5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,440
Sha,

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,399
you haven't told me

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,679
why you've turned
into Longqiu Chengtian.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,280
It's a long story.

9
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,399
I will tell you

10
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,640
when I have the time.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,520
That's right.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,960
I saw someone
selling osmanthus cake over there.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,119
Let me buy some for you.

14
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,760
Are you still going to follow her
like a dog after being abandoned?

15
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,590
I'm not in the mood
to talk nonsense with you.

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Get lost.

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,159
No one can stop me in my path.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Moreover,

19
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,760
you are just a lowly magical beast.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,150
Stop your wishful thinking.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,359
I will never let you harm Chengyan.

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,879
You knew she was Chengyan, right?

23
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,400
What a pity.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
She wouldn't recognise you

25
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,799
and is still acting lovey-dovey
with someone else.

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,320
I've kept you waiting.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,520
Longqiu Chengyan,

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,039
I will kill you next time.

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,360
What's wrong?

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,719
Does Muling not have it?

31
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,599
Yunsha Fan?

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,159
Divine Maiden,
why are you asking about this?

33
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,919
Yunsha Fan is an artifact
of the Fengshan Sect

34
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,439
but I haven't seen it since I came back.

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,380
I think it has probably
been hidden somewhere.

36
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,680
I heard that Yunsha Fan vanished

37
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,639
after you sealed the magical beast

38
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,719
a thousand years ago.

39
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,520
It is still missing until now.

40
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,520
What else?

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,719
There's more.

42
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,319
She had a chat
with a few elders of the Fengshan Sect.

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,560
A chat?

44
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,720
What did they talk about?

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,719
Yunsha Fan.

46
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,439
Also,

47
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,759
Muling has been captured and imprisoned.

48
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,800
Do you like it?

49
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:26,879
Sha,

50
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,319
what is the meaning of this?

51
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,519
Lu Ming,

52
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,560
let's get married.

53
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,160
What's wrong?

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Let's get married.

55
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,079
Who am I marrying?

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,660
Is it with the Supreme Lord of
Cultivation Realm, Longqiu Chengtian,

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,560
or my lover,

58
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,600
the ancient magical beast, Sha?

59
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,639
Must you become Longqiu Chengtian?

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,920
What's so bad
about being Longqiu Chengtian?

61
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,920
In the past,

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
when I was a magical beast,

63
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,439
the world showed disdain
and hunted me down.

64
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,820
Right now, I am the Supreme Lord
of the Cultivation Realm.

65
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,750
I'm being treated with respect
by tens of thousands of people.

66
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm a better match

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,160
with you.

68
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,399
He is not you after all.

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,439
I don't want to be together
with the Supreme Lord.

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,319
I just want to be with Sha

71
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,079
no matter where we are.

72
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,950
You said the same thing to me
in the past.

73
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I trusted you.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,160
Then, you sealed me
for a thousand years.

75
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,920
Lu Ming,

76
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,879
I won't allow anything else

77
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
to stop us from being together.

78
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,360
My Lord.

79
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,240
My Lord.

80
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,839
She is Chengyan.
She is not Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,480
Trust me.

82
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
You've been lied to.

83
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Fool!

84
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,519
I've warned you

85
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,759
not to cause her trouble.

86
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sure you have a death wish.

87
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,439
My Lord,

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,439
I'm doing all this for your sake.

89
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,399
You can't treat me like this.

90
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,920
I wanted

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,279
to spare you at first,

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,759
but you've spoiled my plans
again and again.

93
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,279
Tomorrow,

94
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,319
I will marry Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

95
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,600
You should kill yourself

96
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,600
if you know what's best for you.

97
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,399
No! This is impossible!

98
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,879
You cannot marry her!

99
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,360
You promised to let me
become your cultivation partner,

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,040
but you are asking me
to commit suicide because of her.

101
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
No. I'm going to kill her.

102
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,240
If I kill her, you'll be mine!

103
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
Dream on.

104
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,319
No one in this world

105
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,279
can replace her.

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,519
Not just you

107
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,170
but even Longqiu Chengyan was a tool
I wanted to use to revive her.

108
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,680
Do you think

109
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,399
you can turn into a human after stealing
Longqiu Chengtian's immortal status?

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,120
Bah!

111
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,160
You're even thinking about reviving
the Human Realm's divine maiden

112
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,800
to fulfill
your disgusting and selfish wish.

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,639
Remember.

114
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,800
You are just a lowly magical beast.

115
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,879
You should be sealed
in the Demon God Valley forever

116
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,079
and never to rise again.

117
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,040
What did you say?

118
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,040
Even if you kill me,

119
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,159
Chengyan will still not
turn into Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

120
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,679
She is pretending to be Lu Ming
to avenge Chengtian.

121
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,840
You will also be poisoned and exposed.

122
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,440
She's out of your league.

123
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,780
(Longqiu Hall)

124
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,879
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
Bow to each other!

126
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,840
Lu Ming.

127
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,080
I have a surprise for you.

128
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
Why did you bring him here?

129
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,720
You still don't trust me.

130
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,759
So,

131
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,759
are you Longqiu Chengyan

132
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,399
or Lu Ming?

133
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,360
Tell me.

134
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
Are you Longqiu Chengyan or Lu Ming?

135
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
