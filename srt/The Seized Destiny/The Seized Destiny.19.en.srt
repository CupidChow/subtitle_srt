=The Seized Destiny=

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,740
(Adapted from
a Tencent Animation and Comics work)

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,220
(of the same title by Huaxiang Mogu.)

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,420
=Episode 19=

5
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,479
Do you mean

6
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,320
this Yunsha Fan was kept
in the Cangji Pavilion all this time?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,799
That's right.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,799
After the death
of Divine Maiden Lu Ming,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,159
the Fengshan Sect's former head
felt extremely guilty.

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,759
She then handed the Yunsha Fan
to the Cangji Pavilion.

11
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,900
The heads of the Cangji Pavilion
would be guarding it

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,240
until another female cultivator
with the Pure Yin Physique appeared.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,439
Though I knew

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
this day would come,

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,520
sealing the ancient magical beast
is a dangerous task.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,799
So it's up to you
whether or not you want to do it.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,760
Of course I will.

18
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,480
Sha has gone berserk.

19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,159
If we don't seal him,

20
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,640
the entire Cultivator Realm

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,519
and even the Human Realm will suffer.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,380
This time,
don't you leave me behind again.

23
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,840
I can give you a hand.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,879
We will seal him together.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,760
So,

26
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,519
how confident are you?

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,519
I've refined the three artifacts.

28
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,719
Plus the Yunsha Fan,

29
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,120
at first, I'd say

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,799
I was fairly confident.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,599
However,

32
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,040
Sha has now gone berserk.

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,710
And he's been absorbing
fellow cultivators' spiritual energy.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm no longer sure about it.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,990
You can have my spiritual energy, then.

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,900
Chengyan is an artifact cultivator.

37
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,840
What she needs are artifacts.

38
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,319
Be more confident.

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,200
I couldn't fight him alone.

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
But I have you two.

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,500
So we now stand a bigger chance.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,199
Don't worry.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,599
Miss Chengyan,

44
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,840
we're here to help you.

45
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,159
Sect Leader Ye,

46
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,800
Miss Chengyan.

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,039
The Cultivator Realm
is facing such a disaster.

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,759
As veteran cultivators,
we can't just sit by and do nothing.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,039
This is the magic gourd
I have treasured for years.

50
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,400
You may refine it.

51
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,000
Girl, this is Green Dragon Jade Flute
of Fengshan.

52
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,319
You may have it.

53
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,000
Chengyan.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been using this sword
since I joined the sect.

55
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,759
I hope you can refine it

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,199
and avenge Sect Leader Yun.

57
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,199
Take mine too!

58
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,159
- Here's mine!
- Here's mine!

59
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,680
- Mine too!
- Mine too!

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,719
Rest assured, everyone.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,400
And mine!

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,719
I will give it my all
and seal that evil magical beast.

63
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't let you all down!

64
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:41,580
(Longqiu Hall)

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,680
To seal Sha completely,

66
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,500
we need to force his original form
out of the body.

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,890
We will then lure him
to the Demon God Valley

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,479
and seal him using the Yunsha Fan.

69
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,360
I have an idea.

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Sha.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,399
Sha.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,720
Sha.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,959
Sha.

74
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,079
Lu Ming.

75
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,360
Lu Ming.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,279
They said

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,079
you didn't mean to seal me.

78
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,199
Tell me.

79
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,160
Is that the truth?

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
Please.

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,079
Say something!

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,160
Tell me the truth.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,519
Sha.

84
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,399
Sha.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,399
Sha.

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,879
Sha.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,319
Lu Ming.

88
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,560
I know it's you, Lu Ming.

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,780
You're here to visit me, right?

90
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,560
Lu Ming.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,800
Lu Ming?

92
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,279
Chen!

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,279
You're seeking death!

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,439
Your Lu Ming is here.

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,959
Give the mirror back.

96
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:03,879
Let's go.

97
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
Return my mirror to me!

98
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,360
Get out of Chengtian's body
and you can have it back.

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,399
You're seeking death!

100
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,590
If you refuse to stay still...

101
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,959
I'll throw it off here.

102
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,439
Looks like

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,399
you didn't heed my advice.

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,839
You have no idea who you really are!

105
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,199
Lu Ming.

106
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,800
Lu Ming.

107
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,560
Lu Ming.

108
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,240
Lu Ming. Is that you, Lu Ming?

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,319
Lu Ming.

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,319
Sha.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,600
No...

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,399
Lu Ming. Lu Ming!

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,079
Lu Ming.

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,360
Lu Ming!

116
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,680
Lu Ming...

117
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Sha.

118
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,399
Lu Ming is gone.

119
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,480
Just let it go.

120
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,720
Let it go?

121
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,279
All my life,

122
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
my only wish

123
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,440
was to spend my life with Lu Ming.

124
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,039
But you

125
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,759
forced her to seal me

126
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
and take her own life.

127
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,440
Well,

128
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,360
this is the only keepsake she left me.

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,039
And you even ruined it.

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,320
You so-called righteous cultivators

131
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,840
took away all my hope!

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,879
If it were you,

133
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,200
would you let go?
