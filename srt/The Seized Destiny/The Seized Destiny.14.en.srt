(Adapted from
a Tencent Animation and Comics work)

=Episode 14=

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,000
It has been a while,

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,359
Sha.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,519
What did you call me?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,320
Don't you remember me,

9
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:35,920
Sha?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,039
I am Lu Ming.

11
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,560
I didn't expect the Fengshan Sect

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,759
to produce such a despicable person.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,200
How dare you attack me.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,960
Longqiu Chengyan.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,079
Stop pretending.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,119
The Divine Maiden has been dead
for a thousand years.

17
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,560
How can she be revived suddenly?

18
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,200
You're so evil

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
and foolish!

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,840
Do you not even recognize
your own sect's Fengshan Whip?

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,910
There's nothing special about
knowing how to use the Fengshan Whip.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,840
You are willing to do anything possible

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,159
to achieve your goal.

24
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,220
I won't believe
that you are Fengshan Lu Ming.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,860
Enough.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,879
My Lord, don't be fooled by her.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,200
Come with me.

28
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,760
She is not Longqiu Chengyan.

29
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,040
I don't care who she is.

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
I must take her away today.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,680
Let's leave this place.

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,280
You are not Sha.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,439
Your aura is different.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,990
The Void is
an ocean of spiritual conscience.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,680
The spiritual conscience of the dead
will ascend to the Void.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,840
Is there a way to go to the Void?

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,240
There isn't.

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,159
Apparently,

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,120
if there's a suitable body in the world,

40
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,370
the spiritual conscience
of a dead person can be summoned

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,919
with a strong enough power.

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,930
However, this move
goes against the law of heaven

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,479
so there might be retaliation.

44
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,240
I wanted to use
Chengyan's Pure Yin Physique

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
during her ascension ritual

46
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,960
to summon your spiritual conscience
and revive you,

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
but I didn't expect you

48
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,080
to return to the Human Realm

49
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,400
because of her death.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Lu Ming.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Perhaps this is Heaven's will.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Come out.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
Why are you here?

54
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,039
My Lord,

55
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,120
please believe me.

56
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,080
The one inside

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,080
will never be the Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,280
How do you explain
the Fengshan Whip then?

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,639
I've practiced with Chengyan
since we were young.

60
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,680
It is possible for her to learn the moves
of the Fengshan Sect in secret.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,450
However, she was also inflicted
with your deadly Purple Reishi Poison.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,360
I advise you

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,240
not to plot anything sinister.

64
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,360
Stay away from this place.

65
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:53,920
Chengyan.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,160
It's me.

67
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,120
It's you?

68
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,480
Why haven't you left yet?

69
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,839
I didn't expect you to hurt me.

70
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,839
Stay away.

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm not Chengyan

72
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,000
whom you speak of.

73
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,720
I am Fengshan Lu Ming.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,839
Who are you?

75
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,560
Why do you look exactly like Sha?

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,220
We are not the only ones

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,000
who resemble each other in this world.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Does the Chengyan you mentioned

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
look the same as me?

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,199
Longqiu Chengyan was my wife.

81
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,800
She was foolish

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,199
and stubborn.

83
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,319
Not only did she look like you,

84
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,800
but she also wanted to become
a solo female cultivator like you

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,270
and save the people of the world.

86
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,439
So,

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120
if something happened,

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
she would abandon me

89
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
and rushed in front alone.

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,110
I wanted to tell her that I loved her.

91
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,990
The rules of the Human Realm

92
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,279
is to be together forever

93
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,839
without separation.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,360
It seems like

95
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,560
you are not Chengyan indeed.

96
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,500
Divine Maiden Lu Ming,
if you see Chengyan,

97
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
please help me tell her

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,160
that I will find her

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
no matter where she is.

100
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,199
My Lord.

101
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,759
I have a way to prove

102
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
that she is pretending
to be Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,639
She is Longqiu Chengyan.

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,480
Do you have a bad memory?

105
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,160
My Lord,

106
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,079
I can guarantee with my life

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,279
that I can find the truth this time.
