and Comics work)

=Episode 9=

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,800
I'll make my way
to the Yunjian Manor tomorrow.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,199
Once I've got the Glazed Bead

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,440
and restored the inner core,

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,000
I will head back to the Longqiu

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,679
and avenge Chengtian.

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,759
Okay.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,159
Black cat.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,640
You've been so kind to me.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,920
So I want to fulfill a wish of yours.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,479
Tell me.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,640
What do you wish for?

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,479
Like I said,

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,439
I want to be with you...

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,479
Forever,

19
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,359
right?

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,759
No way.

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,600
That's too big of a wish.

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,679
It's way too big.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
I think

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,480
I should send you
back to the Demon Realm first.

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,000
That way, you can stay out of it all.

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,359
As expected
of our righteous Miss Cultivator.

27
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,799
Though you're drunk,

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,319
you're still making an empty promise.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,280
Chen!

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,439
How dare you

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,040
talk bad about me?

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,719
That hurts!

33
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,200
The madam from the greenhouse said

34
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,420
cats don't like it
when their ears are being pinched.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I wouldn't dare to talk bad about you.

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,319
Bully me as you please
and I won't complain.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,400
Give me a smile, then.

38
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,239
That's the way it should be.

39
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,680
Chengyan.

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,599
When it's all over, let's go back
to the Demon Realm together.

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,319
Sure.

42
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,400
I'll go wherever you go.

43
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,200
How decisive you are.

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,280
You don't believe me?

45
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,719
I'm a woman of my word.

46
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes,

47
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,120
you always keep your word.

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,240
Not when you lied to me twice though.

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,199
I believe you.

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,960
My Lord.

51
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,360
Chengyan will show up

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,919
at the Yunjian Manor.

53
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,560
Come up with a way to catch her.

54
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,759
Don't end up like that inept Ye Qixiu.

55
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,039
Once the deed is done,

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,380
I will give you a reward
in the presence of all the sects.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,210
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,360
It's the Yunjian Manor's duty
to get rid of evildoers.

59
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,740
I've had everything ready,

60
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,599
and I will definitely bring those demoness
and magical beast to you.

61
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,680
(No waste to prove kindness,
no hardship to preach thrift.)

62
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,800
Don't worry, My Lord.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,520
Yun Qingping
has always been a loyal subject.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,639
I'm sure he will get that demoness.

65
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not worried

66
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,599
about him not catching Chengyan.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,800
What's your concern, then?

68
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,199
Head to the Yunjian Manor

69
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,319
and give Yun Qingping a hand.

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,400
Yes, My Lord.

71
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,560
Wait.

72
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,199
Don't hurt her.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,279
(Longqiu Chengyan)

74
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,759
(This time,)

75
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,959
(I will make sure
you die an ugly death.)

76
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,040
Longqiu Chengyan.

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,639
Be patient.

78
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,839
I've got you a big present here.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,439
Cloud-Piercing Swords
in Their Thousands.

80
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,230
Get the array ready!

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
This array
is my sect's secret technique.

82
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,920
How fortunate of you

83
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,759
to be experiencing it.

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,839
Longqiu Chengyan.

85
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,800
I guess you're not as quick-witted

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,199
as claimed.

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Truth be told,

88
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,319
the Glazed Bead isn't here.

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,480
I set this trap

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,439
just to catch you.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,519
And I didn't expect you
to show up here.

92
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,199
Chengyan.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm not a stone-hearted man.

94
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,120
If you're willing
to let me have your Pure Yin Physique,

95
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,399
I can put in a good word for me
in front of His Lordship.

96
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,639
What are you laughing about?

97
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,639
Don't push your luck.

98
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
How have you been,

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,680
Sect Leader Yun?

100
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,759
Sect Leader Yun.

101
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,319
Calm down.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,460
In fact, we've known from the get-go

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,319
that you'd hide the Glazed Bead
somewhere else

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,390
like Sect Leader Ye
of the Cangji Pavilion did.

105
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,560
However,

106
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,519
to be honest,

107
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,360
You've been as predictable as ever.

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,390
We were expecting
some surprising move from you.

109
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,759
What do you mean?

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,170
Could it be that Chengyan
has found the Glazed Bead?

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,519
Looks like you're not silly after all.

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,399
Fellow disciples,
tie this magical beast up!

113
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,639
I dare you!

114
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,399
Introducing this exclusive invention
of Chengyan's called Playful Powder.

115
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,990
It's both colorless and odorless,
but it's a strange one.

116
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,199
You are fine

117
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,920
if you stay still.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,120
Otherwise,

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
you keep moving about

120
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,680
until you die from exhaustion.

121
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,360
Heed my advice and stay still,
Sect Leader Yun.

122
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,319
Tie him up at once.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,279
Chengtian?

124
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,120
Yan.

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,600
Is that you, Chengtian?

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
I gave you this for your birthday.

127
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
It's white.

128
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,679
Chengtian,

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,039
it's really you.

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,470
You've wished for my return, no?

131
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,200
You've had it hard

132
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,159
all this while.

133
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,120
I...

134
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,720
Chen.

135
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,000
Chen?

136
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,639
You're the magical beast that killed me!

137
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,679
You've got it wrong, Chengtian!

138
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,960
Chen didn't kill you.

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,159
Stay right here, Yan.

140
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm going to kill him!

141
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,799
You can't, Chengtian!

142
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,639
He didn't do it.

143
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,850
However, only by killing him
can I come back to life.

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't you want that?

145
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,720
Chengtian!

146
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,559
Don't come near us!

147
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,519
I want my life back, you beast!

148
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
Chengtian,

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,799
I beg of you!

150
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,080
Please don't hurt Chen!

151
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,639
Yan...

152
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,320
Don't hurt him, Chengtian!

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,559
He didn't do it!

154
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
Chengtian!

155
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Chen!

156
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,960
I want my life back!

157
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,759
Chengtian!

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,279
No!

159
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,159
I want my life back!

160
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,840
No!

161
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
As expected of the Glaze Mirage.

162
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,840
Luckily, I came prepared.

163
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,200
It seems like the Glazed Bead
is right here.

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,840
His Lordship told me to come
and lend Yun Qingping a hand.

165
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,680
I figured something was off
behind the mountain on my way there.

166
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,110
So I decided to come and take a look.

167
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
Never did I expect

168
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,480
to bump into you here.

169
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,840
Cut the crap.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,159
Give me back the Glazed Bead.

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,080
I hate this tone of yours the most.

172
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,879
As if you were above all else.

173
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,519
You lose.

174
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
You should experience
the Glazed Mirage as well.

175
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,759

♪I want to travel the world with you♪

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,050

The journey's exhaustion goes to waste♪

Waiting until trees and grass wither♪

♪Long hair falls, sorrow and joy mix,
I write with my tears kneeling♪

♪In the blink of an eye,
the lights flicker dim♪

hope to be by your side in my dream♪
