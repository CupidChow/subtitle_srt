00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,879
Lu Ming is gone.

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,039
Just let it go.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,079
You so-called righteous cultivators

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,520
took away all my hope!

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
If it were you,

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,960
would you let go?

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,039
But that's not an excuse for you
to act selfishness and kill the innocent!

12
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,280
Don't you forget
that you're a magical beast like me!

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,079
Do you think

14
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,880
they will be grateful to you

15
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,560
after sealing me?

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,039
No.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,679
They will just despise you
more than ever.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
Longqiu Chengyan and you

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,280
will never ever

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,439
get together!

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
You will end up like me and Lu Ming.

22
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,319
We're different.

23
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,040
If so,

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,560
give it a try, then.

25
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,000
Back then,

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,319
when I was a magical beast,

27
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,959
I couldn't be with my loved one.

28
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,599
I am now

29
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,200
a lord.

30
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,840
However, I still can't find Lu Ming.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,680
Since that's the case...

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,599
What's the use

33
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,520
of having this body?

34
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,759
No one can stop me
from being with Lu Ming.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,439
No one!

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
Longqiu Chengyan.

37
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,479
You think sealing me

38
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,080
will put an end to all this?

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,599
You want to be together forever?

40
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,560
Dream on!

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,319
I'm telling you,

42
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,400
we are not brothers.

43
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,039
We used to be one.

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,120
He's nothing but my obsession

45
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,719
and my clone!

46
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,280
Lu Ming.

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,199
Why did you do this to me?

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
Why?

49
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,120
Why?

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,370
It turned out that the light

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,959
was Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

52
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,879
Chen!

53
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,519
Longqiu Chengyan.

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Listen here.

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,079
This man whom you call Chen

56
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,360
is merely

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,079
my obsession for Lu Ming.

58
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,040
If you insist on sealing me,

59
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,240
he will die too!

60
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,680
Isn't it your wish
to be the second Lu Ming?

61
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,519
Go ahead.

62
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,199
Kill me.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,399
Do it.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
Kill me!

65

Chen...

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,199
I can't.
