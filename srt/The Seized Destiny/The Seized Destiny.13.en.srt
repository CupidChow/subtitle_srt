5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,640
My Lord,

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,079
I don't ask for much.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,559
I just want
to become your cultivating partner.

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,879
You've helped me out

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,560
when I was in danger today.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,210
I will grant you the title
of Sect Leader Fengshan.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,200
Three days later, the ascension ritual
and appointment ceremony will happen.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,719
My Lord,

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,799
my ascension ritual

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,600
must be grander than Chengyan's.

16
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,119
Sure.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,239
After the ritual,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,519
I'll become your cultivating partner

19
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,239
and accompany you forever.

20
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,200
Since someone wants to replace you,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
I will fulfill her wish.

22
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,519
(Fengze Hall)

23
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,200
Fengshan Muling has contributed by
killing the evil lady, Longqiu Chengyan,

24
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:04,121
and is granted the title
of Sect Leader Fengshan.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,439
Fengshan Muling has contributed by
killing the evil lady, Longqiu Chengyan,

26
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,360
and is granted the title
of Sect Leader Fengshan.

27
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,039
Longqiu Chengyan.

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,240
I want

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,759
everything you had.

30
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,639
Lord Li, speak freely.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,479
I dare not.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,439
My Lord,

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,680
I think Lord Li is worried
that you might kill her

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,780
if she says something wrong.

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
Why would I kill you?

36
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,360
Just speak freely.

37
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,479
After that, I still have questions for you.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,520
My Lord, you came back
with a different aura this time.

39
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,159
I wonder

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,479
if something happened to you
in the Human Realm.

41
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,199
I've told you many times.

42
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,520
My aura is different

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,800
because I'm not
the Demon Lord you are searching for.

44
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,620
The Demon Realm hasn't
had a lord for a thousand years.

45
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,680
Your return is a blessing
for all the people at the Demon Realm.

46
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,599
I'm afraid

47
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,840
I'm going to let you down.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,479
My Lord!

49
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,120
Lord Li,

50
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,879
I just want to ask you

51
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,599
how I can leave the Demon Realm.

52
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,840
My Lord,

53
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,120
the people here need you.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,319
I also think

55
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,240
you should protect your people.

56
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,360
But my wife's fate is unknown now.

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,520
I must go back and save her.

58
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,080
I...

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,719
I don't know
how to leave the Demon Realm.

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,000
Please forgive me, My Lord.

No.

You mustn't tell Lord Li about this.

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,680
I came here to help you
leave the Demon Realm.

88
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,920
this was where you left the Demon Realm
a thousand years ago

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
and never returned.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,639
I always saw her
sitting here and waiting for you.

91
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,319
She would sit for one whole day.

93
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,199
are you going to leave again?

My Lord, please think twice.

97
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:03,720
I...

98
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,760
The people of the Demon Realm
have waited for you for so long.

99
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,060
Now that you've finally returned,

100
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
are you going to abandon them again?

101
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,439
Lord Li,

102
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
we have our respective duties.

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,480
Let's not trouble each other anymore.

105
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,040
Lord Li,

106
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,399
just let him go.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,839
Li,

108
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,439
actually,

109
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,240
you are totally capable
of managing the Demon Realm.

110
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,990
You've worked hard for all these years.

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,079
In the future,

112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,790
I'll leave the Demon Realm
in your hands.

113

114
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't feel sad.

115
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,879

Tell me where Chengyan is.

121

Longqiu Chengyan is dead.

122
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
You will never see her again.

123
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,800
You're asking for this.

124
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
Chengyan is dead.

125
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,120
Everyone here saw it

126
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,319
with their own eyes.

Longqiu Chengyan is dead.

129
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,120

130
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,959
to see even her dead body.
