(Adapted from a Tencent Animation
and Comics work)

=Episode 5=

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,399
I'd like to...

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,079
pet you.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,840
Go ahead.

8
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,239
(Black Cat.)

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,000
(Truth be told,)

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,799
(when you caught me)

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
(after jumping off the cliff,)

12
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,480
(I was touched.)

13
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,200
(Though you're a proud,)

14
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,000
(sharp-tongued, disobedient)

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,959
(magical beast,)

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,239
(well,)

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,719
(you're kind-hearted.)

18
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,400
Black Cat.

19
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:03,959
Thank you.

20
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,159
When everyone went back against me,

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,639
you saved my life.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,479
You've even kept me company.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,199
Enough with the formality.

24
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,919
I was just too free.

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,240
You're burning.

26
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,560
Miss Cultivator.

27
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,560
I've fulfilled my promise.

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
If you don't keep your word and die,
my effort will be vain.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,639
Here.

30
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,039
Be good, have some water.

31
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,680
Since you and I

32
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
have had a pact,

33
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,960
naturally, we must

34
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,039
abide by it.

35
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,840
Though I hate to admit it,

36
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,199
the truth is

37
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,519
your appearance

38
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,680
has made me
that feel life is meaningful.

39
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,660
I can tell your cultivation
is still shallow.

40
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,800
This armor

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,480
should be of help.

42
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,439
Thank you, My Lord.

43
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,959
I will definitely get you
demonic Chengyan.

44
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,959
Black Cat.

45
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,759
Black Cat!

46
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,319
I'm here.

47
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,519
Coming.

48
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,319
You're awake.

49
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,519
I went to fetch us some water.

50
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,920
Here you go.

51
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,720
Oh, right, Black Cat,

52
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,040
I think you said something to me

53
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,199
when I was out of consciousness.

54
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,959
But I didn't catch it.

55
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,839
Can you repeat it?

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,959
There are many fruits nearby.

57
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,470
And they taste amazing.

58
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
I'll go get you some.

59
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:43,720
Oh, right.

60
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,160
Stay right here.

61
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,230
There are many vicious beasts
in the Demon God Valley.

62
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,920
They're powerful.

63
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:48,879
They could

64
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,810
eat you alive.

65
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,839
I'm off.

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,639
(Black Cat.)

67
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,879
(At least I still have you.)

68
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,600
Show yourself.

69
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,920
Chengyan.

70
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
As expected, you're still alive.

71
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,480
How fortunate of you.

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,590
You're no less fortunate.

73
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,120
You managed to find me here.

74
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,990
Why didn't Chengtian come
and catch me himself?

75
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:39,920
Well,

76
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,040
His Lordship doesn't have
to do so himself.

77
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,759
How could you be this easily defeated?

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
I haven't had enough fun of it.

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,079
Get up!

80
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,600
Just kill me

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
if you can.

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
In your dream.

83
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,519
His Lordship

84
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,279
has been bewitched by your face.

85
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,399
Today,

86
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm going to ruin it.

87
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,319
You will die
as nothing but an ugly ghost.

88
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,620
How dare an ugly person like you
show up at the Demon God Valley?

89
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,959
You think you're able to save her?

90
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,759
She won't live past tonight.

91
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,439
You should worry about yourself.

92
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,320
You might not even get out
of the Dark Forest alive.

93
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,820
(Longqiu Hall)

94
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,600
My Lord.

95
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,840
As expected,
that demoness is still alive.

96
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,840
And I almost got...

97
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,279
The pill.

98
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,679
I knew it.

99
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,720
She wouldn't be dead.

100
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,080
Sinister.

101
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,759
Cunning.

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,879
Despicable.

103
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,960
Shameless.

104
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,880
They're all evil.

105
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,960
How did you make it until now?

106
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,879
Chengyan.

107
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,759
Since you're a cultivator,

108
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,000
you should know
how to rebuild an inner core.

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,390
As an artifact cultivator,

110
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,600
I do know the way
to rebuild an inner core.

111
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,720
How?

112
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't panic.

113
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,799
Let me finish first.

114
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,879
To rebuild an inner core completely,

115
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,960
we need the artifacts
from the three sects.

116
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,879
But the first one,

117
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,400
which is the Azure Dragon Robe,

118
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,840
was lost three years ago.

119
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,440
My senior brother Chengtian
accidentally lost it

120
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,120
while cultivating outside.

121
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,480
Azure Dragon Robe?

122
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,720
It's the artifact of our sect.

123
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,960
Is this

124
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,000
the Azure Dragon Robe?

125
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,360
Of course not.

126
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,559
The Azure Dragon Robe
is made from dragon cotton.

127
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,279
Dragon cotton is pure white

128
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
and never changes color.

129
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,320
Didn't you know?

130
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,320
If it gets tainted by demonic energy,

131
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
it turns black.

132
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,560
It is the Azure Dragon Robe indeed.

133
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,080
Chengtian, this shawl...

134
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
Chengtian.

135
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,600
Forget about all this.

136
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,879
Could it be real?

137
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,840
The robe is an ancient artifact
passed down through our sect.

138
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Why is it with you?

139
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,399
Tell me.

140
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,240
This Longqiu Chengtian,

141
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,039
who exactly is he?

142
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,399
Tell me already!

143
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,080
This Longqiu Chengtian

144
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,600
is my elder brother.

145
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
He's an ancient magical beast

146
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,519
