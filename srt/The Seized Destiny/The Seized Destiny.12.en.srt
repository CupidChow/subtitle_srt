5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,759
Chengyan,

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,679
it seems like

7
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,119
you are prepared to go back with me.

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,640
Chengtian,

9
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,359
you called everyone here

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
just to capture me.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,631
There's something
that has been confusing me.

12
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,960
Since everyone is here,

13
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,119
I can ask you myself.

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,000
We have been martial siblings for years.

15
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,240
We were as close as real siblings.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,239
Why do you not care
about our relationship this time

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
and insist on killing me?

18
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,799
Longqiu Cheng Yan!

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,000
You colluded
with an ancient magical beast

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,840
and stole
the Luoying Blade and Glazed Bead.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Everything you did was a crime
that humiliated the sect.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,040
Shut up!

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,959
This is no place for you to talk.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,560
Don't tell me

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,799
that you're afraid
that I might expose some dark secrets.

26
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,799
Chengyan,

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,599
you've been badly brainwashed
by the ancient magical beast.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,480
Magical beast?

29
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,200
It seems like
you've been pretending for a long time

30
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,319
and has forgotten your true identity.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Am I right,

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,680
Ancient Magical Beast,

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,760
Sha.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Sha?

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,690
Dragon cotton turns black
after it is exposed to a demonic aura.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,359
I will expose you today.

37
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,280
Longqiu Chengyan,

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,719
what are you trying to do?

39
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,400
This drug can suppress
your demonic trait temporarily

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
and hide your identity.

41
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,400
Chengyan,

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
we are from the same sect.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,990
If you are willing
to come back to Longqiu with me,

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
I will spare your life.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,479
Let me ask you.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,599
Did you

47
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,800
kill Chengtian three years ago?

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,039
Chengyan,

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,439
I am standing right here

50
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,840
yet you keep cursing me.

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,759
I'm sure the magical beast

52
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,879
made you lose your mind.

53
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,479
If Heaven won't punish you,

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,639
I will

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,479
kill you today

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
and avenge Chengtian!

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,680
You are so foolish.

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
He hid his identity for so many years.

59
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,879
How would he let you expose it easily?

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,919
You knew he wasn't Chengtian.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,319
Why are you still helping him?

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,280
You don't need to know.

63
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,599
That's right.

64
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840
I forgot to tell you.

65
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,159
No one can survive
after getting poisoned

66
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,240
by my Purple Reishi Poison.

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Longqiu Chengtian couldn't survive.

68
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,279
You too.

69
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,480
Chengyan.

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,680
Chengyan.

71
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,990
I want to give you
a grand bridal procession,

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,900
and the best bridal chamber.

73
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,560
I want you to become the happiest

74
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,360
and prettiest bride in the world.

75
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,865
(Chen, live well for my sake.)

76
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,120
Chengyan.

77
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,360
Chengyan, no.

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Chengyan!

79
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,000
Why?

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,639
Chengyan.

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,639
Chengyan!

82
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
Chengyan!

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,480
Chengyan!

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,079
Someone,

85
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,160
take Longqiu Chengyan back to Longqiu.

86
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:15,920
Lord Li,

87
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,040
I touched the ancient Demon Lord's hair.

88
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,279
His hair is just as soft as mine.

89
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,920
I thought the Demon Lord
would have spikes on his hair.

90
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,240
Lord Li, what's wrong?

91
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,839
Don't you feel happy after finding him?

92
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,839
I do.

93
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,000
However,

94
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm more worried.

95
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
I don't understand.

96
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,000
A thousand years ago,

97
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,240
our Demon Lord's cultivation level

98
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
has reached an extreme.

99
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,680
We could not sense his aura.

100
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,879
This man

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,279
is a little weird.

102
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,759
He is different from our Demon Lord.

103
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,319
I still don't understand.

104
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,730
Back then, the demon lord

105
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,890
was sending people who accidentally
came to the Demon Realm home.

106
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,680
Later,

107
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,920
he vanished without a trace.

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,199
Perhaps something happened to him
over there.

109
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,920
Chengyan.

110
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,780
Chengyan, are you all right?

111
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,279
Chengyan.

112
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,839
Chengyan!

113
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,960
Chengyan, what's wrong?

114
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,919
Chengyan!

115
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,759
Demon Lord,

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,960
you are finally awake.

117
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,610
What is this place?

118
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Li and Yi welcome you back
to the Demon Realm, My Lord.

119
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,519
The Demon Realm?

120
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,559
