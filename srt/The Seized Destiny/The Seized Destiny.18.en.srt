=Episode 18=

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,320
You're the most gifted one
in the Fengshan Sect.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,800
I cannot let you be ruined
by some magical beast.

7
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,079
Master.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,210
The magical beat from
the Demon God Valley has wreak havoc

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,530
and tried to harm the Human Realm.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,439
Here's my order.

11
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,840
Go and seal it.

12
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,280
Lu Ming.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,679
What took you so long?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,079
Lu Ming!

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,719
It's me!

16
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,200
I'm Sha!

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm giving you this Void Mirror.

18
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,079
Trust me.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,400
I won't let you down

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
forever.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,359
Forever.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,439
Sha!

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Sha...

24
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,120
Lu Ming had always loved you.

26
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,039
Upon taking her own life,

27
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,879
she sealed her consciousness with you.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,039
For the past thousand years,

29
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,319
she's been with you.

30
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,800
Always.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Lu Ming...

32
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,080
Lu Ming...

33
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,400
No.

34
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
No way.

35
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,439
I don't believe you!

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,280
I want to see Lu Ming.

37
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,639
I want her to tell me

38
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,479
all of the truth!

39
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,039
Lu Ming...

40
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,479
Lu Ming!

41
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,599
My Lord!

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,800
Lu Ming...

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,520
My Lord.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,990
What's the matter with you?

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
Just the right timing.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,039
I need you

47
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,800
very much now!

48
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,319
My Lord...

49
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,000
My Lord...

50
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,120
Sha!

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
How could you kill the innocent?

52
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,439
Didn't you always want

53
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,599
to serve me?

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,930
Now is the time for you to do so!

55
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,990
You're not going to hurt them
as long as I'm here!

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
Who do you think you are?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,520
Chen!

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
Do you know

59
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,800
who you really are?

60
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,159
Cut the crap.

61
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't have a brother like you.

62
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,839
Brother?

63
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,000
You might want to try to recall

64
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,720
who you truly are.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,959
Leave now, Chengyan.

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,199
Let's go.

67
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,000
Who exactly am I?

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,660
I don't remember anything
about my days living in the Demon Realm.

69
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,160
I don't know

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,279
why I'd show up there either.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm not the ancient magical beast, Sha.

72
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,040
And I might not be his brother.

73
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,199
Who exactly am I?

74
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,199
What's wrong?

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
What did Sha say to you?

76
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,839
Chengyan.

77
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,800
You do know

78
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,759
that I started to remember things
three years ago.

79
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,480
On the day I came around,
Sha told me

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,680
that we're brothers.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,519
Apart from that,

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,519
I know nothing about my own background.

83
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,680
I've always thought

84
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,639
that I don't remember things

85
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,990
because I was
out of consciousness for too long.

86
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,360
However, upon returning
to the Demon Realm,

87
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,340
I found out that I didn't remember

88
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,759
anything there.

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm worried.

90
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,879
It's not that I remember nothing.

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
In fact, I have no memories
to begin with.

92
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,959
You are Chen.

93
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
You are my Chen.

94
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,879
I don't care whether or not
you remember the past.

95
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,959
Since our encounter
in the Demon God Valley,

96
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,439
I've wanted you to remember

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
everything about me

98
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,120
and all of our experiences.

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,590
You can't forget anything about them.

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,630
Here comes another one who seeks death.

101
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,560
Do you think

102
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,240
a mere Immortal Binding Rope

103
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,279
is enough to restrain me?

104
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,399
Stop struggling.

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,399
It took me a hundred year worth
of spiritual energy to make it.

106
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,720
There's no way you're escaping it.

107
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
You're overestimating yourself.

108
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,120
Let's go!

109
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,080
Chengyan.

110
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Now that

111
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,279
Sha has gone berserk,

112
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,000
how should we deal with him?

113
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,279
My senior brother said
that if we want to seal a magical beast,

114
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,799
we need to locate the Fengshan artifact,
Yunsha Fan.

115
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,720
I searched all of Fengshan,

116
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,960
but the fan was nowhere to be found.

117
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,240
Perhaps this Yunsha Fan

118
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,000
isn't in Fengshan?

119
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,639
If not Fengshan,

120
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,440
where else could it be?

121
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,360
It's with me.
