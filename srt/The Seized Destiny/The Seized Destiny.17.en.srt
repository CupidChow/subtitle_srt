(Adapted from
a Tencent Animation and Comics work)

=Episode 17=

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,239
So,

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,239
are you Longqiu Chengyan

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,800
or Lu Ming?

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,000
Tell me.

9
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,960
Are you Longqiu Chengyan or Lu Ming?

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,320
Are you going to say it or not?

11
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,280
You are indeed not Lu Ming.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,079
Then, how do you know about Lu Ming?

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
Let him go

14
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,120
and I'll tell you.

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,680
You've finally recognised me.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,519
Don't worry.

17
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,599
I won't die so easily.

18
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,640
Don't speak.

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,280
Where is Lu Ming?

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,400
Divine Lady Lu Ming has vanished.

21
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,040
She will never come back.

22
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,040
You're lying to me again!

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,879
I'm not lying to you.

24
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,719
She might not come back anymore,

25
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
but her memory has been kept intact.

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,639
Yan.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,759
Chengtian.

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
It's really you.

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,520
Chengtian,

30
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,439
I thought I would never see you again.

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,280
Chengtian.

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
What is this place?

33
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,759
This is the Void.

34
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,360
The Void?

35
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,759
The place where the dead
leave their spiritual conscience?

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,159
Yes.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,520
However, you shouldn't be here now.

38
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,439
Return to the Human Realm.

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,000
This is the memory
of Divine Lady Lu Ming.

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,599
Bring it back with you as well.

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,159
So,

42
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,840
Divine Maiden Lu Ming's
spiritual conscience isn't in the Void.

43
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,240
You should accept the truth.

44
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,840
She will never come back.

45
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,080
Nonsense!

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I...

47
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,879
Who is it?

48
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,360
Why are you following me?

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
I'm walking on my own path.

50
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,720
How is that following you?

51
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,439
That's right.

52
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,990
I picked up something
that belongs to you.

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,839
Here you go.

54
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,839
Thank you.

55
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,560
How is it?

56
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,120
Is it delicious?

57
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,399
It is.

58
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Let me taste it as well.

59
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,850
Don't you have one?

60
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,120
Yours is big and red.

61
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,720
I want to taste yours.

62
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,090
Is it delicious?

63
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,279
It is.

64
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,380
Do the people of the Human Realm
think I'm not a match for you

65
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,480
because I'm a magical beast?

66
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,560
No.

67
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
Give me some time.

68
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,480
I can solve it.

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,480
Go back first.

70
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,380
It'll be troublesome
if they find you here.

71
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,839
I'm giving you this Void Mirror.

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,040
Trust me.

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,079
I won't let you down forever.

74
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,439
Forever.

75
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Lu Ming.

76
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,319
Why are you so late?

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,990
Shameless magical beast.
You've done a lot of evil deeds.

78
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,879
I will seal you here today.

79
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,720
If she hadn't betrayed me back then,

80
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
perhaps

81
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,279
we would still have
many wonderful memories.

82
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,519
What you saw
was only what you experienced.

83
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,480
Do you know

84
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,399
why Lu Ming suddenly changed her mind

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,990
when both of you promised each other
to wander the world together?

86
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,160
Master.

87
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,279
Are you going to give up your talent

88
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,720
and your identity as a cultivator

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,519
just to be with the magical beast?

90
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
I didn't expect you to be so stubborn.

91
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,079
Master, please grant my wish.

92
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:52,879
You should

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,790
forget about my existence
as your disciple.

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,279
Whatever.

95
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,759
It's my fault.

96
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,399
I didn't educate you well.

97
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,279
Stand up.

98
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Master.

99
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,720
Master!

100
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,319
You are the most gifted person
in the Fengshan Sect.

101
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,600
I can't see the magical beast
ruin you and do nothing.

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Master.

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,679
The magical beast
at Demon God Valley is causing trouble

104
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,890
and harming the Human Realm.

105
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,960
Go and seal it.

106
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,320
Yes.
