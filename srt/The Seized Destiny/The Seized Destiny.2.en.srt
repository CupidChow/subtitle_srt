a Tencent Animation and Comics work)

=Episode 2=

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Why are you here?

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,960
What did you say?

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,079
I asked you

8
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,920
why you are here!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,039
Why can't I be here?

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,479
- You...
- Chengyan.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,399
Are you all right?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
I'm fine!

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,760
I need to sleep now.

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,580
(Stay humble)

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,560
Don't worry.

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,319
She left.

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,879
I can hear it clearly.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
How did you find this place?

19
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,319
Because we formed a bond.

20
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,650
Once you form a bond
with a magical beast,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,040
I can clearly
feel your location and condition.

22
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,159
When did I form a bond with you?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,580
When you gave me your spiritual energy.

24
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,190
What's that expression you're showing?

25
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,159
Do I disgust you?

26
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,520
I can protect you
after forming a bond with you.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
I don't need your protection.

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,530
My ascension ritual will happen soon.

29
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,759
If someone finds out

30
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,159
that I formed a bond
with a small beast of the Demon Realm,

31
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,000
it'll be all over for me!

32
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,247
Be careful.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,980
Your wounds from falling down the cliff
haven't healed.

34
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,890
You need to recuperate.

35
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,240
Also,

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm not a small beast.

37
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,680
I am the Ancient Demon Lord.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
How can I
undo the bond with you, Little Beast...

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,919
Demon Lord.

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,159
This is easy.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
If I'm in a good mood,

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
we can undo it anytime.

43
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,439
But if I'm in a bad mood...

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,960
Miss Cultivator!

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,120
What are you doing?

46
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,800
I might be a black cat

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
but I'm still a man.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,439
Enough of the nonsense.

49
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,820
Undo the bond with me immediately!

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,960
You can't force it.

51
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,000
I told you.

52
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,479
I must be in a good mood.

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,520
How can you be in a good mood?

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,039
That's easy.

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,850
Give me your inner core.

56
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,919
(How do I get rid of this stupid cat?)

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,400
(Cats like beads.)

58
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,599
(Got it.)

59
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,120
This clingy cat.

60
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,890
How dare he cast his eyes
on my inner core.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,199
Dream on.

62
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,340
(Longqiu Hall)

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Black Cat.

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,480
What are you doing?

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,839
You scared me.

66
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,100
You look so gentle,
but you're so rough.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,879
Don't change the topic.

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,399
What are you doing sneaking around

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,480
so late at night?

70
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,610
Weren't you the one who chased me out?

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,920
I was just taking a stroll.

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Taking a stroll?

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
This is Chengtian's chamber.

74
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,759
It's bad if he discovers you.

75
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,920
Don't cause trouble for me

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,000
before my ascension ritual.

77
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,920
Otherwise...

78
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,170
What are you trying to do?

79
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,959
I won't accept this.

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,839
You are overthinking.

81
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,839
Longqiu Chengyan.

82
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:18,839
Not so loud.

83
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,120
What did you scatter on me?

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,519
Garlic powder.

85
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,600
My fellow cultivator in the kitchen

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
cats are afraid of garlic powder.

87
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,839
Garlic powder?

88
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,410
Are you trying to cook or what?

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,639
I also have

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,959
mint powder,

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,839
and oleander powder.

92
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,980
They are good against you as well.

93
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,480
That's so childish.

94
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,610
It seems like oleander powder is useful.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,839
Stay here.

96
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,600
(Void and Serenity)

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,160
Yan?

98
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,720
Chengtian.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,290
You're not sleeping at this time.

100
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,240
Why are you here?

101
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,959
Yes.

102
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,920
Why am I here?

103
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,680
It's very late.

104
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
You are still awake as well.

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm going to sleep soon.

106
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,759
It's humid at night.

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,519
Rest well, Chengtian.

108
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,959
I'm going back to sleep.

109
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,980
(Dazzle the Heaven)

110
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,600
Chengtian. This is
a birthday present for you.

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,519
Yan,

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
your artifact cultivation power

113
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,660
has increased again, right?

114
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,319
This is made with premium dragon cotton.

115
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,279
Chengtian,

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
this scarf...

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,959
Chengtian!

118
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,120
Yan,

119
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
promise me

120
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,439
to forget everything.

121
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,600
(Thankfully,)

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,200
(it was just a dream.)

123
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,759
(Why do I keep having this dream)

124
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,280
(after Chengtian
became the Supreme Lord?)

125
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,120
I took you in kindly

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,080
and this is how you repay me?

127
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,720
This is more comfortable.

128
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,799
This is my favourite blanket!

129
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
It's just a blanket.

130
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,039
Wait.

131
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,639
Why are you so petty?

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,159
Isn't it just a blanket?

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
Enough! I admit my fault.

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,279
Chengyan.

135
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,519
Today is your ascension ritual.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,250
His Lordship will be here soon.

137
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,759
Hide now!

138
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,159
Why should I?

139
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,440
Yan.

140
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,960
Chengtian.

141
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,420
I came here to deliver
the gown for your ascension ritual.

142
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,919
I purposely picked this for you.

143
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,080
I think you'll like it.

144
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,200
It's so beautiful.

145
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,930
You are still the one
who treats me best.

146
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,580
I'm glad that you like it.

147
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,639
Chengtian.

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,759
Thank you

149
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,519
for purposely
preparing this gown for me.

150
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,399
You are

151
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,540
