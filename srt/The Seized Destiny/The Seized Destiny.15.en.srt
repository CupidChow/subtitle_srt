00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,520
My Lord,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,920
I'll now show you whether it is
Divine Maiden Lu Ming or Longqiu Chengyan

7
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,200
who is inside this room.

8
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,480
This is impossible.

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,120
Lu Ming.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,680
This man has been
troubling me again and again.

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,600
I wonder what he is plotting.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,980
How can I plot anything?

13
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm just worried about you.

14
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,632
I've told you

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,760
that I'm not Chengyan

16
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,200
and you are not Sha.

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,799
You better not appear before me again.

18
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,560
The Divine Maiden Lu Ming

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,040
only cares about Sha,
the ancient magical beast.

20
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:32,900
Don't tell me

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,120
that you regret sealing him back then.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Spare me, My Lord!

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,959
I did not intend to hurt you.

You are Sha.

00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,879
Put Fengshan Muling in prison!

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,120
My Lord!

32

My Lord!

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,719
Sorry.

36
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,580
I'm not good at dressing your injury.

37
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,199
You may scream if it hurts.

38
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,690
It's all right.

39
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,120
Oh.

40
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,990
What is the name
of this throwing weapon?

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,840
Autumn Leaf Dart.

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,120
Autumn Leaf Dart?

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,159
Is it called Autumn Leaf Dart

44
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,000
because of the leaves here?

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,759
Has anyone told you
that you annoy people easily?

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,719
Yes.

47
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,520
Many.

48
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,990
Return me my Autumn Leaf Dart.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,319
Why are you so interested
in my throwing weapon?

50
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,879
You are half right.

51
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,959
I am very interested indeed

52
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,800
but not in the throwing weapon.

53
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,600
I've always carried

54
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,560
your Void Mirror

55
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,959
for all these years.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,940
(Longqiu Hall)

57
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,900
Divine Maiden Lu Ming has descended
to the Human Realm to cultivate.

58
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,490
She will be Fengshan Sect's Sect Leader.

59
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,380
Pass the message down!

60
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,050
Divine Maiden Lu Ming has descended
to the Human Realm to cultivate!

61
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,120
She will be Fengshan Sect's Sect Leader!

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,759
No.

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
She is not Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

64
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,319
She is Longqiu Chengyan.

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,519
Let me out!

66
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,800
All of you have been fooled!

67
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,879
Let me out!

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
Let me out!

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,319
Let me out!

70
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,759
Quick!

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,920
Quick, let me out!

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,399
Quick!

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Evil Woman, what are you trying to do?

74
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,639
Do you know why your lust incense

75
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,680
didn't work on me?

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,380
Because I'm a descendant
of the Artifact Cultivator Sect.

77
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,560
It's not difficult to create

78
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,839
a small defensive barrier.

79
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,240
I knew it.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,360
You are pretending as Lu Ming.

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,519
This is a conspiracy!
I'm going to expose you!

82
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,839
I will tell His Lordship!

83
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,199
You are the evil woman!

84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Fengshan Muling.

85
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,390
I'm just going to ask you this.

86
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,879
Did you

87
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,199
poison Chengtian three years ago?

88
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,000
I did it, so what?

89
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,279
Longqiu Chengtian was a dull person
who only focused on cultivation.

90
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,399
Only by killing him

91
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,160
and replacing him can I become
the Supreme Lord's cultivation partner!

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,680
You poisoned Chengtian for this reason?

93
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
How shameful and despicable of you!

94
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,150
Becoming the new Supreme Lord's
cultivation partner

95
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,120
and ended up like this.

96
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,439
Are you satisfied now?

97
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,279
The magical beast is unreliable.

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
But let me tell you.

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,279
Don't be too arrogant.

100
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,390
As long as you are exposed,
I'll still have a chance.

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,279
I will surely win!

102
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,199
Mark my words!

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
I want you
to apologize to Chengtian in person!

104
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,600
Longqiu Chengyan, stop!

105
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,519
Stop right there!

106
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,399
(Where is it hidden?)

107
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,240
Lu Ming.

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,480
Why are you here?

109
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,199
I want to meet you.

110
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,680
Let me take you to a place.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,930
Is this the Temple Festival
of the Human Realm?

112
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,759
Yes.

113
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,519
I promised to bring you

114
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,660
to a small town in the Human Realm
to take a look at their Temple Festival.

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
It is more lively than Fengshan Hall.

116
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,040
Do you like it?

117
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,399
Let me give it to you.

118
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,120
No need.

119
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,199
I can buy the things I like myself.

120
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,200
Do you like it?

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,510
Let me give it to you.

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,919
Let's keep walking.

123
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,410
This is the Matchmaker's Temple.

124
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,799
A place where you request marriage
in the Human Realm.

125
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,860
This is the Matchmaker's Temple.

126
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,700
It's very effective.

127
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,159
I said I'd be with you forever

128
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
and I won't let you down.

129
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,320
You are
the most reliable person in this world.

130
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,679
Of course, I trust you.

131
