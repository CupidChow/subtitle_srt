5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,680
Stop right there!

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,679
What are you two doing here?

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,439
Well...

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,079
What a round moon we have tonight.

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,160
So we decided to come and check it out.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,479
You're here to check out the moon?

11
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,320
Leave now.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,640
Yes.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,600
We're heading back.

14
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,000
Hold on.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,439
Is there anything else, Senior Brother?

16
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,880
I never saw you here before.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,040
We're new here.

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,480
From now on,

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,319
please look after us.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,200
That's a must.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm in charge

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,959
of these two areas.

23
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,400
You'll be

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,799
under my care.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,799
Thank you, Senior Brother.

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,239
Fine, head back now.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,879
Look at how big-sized she is.

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,359
How could you be laughing?

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm telling you.

30
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,860
I will never
put on women's clothing again.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,560
But you look pretty in it.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,959
There, there.

33
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,719
To avoid any mishaps,

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,280
we should go separate ways.

35
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,120
(Why is this place)

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,599
(not guarded at all?)

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,039
This human kitchen is terrifying.

38
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,159
Chengyan said

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,680
that the Luoying Blade
could absorb the moon's energy.

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,039
Could this be the one?

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,620
If this is the Luoying Blade,
what's inside the Cangji Pavilion?

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Oh no!

43
00:03:56,698 --> 00:04:02,220
(Exceptional)

44
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,879
Put down the blade, Beast.

45
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,120
What if I refuse to?

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,279
You should know your place.

47
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,470
If you insist on being with Chengyan,

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,800
his life will be in grave danger.

49
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,600
Whether I'm going to save her

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
or bring her harm,

51
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,270
that's none of your business.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,610
Looks like you're nothing but stubborn.

53
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,600
You won't be able to enter it.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,490
How despicable and shameless you are!

55
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,279
You actually set up this trap
and lured her in.

56
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,879
We won't hurt her.

57
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,920
I don't believe you!

58
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,800
This barrier was formed
by the elder of the Cangji Pavilion.

59
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,240
You will never get to open it

60
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,639
without the artifact of our sect.

61
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,439
Chengyan!

62
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,639
Here's the Luoying Blade!

63
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Are you hurt?

64
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
I will always keep my promise.

65
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
We can't stay here.

66
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Let's go.

67
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,040
Forget about it.

68
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,519
How dare you, Ye Qixiu?

69
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,519
You actually let them go?

70
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,680
I've been incompetent.

71
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,360
Please punish me, Your Lordship.

72
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,279
You!

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,319
Perhaps

74
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,120
this is fate.

75
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,839
Little did I expect

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
that the famous Luoying Blade

77
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,839
is a kitchen knife.

78
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,460
Qixiu's ancestors
were of the Food Cultivator Sect.

79
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Well,

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,759
it makes sense that the blade
is a kitchen knife.

81
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,470
However, it's such a shame
that he's not skilled enough

82
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,279
to deserve his ancestral artifact.

83
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,240
How snobbish of you.

84
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
If it weren't for Qixiu's leniency,

85
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,480
we'd have been caught last night.

86
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,519
What do you mean by that?

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
The Cangji Pavilion
isn't short of skilled fighters.

88
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,420
Those cultivators
who fought with me last night

89
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,120
seemed to be amateurish.

90
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
None of them was skilled.

91
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,319
Looks like

92
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,680
Qixiu never intended to catch us.

93
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,000
What are they doing?

94
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,799
That's a wedding.

95
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,759
They're joining the fun.

96
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,700
- Here comes the auspicious hour.
- A wedding?

97
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,399
- Come out now, bride.
- A wedding?

98
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,639
What's a wedding?

99
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
It's a custom in the mortal realm.

100
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,600
It's when two are in love

101
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,320
and promise to be together forever.

102
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,800
They will keep each other company,
without any separation.

103
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,559
Two people

104
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,919
stay together forever?

105
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,639
I want to be with you forever too.

106
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,559
- Here, hold each other's hands.
- Chengyan.

107
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,679
Did you hear that?

108
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,919
What did you say?

109
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,360
I said...

110
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,610
I said I'm aware of all these mortal customs.

111
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
Longqiu Chengyan!

112
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,120
(Well,)

113
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
(I want to marry you)

114
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,610
(and be blessed with your company)

115
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,399
(forever.)

116
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,810
(I want us to always stay together.)

117
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,240
Do you like that?

118
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,360
I'll buy it for you.

119
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,279
It's all right.

120
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,200
I buy what I like.

121
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,080
(My confession)

122
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,919
(has been ignored
by a female cultivator.)

123
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,320
(Did she even catch what I said?)

124
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Longqiu Chengyan.

125
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,890
You sure have a good appetite.

126
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,840
You eat whatever you can get.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,570
Why would I not be enjoying the food?

128
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,559
Since you said you wanted
to be with me forever,

129
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,090
of course I'm enjoying my food
due to my good mood.

130
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,919
You heard that?

131
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,180
Well, why didn't you answer me?

132
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,440
Because I liked the sound of it.

133
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,600
And I wanted to hear you repeat it.

134
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,759
You got me there.

135
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,960
Here's a kitty lantern.

136
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,200
I refined it myself.

137
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
