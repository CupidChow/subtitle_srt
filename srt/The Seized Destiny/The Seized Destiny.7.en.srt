00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,920
(No way,)

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
(this can't go on.)

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,439
Not bad.

8
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,820
(Luckily, I refined the robe,
which now gives me protection.)

9
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,120
It's you.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
I'll settle
the score with you later.

11
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,500
I am the Ancient Demon Lord, Sha.

12
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,590
Does anyone of you want my body?

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Is he the one?

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,519
The Ancient Demon Lord, Sha?

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
Why did he break the seal?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,760
Run!

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,690
Stop pushing me.

18
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,480
Why are you...

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
How could you leave

20
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,120
without saying goodbye?

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,439
But...

22
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,300
You've done it twice.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
You left me behind just like that.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm going to avenge my senior brother.

25
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,920
Sha has taken control
of his body for so long.

26
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,439
I'm going to make him pay.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,560
But he is

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,280
your family.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,840
Chengyan.

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,519
Didn't you ask me

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
about what I said

32
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,810
when you were out of consciousness?

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,879
Listen carefully.

34
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,439
I said I've found life

35
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,000
meaningful

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
because of you.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,639
You're still recovering.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,220
With me by your side,

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,039
at least we can seize
those artifacts together.

40
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,439
Thank you.

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,719
Let's go.

42
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,919
A thousand-year cycle of rebirth.

43
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,039
The Divine Maiden walks the earth again.

44
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,199
Fate is truly inevitable after all.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,039
Watch out, Yan!

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,879
Chengtian.

47
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,400
What are you doing here?

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Chengtian.

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
What's down there?

50
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,840
It's the Demon God Valley.

51
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,000
The Demon God Valley?

52
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,760
That's right.

53
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,920
Bear this in mind.

54
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,420
The Demon God Valley
is very dangerous.

55
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,660
So you must stay away from it.

56
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,479
I know.

57
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,970
A ancient magical beast
is being sealed there.

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,919
The Divine Maiden Lu Ming did so.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
I want to be as brilliant as her.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,159
Yet, Chengtian,

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,280
did that magical beast
do something unforgivable?

62
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,719
Why must we keep him sealed?

63
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,639
Regarding that,

64
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,039
I don't have an answer to it.

65
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
I'll let you know after my cultivation
in the Demon God Valley.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,680
Few days ago,

67
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,460
you were a skilled female cultivator from
an prestigious artifact cultivator sect.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,439
And I

69
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,680
was an evil ancient magical beast.

70
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,600
You've now been driven out of the sect.

71
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,959
And I

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,639
have lost my only name.

73
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,720
That reminds me of it.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,879
If you're not Sha,

75
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,199
who are you, then?

76
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,920

00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,639
Rumor had it that Longqiu Chengyan
is the Divine Maiden Lu Ming.

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,330
It turned out

111
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,690
that she's a mere demoness who's
having an affair with the magical beast.

112
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,690
We're just mortals.
So enough worrying about that.

113
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,920
We'll have a full moon tonight.

114
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,399
I heard that that soothsayer
from the Cangji Pavilion

115
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,600
has long made the arrangement.

116
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,420
- (The Cangji Pavilion.)
- You certainly know a lot.

117
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,560
(The full moon night.)

118
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
(Of course
they're up to something tonight.)

119
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,720
(Well,)

120
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,818
(I'm seizing the Luoying Blade tonight.)

121
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
Stop eating.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,919
The Cangji Pavilion faces
the street to the north

123
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,039
which is always crowded.

124
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,753
(Cangji Pavilion)
And the south is guarded

125
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:47,840
(Cangji Pavilion)
by a number of disciples.

126
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,200
The east side faces the water,
which is not convenient either.

127
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,759
From the looks of it,

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,380
only the west side is worth a shot.

129
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,360
What say you, Chen?

130
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,690
Why go through so much trouble
to enter the Cangji Pavilion?

131
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,360
No matter how many people
are each side, I'll find a way in.

132
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,360
Yes, yes.

133
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,639
You're the best.

134
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,320
Why does it feel like something's off?

135
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:32,800
The Cangji Pavilion

136
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,250
places the Luoying Blade on the rooftop
every full moon night.

137
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,080
(Cangji Pavilion)

138
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,890
To make sure the blade absorb
the full moon's energy as much as possible

139
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,180
to enhance its spiritual energy.

140
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,759
Slow down a bit.

141
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,120
Why do I have to wear this outfit?

142
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
It's uncomfortable.

143
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,279
Be quiet, okay?

144
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,080
Cut the nonsense.

145
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
Fine, I'll shut up.

146
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,720
But there's one thing I must remind you.

147
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,450
Whether or not we manage
to find the Luoying Blade tonight,

148
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,340
you are not allowed to risk your life.

149

Don't worry.

150
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,840
I'll be careful.

151
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,350
You need to be careful too.

152
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,629
