is my bride.

I'm sure

10
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,960
I did many good deeds
in my previous life

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,879
to marry

12
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
I'm embarrassed.

28
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,120
I want to enjoy the breeze.

29
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,560
Sure.

30
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
I'll go with you.

Chen,

32
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,519
you've always said you'd bring me
back to the Demon Realm

33
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,360
but I don't know
what the Demon Realm looks like.

34
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
To be honest,

35
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I don't remember everything
before I was sealed.

36
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,480
However, I have a vague feeling

37
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,879
that the Demon Realm
is a place that makes people happy.

38
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,990
Everyone is friendly
and lives harmoniously

39
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,079
while helping each other.

40
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,680
Yan,

41
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
why are you crying?

42
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,050
I really want to go back
to the Demon Realm with you

43
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,560
and live happily there.

44
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,399
Silly girl,

45
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,360
why are you crying about that?

46
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,199
The Demon Realm is my home.

47
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,639
It'll also be yours in the future.

48
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,170
When we are done dealing
with matters here,

49
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,890
we will return
to the Demon Realm together

50
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,600
and live happily there

51
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,839

Chen,

53
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
you know I'm an amazing
female artifact cultivator, right?

54
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,839
Of course, I know that.

55
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,079
I used everything I've learned

56
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,800
to make this windbreaker for you.

57
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
It can help you
reach the Demon Realm directly.

58
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,040
What do you mean?

59
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,000
Chen,

60
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560

62
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,879
is the only thing

63

Chen!

68
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't go back
to the Demon Realm with you.

69

Promise me!

70
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
