1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,119
(Millions of years ago,)

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,079
(Dual cultivation between men and women
was popular in the cultivation world.)

3
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,760
(Cultivators of the world rushed)

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
(Longqiu Hall)
(to find a partner for cultivation.)

5
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,580
=The Seized Destiny=

6
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,781
(Adapted from
a Tencent Animation and Comics work)

7
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:03,060
(of the same title by Huaxiang Mogu.)

8
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,260
=Episode 1=

9
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,260
(Three Days Ago)

10
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,719
Calm down.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,280
There's no need to scream

12
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,990
even if you see someone
as handsome as me.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,439
You are not a human.

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,799
Who are you?

15
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,280
Who in the world are you?

16
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,680
Forget it.

17
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,480
Let me introduce myself.

18
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,079
I am

19
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,599
the Ancient Demon Lord,

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,000
Sha.

21
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,280
Little Beast.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,980
Don't be so clueless
when you try to bluff.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,919
A thousand years ago,

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,599
The evil ancient beast, Sha,

25
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,550
fought Divine Maiden Lu Ming
at Demon God Valley

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,610
and was sealed by
Divine Maiden Lu Ming in the end.

27
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,280
Why would he appear here

28
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,400
and looked

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,639
so weak?

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,240
Who told you
that the ancient beast was evil?

31
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,919
If he wasn't evil,

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,159
why would the Divine Maiden seal him?

33
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,960
You are right.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
I was trapped for a long time

35
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,479
in the Demon God Valley.

36
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,919
Is this Demon God Valley?

37
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,480
What are you expecting?

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
Your backyard?

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,639
(Ye Qixiu)

40
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,660
Longqiu Chengyan
from the Artifact Cultivator Sect.

41
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,980
(Longqiu Chengyan)

42
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,930
Fengshan Muling
from the Secret Cultivator Sect.

43
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,660
(Fengshan Muling)

44
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,120
This competition

45
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,890
is to decide whether the cultivator
worthy of ascending to the next level.

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,160
The format is not limited
but this is a friendly duel.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,730
Participants must know when to stop.
Killing is not permitted.

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,879
Yes.

49
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,780
(Longqiu Chengtian)

50
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,879
Let's begin.

51
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:42,159
Muling,

52
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,080
let's get it over with.

53
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,230
It'll be the hour of Wu soon.
Let's not delay lunch.

54
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,400
My thoughts as well.

55
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,000
You used an underhanded move
as soon as the duel began.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
What could I do?

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,180
The Secret Cultivator Sect
excels in using throwing weapons.

58
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,479
It seems like you are starving,

59
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,439
Muling.

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,186
(Yun Qingping)
Longqiu Chengyan,

61
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,310
(Yun Qingping)
how dare you take my sword!

62
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,959
You can't even protect your sword

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,890
as the sect leader
of the Sword Cultivator Sect.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,600
You...

65
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,800
How unexpected.

66
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,550
Chengyan's power in
artifact cultivation has improved a lot.

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
She could even turn
Sect Leader Yun's sword

68
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
into a weapon she could use.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,610
Sect Leader Yun, thanks for your sword.

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,920
That was so disrespectful.

71
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,759
Chengtian,

72
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,160
I told you I would win.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
I promise

74
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,040
to carry out
your ascension ritual three days later.

75
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,199
Thank you, Chengtian.

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,839
Muling.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,759
Are you all right?

78
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,000
You win.

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
Stand up.

80
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,319
The Demon God Valley
is indeed below the cliff.

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,480
(Muling.)

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,490
(I'll go back and get revenge on her.)

83
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,879
It hurts.

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,160
Don't waste your strength.

85
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,800
No one can untie you besides me.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
No wonder you could awaken me.

87
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,420
This is a Pure Yin Physique that can
only be found once in a millennium.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
After being sealed for so long,

89
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,170
I've actually gotten a feast
for my first meal.

90
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,500
Give me your inner core!

91
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,360
Wait!

92
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,360
If you want my inner core,
biting won't work.

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,920
Let me tell you
how to obtain a cultivator's inner core.

94
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,879
Are you sure?

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,639
Since you are the demon lord,

96
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,399
I'm sure you are very knowledgeable.

97
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,040
You should know that
a move must be used

98
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,480
to achieve balance on both ends

99
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,990
before obtaining
the inner core of a human cultivator.

100
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,759
Demon Lord.

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
I'm sure you know this.

102
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,150
Are you underestimating me?

103
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,519
That's right.

104
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,079
Demon Lord.

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,240
Help untie me

106
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,959
so I can use the move
to transfer my inner core to you.

107
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,279
Let me give you a reminder.

108
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,560
Those who lied to me

109
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,319
all died a cruel death.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
That's right.

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,920
We need to achieve balance.

112
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,240
Otherwise...

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,519
What is it?

114
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,439
You have a death wish!

115
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,240
You trust others too easily.

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,000
You're so stupid.

117
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,920
How dare you impersonate
the Ancient Demon Lord.

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,690
I have no time to fool around with you.

119
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,040
You better take care of yourself.

120
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,959
(He actually)

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,920
(helped apply medicine on me?)

122
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,240
Don't misunderstand.

123
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
I didn't hurt you on purpose.

124
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,720
You rushed towards me suddenly
and scared me.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,759
Little Beast, you must remember

126
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,399
not to simply ask for
a cultivator's inner core.

127
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,840
It'll cause a backlash.

128
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,279
The spiritual energy I gave you

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,190
was enough for you to survive.

130
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:29,080
You must rely on yourself
in your future cultivation.

131
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,440
Hey!

132
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,039
What is your name?

133
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,320
Longqiu Chengyan.

134
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Longqiu Chengyan?

135
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,679
We will meet again.

136
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,440
I hope not.

137
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,780
(Demon God Valley)

138
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,799
Yan!

139
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,600
Chengtian!

140
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,799
Chengtian.

141
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,799
Are you hurt?

142
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,799
How did you fall down the cliff?

143
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,440
It was just an accident.

144
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
This place is very dangerous.

145
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,300
We'll talk about it when we go back.

146
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,120
Let's go.

147
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,879
Be careful.

148
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,559
Brother?

149
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,960
Without you,

150
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,550
I'll be the only candidate
to cultivate with His Lordship.

151
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm the only person
worthy of cultivating with His Lordship.

152
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,919
His Lordship's partner can only be me!

153
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,840
Fengshan Muling!

154
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,240
Since I've returned safely,

155
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,990
I will forgive you for what you did.

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,440
But if you do it again...

157
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,720
