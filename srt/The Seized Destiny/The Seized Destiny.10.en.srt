It's time for you
to have a taste of the Glaze Mirage.

00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,159
Congratulations, Sect Leader Fengshan!

7
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,920
Congratulations, Sect Leader Fengshan!

Muling.

10
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,000
Muling.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Wake up, Muling.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,320
Muling, wake up!

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,399
Muling!

14
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,200

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,480
Muling, wake up!

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,200
Have you gone mad?

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,439
Loser!

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,599
Who are you to shout at me?

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,159
What about Longqiu Chengyan?

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,239
Was she here?

21
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,190
Where's the Glazed Bead?

22
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,599
Thanks to your wisdom, Sect Leader Yun,

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,439
Longqiu Chengyan has successfully
harvested the Glazed Bead

24
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,239
and reconstructed her inner core.

25
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:23,879
I...

26
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,200
However,

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
her road

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,519
is finally coming to an end.

29
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,040
(Chen, sorry for making you wait.)

30
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:56,919
Chen.

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,990
You were gone for so long.

32
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,820
Did you encounter some kind of trouble?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm fine.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm just in a rush to meet you.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Chen,

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,039
do you still remember

37
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,319
the rules of the Human Realm?

38
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,910
There are many rules in the Human Realm.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,890
I don't know
which one you are talking about.

40
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,199
Can you tell me

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
the things I like to hear?

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,439
Getting married is a rule
of the Human Realm.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
It is a promise

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,719
for two people in love
to be together forever

45
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,120
and accompany each other

46
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
without separation.

47
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,560
Two people

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
being together forever

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
without separation.

50
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,400
I also want to be with you forever.

51
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,199
What do you mean?

52
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,400
Just say it again.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,110
I want to hear you say it.

54
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,520
Longqiu Chengyan,

55
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
I want to be together with you forever

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,930
and never separate from each other.

57
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,399
Chen,

58
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,480
let's get married.

59
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,519
Really?

60
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,519
Yes.

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,959
My Lord, don't worry.

62
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,079
Longqiu Chengyan will surely die.

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,399
I asked you not to hurt her

64
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,839
and you're telling me
she will surely die?

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,319
My Lord,

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,959
I don't understand.

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,040
She does things heartlessly.

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,600
Why do you still protect her?

69
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,720
Since she has chosen to go against you,

70
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,519
she deserves to be killed!

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,240
My Lord,

72
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,480
I did all this for your sake.

73
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,600
For my sake?

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,980
Do you think I don't know
what you're scheming?

75
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,240
I admit it.

76
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,759
I want to replace Chengyan

77
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,160
to become your cultivation partner!

78
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,720
I don't want
to live under Chengyan's shadow!

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,839
I want you to see me.

80
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,519
Enough.

81
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,040
Chengyan only cares about Qixiu

82
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,879
and not you!

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,199
My Lord.

84
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,360

85

86
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,560

God will be busy fulfilling them.

91
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,850
Perhaps he will forget about you.

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,639
Speaking of which, what did you wish for?

93
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,639
Is it related to me?

94
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,730

Chen, I want to go to a place.

115

How much

116
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
do you know about me?

117
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600

three years ago.

119
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,639
The real Longqiu Chengtian was inflicted
with my Purple Reishi Poison.

There's no antidote for the poison.

121
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,679
You are hit with the poison
time after time

122
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,720
because you took over his poisoned body.

123
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,159
You are someone

124
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,120
who poisons her own Supreme Lord.

125
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,440
Why should I trust you?

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
My Lord.

127
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,440
I can do everything

128
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,000
that Chengyan is capable of.

129
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,159
I can even suppress your poison

130
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,879
and help you become an immortal.

131
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,679
What happened to Chengyan?

132
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,360
I applied Purple Reishi Poison
on the Glazed Bead.

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,519
Chengyan harvested the Glazed Bead

134
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,480
and the poison entered her blood.

135
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,000
