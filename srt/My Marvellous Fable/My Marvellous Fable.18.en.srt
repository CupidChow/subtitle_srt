4
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,300
(If you ask me why I've come to this,)

5
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,020
(we have to start with the parcel)

6
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,820
(that Luna is holding.)

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,420
Luna.

8
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,540
I'll carry it for you.

9
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,620
It's okay.

10
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,340
Let me help.

11
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,900
Thank you.

12
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,620
It's pretty heavy.

13
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,100
It's indeed heavy.

14
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,100
It's okay.

15
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,580
Well.

16
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,420
Thank you.

17
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,420
Say "thank you" to Mister.

18
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,820
He is carrying the parcel for us,

19
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,420
right?

20
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,340
Say "thank you" to Mister.

21
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,740
Sorry about that.

22
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,420
It's okay.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,300
Let's go.

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,380
Thank you.

25
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,860
The rain has stopped, right?

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,860
Let me close the umbrella.

27
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,340
Let's go.

28
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,020
Later,

29
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,060
tell me

30
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,700
that you need to go to the toilet,

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,500
okay?

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,260
Say it.

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,620
Now.

34
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,900
Mom, I want to go to the toilet.

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,820
I want to go to the toilet!

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,580
You want to go to the toilet?

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,340
I want to go to the toilet.

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,220
I need to pee.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,140
Okay.

40
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,820
Okay.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,060
I'm going to wet my pants.

42
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,620
I want to go to the toilet.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,820
I want to go to the toilet.

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,140
I need to take him to the toilet.

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,740
Can you wait for me?

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,660
Okay.

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,100
Please go ahead.

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,060
Come on.

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,540
Let's go.

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,500
Let's go to the toilet.

52
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,020
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,580
Let's go.

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,220
Run.

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,780
Come on.

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,540
Hurry up.

57
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,060
Let's run.

58
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,420
You are running so fast.

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,380
(Why is Luna acting as sneakily
as the team leader)

60
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,020
(and the others?)

61
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,980
(What's inside here?)

62
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,820
(It's so heavy.)

63
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,220
(How long do I have to wait?)

64
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,125
(Future)

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,660
Hello,

66
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,620
Luna.

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,100
I'm Feng Tianlan.

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,980
I'm still waiting for you
at the same place just now.

69
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,020
Why isn't she here yet?

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,580
(LUNA)
(Hello.)

71
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,900
(What's going on right now?)

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,660
(Something urgent came up.)

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,820
(If you can't wait,)

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,980
(you can just leave)

75
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,820
(the box there.)

76
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,260
(Did Luna collude)

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,620
(with Wang Putao)

78
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,580
(to prank me?)

79
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,380
It's you.

80
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,740
Do you know me?

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,020
No.

82
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,300
But I know your boyfriend.

83
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,340
My boyfriend?

84
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,900
The one

85
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,620
who paid for you last time.

86
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:33,897
(Ms. Wang, we haven't talked
in a long time. How have you been?)

87
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,820
(Forget it.)

88
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,540
(She won't reply to me anyway.)

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,322
(Ms. Wang, what are you doing?)

90
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,500
(Wang Putao.)

91
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,780
Xiwen.

92
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,660
Long time no see.

93
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,060
Xi.

94
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
Who are you calling?

95
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,820
That person is already dead.

96
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,820
I was wrong.

97
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,340
I mean it.

98
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,580
Last year...

99
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,340
Last year,

100
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,020
I went to see a psychiatrist.

101
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,340
And I indeed...

102
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
got better.

103
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,140
Liang Wenkai.

104
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,220
I was fooled too many times by you.

105
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,740
Your apology doesn't mean anything

106
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,820
to me.

107
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,340
So, I hope that today

108
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,780
will be the last time we meet.

109
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,420
And I hope

110
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,820
that you'll stay away from me forever.

111
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm here to apologize sincerely to you.

112
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,380
Xi.

113
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,340
Look at this

114
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,140
and this.

115
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,100
Look at these.

116
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,820
These are my proof of diagnosis.

117
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,580
I'm really getting better now.

118
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,060
Xi.

119
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,780
I want to apologize to you sincerely.

120
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,540
For the mistakes I made in the past.

121
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,020
Xi.

122
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,300
Excuse me.

123
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,100
The bill, please.

124
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,380
Idiot.

125
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,140
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

126
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,940
Where did you go?

127
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,220
I was so worried about you.

128
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm fine.

129
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,620
He seemed

130
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,340
different this time.

131
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,900
(It has been six hours.)

132
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,100
(Where did the mother and the son go?)

133
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,820
(Something urgent came up.)

134
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,100
(If you can't wait,)

135
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,220
(you can just leave)

136
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,180
(the box there.)

137
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,340
(No.)

138
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,140
(This doesn't make sense.)

139
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,300
(She took the parcel out purposely.)

140
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,780
(How could she
throw it away this easily?)

141
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,260
(Can it be)

142
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,100
(that this parcel is for me?)

143
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,580
Hello.

144
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,500
How is it?

145
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,980
He's still waiting downstairs
like a fool.

146
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,660
I think it's going
to drive him mad soon.

147
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,820
Well done.

148
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,020
What's wrong with you?

149
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,500
You know

150
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,180
how mischievous my son is.

151
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,500
It's good that he's still sane.

152
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,780
Think of it as a treatment
to cure a patient.

153
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,540
Fine.

154
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,340
I'll hang up now.

155
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,620
Luna.

156
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,780
Liang Wenkai found me again.

157
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,220
How did that happen?

158
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,660
How are you?

159
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,620
Are you okay?

160
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,700
I'm fine.

161
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,900
Thank you for helping me all along.

162
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,420
What are you talking about?

163
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,020
You should stay away
from a pervert like him.

164
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,820
No.

165
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,780
How are you doing right now?

166
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,740
Are you troubled by something?

167
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,980
I don't know.

168
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,260
But Liang Wenkai

169
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,660
looks different this time.

170
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,740
He asked me to forgive him.

171
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,020
Anyway,

172
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,340
you have to stay alert,

173
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,380
okay?

174
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,460
Okay.

175
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,020
I got it.

176
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,140
I'll hang up now.

177
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,780
(I'm sure it's not for me.)

178
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,540
(I don't even know
if she likes me or not.)

179
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,540
Feng Tianlan.

180
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,980
It doesn't matter
if she likes you or not.

181
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,580
What matters

182
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
is that you like her.

183
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,940
If this parcel is for Luna,

184
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
you'll apologize to her.

185
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,500
If the parcel is for you...

186
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,300
This is not your fault.

187
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,620
You've waited six hours for her.

188
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,740
She's the one who didn't contact you.

189
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,260
This is not your fault.

190
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,340
This is not your fault.

191
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,340
(When you are ready)

192
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
(and happen to be thinking about me,)

193
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,820
(come and find me.)

194
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,500
(Could it be...)

195
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,020
(Could it be that she
has been waiting for me?)

196
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,620
(So,)

197
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,500
(she has been waiting for my answer.)

198
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,740
What did last night

199
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,300
mean to you?

200
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,820
Is the manuscript that important to you?

201
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,820
(Yes.)

202
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,300
I...

203
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm not done talking yet.

204
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,780
(When you are ready and happen
to be thinking about me, come and find me.)

205
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:56,050
(I know you'll come, so I'll wait.)

206
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,380
Tell me.

207
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,980
Why did you have to do that?

208
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,820
You know,

209
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,700
he'll never know what's in the box

210
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,740
if he doesn't open it.

211
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Even if he wants to like someone,

212
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,180
he is too afraid to approach her.

213
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,740
But

214
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,900
if that's the case,

215
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,460
nothing will happen between us.

216
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,125
(Five days later)

217
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,380
(It has been a few days.)

218
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,300
(Why isn't he here yet?)

219
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,380
(Had I gone overboard?)

220
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,420
(Will I...)

221
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,340
Are you heartbroken?

222
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,260
You know nothing.

223
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,180
How dare you

224
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,260
disrespect your elder.

225
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,180
You!

226
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,620
Fine.

227
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,100
That's painful.

228
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,380
Fine.

229
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,340
I was wrong.

230
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,460
Drink this.

231
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,140
I made it for you this morning.

232
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,460
Look at your pathetic self.

233
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,820
How did I raise you into a fool?

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:04,980
Forget it.

235
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,620
Tell me.

236
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,380
How long are you going to hide here?

237
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,820
When are you leaving?

238
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,340
Who says I'm hiding?

239
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,620
I'm not.

240
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,500
Think about it.

241
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,740
It has been one, two, three,

242
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,540
three years,

243
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,700
since you broke up with Xu Youguang.

244
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,140
Finally, you are in love again.

245
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,300
Why are you so happy?

246
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,660
You are so strange.

247
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:30,850
(Six days later)

248
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
(If he's not coming, so be it.)

249
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,020
(I don't care anyway.)

250
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,620
It's me.

251
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,100
Of course I know it's you.

252
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,820
You overdid it.

253
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,020
You had to say you'd cure him or something.

254
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,980
And you said since the first day

255
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,100
that he would come back.

256
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,220
Where is he now?

257
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,860
You asked me to cook
for one extra person every day.

258
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,900
When is he coming back?

259
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,660
None of your business.

260
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,020
I can finish all the food.

261
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Go ahead then.

262
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,620
There's more.

263
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,180
Good girl.

264
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,500
Careful.

265
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,780
No one is taking your food away.

266
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Why didn't you remove

267
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,940
the heads of the prawns?

268
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,980
Are you complaining?

269
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,860
If you don't like it,

270
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,900
you can cook for yourself tomorrow.

271
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,300
Great.

272
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,100
I think your culinary skills

273
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,740
have gotten worse.

274
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,900
You can cook for me tomorrow.

275
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,300
Are you still waiting for him?

276
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Why is he so stupid?

277
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,820
He should've thought it through by now.

278
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,300
I've known you for so many years.

279
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I feared

280
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,420
that you might bring trouble to others.

281
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,020
Otherwise, I would've thrown you out
a long time ago.

282
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,260
Look

283
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,540
what you have done.

284
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,180
This is different.

285
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,260
Others don't have to understand
that I'm helping him.

286
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,100
But he

287
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,980
has to understand.

288
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,820
(That fool.)

289
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,460
(What is he doing?)

290
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,150
(Six days ago)

291
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,875
(I Can Still See Her)

292
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,340
(Feng Tianlan.)

293
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,420
(We are just ordinary people.)

294
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,820
We'll die one day.

295
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,500
But we are living

296
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,340
as if we had forever together.

297
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,500
Getting to know someone is easy.

298
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,420
But it's never easy
to say goodbye properly.

299
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:47,475
(Zhang Haibei: QQ, Phone Number)

300
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,620
(It's time)

301
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,340
(to do something.)

302
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,660
Hello,

303
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,140
sir.

304
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,020
Regarding the sample book,

305
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,820
I will reconfirm it with Putao.

306
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,100
However,

307
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,260
if she doesn't wish to confirm it,

308
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,340
I hope you'll stop forcing her.

309
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:20,940
Hello?

310
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,300
Feng Tianlan.

311
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,340
What are you talking about?

312
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,820
It's the same with me.

313
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,140
Maybe we won't be able
to publish the book at last.

314
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,980
I hope you can understand that.

315
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,500
But now,

316
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,340
I have to go to her.

317
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,860
Feng Tianlan.

318
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,820
I'm not done yet...
