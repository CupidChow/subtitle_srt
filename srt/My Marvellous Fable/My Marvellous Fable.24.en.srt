00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,260
=Episode 24=

4
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,860
The food in the hospital is just terrible.

5
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,140
Why are you here?

6
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Come on, let's go home.

7
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,020
Come on.

8
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,900
Let's go home and eat.

9
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,820
Let's go home.

10
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,580
I still have something else to do.

11
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,220
It's all here.

12
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,580
It's here.

13
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,860
I still have something else to do.

14
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,580
It's here.

15
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
I still have...

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,620
Let's go home.

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,580
I still have...

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,580
Let's go home.

19
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,100
I still have something else to do.

20
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,900
Mr. Wang!

21
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,500
Mr. Wang!

22
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,860
(Feng Tianlan)
(I'm at the beach.)

23
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,140
(I haven't found him yet.)

24
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,540
(Wang Putao)
(Be careful when you're alone.)

25
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,620
(I'll go back to the nursing home again.)

26
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,260
I still have something else to do.

27
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,940
Go home!

28
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
We'll go home and eat.

29
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,500
I still have something else to do.

30
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,620
I...

31
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm...

32
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,620
We'll talk at home.

33
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,580
I don't want to go back.

34
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,140
We'll talk at home.

35
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,300
I'm not hungry.

36
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,660
I'm not going anywhere.

37
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,100
I don't want to go.

38
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,860
Don't take me away.

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,180
Mr. Wang!

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,380
Mr. Wang!

41
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,300
Mr. Wang!

42
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,780
Mr. Wang!

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,500
I fail my duty as a daughter.

44
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,260
Indeed.

45
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,140
You guys know my dad

46
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,260
more than I do.

47
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,460
I see many elderly

48
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,620
whose condition fluctuates

49
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,460
like your father every day.

50
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,460
Getting lost

51
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,140
or running away from home

52
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,740
when they're not happy

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,420
is very common.

54
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,820
But

55
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,820
children like you

56
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,060
are rare.

57
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,700
He didn't call you.

58
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,660
And you

59
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,020
never came to visit.

60
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,500
I know

61
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,260
it's none of my business.

62
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,420
But...

63
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,140
(Wang Heping.)

64
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,980
(Uncle Wang.)

65
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,940
(Wang Heping.)

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,180
(Mr. Wang!)

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,460
(Wang Heping.)

68
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,660
(Mr. Wang.)

69
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,740
(Wang Heping.)

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,540
(Mr. Wang.)

71
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,900
(Wang Heping!)

72
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,700
(Mr. Wang!)

73
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,260
Eat some,

74
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,980
Putao.

75
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Mr. Wang

76
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,660
left this braised meat
especially for you.

77
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,300
Don't worry,

78
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,020
Putao.

79
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,940
We'll definitely find him.

80
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,540
It tastes better when it's freshly cooked.

81
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,460
If I had them yesterday,

82
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,940
it would taste even better.

83
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,700
(Fables can be passed down
through generations)

84
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,420
(because people are willing
to believe in fictional stories.)

85
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,820
(The princess)

86
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,220
(will meet the prince.)

87
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,700
(And villains)

88
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,540
(will be punished.)

89
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,980
(Some stories are about desire,)

90
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,300
(some are about illusions,)

91
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,540
(while some are about life and death
and sacrifices.)

92
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,020
(We live in fictional stories)

93
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,300
(that we create.)

94
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,860
(This)

95
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,700
(is our last story.)

96
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,020
(Xi,)

97
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,900
(soon enough,)

98
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,380
(you'll be solely mine again.)

99
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,540
(We were so happy back then.)

100
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,580
(I admit there were misunderstandings
between us.)

101
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,100
(But it was
because I was too afraid of losing you.)

102
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,580
(I believe)

103
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,700
(that one day,)

104
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,100
(you'll come back.)

105
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,740
No, don't.

106
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,900
(Where am I?)

107
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,660
Feng.

108
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,060
Feng.

109
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,220
Let me see

110
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,780
who you texted.

111
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,860
Let's play a game.

112
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,060
Don't move.

113
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
Whoever moves first loses.

114
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,180
Be good.

115
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,140
Behave.

116
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,060
Don't tie me up.

117
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,380
You'll win soon enough.

118
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,860
Old man,

119
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,020
do you remember me?

120
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,300
Treat my daughter well.

121
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,380
You must treat her well.

122
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,860
Or else I'll come after you,

123
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,540
do you hear me?

124
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,220
I will, sir.

125
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,020
Please calm down.

126
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,100
Don't worry.

127
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,460
Mr. Wang!

128
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,700
(Mr. Wang)

129
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,980
(No. 77, Guanshan Yue Villa)
(Sanya, Hainan Province)

130
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,940
Mr. Wang.

131
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,860
Mr. Wang?

132
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,140
Mr. Wang.

133
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,940
Mr. Wang,

134
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,220
where are you?

135
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,740
Mr. Wang.

136
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,860
Mr. Wang.

137
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,940
Mr. Wang.

138
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,900
Mr. Wang.

139
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,540
Mr. Wang.

140
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,820
Mr. Wang.

141
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,740
Mr. Wang, open your eyes.

142
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,540
Mr. Wang.

143
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,780
What are you doing?

144
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
I have no phone.

145
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,780
Phone.

146
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Don't move.

147
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,900
Stay still.

148
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Feng Tianlan.

149
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,500
Am I right?

150
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,420
Why are you here by yourself?

151
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,900
Where's Xi?

152
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
What are you trying to do?

153
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,140
Let him go.

154
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,380
Xi left something with me.

155
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm waiting for her to come

156
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,020
to give it back to her.

157
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,860
I'll wait for her.

158
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,100
I'll wait.

159
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,580
After all,

160
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,460
this was the house we were supposed

161
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,020
to move into after we got married.

162
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,180
How did it go?

163
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,420
Did you file a police report?

164
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,740
Where's Feng?

165
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,820
I already called the police.

166
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm still waiting to hear from them.

167
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,540
I can't reach Tianlan on the phone.

168
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,740
Do you think

169
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,020
something might have...

170
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,260
He's fine.

171
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,460
It's fine.

172
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,740
It'll be okay.

173
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,180
Don't think too much.

174
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,100
We'll wait
for the police's news tomorrow.

175
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,860
Everything will be okay.

176
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,300
Get some rest today.

177
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,740
Okay.

178
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,340
Aunt, I'd like to have some time alone.

179
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,260
Okay.

180
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,500
Well,

181
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,420
don't stay up too late.

182
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,500
Okay.

183
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,020
(Tianlan,)

184
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,180
(where are you?)

185
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,540
(Wang Putao)
(I'm really worried about you.)

186
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,100
(Could it really)

187
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,220
(be related to Liang Wenkai?)

188
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,260
(Where could they be?)

189
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,940
(They must be there.)

190
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,140
(Gasoline?)

191
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,740
Xi.

192
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,620
Here you are.

193
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,780
Put this on.

194
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,700
I hope you still remember the dance

195
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,060
we practiced together.

196
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
I'll be waiting for you.

197
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
(I'm currently at this location.)

198
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,340
(Xiwen)
(If I don't contact you in half an hour,)

199
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,580
(call the police right away.)

200
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,780
Where are they?

201
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,860
Tianlan!

202
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,500
Liang Wenkai,

203
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,580
you sick psycho.

204
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,780
Other than hurting me

205
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,300
and controlling me,

206
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,220
what else can you do?

207
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,420
Also,

208
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,220
I'll never forget

209
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,020
every bruise and injury on my body.

210
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,860
But I love you the most.

211
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,820
Look at this house.

212
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,140
Look at everything around you!

213
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,020
Why do you always treat me like this?

214
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,140
You truly

215
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,820
will never change.

216
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,380
But I've changed.

217
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,260
No matter how many times I fall,

218
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,540
I always stand up again.

219
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,300
(I suddenly remembered)

220
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,060
(that was the move)

221
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,900
(she used on me that night.)

222
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,780
(I suddenly found her)

223
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,620
(so cool that night.)

224
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,260
(So)

225
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,860
(Director Feng,)

226
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,500
(did the female boxer)

227
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,140
(end up)

228
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,580
(saving the male protagonist?)

229
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,500
(Of course.)

230
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,660
(A princess can save a prince.)

231
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,700
(Script Reading Session)

232
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,220
(Script Reading Session)
All right.

233
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,500
(Script Reading Session)
If there are no more questions,

234
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,660
(Script Reading Session)
we'll end the session here.

235
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,020
Director Feng,

236
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,660
how does it feel to direct a film

237
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,500
written by your loved one?

238
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
Afraid of messing it up

239
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,940
and getting scolded.

240
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,740
Let's go.

241
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,300
Okay.

242
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,660
(Naturally,)

243
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,660
(such stories may be exciting.)

244
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,700
(But in reality,)

245
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
(there are better choices.)

246
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,500
(Putao soon received the location)

247
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,700
(I sent her.)

248
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,180
(After that,)

249
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,020
(she called the police.)

250
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,980
(The police quickly arrived
at the scene.)

251
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,980
(And Liang Wenkai)

252
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,420
(received the punishment
he deserved for his crimes.)

253
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,220
(After that,)

254
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,540
(Putao's new book)

255
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,540
(finally got published.)

256
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,940
(But)

257
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,860
(there's a huge change)

258
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,660
(from the original storyline.)

259
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,820
(Ziyun no longer envies
other people's life.)

260
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,180
(She understands the value
of ordinary life.)

261
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
(Yuanyuan is no longer obsessed)

262
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,780
(with success
that doesn't belong to her.)

263
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,100
(She changes her mindset)

264
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,740
(and finds a job she enjoys doing.)

265
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,020
(Xu Youguang sets aside his desires)

266
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,180
(and chooses to be with Guixiang.)

267
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,940
(Everyone)

268
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,460
(has a perfect ending.)

269
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,060
(I asked her why she changed)

270
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,340
(the ending of each story.)

271
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,940
(She said)

272
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,300
(this marvelous journey)

273
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,460
(had helped her find)

274
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,340
(different endings in life.)

275
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,340
Putao.

276
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,620
Putao!

277
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:09,940
(Does Father)

278
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,660
(remember you now?)

279
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,700
Come here.

280
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,500
I'll take you to ride the waves.

281
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,340
(I tell you this story)

282
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,260
(my way.)

283
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,940
(I hope those
who finish watching this story)

284
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,380
(can gain a glimmer of hope for life.)

285
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,420
(Even if)

286
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,460
(it's just a little bit.)
