=Episode 14=

4
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,580
(My name is Wang Putao.)

5
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,420
(The guy sitting next to me)

6
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,020
(is my intern editor.)

7
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,620
(This fool)

8
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,860
(used alcohol as a facade
to kiss me last night.)

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
(Now, he acts like nothing happened.)

10
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,860
(Let's see how long
you can keep pretending.)

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,740
Feng Tianlan.

12
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,980
After spending so many days with you,

13
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,580
I noticed that you...

14
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,140
Are you trying to say

15
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,300
that I can be funny at times?

16
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,380
For the sake of the manuscript,

17
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,100
I would do anything from swimming

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,380
to being a driver.

19
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,620
Whatever you asked.

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,820
You have a good sense of self-awareness.

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
But aren't you afraid

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,380
that one day you'll become

23
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,740
one of those workaholic Minions?

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,980
Then...

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,180
Isn't being a workaholic a strength?

26
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,980
What do you think?

27
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,580
Put my matters aside first.

28
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,380
Yesterday,

29
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,860
you mentioned

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,020
that your dad was sick.

31
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,500
How should I put it?

32
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,540
(Actually, I don't have
much impression of him.)

33
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
(Since I can remember,)

34
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,260
(I only get to see him
during the winter holidays.)

35
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,780
(My relationship with my dad)

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,780
(has always been mediated)

37
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,260
(by my mom.)

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,580
Xiwen!

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,340
(But)

40
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,420
(when I was ten,)

41
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,100
(my mom fell seriously ill.)

42
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,620
(He couldn't even come back in time)

43
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,820
(when she passed away.)

44
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,580
(Since then,)

45
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,140
(the connection between my dad
and me has been severed.)

46
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,340
(It was my aunt who raised me.)

47
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,860
(All these years,)

48
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,540
(when I needed my family the most,)

49
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,020
(he never cared about me.)

50
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,900
(So)

51
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,500
(I've gotten used
to not bothering each other)

52
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,820
(and living separate lives.)

53
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,100
Hello.

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,340
Hello, this is Kangle Nursing Home.

55
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,100
I'm Wu.

56
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm calling to inform you
about something.

57
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,140
Your father was diagnosed

58
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,660
with Alzheimer's disease six months ago.

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,060
He didn't want us to notify the family.

60
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,340
But his condition has worsened recently.

61
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,380
We hope you

62
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,820
can come back as soon as possible
to handle this.

63
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,580
(Just when I was struggling)

64
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,180
(with whether or not
to return to Qionghai,)

65
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,740
(you suddenly appeared.)

66
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,060
(I told myself)

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,820
(that if you refused
to drive me back to Qionghai,)

68
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,980
(then I had an excuse not to return.)

69
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,100
But I didn't expect

70
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,140
that your need to oblige others
would come to this extent.

71
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,820
Although I've returned,

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
I still haven't figured out

73
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,860
how to face him.

74
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,740
Since childhood,

75
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,260
his existence or non-existence

76
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,540
seems to have little meaning to me.

77
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,500
All parents in the world

78
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,140
love their children.

79
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,420
You can't be too certain about that.

80
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,540
Besides,

81
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
he won't recover

82
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,260
just because I've returned.

83
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,980
It's just to soothe

84
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,580
my conscience.

85
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,300
Ms. Wang.

86
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,180
Can you give me a book, Ms. Wang?

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,980
Have you gone mad from drinking?

88
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,420
You must have lost your mind.

89
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,580
Not as mad as you.

90
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,540
What did you say?

91
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:00,980
Wang Putao, you...

92
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:04,860
Me? You're the...

93
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,740
(During the days we've spent together,)

94
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,380
(I could feel that Feng Tianlan
is a very sincere person.)

95
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,620
(But he keeps avoiding)

96
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,420
(what happened last night.)

97
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,060
(I think he hadn't figured out)

98
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,660
(if he said he liked me)

99
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,300
(in the spur of the moment)

100
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,780
(or if he meant it sincerely.)

101
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,540
(But I don't want to push
for answers anymore.)

102
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,740
(At least,)

103
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,260
(I felt quite happy)

104
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,780
(during the time of picking on him.)

105
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,620
What's wrong?

106
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,620
Nothing.

107
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,020
Why are you dressed like that?

108
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,140
Why do you care?

109
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,860
Where are you going?

110
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,940
I have a date.

111
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,060
A date?

112
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,100
It's already late.

113
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Besides, aren't you single?

114
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,900
I'm already old enough.

115
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,460
I don't need you to restrict me.

116
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,420
By the way,

117
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,700
you two

118
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,380
must help me

119
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,700
take care of the inn
for a couple of days.

120
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,060
When I'm not around,

121
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,540
you must serve the guests properly.

122
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,900
I'll be back in a day or two.

123
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,700
What?

124
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,500
Bye-bye.

125
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,100
Bye.

126
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,580
Can you cook?

127
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,460
Yes.

128
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,500
(I know you'll come, so I'll wait.)

129
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,580
Rushing me for the manuscript again?

130
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,420
No...

131
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,940
It's not the manuscript.

132
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,220
I just washed my hair.

133
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,060
The sea breeze can dry it faster.

134
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,620
You splashed water on me.

135
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,380
Sorry about that.

136
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,540
Jeez.

137
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,900
You shouldn't come out
with wet hair like that.

138
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,140
You'll catch a cold being in the wind.

139
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,700
Turn around.

140
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,020
I said turn around.

141
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,180
You're still willing to accompany me

142
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,740
even though I bully you all the time.

143
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,420
Could it be that you like me?

144
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,660
Maybe I do like you.

145
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,100
What are you looking at?

146
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,740
Dry it yourself.

147
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,460
We agreed

148
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,580
to finish the manuscript together.

149
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,700
You're so pushy.

150
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,460
I even swam.

151
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,100
You must keep your word.

152
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,100
Is the manuscript that important?

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,580
Yes, it's important.

154
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,500
And quite special.

155
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,020
How special?

156
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,100
I've read

157
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,700
some of your previous novels.

158
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,020
In the stories,

159
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,260
there's death wherever the characters go

160
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,780
or some middle-aged woman

161
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,260
seeking revenge on society.

162
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,140
But I feel like

163
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,180
there's something different
in this novel.

164
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,580
That's why

165
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,460
I really want it.

166
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,020
I can't write it.

167
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,180
You can do it.

168
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,980
In a high-end apartment lobby.

169
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,900
Start writing.

170
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,100
We're starting already?

171
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,460
What else?

172
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,900
(Sun Xuan just came home from exercising.)

173
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,620
(She's a bit peculiar)

174
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,100
(and doesn't like
interacting with people.)

175
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,020
(She doesn't even like riding
the elevator with others.)

176
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,100
(As of late,
she hasn't been sleeping well.)

177
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,100
(She keeps having recurring dreams.)

178
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,340
(Often, she's unable to distinguish)

179
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,660
(between reality and dreams.)

180
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,100
Excuse me. Your takeout is here.

181
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,980
(In the dream,)

182
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,660
(strange things)

183
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,900
(have been happening to her.)

184
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,260
(For example,)

185
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,300
(the tight bottle cap
magically opened on its own;)

186
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
(blankets covered her)

187
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,460
(without her doing it;)

188
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,540
(and even)

189
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,460
(the messy desk is tidied up magically.)

190
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,620
(Ms. Wang,)

191
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,380
(are you telling a story)

192
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,660
(about a kindhearted fairy godmother?)

193
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,140
(Why must you add
the element of dreaming?)

194
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,940
(If not in a dream,)

195
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,060
(how is it possible
for the good stuff to happen?)

196
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,340
(Chapter 4: Between Black and White)

197
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,940
(Between Black and White, Sun Xuan)

198
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,700
(Today,)

199
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,460
(Sun Xuan has caught a severe cold
after being in the cold.)

200
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,420
(Strange things happen again.)

201
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
(Sun Xuan clearly didn't order
any cold medicine,)

202
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,540
(yet she received a call
for medicine delivery.)

203
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,580
Are you the resident of Unit 1620?

204
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,420
The heater on the 15th floor is leaking.

205
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,980
It has flooded the elevator area.

206
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
I'll go and fix it right away.

207
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,380
It'll be repaired in a moment.

208
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,700
Please wait here for a while.

209
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,180
(Sun Xuan thinks)

210
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,580
("This is really strange.)

211
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,420
(Is someone genuinely concerned about me)

212
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,260
(or is someone playing a prank?)

213
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,380
(Forget it.
I'd better not take the medicine.")

214
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
(In a drowsy state,)

215
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,380
(she seems to see a stranger.)

216
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,740
(Wait a minute.)

217
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
So here's another girl

218
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,580
who is single, lonely,

219
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,860
and lives alone.

220
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,540
Yes.

221
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,660
Why?

222
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,580
Any problem?

223
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,420
Nothing.

224
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,940
I was just asking.

225
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,900
Other people are in pairs.

226
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,740
Building an image that way
makes Sun Xuan

227
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,860
special and stands out more.

228
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,020
Get it?

229
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,300
(Silly.)

230
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,260
(Don't you know)

231
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,940
(why she's alone?)

232
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,060
(Was I not clear enough?)

233
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,500
This guy

234
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,900
is tall and slender.

235
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,980
(He's wearing)

236
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,740
(a four-piece black suit)

237
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,380
(with a peculiar-looking hat)

238
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,540
(on his head.)

239
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
(He looks)

240
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
(old-fashioned and conservative)

241
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,220
(but also quite good-looking.)

242
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,260
Are you the owner of Unit 1620?

243
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,060
Why are you still here?

244
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,420
The elevator has been repaired.

245
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,540
You should go back.

246
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,020
Don't catch a cold.

247
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,100
(It seems only Sun Xuan)

248
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,300
(can see this strange guy.)

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,940
(He carries her in his arms.)

250
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,260
(She wonders,)

251
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,100
("Am I being single for too long)

252
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,260
(so I am having hallucinations?")

253
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,220
(But why does this hallucination)

254
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,780
(feel so real?)

255
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,020
(Maybe I am dreaming.)

256
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,700
(I dream that he secretly kisses me.)

257
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,940
How did I come back yesterday?

258
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,420
(The next day,)

259
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,860
(Sun Xuan discovers)

260
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,420
(that the lock on her door is broken.)

261
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,700
Everything inside was burned.

262
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,260
It looks like it was burned by fire.

263
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,180
You need to get a new one.

264
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,780
How is that possible?

265
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,260
Why?

266
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,380
Do you think I'm trying to cheat you?

267
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,660
Oh, no.

268
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,220
That's not what I meant.

269
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,300
(Sun Xuan thinks)

270
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
(many strange things
have been happening lately.)

271
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,780
(If it gets even stranger,
she'll install surveillance cameras.)

272
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,420
(She is usually)

273
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,620
(a very hard-working person.)

274
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,900
(She doesn't need anyone
to motivate her)

275
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,740
(to do well.)

276
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,420
(On this day,)

277
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,540
(she's staying behind
to work overtime alone.)

278
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,260
(Suddenly, she remembers
she has dinner plans with a friend.)

279
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,060
(So she hurries to the restaurant.)

280
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,460
Hello?

281
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm currently...

282
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,420
Right now,

283
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm number ninth in line.

284
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,740
When are you coming?

285
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,860
How can you suddenly not come?

286
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,420
I've been waiting

287
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,900
and queuing outside in the cold

288
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,660
for one hour.

289
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,740
Hello?

290
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,620
Thanks.

291
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,220
(So it's better to stay single.)

292
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,500
(Dating is too troublesome.)

293
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,220
Excuse me, miss.

294
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,540
Are you ready to order?

295
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,300
I'll have Set A.

296
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,500
Well,

297
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
we have a promotion today.

298
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,140
You can enjoy a second Set B
at half price.

299
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,300
Would you like that?

300
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,100
No,

301
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,660
thank you.

302
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,260
Miss, this bear is for you.

303
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:42,980
(Never mind.)

304
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,660
(It's nice to have it
accompany me for dinner.)

305
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,060
(AirDrop)

306
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,180
(Can we share a table?)

307
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,260
(Well, that comes out of nowhere.)

308
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,540
(Again?)

309
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,740
(I'm also alone.)

310
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,700
(This man in Sun Xuan's dreams)

311
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,060
(is standing outside the window)

312
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,180
(like a fool,)

313
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,860
(looking particularly ridiculous.)

314
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,220
Miss,

315
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,020
is there anything else you need?

316
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,620
Please add another set of cutlery.

317
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,020
(This man is sitting opposite her)

318
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,500
(quietly,)

319
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,380
(not saying a word.)

320
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,380
If you're not ordering,

321
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,900
I'll get the check first.

322
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,540
Excuse me.

323
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,020
Yes, miss.

324
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,220
Get me the check, please.

325
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
This gentleman
has already paid for this table.

326
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,020
Hello?

327
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,380
I've already had dinner.

328
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Okay, we'll meet some other day.

329
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,020
Bye-bye.

330
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,700
(He left without saying goodbye.)

331
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,100
(He didn't even eat)

332
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,180
(and paid for dinner.)

333
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,780
(What a strange guy.)

334
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,140
(But...)

335
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,740
(he's pretty good-looking.)
