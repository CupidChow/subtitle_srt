4
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,460
Do you want to go back and sleep first?

5
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,020
Okay.

6
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,620
Even if it's just for a few days.

7
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,620
(If you want
to be with me, just say it.)

8
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,140
(What do you mean
by just for a few days?)

9
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,020
(Why can't he
be straightforward with me?)

10
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,940
Hello.

11
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,500
Team Leader?

12
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,940
Hello.

13
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,580
Sir.

14
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,660
Feng.

15
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,740
How is it?

16
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,220
Any progress with the manuscript?

17
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,660
I think

18
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,660
it's going quite smoothly.

19
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,500
Is it really?

20
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,020
That's great.

21
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,580
So,

22
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,780
when can she submit the manuscript?

23
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,780
Submit the manuscript?

24
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,420
Three...

25
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,500
Three days?

26
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,820
Three days?

27
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,500
Three days is great.

28
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,180
Feng.

29
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,260
You are so capable.

30
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,500
You are amazing.

31
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,940
Can you let me take a sip?

32
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,460
No.

33
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,700
S... Sir.

34
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,660
I have things to do.

35
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,260
I have to hang up now.

36
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,180
Hello?

37
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,500
Feng.

38
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,500
Feng.

39
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,740
Just a sip.

40
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,220
Let go.

41
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,060
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,660
You were just out of my sight
for two minutes,

43
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,220
and you were already causing trouble.

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,140
Let's go.

45
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,500
(Maybe,)

46
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,220
(I'll give him another chance.)

47
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,340
Okay.

48
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,980
Thank you.

49
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,900
You are so unbelievable.

50
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
You stir up trouble

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,940
as soon as I lose sight of you.

52
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,660
It's grape flavored.

53
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,540
(I can't believe this.)

54
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,980
(Turning a silly guy into a smart one
is no walk in the park.)

55
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,300
Let me pick it up for you.

56
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,260
Why were you so careless?

57
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,740
Have we met before?

58
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,420
Did you go there for high school?

59
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,300
What a coincidence.

60
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,420
(You scoundrel.)

61
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,500
You've changed.

62
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,740
You weren't like this in the past.

63
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,540
Really?

64
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,940
I'm sitting there. Where do you sit?

65
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,220
It's grape flavored.

66
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,740
(It's grape flavored?)

67
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,020
(It's too late now.)

68
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,820
Are we going to leave

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
upon the lady boss's return?

70
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,540
(He's asking the same thing again.)

71
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I heard

72
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
that there is a really fun
water park nearby.

73
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,060
We should check it out.

74
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,540
Stop changing the topic.

75
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,460
(Who's changing the topic now?)

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,180
Feng Tianlan.

77
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,820
Did you have a girlfriend

78
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,540
in the past?

79
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,820
I did.

80
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,420
I had a girlfriend before.

81
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,540
How long did it last?

82
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,500
A week.

83
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,060
A week?

84
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,140
Did you even hold her hand?

85
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,300
No.

86
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,180
What is the meaning of that?

87
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,260
Nothing.

88
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,580
No.

89
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,540
Stop changing the topic.

90
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,420
Are we going to leave anytime soon?

91
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,300
Give me some time to consider.

92
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,580
What about you?

93
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,420
Of course I'll go back with you.

94
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,980
And then?

95
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,180
Then,

96
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,940
I'll hand in the manuscript first.

97
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,140
The manuscript?

98
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,140
That blasted manuscript.

99
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,740
Is the manuscript so important to you?

100
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,500
Not really.

101
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,420
Not really.

102
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,740
Actually, I've figured

103
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,660
something out lately

104
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,340
after having this fun trip with you.

105
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,500
In the past,
I had lived a very passive life.

106
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,540
This bucket list

107
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,140
has given me goals

108
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,020
and the courage to go on.

109
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,500
These goals

110
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,260
have opened up more opportunities for me

111
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,940
to break through my limit.

112
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,700
That's why I'm doing these things.

113
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,740
Including working as your editor.

114
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,020
So, I'm your limit.

115
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,780
What did last night

116
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,140
mean to you?

117
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,220
About last night...

118
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,980
Forget it.

119
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,820
(I just want him)

120
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,460
(to tell me that he likes me.)

121
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,500
(Why is it so hard for him
to say it out loud?)

122
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,460
(What happened?)

123
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,940
(We were fine)

124
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,660
(this morning.)

125
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,220
(I must have said)

126
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,740
(something wrong again.)

127
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,580
Should we...

128
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,620
Should we leave

129
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,420
early in the morning

130
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,260
tomorrow?

131
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,940
Feng Tianlan.

132
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,140
Say something.

133
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,540
Look. There's an island over there.

134
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,180
I see that already.

135
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,260
Feng Tianlan.

136
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,260
Now, I owe you

137
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,100
one last story.

138
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,540
You know why I'm working

139
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,420
at this company.

140
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,820
Actually, after this book is published,

141
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,180
Putao,

142
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,220
I want to start a new life.

143
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,180
Enough. Say no more.

144
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,620
I know.

145
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,940
I think it's good enough right now.

146
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,580
I...

147
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
I'm not done talking yet.

148
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,380
Ever since I met you,

149
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,900
I've realized

150
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,180
that I can let go of my past
if I want to.

151
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,900
But I just want

152
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,420
to start a new life.

153
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,740
Not

154
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,260
as the author and the editor.

155
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,220
I just want to ask you

156
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,060
if you are willing to be with me.

157
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,420
Feng Tianlan.

158
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,820
You've been working on this speech

159
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,860
for so long.

160
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,780
Why can't you just say it to her?

161
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,020
(Sometimes,)

162
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,740
(that's how people are.)

163
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,180
(Once you miss your chance,)

164
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,860
(you won't get a second one.)

165
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,700
(I sent her a lot of messages.)

166
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,460
(But she didn't reply to me.)

167
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,900
Putao.

168
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,340
It's me.

169
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
I cooked meat for you.

170
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,860
Come out and eat it.

171
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,180
Putao.

172
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,380
(I think)

173
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,860
(she'll never forgive me.)

174
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,380
Feng.

175
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,140
Putao asked you to take the car back.

176
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,740
She'll go back to Beijing on her own.

177
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,660
Okay, miss.

178
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,380
I got it.

179
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,020
Goodbye.

180
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,540
Take care.

181
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,260
(Just like that,)

182
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
(I returned to Beijing.)

183
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,820
- Did I...
- What should I eat?

184
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,220
Did I put too much gel on my hair?

185
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Why aren't you replying to my question?

186
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,700
Sir.

187
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,620
How dare you come back!

188
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,940
Give Wang Putao back to me!

189
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,340
What are you doing?

190
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,380
What are you doing?

191
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,100
What are you doing?

192
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,220
Don't attack him.

193
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,220
Sit down.

194
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,180
Calm down.

195
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,260
Drink some water.

196
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,900
What happened?

197
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,180
Stop looking.

198
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,820
Just leave.

199
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,300
No matter

200
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,060
what Wang Putao writes,
I'll publish it for her.

201
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,140
(After returning to Beijing,)

202
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,580
(I call her every day,)

203
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,740
(but she never answers my calls.)

204
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,100
(Ten days later)

205
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,260
He is quite scary.

206
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,780
Ever since Ms. Wang
published her last book,

207
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,100
we haven't seen any editor
who could make it back in one piece.

208
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,740
Why did Feng come back alone?

209
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,660
Do you miss Ms. Wang?

210
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,020
- Sir.
- Sir.

211
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,180
Your...

212
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,700
Your right eyelid is twitching so much

213
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,220
as if it were electrified.

214
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,420
I have a bad feeling about this.

215
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,380
Look at him.

216
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,020
It's normal to lose contact
with Ms. Wang,

217
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,580
but...

218
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
It really feels different this time.

219
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,260
That's right.

220
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,100
The undercurrents flow

221
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,820
beneath the deceptively calm ocean.

222
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,620
Sir.

223
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,500
Feng.

224
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,260
Where are you going?

225
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,020
The printing house.

226
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,980
The sample book is out.

227
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,700
Okay.

228
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,060
Go ahead.

229
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,820
You can just get off work from there.

230
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,220
Okay.

231
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,700
I'll get going now.

232
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,060
Wait.

233
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,060
Still...

234
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,780
no news from her?

235
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,300
No.

236
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,940
First review,
second review, final review.

237
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,380
Manuscript submission,
typesetting, proofreading.

238
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,940
Confirmation,
quality inspection, page proof,

239
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,860
printing, and sample book.

240
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,980
It has been ten days.

241
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,100
But

242
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,340
not even a peep from her?

243
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,220
Fine.

244
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,940
You are really calm and collected.

245
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,020
You can go now.

246
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,740
I'll get going now.

247
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,940
Don't you think

248
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
that he's different
from what he was on day one?

249
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,540
He has changed completely.

250
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,500
Gosh.

251
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,700
He must have suffered a lot.

252
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,220
Luckily, it was not me.

253
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,460
(Wang Putao sent the last story)

254
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,420
(to the team leader.)

255
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,420
(Maybe)

256
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,260
(she really doesn't want
to see me anymore.)

257
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,540
(Marvel in the Fable)

258
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,220
(The last story in this book)

259
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,580
(is called "The Last Secret.")

260
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,260
(It's about a girl who has always
been competitive since she was young.)

261
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,500
(Xi.)

262
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,460
(No matter how many times she falls,)

263
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,500
(she always
stands back up courageously.)

264
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,620
Coach.

265
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,820
I've been training for two years.

266
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,620
I can learn that technique now, right?

267
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,500
(She learned kickboxing for two years)

268
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,420
(just to learn the ultimate skill
from her coach.)

269
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,220
(Because the fire of revenge)

270
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,860
(burns deep in her heart.)

271
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,260
(After she learns
the ultimate skill from her coach,)

272
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,060
(she'll go back
and beat up her ex-husband.)

273
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,900
(The scoundrel who once)

274
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,500
(abused her.)

275
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
(I think this is the most placid)

276
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,540
(but soul-stirring story)

277
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
(in this book by Wang Putao.)

278
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,340
(I don't know which stories)

279
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,020
(are real)

280
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,620
(and which are fake.)

281
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,500
(But it makes me realize)

282
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,900
(that I don't really know her at all.)

283
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,900
(When I recall the time
that we had gone through,)

284
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,740
(I thought
that finishing this manuscript)

285
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,500
(would fulfill my promise to Haibei.)

286
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,740
(But now that I've done it,)

287
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
(I feel a sense of loss.)

288
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,620
(I suddenly feel)

289
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,620
(that I've lost the only connection)

290
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,500
(to Wang Putao.)

291
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,420
Do you want to eat it?

292
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,380
You stole them!

293
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
Are you insane?

294
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,940
Why are you still following me around
if I'm insane?

295
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,260
Can you cook?

296
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,380
Yes.

297
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,700
(Thinking about this journey
that we had gone through,)

298
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,420
(we started from misunderstanding
each other)

299
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,420
(to getting familiar with each other.)

300
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,660
(I've fallen in love)

301
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,900
(with a life with her in it.)

302
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,300
(It's fated)

303
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,900
(that every person)

304
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,420
(and every story)

305
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,500
(has their own direction and meaning.)

306
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,180
(I failed to make it.)

307
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,820
(I just happened to find her.)

308
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,180
(Don't do something
in the spur of the moment)

309
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,900
(if you can't maintain it forever.)

310
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,460
(But I don't know)

311
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,700
(if I still have the chance
to do that now.)

312
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,340
Wang Putao.

313
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,380
You are punishing me, right?

314
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,740
Hello.

315
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,540
Hello.

316
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,420
I'm from the FlashEx.

317
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,100
Are you Mr. Feng Tianlan?

318
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,340
Yes. It's me.

319
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,260
There's a parcel for you.

320
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,900
But I can't find you at your company.

321
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,820
Hello. This way.

322
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,820
Here's your parcel.

323
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,500
Okay. Thank you.

324
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:48,340
