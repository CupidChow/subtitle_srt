=My Marvellous Fable=

2
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,860
(Fifty hours)

3
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,500
(after meeting Ms. Wang,)

4
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,580
(we finally set off on our way
back to Qionghai to pay respects.)

5
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,140
(But the strange thing)

6
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,460
(is Ms. Wang)

7
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,580
(doesn't look sad at all.)

8
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
What does the company say?

9
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,100
According to the contract,

10
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,140
the suspense novel is supposed
to be finalized by next month.

11
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,340
I haven't written a single word.

12
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,300
Ms. Wang,

13
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,020
that's what happened.

14
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,500
I think

15
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,900
the job is very meaningful.

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,900
Meaningful? How is it meaningful?

17
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,380
According to them,

18
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,220
I should be able to finalize the novel
by tomorrow.

19
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm only
a few hundred thousand words away.

20
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,620
Ms. Wang,

21
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,740
it seems like you know
what they want clearly.

22
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,060
That's great. Let's start.

23
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,500
Start? How?

24
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,060
How?

25
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,780
Start...

26
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,825
(Recording)

27
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,300
(And so,)

28
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,300
(Ms. Wang finally tells me)

29
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,580
(the first story,)

30
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,380
(Duet.)

31
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,475
(Chapter One: Duet)

32
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,060
(Another sunny day.)

33
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,140
(In the cluttered room,)

34
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,660
(the alarm)

35
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,860
(woke Lu Ziyun up.)

36
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,460
(Duet, Lu Ziyun)
(She is following an influencer,)

37
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,820
(Mengmeng.)

38
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,900
(Drink Oxygen Forest,)

39
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,340
(Mengmeng)
(and start your new life.)

40
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,860
(In today's video...)

41
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,380
(She is showing off
her luxurious life again.)

42
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,060
(I'd like to share with you
my newly purchased)

43
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,780
(penthouse.)

44
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,980
(I just renovated it.)

45
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,424
(It cost me about...)

46
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,020
(Lu Ziyun wants a life like this too.)

47
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,140
(She takes a look at the horoscope.)

48
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,300
(Today, your lucky color is red.)

49
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,900
(Another lucky day,)

50
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,900
(she thought.)

51
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,660
(She hopes her blind date will go well.)

52
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,020
Can you introduce me
to someone trustworthy?

53
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,140
You told me the guy I met
is 30 years old.

54
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,260
I think he is at least 50.

55
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,300
Miss Lu,

56
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,060
I'm doing

57
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,620
as you told me.

58
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,300
I've been a matchmaking agent for years.

59
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
To be honest,

60
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,460
the man's capability

61
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,780
is what matters the most.

62
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,780
He is 50 years old.

63
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,060
What else is he capable of?

64
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,980
According to the information,

65
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,820
he is 31 years old.

66
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,300
Fine.

67
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,980
Even if he is 31 years old,

68
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,620
he can at least act like a gentleman.

69
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,340
I paid for the meal.

70
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,100
He said he would pay me back.

71
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,660
And then,

72
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,860
he blocked me right away.

73
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,580
Miss Lu,

74
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,140
let me tell you something.

75
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
(The passerby's sarcastic laugh)

76
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,820
(made Lu Ziyun furious.)

77
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,580
(However, she is convinced)

78
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,780
(by the customer service personnel
once again.)

79
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,620
You just have to pay

80
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,020
another 59,999.

81
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,340
Then, you can be upgraded
from a Diamond member

82
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,260
to a Star member.

83
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,540
Liars!

84
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,875
(Star member)

85
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,180
(She topped up to a Star member)

86
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,780
(and went for
more high-end matchmaking.)

87
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,060
(If I hadn't upgraded to Star member,)

88
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,980
(I would've never stepped into
this restaurant for the rest of my life.)

89
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:01,300
(Couples' set menu)

90
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,540
(Is the price)

91
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,700
(in RMB?)

92
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,460
(Set for one: 1,058 yuan)

93
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,220
(It'll cost me one month's salary.)

94
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,780
(All my salary is gone now.)

95
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,060
(Didn't we say to meet at 8 PM?)

96
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,100
(Is that person trustworthy?)

97
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,580
What?

98
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,540
(Mengmeng)
(Hello,)

99
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,580
(my dear fans.)

100
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,260
(Today,)

101
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,420
(we have a mission,)

102
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,980
(which is how to complete
the shopping challenge)

103
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,580
(in a day.)

104
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,500
(So jealous of her.)

105
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,660
(When can I be like her?)

106
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,125
(You have a new message.)

107
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,700
Today, you'll have a surprise.

108
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,340
Oh, no!

109
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,020
Now I can't get a refund for the dress.

110
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,060
Hello?

111
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,660
Hello, Miss Ziyun.

112
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,580
Well...

113
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,980
The Star member
that you are meeting today

114
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,420
bumped into his ex-girlfriend,

115
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,180
and they got back together.

116
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,580
You...

117
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,780
What's your point
of telling me a lie like this?

118
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,740
I want a refund!

119
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,100
Surprise?

120
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,620
This is more like a jump scare.

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,940
I don't think I'm ordering food.

122
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,700
I have something to attend to.

123
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,380
Miss,

124
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,420
I'm not here to take your order.

125
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,540
Today,

126
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,660
we have a special event.

127
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,460
Today is the tenth anniversary
of our restaurant.

128
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,940
You are sitting at Table Ten.

129
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,140
We'll serve you a Set Ten meal

130
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,980
for free.

131
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,060
Please wait for a moment.

132
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,860
A Set Ten meal.

133
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,580
What is it?

134
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,540
(It's the same water,)

135
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,260
(but in the wine glass,)

136
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,380
(it looks premium.)

137
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,250
(Duet, Mengmeng)

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,860
(It's her.)

139
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,340
(This is so unfair.)

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
(She has such a pretty face,)

141
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,540
(a sexy body,)

142
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,420
(and incredibly good luck.)

143
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,180
(I hope I can have her life.)

144
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,740
(I bet I'll be much happier than now.)

145
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,740
(Do you want to have
an experience like never before?)

146
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,900
(Do you want a new life?)

147
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,420
(Now, all you need to do
is upload your profile picture)

148
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,060
(and basic information)

149
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,100
(to the application)

150
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,500
(Exchange)
(and click Exchange.)

151
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,700
(You'll get to experience
a fantasy journey like never before.)

152
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,660
What the heck?

153
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,740
(The first exchange is free!)

154
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,660
(Do you want to experience
a different life?)

155
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,620
(It's free.)

156
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,020
(It's the same water,)

157
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,620
(but in the wine glass,)

158
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,860
(it looks premium.)

159
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,580
(Click "Exchange".)

160
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,775
(Exchange)

161
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:39,475
(Set for one: 1,058 yuan)

162
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,540
What's wrong?

163
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,100
Don't like the steak?

164
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,900
Today is our first anniversary.

165
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,060
I remember.

166
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,260
This is for you.

167
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,500
I was just in the mood
of creating a story.

168
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,420
You are distracting me.

169
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm sorry, Ms. Wang.

170
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,500
I'll put it here.

171
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,460
Sorry.

172
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,660
Whatever. I'm not in the mood now.

173
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,340
Don't, Ms. Wang.

174
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,700
It's my bad.

175
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,220
I'll be more careful next time.

176
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,980
Okay?

177
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,380
Well, you are quite good
at admitting mistakes.

178
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,780
Oh, Ms. Wang.

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,700
I just wanted to ask

180
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,460
if you always went on blind dates.

181
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,980
Why do you ask?

182
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,100
I feel like you know a lot

183
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,940
about this.

184
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,740
Not only writers

185
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,580
but many people
will put their life experience

186
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,740
into their creative works.

187
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,740
For example...

188
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,060
Filmmaker, Pedro Almodóvar.

189
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,660
Ms. Wang, do you know

190
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,860
I'm a big fan of him?

191
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,660
His movie,

192
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,580
All About My Mother,

193
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,180
is my favorite.

194
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,780
I think his film
has a weight and reality.

195
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,260
Also,

196
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,900
Wong Kar-wai's observation
of Hong Kong, China,

197
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,500
is extremely good.

198
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,860
Chungking Express is incredible.

199
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,420
So, Ms. Wang,

200
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,380
do you always substitute yourself
into the narrative

201
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,220
while you are creating a work?

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,020
That makes it so much more realistic.

203
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,940
Do you still want the story?

204
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:25,940
Sorry.

205
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,380
I'll keep quiet.

206
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,460
This is a warning.

207
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,860
Don't interrupt me again.

208
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:49,700
(Recording)

209
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,140
Your hand.

210
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:02,980
Do you like it?

211
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,620
(What is going on?)

212
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,580
(Isn't that me?)

213
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,380
Mengmeng.

214
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,620
Mengmeng.

215
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,020
Are you done?

216
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,620
Yes.

217
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,420
Let's pay the bill and go home.

218
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:24,700
Okay.

219
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,220
Let's go.

220
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:34,200
(First night)

221
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,700
Okay.

222
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,580
Wait for me.

223
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,260
I'm coming down.

224
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,660
Mengmeng.

225
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,020
Where is my melatonin?

226
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,420
I want to have it on the way.

227
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,340
Are you leaving today?

228
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,580
Yeah, I'm going to Shanghai.

229
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,620
A regular client
wants to amend his will.

230
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,940
My dad couldn't make it.
So I have to go.

231
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,460
So you're a lawyer.

232
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,420
Melatonin. Yes.

233
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,060
What's wrong?

234
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,140
I didn't spend time with you last night

235
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,940
and you're upset now?

236
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,140
How about this?

237
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,580
Didn't we agree on that?

238
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,900
I'll go to Shanghai tomorrow,

239
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,940
and I'll get you the watch
that you've always wanted.

240
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,460
Okay?

241
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,060
Don't be upset.

242
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,060
Come on. Cheer up.

243
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,580
Cheer up.

244
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
(Seriously?)

245
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,860
(A ring and a watch.)

246
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,100
(She is living the best of her life.)

247
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:19,860
Cheer up,

248
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,580
okay?

249
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,020
Hello?

250
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,700
Wait for me downstairs,

251
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,180
okay?

252
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm coming down soon.

253
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,260
Well, I'll leave first.

254
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,860
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

255
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,580
I have something

256
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
to take care of.

257
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,100
Wait for me at home.

258
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,740
I'll leave now.

259
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,180
Bye.

260
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,140
(Lu Ziyun, who has just switched bodies
with Mengmeng,)

261
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,860
(can't wait)

262
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,860
(to start enjoying
Mengmeng's luxurious life.)

263
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,460
(But)

264
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,580
(Mengmeng, who got replaced,)

265
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,620
(never went to see her.)

266
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,020
(Until...)

267
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,420
No big deal. We can get our stuff first,

268
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
then we can eat later.

269
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Consider it as dieting.

270
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,460
(But soon,)

271
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,580
(she leaves it behind.)

272
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,540
(The one who owns the body)

273
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,740
(is her, Lu Ziyun.)

274
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,380
Wangcai?
[*often used as a name for dogs]

275
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,540
Who calls themselves by such a name?

276
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,340
Hello?

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,180
What's wrong with you, Mengmeng?

278
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,220
You haven't uploaded
any new videos recently,

279
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,580
and you are not doing any live streams.

280
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,980
Do you still want the job

281
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,100
or not?

282
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,220
Who is this speaking?

283
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,140
You are pretending
to lose your memory, huh?

284
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,340
Did you forget about the money
that you owe me?

285
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,740
Bear in mind

286
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,140
how you got everything you have now.

287
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,540
You'd better deposit
at least ten million

288
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,420
for me next month.

289
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,620
Otherwise,

290
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,260
I'm going to expose

291
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,460
all the dirt you've done.

292
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,425
(Second night)

293
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,580
Do you want water?

294
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,780
Hubby.

295
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,180
Baby.

296
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,260
How have you been?

297
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,540
I missed you!

298
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,500
What took you so long?

299
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,340
You lost weight.

300
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,060
Who are you?

301
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,700
I'm kidding!

302
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:19,780
Honey,

303
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,380
then I'll play my games.

304
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,060
Yes, sure.

305
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,900
Come on.

306
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,580
How is it?

307
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,220
Did you pass?

308
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,100
I'm a pro player.

309
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,380
Be nice to me.

310
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,060
You guys have fun.

311
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,540
I'll make you some food.

312
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,140
Carry on.

313
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,100
Go on.

314
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,020
Don't mind me.

315
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,383
(Mother-in-law)

316
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
Mengmeng.

317
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,700
Every time I see you,

318
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,980
it reminds me

319
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
of my good old days in France.

320
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,540
Back then,

321
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,780
I was 19.

322
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,180
I woke up at noon,

323
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,140
went to a cafe with my friends,

324
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,700
and we would chat

325
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,900
or stare at the clouds.

326
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,180
Doing nothing,

327
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,060
and we called it a day.

328
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,220
(What is this old witch talking about?)

329
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,180
Someone was gossiping with my dad.

330
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,020
They said I was mooching off
my family in France.

331
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,780
Guess what my dad said?

332
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,540
He said I'm spending my father's money.

333
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,860
So nothing's wrong with that.

334
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,460
Back then, I felt ashamed.

335
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,780
Unlike you guys,

336
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,660
you have no problem
spending others' money.

337
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,500
Look.

338
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,860
You're enjoying life.

339
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Mengmeng,

340
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,380
you must have suffered during childhood.

341
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,060
(Childhood?)

342
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,900
That's why
you are such an understanding adult.

343
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,060
Do you feel bad
that I buy you so much tonic?

344
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,940
Is that why you're not taking it?

345
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,580
All right.

346
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,620
Wake up from the nightmare.

347
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,380
You've succeeded.

348
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,420
These are for you.

349
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,260
Eat them.

350
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,460
It's noon already.

351
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,140
Where is the tonic?

352
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,620
Why didn't you bring it with you?

353
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,340
Tonic?

354
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,580
What tonic?

355
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,660
It's been two years.

356
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,580
Our neighbor's daughter-in-law

357
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,620
got married at the same time as you,

358
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,780
and they have two children already.

359
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,700
They are taking the same medicine.

360
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,540
She is doing so well.

361
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,180
Something is wrong
with the way you take the tonic.

362
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,420
Show me.
How do you usually take the tonic?

363
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,260
Hey.

364
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,700
Oh, right.

365
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,100
The market
has been doing very well recently.

366
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,260
Did your mother earn it back?

367
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,780
We had a deal.

368
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,580
The five million that she borrowed

369
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,060
was an advance
for my grandchild's lucky money.

370
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,700
And your brother.

371
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,580
What a business genius!

372
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,660
Shall we

373
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,580
ask him to start a class

374
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,500
for MBA students?

375
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,540
How could the restaurants he owned

376
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,580
lose profit that is similar

377
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,060
to a public company?

378
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,380
We've got an update from the prison.

379
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,580
If we were to talk about commutation,

380
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,140
your father is not qualified.

381
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Last night,

382
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,860
did you sleep together?

383
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,180
No.

384
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,100
He spent the night

385
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,620
playing games with his friend.

386
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,020
He would rather play games
than sleep with you.

387
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,460
Ask yourself.

388
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,900
What have you contributed
since you joined our family?

389
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,540
Why can't you get pregnant?

390
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,580
(My mother is in debt,
my brother has lost money,)

391
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,500
(and my father is in jail.)

392
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,500
Oh my.

393
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,140
This is so bitter.

394
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,020
Mengmeng,

395
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,660
I have done what I could.

396
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm not giving it to you.

397
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,780
See if you can have more.

398
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,620
See if you can win.

399
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,380
Bang!

400
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,025
(Emergency. Let's meet.)

401
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,725
(Third night)

402
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,500
Well...

403
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I think you know everything now.

404
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,500
About what?

405
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,060
You know this is what my life
looks like.

406
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,460
I've been financially struggling,

407
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,900
especially recently.

408
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,220
The guy that keeps calling you.

409
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,980
I was swindled by him.

410
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,580
He told me

411
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,620
as long as I do a good job
of flaunting wealth,

412
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,580
I can cash out indefinitely
with no limits.

413
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,460
I believed him.

414
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,180
And I bought a lot of useless stuff.

415
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,780
Not only did I spend all my money,

416
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,380
but I also owe
the company a lot of money.

417
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,180
So,

418
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,780
why did you want to see me today?

419
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,100
Tomorrow is my only chance.

420
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,340
I've been putting in a lot of effort

421
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,740
for the live stream.

422
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,500
I even got different teams

423
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,620
to advise and plan for me.

424
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,340
If I succeed,

425
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,940
not only can I earn a fortune,

426
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,060
but I can also pay off my debt.

427
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,500
The platform is going to support me too.

428
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,060
But what does it have to do with me?

429
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,860
I can give you some money.

430
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,980
I can give you anything you want.

431
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,900
Just help me with the live

432
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,660
tomorrow.

433
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,460
I can give you anything you want.

434
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,340
Even...

435
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,020
Your husband?

436
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,340
I don't want him.

437
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,180
Please.

438
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm begging you.

439
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,340
Just one day.

440
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,460
One day.

441
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,660
Fine.

442
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,780
But I want one million when it's done.

443
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,060
Okay.

444
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,060
One million.

445
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,060
Deal.

446
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,140
Okay.

447
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,380
Mengmeng.

448
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
This time, our selection

449
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,060
will definitely be ranked in the top 50.

450
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,460
Look at this snack.

451
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,860
Lowest price online!

452
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,500
(Mengmeng's Live)
And the sparkling water,

453
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,220
it's amazing.

454
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:24,940
Mengmeng,

455
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,580
keep this price in mind.

456
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,540
Today is 15 yuan.

457
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,700
15 yuan. Do not go higher than this.

458
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,140
My dear friends,

459
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,060
the devil is coming!

460
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,700
We are offering
the lowest price online for this snack.

461
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,220
The live stream next door
is selling for 99 yuan.

462
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,380
Here? We are offering
the lowest price online.

463
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,860
Listen carefully.

464
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,260
Only 49 yuan!

465
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,580
49 yuan!

466
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,060
The supplier
is right in front of us right now.

467
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,580
We'll adjust the price on the spot.

468
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,580
We'll adjust the price on the spot.

469
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,500
30 yuan.

470
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,740
Can we do 30 yuan?

471
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,060
We can't do 30 yuan.

472
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,740
We can't do that.

473
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,020
We'll earn nothing.

474
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,460
I don't care!

475
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,500
This is for my dear fans.

476
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,980
I want to give them the best.

477
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,020
I want to give them the lowest price!

478
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,500
15 yuan a set. Deal?

479
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,020
15 yuan is even cheaper, Mengmeng.

480
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,420
That means you have to make up for it.

481
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,020
Is that the lowest we can go?

482
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,780
Yes.

483
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,900
That's the lowest, Mengmeng.

484
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,780
All right.

485
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,660
I...

486
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,780
I'll subsidize 15 yuan.

487
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
15 yuan a set.

488
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,380
Hurry up and give me the link.

489
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Three, two, one.

490
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,900
Here's the link!

491
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,525

492
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,325
(Sales)

493
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,340
Mengmeng.

494
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,580
One million sets! All sold out!

495
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,780
Thank you, my dear fans!

496
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,420
To repay the love of my dear fans,

497
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,140
I'll stick with you to the end today.

498
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,700
I want another million sets!

499
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,660
Kill me!

500
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,460
This is the lowest price we can offer.

501
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,180
I don't care!

502
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,980
In my live stream, my dear fans

503
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,020
can get the goods

504
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,220
at the lowest price online.

505
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,260
It's now or never!

506
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,020
Mengmeng, we can't do that.

507
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,100
Our supplier is leaving now.

508
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,140
He is leaving.

509
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,380
I can't do that.

510
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,860
Hurry up!

511
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,460
Lowest price online!

512
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
It can't get any lower.

513
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,940
It's now or never!

514
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,180
Hurry up.

515
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,740
Three, two, one.

516
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,220
Here's the link!

517
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,060
(Mengmeng.)

518
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,940
(Record-breaking)
(One million sets sold out in seconds!)

519
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,180
(You have to subsidize the cost.)

520
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,900
(I want the lowest price online)

521
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
(in my live stream!)

522
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,060
(Add another million sets.)

523
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,660
(Here's the link.)

524
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,980
(Congratulations, Mengmeng)

525
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,380
Mengmeng.

526
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,100
The live stream went great.

527
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,100
We have reached an agreement
with the platform.

528
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,180
They will give us

529
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,900
more resources in the next six months.

530
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,060
But

531
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,460
they would like to revise

532
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,740
the commission split.

533
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,380
After all,

534
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,740
we are a big business now.

535
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,700
We are not the small business
that we used to be.

536
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:19,940
Look.

537
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,140
This is the negotiated commission split.

538
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,820
Have a look.

539
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,420
20/80.

540
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,580
What do you think?

541
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,300
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

542
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,140
Generous?

543
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,380
Right.

544
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
I'll do my best.

545
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:47,150
(Fourth night)

546
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:02,225
(Sales report)

547
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,580
(Dear Lu Ziyun,)

548
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,940
(your exchange experience)

549
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,380
(will be terminated in 24 hours.)

550
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,180
(If you've registered
for permanent mode,)

551
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,340
(kindly ignore it.)

552
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,660
(Kindly ignore.)

553
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,700
(Kindly ignore.)

554
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,580
(Kindly ignore.)

555
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,580
(Kindly ignore.)

556
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,220
Mengmeng.

557
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,540
I've arranged

558
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,620
the next live stream for you.

559
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,940
Don't worry.

560
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,460
The management
is satisfied with your performance.

561
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,060
They are giving us more resources.

562
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,180
(So, that's it.)

563
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,500
(In the end, it's all thanks to me.)

564
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,780
(She's been an influencer for so long.)

565
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,060
(But I sold much more goods
than she did.)

566
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,020
(She doesn't deserve all these.)

567
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:21,375
(Fifth night)

568
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,020
(What would happen next?)

569
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,140
(Am I)

570
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
(going back to my own body soon?)

571
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,020
(No.)

572
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,340
(I don't want to.)

573
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,980
(The only difference
between Mengmeng and me is our bodies.)

574
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,500
(She is incapable and stupid.)

575
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,220
(How could she enjoy such a life?)

576
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:09,106
(Dear Lu Ziyun.
Please choose a renewal plan.)

577
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:10,250
(More plan)

578
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:17,200

579
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,200

584
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,660
(Please wait patiently.)

585
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,225
(Permanent exchange request
is being verified.)

586
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:07,825
(Loading)

587
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,575

588
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,060
(Dear Wang Mengmeng,)

589
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,500
(congratulations on activating
the permanent exchange service.)

590
