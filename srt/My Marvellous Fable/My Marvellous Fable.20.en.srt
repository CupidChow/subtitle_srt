=Episode 20=

4
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,820
I'll light it first.

5
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,460
Do you even know how to do it?

6
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,700
Not really.

7
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,580
You never played this before?

8
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,580
Will it burn my hand?

9
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,460
You scared me.

10
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,300
You're actually afraid of sparklers?

11
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,700
This is how you play it.

12
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
Are we conducting an orchestra here?

13
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,820
How is the team?

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,780
I don't know.

15
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,980
I didn't pay attention to them.

16
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,540
Didn't you go to work?

17
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,260
I did.

18
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,700
However,

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,340
the only thing on my mind was...

20
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,540
Was it me?

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,340
I... I was trying to find you.

22
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,580
I see.

23
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,020
I met Luna too.

24
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,060
Oh.

25
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,420
Oh?

26
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,020
Oh?

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,500
Do you think that explains everything?

28
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,740
Yeah.

29
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,180
Oh means oh.

30
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,540
It doesn't have any meaning to it.

31
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,740
Don't do this again.

32
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,900
I was just worried about you.

33
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,980
You were worried about me?

34
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,020
If you were worried about me,

35
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,020
you wouldn't have left
without saying a word.

36
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,340
You're not a criminal.

37
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,780
How could you

38
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,860
vanish

39
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,220
without saying a word?

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,260
I didn't vanish.

41
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,100
You said nothing,

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,820
and you became unreachable.
That's called vanishing.

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,780
You're getting ahead of yourself, huh?

44
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,500
You'd do the same if you went through

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
what I went through.

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,180
I was worried about you

47
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,340
and your novel.

48
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:57,940
The team

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,500
was acting suspiciously too.

50
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,020
That's because you kept urging me
for the manuscripts all day long.

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,260
Is there nothing else between us

52
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,980
besides the manuscripts?

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,580
Didn't I tell you already?

54
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,060
The manuscripts don't matter.

55
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,380
The manuscripts don't matter?

56
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,340
Are you sure they don't?

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,260
I'm finally free!

58
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,140
But now,

59
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
the manuscripts have
a different meaning to me.

60
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
What's the difference?

61
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,260
In the past, urging you

62
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,700
for the manuscripts was my task.

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,060
Sometimes, I get stressed out.

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,620
What about now?

65
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,820
At least I can spend time with you

66
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,460
when I urge you for the manuscripts now.

67
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,060
Looks like you've recovered
from your illness.

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,700
Illness?

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,420
It's nothing.

70
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,780
Tell me.

71
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,740
What illness did you mean?

72
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,260
Feng Tianlan,

73
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,620
do you like me?

74
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,540
I do.

75
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,700
Tianlan,

76
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,300
have you found Ms. Wang?

77
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,220
I have.

78
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,180
How is she doing then?

79
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,220
She...

80
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,020
She's doing well.

81
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,340
Good job,

82
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,780
Feng.

83
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,060
You two should catch
the last flight for today.

84
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,580
I'll tell Ziyun to pick you guys up.

85
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,060
It's pretty late now.

86
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,420
We'll return tomorrow.

87
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,420
Sir,

88
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,340
don't worry.

89
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,340
This is my personal affair.

90
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,420
I won't ask for reimbursements.

91
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,500
Alright then.

92
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,780
Okay.

93
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,340
If so, Feng,

94
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,300
ask her

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,540
if she could give me
a complete version of the sample book.

96
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,500
Sample book?

97
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm not sure about that.

98
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Let me ask her for you.

99
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,940
I'm getting annoyed here.

100
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,260
Got it.

101
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,820
He hung up.

102
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,620
Actually, I've been thinking of this

103
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,740
when I was looking for you.

104
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,580
I was wondering

105
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,020
what was on your mind.

106
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,780
So, have you figured it out?

107
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,020
Of course not.

108
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,340
But I figured it out on my own terms.

109
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,580
What do you mean?

110
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,940
I had an exhausting life in the past.

111
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,580
I was too full of myself.

112
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,660
I was pretending

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,780
so that

114
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,500
I could feel better.

115
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,180
But after I got over the people
and the things that haunted me,

116
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,260
I finally got to move forward.

117
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,060
I'm glad that you figured it out.

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,180
What about you?

119
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,580
Have you figured it out?

120
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,100
What do I need to figure out?

121
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,780
About going back.

122
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,540
I will join you.

123
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,060
Let's go home together, okay?

124
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,020
Should we...

125
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,980
What?

126
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,260
Should we proceed to the next step?

127
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,020
I won't hold back then.

128
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,700
What do you mean?

129
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,500
It's starting to get annoying.

130
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,540
So, do you two plan

131
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,260
to visit her father together?

132
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,860
Hurry up then.

133
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,100
Finish your food and leave.

134
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
Coming.

135
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,660
What are you doing here?

136
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Morning, Aunt.

137
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,220
I'm here to visit Xi.

138
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,860
Wait.

139
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,980
Listen.

140
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,700
If I'm able to run a business here,

141
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,540
that means taking care of you
is no problem at all.

142
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,020
Step inside

143
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
if you dare.

144
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,540
Let go.

145
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,340
Liang Wenkai, let go of her!

146
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,700
Xi, you're finally here.

147
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,100
Aunt wouldn't let me see you.

148
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,580
Xi.

149
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,980
Shout my name if he tries

150
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,100
to do anything funny.

151
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,020
It'll be fine.

152
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,860
Tell me.

153
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,980
What do you want?

154
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,460
I just want to apologize to you.

155
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,620
Aunt,

156
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,020
why were you guys outside?

157
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
Did something happen?

158
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,060
It's nothing.

159
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,420
You see,

160
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,620
the village is holding an event.

161
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,860
They think Putao is a cultured person.

162
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,780
They're just asking her some questions.

163
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,660
It's fine.

164
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,580
Let's return to our meal.

165
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,180
I'll take a look.

166
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,780
Come back!

167
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,380
Finish your meal.

168
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,420
Xi,

169
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,500
let's have a meal together.

170
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,660
Liang Wenkai,

171
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,820
stop pestering me.

172
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,060
I will never eat with you.

173
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,340
I'm serious.

174
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,140
I mean it.

175
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Just one last time.

176
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,580
Let's bid a proper farewell
to each other.

177
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,300
This is my hotel room key.

178
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,980
I'll wait for you.

179
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,060
See you there.

180
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,340
I'll wait for you.

181
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,100
You're back.

182
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,380
Putao,

183
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,020
I told you already.

184
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,300
You should stay out
of the village's affairs.

185
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,780
It's not like you're
the only cultured person around.

186
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,860
Am I right?

187
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,500
Yeah.

188
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,780
That's why they were
asking for my opinion.

189
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,980
I'm a writer after all.

190
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,340
That's right.

191
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,780
Tianlan,

192
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,180
why don't you go
and pack your luggage first?

193
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,580
Okay.

194
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,820
Feng, you can go.

195
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,660
I'll make a move first.

196
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,860
In my opinion, you shouldn't go there.

197
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,820
Just call the police.

198
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,900
That won't do.

199
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:28,980
Don't tell me

200
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
you're heading there alone?

201
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,020
Actually, this will happen eventually.

202
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,900
I never got past it.

203
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,780
It's time for me to face it.

204
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,420
What about Feng then?

205
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,100
When do you plan to tell him?

206
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,180
This is my own problem.

207
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,540
I hope that I can resolve it myself.

208
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,500
You're so silly.

209
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,620
Aunt,

210
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,140
this time, I no longer want to hide.

211
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,540
There's someone who can
face the music together with you.

212
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,500
Isn't that better?

213
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,700
Maybe it's for the better.

214
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
However, I don't want our relationship

215
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,580
to start in this way.

216
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,500
Putao,

217
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,060
I'm done.

218
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,860
You're done?

219
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,820
I'll send you a location later.

220
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,580
You can pick my father up first.

221
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,660
What?

222
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,660
I have something to attend to.

223
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,140
I will join you as soon as possible.

224
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,500
What's the matter?

225
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,500
You two have been acting weird.

226
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,700
Are you guys hiding something?

227
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,300
No.

228
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,940
We have nothing to hide from you.

229
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,620
Are you sure?

230
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,180
There's nothing.

231
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
I'm not hiding anything from you.

232
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,660
Wang Putao,

233
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,780
are you going to take off again?

234
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,940
No, I'm not.

235
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,700
You shouldn't have recovered this fast.

236
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,220
What?

237
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,620
What did you say?

238
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,100
I said I love you.

239
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm fond of you.

240
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,020
They're doing it again.

241
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,580
I...

242
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,500
I...

243
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,380
Don't stutter.

244
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,660
I know what you're worried about.

245
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
So, don't worry about me.

246
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,020
I won't run away this time.

247
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,460
I truly have something urgent
to attend to.

248
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,500
So, please visit my father for me,

249
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,020
will you?

250
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,020
You better return quickly, okay?

251
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,860
I'll make a move first.

252
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,140
Text me when you're there.

253
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,340
Do you think meeting your father now

254
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,860
is too sudden?

255
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,460
Not at all.

256
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,340
Okay then.

257
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,300
See you.

258
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,780
Go now.

259
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,500
(Wang Putao)
(Everyone has thought of)

260
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,060
(a scenario where their souls
leave their bodies)

261
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,980
(and lead a different life.)

262
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,500
(Feng Tianlan,)

263
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,500
(I'm not afraid of the past.)

264
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,140
(It's something more terrifying
than the past.)

265
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,580
