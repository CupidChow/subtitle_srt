=My Marvellous Fable=

2
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,820
Use your wit

3
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,860
to make Ms. Wang do the test,

4
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
not by force.

5
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,060
All the best,

6
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,020
Feng.

7
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,700
(Let her do the test?)

8
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,220
(I'm afraid she'll skin me alive)

9
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,900
(after she finishes with the test.)

10
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,940
(What should I do?)

11
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,780
Okay.

12
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,100
Thank you.

13
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,340
(The first step
in the Thirty-Six Stratagems)

14
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,940
(is doing one thing
under cover of another.)

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,660
What are you doing?

16
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,940
Wash your hands first.

17
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,140
So Mr. Feng Tianlan,

18
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,100
do you have kids?

19
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,860
I just graduated in July this year.

20
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,780
Do you know

21
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,100
what you did just now

22
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,100
resemble those of a loving mother

23
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,660
in 1990s TV dramas?

24
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,300
Do you usually portray yourself

25
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,380
as some vulnerable and innocent infant?

26
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,180
You acted like a mother
having been through hardship and suffering first.

27
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,260
Where's my fork?

28
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,660
You can eat with your hands
after washing it.

29
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,460
(Okay.)

30
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,300
(This is the moment!)

31
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,860
(Time to feign retreat
to ambush the enemy.)

32
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,260
Your hair.

33
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,620
You're crossing the line here.

34
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,940
I won't fall for this trick.

35
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,380
(This trick doesn't work either.)

36
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,020
Here.

37
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,860
You even have a hair tie.

38
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,580
Did your girlfriend ask you
to carry it with you?

39
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,620
I have seven female cousins.

40
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,860
Carrying hair ties with me
help them tie their hair

41
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,820
is my passive skill.

42
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,620
Passive skill?

43
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,100
What kind
of people-pleasing personality is this?

44
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,100
What do you mean?

45
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,100
Why are you always accommodating
in every aspect?

46
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
You're a man.

47
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
But taking out a hair tie

48
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,900
from your pocket

49
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,780
is absurd.

50
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,940
I really can't understand.

51
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,260
Have you ever refused anyone?

52
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,460
What's your bottom line,

53
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,860
Obliger Feng?

54
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,020
Obliger Feng?

55
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,940
Feng Tianlan

56
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,780
is the world's number one person
who doesn't know how to refuse.

57
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,260
Thus, "Obliger Feng."

58
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,620
Did you have any childhood trauma...

59
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,100
or something

60
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,460
that caused you
to be emotionally distressed?

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,140
(Me? Emotionally distressed?)

62
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
(You're the one
with emotional distress.)

63
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,620
By the way,

64
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,860
are you almost done eating?

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,660
Generally,

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,900
when someone says "by the way"

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,660
during a conversation,

68
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,180
it means they want to change the topic.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,180
So tell me.

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,300
What are you up to again?

71
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,340
(I'm done for.)

72
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,540
(She found out.)

73
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,380
Nothing.

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,540
It's nothing.

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,260
Ms. Wang,

76
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,860
this test is especially interesting.

77
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,380
Do you want to try it?

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,340
No.

79
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,100
I don't want to.

80
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,140
I refuse.

81
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,260
It's a scam on the Internet,

82
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,020
saying things like,

83
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,460
"A person with blood type A
is your good match."

84
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,900
or "Aquarius
is a perfect match for Gemini."

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,100
It's all suggestive.

86
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,180
We're free

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,060
and have nothing to do.

88
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,940
Let's do it for fun.

89
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,900
After all, we've been together
for so many days.

90
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,020
This test can enhance

91
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,940
our understanding of each other.

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,580
Do it.

93
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,860
What kind of test is this?

94
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,020
Just consider it as a way to relax.

95
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
"I feel depressed and frustrated."

96
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,975
(Always like this.)

97
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,540
I'm in my best mood in the morning.

98
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Does it make any difference?

99
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,425
(My constipation troubles me.)

100
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:17,898
(My heart beats faster than usual.)

101
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,664
(My mind is as clear as usual,
with no problems.)

102
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,289
(My life is meaningful.)

103
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:28,774
(Team Leader)

104
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,660
Are you rushing me for the manuscript?

105
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,540
Of course, not.

106
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,140
I'm just worried about our new recruit.

107
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,180
Feng.

108
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,340
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm here.

110
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,020
Turn off the speaker.

111
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,340
You hung up too quickly earlier.

112
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,940
I hadn't finished speaking to you.

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
I received the audio recording

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,540
of your story.

115
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,940
She said this and then that
without coherence.

116
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,660
Does she really think
we're genius editors

117
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,620
who can create something out of nothing?

118
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,420
Of course,

119
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,780
Ms. Wang is a genius.

120
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,780
It's just that we haven't understood

121
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,020
the profound meaning behind her work.

122
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,020
It's even more certain now.

123
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,140
I have just one minor question.

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,740
Please convey it to Ms. Wang.

125
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,660
How does she plan

126
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,500
to connect these stories together?

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,900
Sir,

128
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
your company has been creating content

129
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,340
for quite some time.

130
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,380
Once the stories are finished,

131
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,340
the connection between the content
will naturally be established.

132
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,980
The editors bring up
dumb questions all the time

133
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,220
and you keep mentioning

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,020
the rise of print media

135
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,620
and the artistic renaissance...

136
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:42,980
All right.

137
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,780
I'll stop here.

138
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,380
Ms. Wang,

139
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,540
you're right about everything.

140
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,820
I have a slight headache now.

141
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,500
So I'm hanging up.

142
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,140
Feng,

143
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,940
remember what I told you.

144
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,380
Okay, sir.

145
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,180
You can do it.

146
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,820
So Manuscript Pusher,

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,140
what now?

148
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,380
Ms. Wang,

149
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,300
I understand

150
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,540
we have some issues to solve.

151
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,900
Although I really want the manuscript,

152
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,140
it's not the most important issue.

153
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,340
We have many other things to solve.

154
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,180
Don't worry.

155
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,500
We'll face them together.

156
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,220
When I was very young,

157
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,820
my father

158
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,860
was bedridden for a long time.

159
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,540
After that...

160
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,940
After that,

161
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
he got better.

162
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,380
Ms. Wang,

163
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,220
I understand the feeling

164
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,140
of losing a loved one

165
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,740
and the pain of separation.

166
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,260
That's why

167
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,340
we shouldn't casually joke

168
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,300
about our loved ones.

169
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,180
If we lose them,

170
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,980
we'll regret it.

171
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,380
Sorry about that.

172
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I forgot that you were...

173
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,919
(Team Leader)

174
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,020
(Don't let her do the test anymore.)

175
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,860
(If she knows)

176
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
(it's a self-test
for manic-depressive disorder.)

177
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,780
(Both of us would be done for.)

178
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,940
Excuse me.

179
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,700
A glass of ice water, please.

180
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,380
Thank you.

181
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,220
Let's eat.

182
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,860
Eat.

183
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,340
(You little brat.)

184
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,700
By the way,

185
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,500
I just checked.

186
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,220
It takes about 24 hours

187
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,540
to travel

188
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,980
from Beijing to Qionghai.

189
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,060
If we drive

190
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,700
at least 10 hours a day,

191
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,020
we can get there

192
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
in three days.

193
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,700
Okay.

194
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,340
Of course, if you're in a hurry,

195
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,740
I can drive longer each day.

196
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,580
But I just wanted to ask,

197
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,460
why didn't we take a plane?

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,260
It would only take a few hours.

199
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,180
"Ms. Wang,

200
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,980
why didn't you take the plane?

201
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,820
Why do you have a big appetite?

202
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,860
Why are you such a good drinker?

203
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,180
Why aren't you writing your novel?"

204
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,740
Why? Why? Why?

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,180
All you ask is why.

206
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,260
Ms. Wang,

207
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,380
can we

208
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,220
not start an argument

209
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,900
whenever we have a conversation?

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,860
After all, I'm steering

211
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,220
the wheel now.

212
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,940
So you've learned
how to give threats now, huh?

213
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,780
I dare not.

214
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,500
Feng,

215
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,860
you really work hard.

216
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,180
But does anyone notice it?

217
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,460
Is it wrong for us

218
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,300
to work hard,

219
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,900
Ms. Wang?

220
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,980
I'll tell you one story.

221
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:35,618

(The protagonist of this story)

224
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
(is Yuanyuan.)

225
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,860

(she just graduated)

227

(I hope you'll work hard for ideals)
(and an intern at a company.)

228

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,300
(It's related)

231
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,900
(to whether she
can be officially employed)

232
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,860
(because)

233
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,660
(she always has one belief.)

234
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,540
(That is,)

235

(she wants to work hard)

236
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,740
(and make everyone notice it.)

237
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,300
Hello, Dad.

238
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,460
You're home?

239
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,420
Is it cold there?

240
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:49,980
The weather is fine.

241
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,300
It's not cold.

242
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,300
How's work?

243
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,260
Have you made new friends?

244
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Why aren't you saying anything?

245
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,740
I knew you would fail again.

246
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,980
Hey, listen.

247
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,260
Do you know the guy named Zi'an?

248
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,900
The guy

249
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,580
who always failed his exams.

250
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,700
Guess what?

251
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,700
Things are going really great for him.

252
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,780
He just bought a new house.

253
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,300
Look at you. You've worked so hard

254
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,140
to go from a small town to Beijing.

255
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,300
What's the point of studying so much?

256
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,740
Does anyone notice you?

257
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:20,940
Dad,

258
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,940
I'm hanging up
if there's nothing important.

259
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,660
Even if you do well,

260
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,180
newcomers like us won't get a chance.

261
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,780
Mr. Zhang,

262
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,300
this is
our planning department's new recruit.

263
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,700
Luna.

264
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,820
Mr. Zhang, hello.

265
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,220
How is your preparation?

266
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,500
It's all good.

267
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,180
We've already tested it three times.

268
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,140
Where's Yuanyuan?

269
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
I guess she's not here yet.

270
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,380
Young people nowadays
are becoming more and more unreliable.

271
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,020
Luna seems okay.

272
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,380
If she's talented, keep her.

273
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,460
Otherwise, people will say

274
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm not capable as an employer.

275
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,980
Why are you here?

276
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,940
I prepared the presentation file.

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,820
Of course,
I'll be the one to present it.

you do the presentation then.

287
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,460
Sure.

Mr. Zhang,

290
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,740
I'll begin now.

291

did you give Mr. Zhang?

when they'll put out the notice?

We'll talk about it over lunch later.

311
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,580
Okay.

312

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,020
I don't think
I ever gained weight from eating.

345
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,460
Luna.

346
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,500
Your bag is pretty!

347
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,780
Is that so?

348
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,300
They even gave you
a teddy bear, a limited edition.

349
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,660
It's difficult to buy.

350
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,220
I saved up for a long time

351
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,540
and divided it into 24 installments
to finally buy it.

352
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,700
To make my situation even worse,

353
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,380
my landlord

354
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,820
is going to increase my rent again.

355
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,740
So I have to tighten my belt this month.

356
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,980
You can come and eat here.

357
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,020
There are many empty spaces here.

358
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,860
Come here.

359
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
Luna.

360
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,260
What is it?

361
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,380
This teddy bear is adorable.

362
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,900
It is, isn't it?

363
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,820
I saved up for a very long time.

364
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,860
It's expensive.

365
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,580
It was exhausting.

366
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,500
I worked so hard

367
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,540
just to buy handbags.

368
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,380
Heavens.

369
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,820
I can never afford it.

370
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,540
I love this teddy bear.

371
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,860
It's something I can't afford.

372
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,220
(She used my presentation
to get promoted and receive a raise.)

373
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,660
(Yet she shamelessly brags about it.)

374
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,300
(Forget it.)

375
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,820
(I'm not going to make a fuss
with this kind of person.)

376
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,900
The place we went to for lunch
was okay, right?

377
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,300
The portion was huge.

378
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,380
Oh,

379
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,220
this is urgent.

380
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,380
Give it to me before leaving work.

381
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,540
Before leaving work?

382
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,860
I'm also extremely full.

383
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,660
Please help me compare
the material price lists.

384
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,460
You can give it to me tomorrow.

385
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,020
It's not urgent.

386
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Tomorrow?

387
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,660
I can't finish all these alone.

388
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,300
(All I do is work overtime.)

389
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,060
(We're both new interns.)

390
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,300
(Why doesn't Luna need
to work overtime?)

391
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,420
Is there anyone out there?

392
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,340
Everyone has gone home?

393
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:04,635
(I'm locked inside the Archives Room.
Is anyone still at the office?)

394
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,976
(Does anyone know
the property management's phone number?)

395
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:16,231
(Does anyone know the number?
Send it to @Yuanyuan.)

396
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:23,260
(@Everyone I'm locked at the office!
Is anyone reading this?)

397
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,809
(It's raining. Don't forget the umbrella.
Be careful on your way home.)

398
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,023
(You live nearby.
Go and fetch Yuanyuan @Tiantian.)

399
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,948
(You have 30 unread messages)

400
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:56,104
(Wishing you prosperity!
Come and claim your red envelopes.)

401
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:57,283
(Congratulations, Luna!)

402
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,346
(Congratulations!)

403
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,980
(It's Luna again.)

404
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,020
(She must be intentionally
sending red envelopes)

405
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,300
(to attract everyone's attention.)

406
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,020
Where's Yuanyuan?

407
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,300
I guess she's not here yet.

408
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,780
You're the fastest-promoted person

409
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
I've ever seen in the company.

410
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,700
I can't finish all these alone.

411
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,660
(It wasn't easy for you
to get out of a small place)

412
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,180
(to go to Beijing.)

413
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,060
What's the point of studying too much?

414
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,500
Does anyone notice you at all?

415
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,060
(Are you looking for the key?)

416
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,380
(It's useless,
even if you have the key.)

417
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,060
(The door is locked from the outside.)

418
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,980
(Someone like you)

419
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,460
(is easy to be forgotten.)

420
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,540
Why does no one notice me?

421
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,500
(They don't?)

422
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,580
(Did you work hard enough?)

423
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,700
I did.

424
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,220
(No, you did not.)

425
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,340
I have worked hard enough.

426
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,060
(No, you didn't.)

427
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,780
(They can't see you.)

428
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,540
(No one notices you.)

429
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,260
(No one sees you.)

430
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,940
(No one sees you.)

431
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,660
(No one sees you.)

432
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
(No one sees you.)

433
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,700
Stop it.

434
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,380
(No one sees you.)

435
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,300
I said, stop it!

436
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,500
(No one sees you.)

437
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,060
(Luna,)

438
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,980
(you made me do this.)

439
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,260
(We shall wait and see.)

440
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,220
The rain yesterday was too heavy.

441
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,940
It scared me, so I ordered two takeouts.

442
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,660
By the way,

443
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,420
that kid

444
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,340
wasn't locked
in the office overnight, right?

445
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,140
It can't be.

446
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,260
We have 24-hour

447
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,460
security patrols.

448
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,460
But I was worried
something might have happened to her.

449
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,820
So I came back.

450
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,300
I didn't see anyone, though.

451
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,620
I see.

452
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,780
By the way, yesterday's heavy rain

453
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,740
made me slip and fall.

454
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,300
What happened to your leg?

455
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,780
How did you get injured like this?

456
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,980
And what happened to your arm?

457
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
My dear,

458
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
you're like a precious gem.

459
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,340
Are you okay?

460
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,620
Yesterday,

461
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,660
I waited until midnight.

462
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
But no one came.

463
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,340
So I had to trouble everyone.

464
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,020
I sent a message
to the property manager.

465
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,340
But they didn't reply.

466
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Didn't I ask you to go and pick her up?

467
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,860
Why didn't you come?

468
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,540
I was about to leave.

469
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
But the boss suddenly asked me
to get something done.

470
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,980
Luna just said she had been here.

471
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,060
How come you were still locked in?
