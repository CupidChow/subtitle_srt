=Episode 12=

4
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,700
(Love and protect the school environment)
(Nurture good habits and virtues)

5
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,140
(Ever since Zhang Haibei and I promised)

6
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,460
(to get admitted into college,)

7
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,340
(I had been determined
to put great effort into my studies.)

8
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,300
(However, for some reason I didn't know,)

9
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,860
(he never showed up at school)

10
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,060
(since that day.)

11
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,540
Guys.

12
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,940
Let's begin our class.

13
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,860
Open your book

14
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
to page 124.

15
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,420
Today,

16
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,980
we'll continue to talk

17
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,460
about the story that took place
in the 24th year of Duke Xiang.

18
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,700
What's the matter?

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,020
Please come over.

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,500
Let's talk out here.

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,420
Over here.

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,420
Hello, Miss.

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,220
What's the matter?

24
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,940
We came here with some questions.

25
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,020
Is Zhang Haibei a student of your class?

26
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,860
Zhang Haibei?

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,380
Yes, he is.

28
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
That's Zhang Haibei's parents.

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,940
Here's the thing.

30
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,180
- We'd like to gather some information.
(- Why is his mother crying?)

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,260
Zhang Haibei had an accident.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,660
Are there any students

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,700
who are close to him?

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,620
We need to ask some questions.

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,340
Well...

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,940
I...

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,940
I'll ask them.

38
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,420
I'm not sure about that.

39
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,460
I'll ask them for you.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,180
Feng Tianlan.

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,020
Come out

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,780
for a moment.

43
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,340
Quickly.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,860
Police officers.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,700
This is his classmate. You...

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,380
Hello.

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,940
Have you been close

48
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,420
to Zhang Haibei recently?

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,940
Have you noticed
any unusual behavior in him?

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,700
Well, he had an accident.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
Do you know anything about that?

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,180
What accident?

53
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,420
We can't disclose that for now.

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,940
If you remember anything,

55
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,820
please contact us.

56
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,740
(Many people came that day.)

57
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,300
(But the image in my head)

58
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,220
(remained to be)

59
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,820
(when we were at the roadside stall that night.)

60
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,740
(I wanted to push away everything
and wake him up,)

61
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
("Haibei, a new game is out.")

62
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,420
("Haibei, Wang Putao's
new book is out.")

63
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,300
(But I didn't.)

64
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,100
(I was just numb
and stood together with others)

65
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,300
(surrounding him.)

66
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,300
(Haibei accidentally drowned.)

67
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,220
(None of us)

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,780
(could accept it.)

69
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,340
(His mother told me)

70
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,660
(that he often mentioned me at home.)

71
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,980
(She thanked me,)

72
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,940
(saying that Haibei was happy
whenever he talked about me.)

73
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,380
(My mind was blank at that time.)

74
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,820
(I only knew)

75
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,620
(that I lost)

76
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,580
(my best friend.)

77
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,180
You can have this.

78
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,420
There are all songs inside.

79
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,100
I don't really understand them.

80
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,540
(Inside this MP3 player)

81
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,060
(were all the catchy songs)

82
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,620
(we both liked.)

83
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,820
Well, let's make a promise
to enter the same college

84
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,700
and continue with our crazy adventures.

85
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,220
(I didn't know)

86
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,300
(how to calm myself down.)

87
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,980
(All I had)

88
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,740
(was a wish list related to him.)

89
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,900
(It was somewhat saddening, right?)

90
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,140
(The entire year of Grade 12)

91
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,580
(disappeared instantly.)

92
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,220
(My grades
weren't at the bottom anymore.)

93
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,540
(I made improvements gradually.)

94
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,460
(Feng Tianlan)

95
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,180
(My family
was a traditional Shandong family.)

96
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,460
(My father hoped
that I could go to a normal college)

97
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,780
(for a teacher's
qualification certificate.)

98
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,340
(As long as my parents are happy,)

99
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,380
(that's all that matters.)

100
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,780
(Occasionally,)

101
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,580
(I heard pebbles
hitting the windows when I sat there.)

102
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,420
(Sometimes, I wasn't sure)

103
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
(for whom I was striving.)

104
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,180
(Class Ranking 3, Grade Ranking 20, Feng Tianlan)

105
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,940
Guys.

106
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,820
Let's review

107
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,260
your performance in this exam.

108
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,500
In this exam,

109
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,300
Feng Tianlan has shown
the most significant improvement.

110
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,420
Let's give him a big hand.

111
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,100
(Probably it's hard to imagine)

112
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,860
(a fool like me)

113
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,220
(could achieve decent grades)

114
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,020
(through hard work.)

115
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,020
(Perhaps, it was because I had the strength)

116
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,140
(Haibei gave me.)

117
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,340
(Admission Ticket)

118
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,940
Moonlight glides across your face.

119
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,300
A face

120
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,140
of misery and beauty from the world.

121
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,100
We combine into one

122
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,140
and fly across the ocean.

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,660
What does that mean?

124
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,460
Hope.

125
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,540
(The poem Haibei recited)

126
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,860
(made me realize
that having hopes is always crucial.)

(Feng Tianlan)

129
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,060
We

130
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,620
will make a to-do list of 20 things.

131
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,260
Put down anything we want to do.

132
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,380
(4. Perform rap together)

135
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:03,660
- Boo!
- Boo!

136
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,860
It's fine. I'll come again.

137
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,340
You're back, Tianlan.

138
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,300
Yes.

139
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,740
Awesome.

140
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,500
We give you our respect.

141
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,820
Guys, let's go and grab something to eat.

142
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,140
Tianlan, we're going to have lunch.

143
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,900
Do you want anything?

144
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,460
You guys go ahead.

145
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,340
Thank you.

146
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,500
(4. Perform rap together)

147
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,100
Let's make a deal.

148
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
After our 18th birthday next year

149
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,820
when we can legally drink,

150
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,940
let's drink a whole crate.

151
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,100
Deal.

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,940
Drink until we're drunk!

153
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,620
- Come on.
- Come on.

154
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,860
Grab your bottles.

155
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,540
- Come on.
- Cheers.

156
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,500
Cheers.

157
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,340
(No matter)

158
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,740
(how long you've gone,)

159
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,940
(I'll never forget you,)

160
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,020
(Haibei,)

161
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,780
(my best friend.)

162
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,620
(Although you couldn't make good
on our promise,)

163
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,740
(Booze it up on our 18th birthday)
(I'd remember it for good.)

164
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,900
(Even though)

165
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,700
(I'm mindlessly accomplishing
our shared wishes.)

166
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,500
(Only by doing so)

167
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,500
(can I prove that he once existed.)

168
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,820
(Go on a trip
with a college scholarship)

169
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,300
Zhang Haibei, I'm here!

170
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,100
How dare you

171
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,500
leave me here alone!

172
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,700
(6. Go cycling to the beach)

173
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
(I've completed a bunch of our wishes,)

174
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,860
(I made many new friends,)

175
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,540
(and I received many awards.)

176
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,460
(I used to think)

177
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,420
(that I was living a life
that was meant for two people,)

178
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,940
(but when I looked back,)

179
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,140
(I found that this wish list)

180
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,980
(had changed my life.)

181
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,940
What should I do now?

182
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,460
I've made arrangements

183
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
for your job.

184
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,820
Your Chinese major
doesn't quite match their requirement,

185
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,780
but

186
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,220
they promised you could be officially employed

187
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,540
as long as you have
a teaching certificate.

188
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,420
Right, being a teacher is more stable.

189
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,460
Tianlan.

190
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
We don't care

191
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,540
what you do in your personal life,

192
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,260
but when it comes to the job,

193
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
you must listen to us.

194
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,020
Dad, Mom.

195
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,540
I have something I want to do.

196
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,620
(5. Zhang Haibei will be accepted
into the Chinese Department)

197
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,220
(and work as Wang Putao's editor
while Feng Tianlan works as her producer)

198
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,300
(Copy Editor)

199
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
(Shanguan Culture Co., Ltd)
(Job description)

200
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,500
(Shanguan Culture Co., Ltd)

201
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,740
Hello.

202
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,540
(Hello, this is Shanguan Culture.)

203
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,540
(Ms. Wang.)

204
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,620
(We haven't known each other long,)

205
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,060
(but I can tell)

206
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,940
(your uniqueness)

207
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,940
(and your pains buried underneath.)

208
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,660
(Life is full of challenges.)

209
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,540
(To be honest,)

210
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,540
(when I saw you fainting
in the water yesterday,)

211
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,260
(I was terrified.)

212
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,780
(I don't want to face
that kind of separation again.)

213
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,700
(So, please hold)

214
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,980
(onto hopes in life.)

215
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,580
(Even if there's just a little bit of hope left,)

216
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,340
(please don't give up
on the belief to live on.)

217
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,980
(There are many ways out.)

218
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,780
You don't have to force yourself
into bearing everything.

219
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
Of course,

220
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,500
(you can peg me as a deserter.)

221
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,940
(Ms. Wang.)

222
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,140
(May we meet again.)

223
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,660
Who said I wanted to kill myself?

224
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,820
Feng Tianlan.

225
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,220
You're dead meat once I find you.

226
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,820
Let me see where you are.

227
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,820
(Where are you?)

228
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,260
(Believe it or not,
I'll feed you to the sharks.)

229
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,820
(Wang Putao)

230
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,580
Hello!

231
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,060
Zhang Haibei!

232
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,940
I'm here again!

233
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,340
How are you?

234
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,020
Wang Putao, she...

235
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,020
As you know,

236
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,460
she's quirky.

237
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,540
I got scared

238
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,220
when I saw her like that yesterday.

239
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,940
I don't want to face the loss again.

240
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,620
Feng Tianlan.

241
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,460
Did you curse me with ill luck?

242
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,020
You...

243
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,060
Thank you, Feng Tianlan.

244
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,820
Feng Tianlan, what are you thinking?

245
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,260
How is that possible?

246
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,940
She just patted on your head.

247
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,940
Nothing is happening now.

248
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,780
It never happened before,

249
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,820
not even in the future.

250
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,940
And why are you here?

251
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,620
She didn't say anything,

252
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,940
but you

253
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,340
just followed her back to the hotel.

254
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
What's wrong with you, Feng Tianlan?

255
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,620
Yes, sir.

256
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,780
I heard that you're back again.

257
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,100
No...

258
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,780
It's not that.

259
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,820
No, sir.

260
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,900
Well...

261
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,580
I...

262
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,140
Our situation isn't what you think.

263
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,220
Our?

264
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,580
You're already using "us."

265
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,940
Oh, Feng.

266
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,780
Well done.

267
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,820
Nice try.

268
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,340
Nice strategy.

269
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,380
Brilliant.

270
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,300
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

271
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,420
Ms. Wang and I...

272
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,300
We haven't talked this out.

273
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,500
I understand.

274
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Play hard to get.

275
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,780
No, it's not that.

276
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,860
Feng.

277
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,460
I knew I'd chosen the right person.

278
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,500
You're passionate about your job.

279
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:50,980
Sir.

280
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,620
I'm still considering

281
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,020
whether or not I should come back.

282
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,780
Yeah, sure.

283
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,460
Consider it thoroughly.

284
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,460
I understand.

285
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,900
You have a clear mind.

286
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,140
Feng.

287
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,140
How about this?

288
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,540
I'll give you three days.

289
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,580
In these three days,

290
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,100
can you persuade Ms. Wang

291
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,660
to give us some of her manuscripts?

292
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,340
Manuscript?

293
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,820
But I haven't decided
if I'll return to my post.

294
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,780
I...

295
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,380
Feng.

296
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,220
So far,

297
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,620
you're the editor of the longest service

298
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,060
for her.

299
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,820
Really?

300
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,500
Exactly.

301
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:26,780
That's true.

302
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,460
Feng.

303
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,820
You're the most courageous young man
I've ever seen.

304
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,020
Back then, an excellent talent like me

305
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,260
could only stay with her

306
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,780
for eight days.

307
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,740
And then, he was recruited.

308
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,220
My record is five days.

309
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,340
I couldn't do as good as him.

310
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,380
Lastly...

311
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,980
I recruited her.

312
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,820
I was recruited.
My record is three days.

313
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,140
Frankly, Ms. Wang

314
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,660
is still bearable at times.

315
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,780
She

316
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,340
is quite understanding sometimes.

317
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,940
Sir.

318
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Why isn't it working?

319
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,020
No, it's not.

320
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,380
We aren't moving.

321
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,340
Ms. Wang, I'll carry that.

322
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,220
I'm on the call with the team leader.

323
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Do you want a chat with him?

324
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,540
Uh...

325
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,820
I have something to attend to, Feng.

326
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
We'll talk later.

327
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,340
Bye-bye. Good luck!

328
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,460
"Wang Putao is still bearable at times?"

329
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,860
"She's quite understanding sometimes?"

330
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,500
I was dumbfounded hearing that.

331
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,460
Ms. Wang, I think we need to talk.

332
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,620
There's nothing to talk about.

333
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,900
Just now...

334
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,660
What happened just now?

335
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,660
I don't know.

336
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,620
It's...

337
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,900
You're right.

338
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,060
Nothing happened.

339
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,460
Nothing.

340
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,100
What are you trying to say?

341
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,580
No... Nothing.

342
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,340
It's nothing.

343
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,780
I'm warning you.

344
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,980
Don't you dare run away again.

345
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,500
Ms. Wang.

346
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,980
Many things

347
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,140
are just my own obsession.

348
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,140
It's my problem.

349
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,580
I shouldn't impose

350
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,980
my pain of losing a friend

351
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,260
onto you.

352
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,460
But I have to say

353
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,740
that your temper is unpredictable,

354
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,780
and I've been disoriented

355
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,580
by your confusing instructions
along the journey.

356
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,900
You told me
you were going home for a funeral.

357
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,460
But it turned out you came to see Xu...

358
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,380
Ms. Wang.

359
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,140
Are we here

360
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,700
to visit Xu Youguang especially?

361
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,020
Feng Tianlan.

362
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,060
Every person has an irreparable memory

363
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,260
and something they intend to avoid.

364
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,460
So, can I choose not to tell?

365
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,460
Ms. Wang.

366
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:39,860
Okay.

367
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,540
Forget about the past.

368
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,500
Let's go on.

369
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,020
Let's do this.

370
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,100
(Mr. Wu)

371
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,900
Hello.

372
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,460
Yes.

373
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,180
Okay, I got it.

374
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,620
What's wrong?

375
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
I'm hungry.

376
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,300
Let's go somewhere to eat.

377
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,820
Okay.
