=Episode 13=

4
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,660
(Wuhan)

5
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,180
(Although)

6
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,180
(I know that it sounded absurd,)

7
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,380
(it did happen.)

8
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,900
(The death anniversary
of Ms. Wang's father is approaching.)

9
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,820
(I don't know why.)

10
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,380
(But I'm more anxious than her.)

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,740
(We went all the way)

12
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,740
(to Zhanjiang in two days.)

13
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,540
(I don't want to drive)

14
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
(Zhanjiang)
(on the highway ever again.)

15
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,980
Feng Tianlan.

16
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,580
Have you bought the ticket?

17
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,780
What ticket?

18
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,060
(I never thought that I would need)

19
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,740
(to buy a ferry ticket)

20
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,620
(for the car to drive to Hainan.)

21
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,620
(Although I paid 600
for the ferry ticket myself,)

22
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,300
(the good news is)

23
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,020
(that this time,)

24
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,620
(I got the receipt.)

25
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,460
(Qionghai)

26
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,500
Thank you.

27
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,700
Aren't you going to eat it?

28
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,620
I'm so envious of you.

29
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,900
You eat everything with so much gusto.

30
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,420
Don't you think that the food in Hainan

31
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,220
is way more delicious
than the salad before this?

32
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,860
Feng Tianlan.

33
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,060
What do you think about Hainan?

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,460
Hainan is quite a nice place.

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,140
The sea is beautiful.

36
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,220
It's very wide.

37
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,620
It feels very comfortable here.

38
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,020
This place is not like Beijing.

39
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,300
It doesn't have
any drastic seasonal changes.

40
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,780
So, it'll make you feel

41
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,220
that time passes by very slowly here.

42
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,900
The wider the ocean,

43
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,340
the smaller I feel.

44
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,420
As if I were just a tiny grain...

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,420
of sand.

46
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,060
Let's eat.

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,420
Since you are enjoying the food so much,

48
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,300
let me tell you a fact

49
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,540
that will ruin your appetite.

50
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,340
Okay?

51
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,420
What can you say to ruin my appetite?

52
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,100
For example...

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,420
my dad is still alive.

54
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Ms. Wang, what are you trying to do?

55
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm telling you the truth.

56
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,100
The truth?

57
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,980
The truth is,
your father is still alive.

58
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,420
What are we doing here then?

59
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,900
Going home.

60
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,220
Going home?

61
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,460
Why do you want to go home?

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,100
For no reason

63
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,340
other than I want to go back.

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,740
Think about it carefully.

65
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,740
You told me you were rushing back
for the funeral.

66
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,220
Funeral! Ms. Wang.

67
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,220
I know.

68
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,620
But isn't it great right now?

69
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,220
My dad is still alive.

70
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,340
And no more funerals.

71
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
I told you

72
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,540
not to joke about your parents

73
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
and any elders like this.

74
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,340
The car is running out of petrol.

75
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,340
I'll fill up the tank for you

76
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,300
at the next petrol station.

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,500
Then, I'll find you a designated driver

78
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,620
and we'll part ways.

79
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,900
What should we do now?

80
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,580
Hello?

81
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:55,460
(10 KM away from Wang Putao's Home)

82
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:04,700
(20 KM away from Wang Putao's Home)

83
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,860
What brought you here to me?

84
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,540
You scared me.

85
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,460
My car broke down.

86
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,340
What a coincidence.

87
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,420
It's a good thing.

88
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,660
Just now, I went to spy on him.

89
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,340
He carried that huge suitcase
up to the room

90
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,740
all by himself.

91
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,460
He's so strong.

92
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,180
Much more reliable
than all the other useless men

93
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,100
before him.

94
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,860
What is it?

95
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,420
Do you like him?

96
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,740
What do you mean?

97
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,780
Of course I like him.

98
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,540
I can tell that he's a good boy.

99
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,980
Stop it.

100
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,220
I know that you like him.

101
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,900
Before my sister passed away,

102
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,660
she entrusted you to me.

103
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,660
I literally raised you.

104
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,100
I know

105
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,420
how you look and act

106
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
when you like someone.

107
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,540
How's my dad lately?

108
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,780
Can he recognize some of you, at least?

109
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,980
He's still the same.

110
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
But I'm quite happy

111
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,420
that you've come back.

112
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,540
What is it?

113
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,620
Are you ready to see him now?

114
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,740
Save me some food.

115
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,860
Hurry up.

116
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,860
We are not celebrating
any festival today.

117
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,340
You don't have to bow to me.

118
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,500
Well.

119
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,140
I'm going back to my room.

120
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,940
Wait.

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,820
We don't have anything
to cook for dinner.

122
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,500
Let's go to the market together.

123
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,340
Come on.

124
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,740
I'm coming along.

125
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,340
Putao.

126
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,220
Let's go.

127
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,820
Hurry up.

128
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,940
Putao!

129
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,620
How much is this?

130
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,980
Ten.

131
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,060
So expensive!

132
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,140
What about this one?

133
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,340
Two yuan for one.

134
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,820
Two yuan for one?

135
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,060
Yes. We are running a small business.

136
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,220
A small business?

137
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,980
Can I taste it?

138
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
One balloon, please.

139
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,740
Don't simply run around without a phone.

140
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,220
Who will look for you if you are lost?

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
I am her aunt.

174
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,260
Come on, call me Aunt.

175
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,220
Dream on.

176
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
You are just a few years older than me.

177
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm still older than you anyway.

178
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,140
Wait!

179
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,460
What is that?

180
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,220
Fried pork lard.
Have you not seen it before?

181
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,340
Feng, where are you from?

182
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,980
I'm from Shandong.

183
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,100
You are from the north?

184
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,700
No!

185
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,980
Don't add water to it!

186
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,220
Ms. Wang,

187
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,500
can you step away?

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,620
Don't make things harder for us.

189
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,900
Go away and entertain yourself.

190
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,100
Feng.

191
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,820
You are from Shandong.

192
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,940
What does your family do?

193
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
When I was young,

194
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
my family made clothes.

195
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,060
After we made some money,

196
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,220
we had many relatives

197
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,580
who loved hanging out together.

198
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,260
So, besides clothes,

199
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,940
we dabbled in auto parts,

200
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,620
pump valves,

201
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,460
et cetera.

202
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,220
So you are the young master
of a business family.

203
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,460
I'm just a helper at most.

204
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,220
Are you investigating
his family background?

205
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm doing it for your own good.

206
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,380
Feng, you have a great personality.

207
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,260
Am I right?

208
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,820
- He's just faking it.
- I'm just putting up with her.

209
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,980
Ms. Wang.

210
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,700
If there's nothing else,

211
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,100
I'll go back to rest now.

212
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,940
Feng Tianlan.

213
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,340
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
After some serious thought,

215
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,820
I realized that I had gone too far

216
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,060
with my lie.

217
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,860
But I didn't mean to do that.

218
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,460
Here are some osmanthus wine

219
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,700
and side dishes.

220
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,780
Continue with your conversation.

221
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,740
Feng Tianlan.

222
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,740
I realize that you...

223
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,220
are so ridiculous.

224
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,260
I never thought

225
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,140
that you

226
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,740
would serve me once, Ms. Wang.

227
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,380
But the wine is so delicious.

228
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,980
Why aren't you drinking it?

229
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,340
Because I don't want
to make someone worry about me.

230
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,740
Ms. Wang.

231
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,980
Today, you look a little bit...

232
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,580
You are really relying

233
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,300
on liquid courage.

234
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,980
To be honest, Wang Putao,

235
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,860
sometimes,

236
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,980
I really don't know

237
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,740
what you are thinking about.

238
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,460
And I don't know

239
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,140
how many secrets you are hiding.

240
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,380
But I have to remind myself every day

241
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,740
to find out what you are thinking.

242
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,620
I'm exhausted.

243
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,460
You are already talking nonsense

244
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,940
after drinking
just a little bit of wine.

245
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,460
I used to hold my liquor very well.

246
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,820
Actually, I'm really envious of you.

247
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Envious of me?

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,460
Why?

249
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,100
Do you know

250
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,740
why you can't talk nonsense

251
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,500
about an elder's death?

252
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,300
"The sun sets slowly down the hills;

253
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,540
The Yellow River flows into the ocean.

254
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,420
Should you see
a thousand miles further,

255
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,260
Ascend to a higher level."

256
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,340
You are so good with the poem.

257
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,940
Can you recite other poems?

258
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm sleepy.

259
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,140
You are sleepy?

260
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,300
Come. Lie down.

261
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Let me turn off the fan for you.

262
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
No. It's too hot.

263
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,340
Too hot?

264
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,620
I don't want you to catch a cold.

265
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,300
I'd better turn it off.

266
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
I'll be fine. Don't turn it off.

267
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,180
Okay. We'll keep it on.

268
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,620
Sleep.

269
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
(When I was young,)

270
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,820
(I thought that we had a lot of time.)

271
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,340
(I thought that my grandma
would always be with me.)

272
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,580
But that was the last time

273
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,020
I saw her.

274
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,700
(She had a fever the next day.)

275
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,340
Our family thought that she was fine.

276
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,900
And that it was just a normal cold.

277
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,780
I thought so too.

278
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,500
So, I went to school.

279
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,100
(But in just a few days,)

280
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,620
(my grandma...)

281
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,020
(was diagnosed with pneumonia.)

282
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,380
(After that...)

283
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,060
(From that moment onward,)

284
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,020
(I felt so guilty about it.)

285
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,100
(Of course,)

286
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,100
I felt guilty
about Zhang Haibei's death too.

287
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,860
(So)

288
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,500
(when you told me
that you wanted to go home)

289
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,100
(to pay respects to your dad,)

290
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,500
(I felt)

291
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,900
(the same anxiety.)

292
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,340
Although

293
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,500
I don't know why

294
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,420
you lied to me
about your father's death,

295
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,420
when you

296
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,300
told me

297
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,620
that your father was still alive,

298
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,540
(I felt quite happy for you.)

299
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
(I couldn't joke )

300
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,180
(about someone's death.)

301
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,100
And I didn't know

302
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,820
how to part with them.

303
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,660
Why is there someone

304
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,300
as foolish as you?

305
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,340
Am I really that foolish?

306
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,020
Yes.

307
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,860
Feng Tianlan.

308
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,580
Actually, I'm not

309
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,900
as free-spirited as you think I am.

310
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
If I could,

311
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,620
I want to live
a free and easy life, too.

312
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,100
Although my dad is still alive,

313
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,860
he's indeed ill.

314
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,580
And his condition is getting worse.

315
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,780
So I still need to go back.

316
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,860
I didn't lie to you about that.

317
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,660
Maybe,

318
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,260
I was using you as an excuse.

319
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,860
I thought if you didn't drive me back,

320
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,500
I wouldn't have to go back.

321
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,540
Who knows

322
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,540
that you didn't even say no to this?

323
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,340
Feng Tianlan.

324
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,180
Actually, we are just ordinary people.

325
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,060
We'll all die one day.

326
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,820
But we are living

327
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,620
as if we had forever together.

328
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,620
(Getting to know someone is easy.)

329
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,540
(But it's never easy
to say goodbye properly.)

330
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,940
(We'll meet some,)

331
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,580
(and we'll part ways with some.)

332
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,260
We don't have to care

333
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,100
or think too much about it.

334
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,900
Don't you have anything else to say

335
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,420
except nodding yes?

336
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,300
I said so much.

337
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,700
All you ever say

338
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:55,820
to me is,

339
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,300
"Okay, Ms. Wang"

340
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,820
"You eat too much, Ms. Wang"

341
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,340
and "Don't do this, Ms. Wang".

342
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,820
I bully you every day.

343
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,900
But you still put up with me.

344
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Could it be that you like me?

345
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,860
Yes.

346
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,140
Do I like you?

347
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,060
Or not?

348
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,660
Maybe I do.

Yes.

364
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,540
I've sent you
the location of the market.

365
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,180
Remember to buy me everything

366
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,100
on the list later

367
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,020
and come back as soon as possible.

368
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,140
Stop the nagging.

369
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,860
I'll come back when it's time.

370
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,460
(It's time for some physical training)

371
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,340
(to strengthen your body.)

372
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,300
(The national radio calisthenics
will start now!)

373
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,820
(Walk in place.)

374
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,380
(One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.)

375
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,300
(Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven. Stop.)

376
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,660
(The first session,
upper-body exercise. Ready, go!)

377
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,980
(One, two, three, four...)

378
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,340
How can you drive

379
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
when you are so drunk?

380
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,540
I'm sober now.

381
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,620
By the way, Ms. Wang,

382
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,620
I didn't do anything inappropriate
last night, did I?

383
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,340
Have you forgotten everything
about last night?

384
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,140
Yes.

385
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,380
But last night,

386
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,540
did I...

387
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,780
Not. You were just dreaming.

388
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,060
Dreaming?

389
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,500
By the way, Ms. Wang,

390
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,140
I vaguely remember

391
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,540
that we are going back
to your home, right?

392
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,260
What about other things?

393
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,380
I don't remember anything else.

394
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,500
(Phone Calls, Ms. Wang)

395
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,620
Ms. Wang, what about the manuscript?

396
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,540
How about this?

397
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,900
If you swim in the sea,

398
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,500
I'll finish the story in three days.

399
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,020
Really?

400
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,420
You have my word.

401
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,060
(Just like what I said
in the first episode,)

402
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,340
(I'm just an intern editor.)

403
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,100
(Maybe too many ridiculous things)

404
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,420
(have happened along the way.)

405
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,740
(Will she really give me the manuscript)

406
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
(as long as I swim in the sea?)

407
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,940
(Is she really Ms. Wang?)

408
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,180
(Something is not right.)

409
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,340
(I'm going crazy.)

410
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,020
(And the worst thing is,)

411
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,380
(I lied.)

412
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,620
(I remember every detail)

413
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,780
(from last night.)

414
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,100
(I)

415
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,700
(am just too afraid to admit)

416
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,140
(that I kind of...)

417
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
(That I kind of like her.)

418
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,820
(I'm doomed.)
