4
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,860
The most important thing is
to be my editor?

5
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,140
Ms. Wang, to be frank,

6
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,780
the team leader offered a high salary

7
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,260
while recruiting the intern editor
for your new book.

8
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
I'm here with a mission.

9
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,180
Besides, it's my first time
being an editor.

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,980
(Have they told you)

11
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,740
(that before you,)

12
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,940
(88 editors)

13
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,900
(had been in this car?)

14
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,020
What had happened to them afterward?

15
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,980
(The majority of them
haven't been seen again.)

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,220
What about the minority?

17
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,460
They jumped into the sea.

18
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
Nature calls.

19
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,180
Ms. Wang.

20
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,860
Didn't you just use the lady's room?

21
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,380
Faster.

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,260
I can't hold it anymore.

23
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,260
Wait a moment.

24
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,500
Let me find a service area.

25
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,140
(2,728 km away from Qionghai, Hainan.)

26
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,420
Here we are.

27
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,420
Okay.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,220
Let me pull over first.

29
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,620
Be careful.

30
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,820
(Eating and then pooping non-stop.)

31
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,860
(As if she were a...)

32
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,180
(Forget it.)

33
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,700
What's that sound?

34
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,380
Kitty.

35
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,180
Come here.

36
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,460
You...

37
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,700
What's wrong with you?

38
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,420
Hold them for me.

39
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,020
You have a kind soul.

40
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,900
I'm not like you.

41
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,860
Do you think

42
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,420
how difficult it's for them to forage?

43
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,340
Now that I feed them,

44
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,820
at least

45
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,860
they won't go hungry tonight.

46
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,100
They won't go hungry tonight.

47
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,900
But what about tomorrow?

48
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,340
You won't think of them again.

49
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,900
Don't quibble.

50
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,220
When they come to look for you tomorrow

51
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,140
and can't find you,

52
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,620
do you know how disappointed
they will be?

53
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,100
Tomorrow,

54
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
they'll still have to find food
from the garbage.

55
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,420
They lose something
right after they gain it.

56
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,220
It will only make them feel worse.

57
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,500
You should know

58
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,140
that because of you,

59
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,540
they might not survive tomorrow

60
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,460
and the days to come.

61
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,420
There are plenty of ways
to satisfy oneself.

62
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,060
You better not start something on a whim

63
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,260
if you can't sustain it.

64
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,540
Ms. Wang.

65
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,940
Don't ignore a benign deed
because it's tiny.

66
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm hungry.

67
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,740
(Did she associate herself
with the kittens?)

68
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,940
(Or has she suffered something before?)

69
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,060
(Actually, I want to tell her)

70
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,700
(that even the smallest love and care)

71
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,180
(can be felt.)

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,420
Didn't you just eat?

73
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,940
(We're still 2,728 km away)

74
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,420
(from Qionghai.)

75
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,580
(It takes only three hours by plane,)

76
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,820
(28 hours by train,)

77
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,060
(but by car,)

78
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,940
(it will take two and a half days,
at least.)

79
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,100
(However, if we keep this pace,)

80
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,500
(I'm afraid
we won't even reach there in a week.)

81
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,140
By the way, Ms. Wang.

82
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,100
Can I discuss something with you?

83
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,180
What's it?

84
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,500
Can we

85
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,780
not stop at every service area

86
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,940
to use the restroom?

87
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,860
Do you have any objections

88
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,780
to my natural needs?

89
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,940
After all, we've been driving all-day

90
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,620
and only made it to Tianjin.

91
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,780
Your place is quite remote.

92
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,580
Because the rent in Tianjin is cheaper.

93
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,220
Let's just stop here

94
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,700
for today.

95
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,420
(I never understand this woman.)

96
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,220
Hello.

97
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,020
Two rooms face east,
towards the garden, please.

98
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,860
Thank you.

99
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,220
This hotel is near
the provincial highway.

100
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,820
There might be noisy trucks

101
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,780
passing by at night.

102
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,700
The rooms facing east are all lit up.

103
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,820
I don't think

104
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,900
they have two rooms next to each other.

105
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,500
Are we staying in two separate rooms?

106
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,060
Can't we stay together?

107
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,180
Wait...

108
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,620
Didn't you say

109
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,540
that you want to see me every day
when you wake up?

110
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,660
Ms. Wang.

111
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
She's just joking.

112
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,420
It's a joke.

113
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,660
I'm not.

114
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,620
I told you

115
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,740
I don't mind if you snore or sleepwalk.

116
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,900
You're always cracking jokes.

117
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,020
Is it fun?

118
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,540
Was it fun?

119
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,500
I think

120
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,620
I might be a good actress

121
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,620
if I'm not a writer.

122
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,020
People could've taken

123
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,820
your jokes seriously.

124
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,820
So what?

125
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,300
That's bothersome, you know?

126
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,460
I'll help you.

127
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,660
Be careful.

128
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,300
I'll go check in.

129
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,140
Off you go.

130
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,380
(I'm exhausted.
It's only the first day.)

131
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,300
(How am I going to survive
the rest of the days?)

132
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,140
(I didn't expect Ms. Wang
to be quite pretty,)

133
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,020
(but also quirky.)

134
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,220
(Wang Putao, Chinese Suspense Author)

135

(Wang Putao.)

136
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,020
(Wang Putao.)

137
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,380
(Something is just wrong.)

138
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,380
(Forget it. We still have
a long journey to cover.)

139
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,300
You're here.

140
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,300
Let's go.

141
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,060
Where?

142
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,460
Let's go downtown.

143
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,140
I thought we should...

144
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,180
Are you coming or not?

145
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,500
(Again.)

146
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,380
Ms. Wang.

147
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,540
Where are we going?

148
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,450
(Fenglin Cemetery)

149
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,500
Ceme... Cemetery?

150
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,460
Why?

151
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,300
Are you scared?

152
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,660
No... it's not that.

153
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,740
Well, Ms. Wang.

154
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,940
I've been thinking about this.

155
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,140
Since we started this journey,

156
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,420
why can't we have

157
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,700
something more positive,

158
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,540
instead of thinking about graveyards,

159
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,180
farewells,

160
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,380
murderers, and such?

161
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,540
Life is beautiful

162
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,460
and positive, right?

163
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,820
We'll go to this place, then.

164
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,460
(Finally, she's taking my advice.)

167
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,980
Let me tell you a new story.

168
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,170
(Recording)

169
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,470
(Chapter Three: The Seed)

(Before the liberation,)

(a small theater in Shanghai)

172
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,820
(Tarzan's Secret Treasure)
(was staging a popular play.)

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,740
Regardless that the done deeds

174
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,540
would be so terrifying
and make one daren't look.

175
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,420
(The play was a huge success.)

176
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,340
(But it had nothing to do
with Xu Youguang,)

177
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,180
(who was standing behind the curtain.)

178
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,420
(He sullenly looked at his senior)

179
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,460
(answering a curtain call.)

180
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,940
(The stage he yearned for)

181
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,420
(was right in front of him)

182
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,420
(but out of his reach.)

183
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,380
Ms. Wang.

184
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,060
So, the book has a story that happened
in the Republic of China era too.

185
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,420
(Despite the bumpy path)

186
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,140
(of being an actor,)

187
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,020
(still, he was luckier than others
about something.)

188
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,660
(That is)

189
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,220
(he had a beloved girl.)

190
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,700
(Meeting her every day after work)

191
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,020
(was the happiest moment for him.)

192
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,140
What are you thinking about?

193
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,100
A recent play in the theater,

194
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,380
Macbeth.

195
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,580
Really?

196
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,300
Who are you playing?

197
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,700
Macbeth?

198
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,620
Why are you smiling?

199
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,860
I'd love to play that.

200
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,700
Only if I'm qualified for that.

201
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,700
Why not?

202
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,820
To me,

203
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,820
you're the best actor.

204
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,140
The best?

205
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,860
How do you know that?

206
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,220
I just know.

207
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,820
You're the best.

208
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,140
No one can ever compare

209
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,900
to you.

210
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:09,900
Yes.

211
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,740
I'm the best.

212
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,700
I can be the best.

213
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,100
I'll take you and leave this place.

214
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,540
I just want to be with you.

215
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
That's all I want.

216
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,500
My father always says

217
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,620
that one shouldn't desire too much

218
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,500
and we should learn to be content.

219
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,420
Being with you,

220
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm content.

221
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,340
(Content.)

222
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,700
(Xu Youguang looked at himself
in the mirror.)

223
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,420
(He hesitated.)

224
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,020
(He was somewhat not satisfied)

225
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,060
(to only play the supporting roles.)

226
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,500
Spring Breeze Theater

227
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,940
is going to put on
a classical Western play,

228
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,900
Macbeth.

229
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,900
(Macbeth)
(Othello)

230
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,060
Youguang.

231
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,260
Why are you standing here?

232
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,900
Let's rehearse.

233
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,300
Let's call it a day.

234
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,500
Don't forget to pack up

235
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
before you leave.

236
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,420
(Xu Youguang stared at the empty stage)

237
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
(and thought,)

238
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,260
("When will it be my turn?")

239
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,860
("It's fine even with just one line.")

240
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,180
(At that moment,)

241
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,460
(Xu Youguang)

242
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,740
(suddenly felt
that he had become the protagonist.)

243
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,980
(It was what he'd been dreaming of.)

244
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,860
Well-played!

245
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,300
Bravo!

246
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,700
Well-played.

247
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,380
Who are you?

248
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,980
You don't have to know that.

249
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,660
I just want to tell you

250
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,220
to come to me if you have a wish.

251
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,740
(Fable Grocery Store)
You'll need this.

252
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,300
Geez.

253
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,820
(Supporting Roles)

254
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,350
(Xu Youguang)

255
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,770
(Fable Grocery Store)

256
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
It's no harm

257
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,420
in taking a look there.

258
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,320
(Fable Grocery Store)

259
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,500
I've never seen this place before.

260
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:17,870
(No regrets for your wish)

261
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,340
Welcome.

262
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,100
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,500
I think I've come to the wrong place.

264
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,580
No, you don't.

265
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,180
This is the place.

266
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,620
What wish do you need me

267
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,620
(Zhongzi, the storekeeper)
to make it happen?

268
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,620
How do you know about that?

269
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,100
People who come here

270
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,660
are always harboring a strong desire.

271
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,380
So, mister,

272
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,500
what's your wish

273
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,700
that needs to be granted?

274
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,500
I want a role with lines,

275
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,700
even if it's just an understudy.

276
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,540
Sure.

277
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,340
I can grant your wish.

278
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,580
You don't ask for much, though.

279
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,380
We have one issue here.

280
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,820
There's Ying and Yang

281
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,540
in this world.

282
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,940
No pain, no gain.

283
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,500
What are you willing

284
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,020
to give me in return?

285
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,380
You don't want money?

286
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,260
What do you want?

287
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,420
Something

288
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,300
that makes your heart hurt
when you lose it,

289
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,820
but it's still bearable.

290
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,500
Mister.

291
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,540
Instead of regretting it
for your whole life,

292
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,220
isn't it worth it, losing a little bit?

293
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,060
This is what my mother left me
before she passed away.

294
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,100
Do you

295
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,540
feel any pain?

296
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,580
The more painful you are,

297
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,300
the more you'll gain.

298
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,380
No refunds or exchanges.

299
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,580
No credit.

300
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,660
Please come again.

301
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,250
