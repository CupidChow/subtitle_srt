(General Manager's Office)

5
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,460
Come in.

6
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,500
Mr. Zhang.

7
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,100
Come.

8
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,780
Have some water.

9
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,740
Tiantian.

10
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,700
Mr. Zhang.

11
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,500
I'm Yuanyuan.

12
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,100
Yuanyuan.

13
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,180
You worked overtime last night?

14
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,580
Our company

15
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,020
doesn't encourage this.

16
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,740
Finish your daily tasks
during working hours.

17
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,460
Right?

18
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,020
But your dedication

19
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,140
in doing your best for the company

20
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,060
deserves to be acknowledged.

21
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,140
Mr. Zhang.

22
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,300
But

23
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,420
smashing the window didn't earn you

24
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,060
any cookie points,

25
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,740
you know?

26
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,380
But it's fine.

27
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,460
I've settled it for you.

28
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,060
The company won't reprimand you

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,900
because of it.

30
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,900
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

31
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,060
Save the thanks.

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,100
Just refrain from working late again.

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,900
Well then,

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
I'll get back to work, sir.

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,820
You're a top student
from Qing University?

36
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,580
Yes.

37
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,500
I graduated in management.

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,780
Management major?

39
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,700
There's an opening at Operations.

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,740
Inform HR.

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,580
Tell them I assigned you.

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,740
You have studied management.

43
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,260
You should do that
in the right department.

44
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,660
(Hardworking people like us)

45

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,180
It's nothing.

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,580
Work hard.

50
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,020
You can do it.

51
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,060
This

52
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,020
will be your new desk.

53
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,300
Get settled.

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,260
Thanks, Ms. Lan.

55

(Operations Department.
Welcome, Yuanyuan. Hello)

56
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,940
(Luna, you tried to set me up?)

57
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,140
(I bet you didn't think
I'd actually come out on top.)

58
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:21,141
(I will have everyone see me
with my effort.)

59
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,940
This month,

60
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,700
I know

61
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
everyone's been very stressed with work.

62
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,500
(Monthly Meeting)
However,

63
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,740
there's something worth celebrating.

64
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,940
We finally got the project

65
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,300
from Beijian Company.

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,380
I'd like to thank every one
of my colleagues.

67
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,300
Not to forget Mr. Zhang.

68
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,940
Without your guidance this month,

69
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,580
we couldn't have achieved it.

70
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,900
Next,

71
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,820
the names

72
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,300
that I'm about to read out,

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,140
your bonus will be doubled.

74
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,580
In addition,

75
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,380
the Employee of the Month

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,460
will get triple.

77
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,820
Luna.

78
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,620
A special mention.

79
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,140
Thank you.

80
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,740
(Employee of the Month)
She's a new employee.

81
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Good work.

82
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,020
Please sit.

83
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:21,940
Now,

84
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
the following names

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,740
will get a double bonus.

86
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,260
Coco.

87
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,340

88

89
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
Fu Diguo.

90
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,940
Congrats.

91
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,700
Michael.

92
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,180
Tiantian.

93
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,820
Tiantian.

94
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,940
Mr. Zhang?

95
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,500
Refill my cup, please.

96
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay.

97
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,300
Jin.

98
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,900
Congrats.

99
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,140
Wenwen.

100
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,380
That's all.

101
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Enjoy the bonuses.

102
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,060
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

103
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,300
Thanks, Ms. Lan.

104
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Keep it up, everyone.

105
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,260
Do your best.

106
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,380
There will be more bonuses next month.

107
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,700
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

108
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,380
How about this?

109
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,580
Free flow of drinks at the KTV tonight.

110
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,500
We'll go to the most expensive place.

111
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,020
Sure.

112
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,180
I've got three times the bonus anyway.

113
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,260
It's all on me.

114
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,975
(A few days later)

115
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,580
It's you.

116
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,540
What are you doing?

117
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,220
I...

118
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,220
I've followed you a few times,

119
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,020
hoping to tell you about this.

120
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,140
But

121
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,700
I didn't know how to say it.

122
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,420
You're crazy.

123
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,100
Why are you following me for no reason?

124
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,740
I guess I didn't do a good job.

125
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,220
Didn't they say

126
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,340
hard work

127
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
would be acknowledged by all?

128
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:54,475
(Have you smiled today?
Awaiting your vote)

129
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,580
Who's been secretly snacking
in the office?

130
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,100
There are so many ants.

131
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,980
Ms. Lan asked me to buy these
for everyone.

132
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Help yourselves.

133
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,740
Alright.

134
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,340
Here.

135
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,220
Did you guys hear

136
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,940
about a pervert in the area?

137
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,100
He would stalk and assault

138
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
all types of women.

139
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,580
Did you guys hear?

140
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,500
Even a type like me?

141
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,940
Indiscriminate attacks.

142
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,980
He attacks everyone.

143
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Us women

144
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,500
really have to protect ourselves.

145
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,980
Whether a man or woman,

146
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,860
when you're alone outside,

147
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,580
you always have to be alert.

148
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,580
So I recently learned

149
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
some self-defense moves for women.

150
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,940
Shall I teach you all?

151
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,460
Sure.

152
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,420
Sounds good.

153
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,980
Everyone, gather around.

154
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,220
Yes, come on.

155
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,100
There was a scene in a movie.

156
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,620
If you get attacked by someone
from the back...

157
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
Try it.

158
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,340
Hey.

159
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,020
I think I was stalked last night.

160
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,900
Speak louder.

161
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,820
We didn't hear what you said.

162
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,860
I don't think she spoke.

163
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,020
I hope you won't get scared

164
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,380
after I tell you.

165
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,220
What?

166
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,420
Is that true?

167
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,740
My brother-in-law

168
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,860
is the director of a police station.

169
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,420
Let me give you his contact.

170
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,500
Come.

171
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,580
I'll add you on WeChat.

172
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,340
There will be a reward for catching him.

173
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,180
Your saying are pretty scary.

174
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,620
Yuanyuan.

175
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,100
I've got this gadget
to ward off perverts.

176
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Let me give you the link.

177
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,300
I don't have your WeChat, Yuanyuan.

178
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Let me add you.

179
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,300
Let's all add her.

180
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,180
Come.

181
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's all add her.

182
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,500
(Luna, now that I'm in this seat,)

183
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,740
(I'll never give it back to you.)

184
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,700
What happened next?

185
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,460
Did that pervert stalk you again?

186
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,860
Did you see his face?

187
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,300
How tall is he?

188
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,100
How does he look?

189
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,460
I heard on the news

190
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,820
that the guy used to be a courier.

191
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,580
Till now,

192
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,980
no one has seen his face.

193
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,820
A courier?

194
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,820
That's right.

195
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,580
Yesterday,

196
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,420
a parcel was delivered to my house.

197
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,500
(Soon after I got out of the elevator,)

198
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,620
(I saw the parcel)

199
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,020
(placed in front of my door.)

200
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,220
(It's been raining
the past two days, right?)

201
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
(The box got wet)

202
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,740
(and the tape loosened.)

203
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,340
(I nudged it open with my umbrella.)

204
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,820
What was it?

205
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,220
A toy.

206
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,100
For adults or kids?

207
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,620
I mean,

208
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,980
there are toys for adults too.

209
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,740
Like Lego.

210
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
It's the one everyone has seen.

211
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,380
This little teddy.

212
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,700
It's the teddy Luna hangs on her bag.

213
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,340
Did Luna send it to you?

214
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,500
You're scared but you want to know more.

215
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,180
So was it?

216
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,980
Any new stories today?

217
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,500
(Isn't that Luna's teddy?)

218
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,700
(Yeah.)

219
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
(I thought she said
it was a limited edition.)

220
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,220
(Are you saying it was Luna?)

221
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,060
(Listen.)

222
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,740
(I wasn't going to tell you guys this.)

223
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,220
(The last time
when I got locked in the office...)

224
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,820
(No wonder she's being so generous.)

225
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,700
(It is hard to fathom a person's mind.)

226
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,460
(Luna.)

227
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,180
(My grievance with you is not over yet.)

228
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,460
(This is only a little punishment)

229
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,500
(for you.)

230
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,125
(General Manager's Office)

231
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,460
Come in.

232
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,420
Have you resolved the issue?

233
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
You remember it.

234
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,420
Don't just talk.

235
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:44,980
Eat some sushi.

236
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,100
Mr. Zhang.

237
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,180
Did you mean the stalking incident?

238
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,580
Or about the colleagues?

239
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,700
How come there's always
something up with you?

240
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,580
Tell me about it.

241
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,100
I was indeed stalked.

242
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,100
Did you see their face?

243
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,980
Not clearly.

244
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,580
(They follow me like a shadow.)

245
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,740
(Even when I get home,)

246
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,460
I still feel like someone

247
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,540
is by the door,

248
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,620
(peeping in through the keyhole.)

249
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:31,980
Say no more.

250
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,700
Report to the police.

251
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,740
It's really not necessary, Mr. Zhang.

252
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Besides, I...

253
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,420
don't have proof.

254
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:43,820
Okay, listen.

255
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,340
Stay calm.

256
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,220
Leave work earlier.

257
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,820
When you're done with work,

258
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,100
I'll give you a ride home.

259
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,020
Hey, you.

260
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,820
Hurry up.

261
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,660
The jam's about to start.

262
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,980
Quickly.

263
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,380
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

264
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,260
See you.

265
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,820
So clumsy.

266
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,660
Thanks.

267
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,140
Stay safe.

268
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,100
Call me if anything happens.

269
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:51,860
Okay.

270
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,820
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

271
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,500
Let's go.

272
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,620
(Who could the stalker be?)

273
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,180
(Is it Luna?)

274
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,340
(Or is it just my imagination?)

275
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,660
Yuanyuan.

276
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,380
I heard you were stalked a few days ago.

277
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,020
What happened?

278
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,820
How are you?

279
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,020
I'm fine.

280
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,820
Looks to me like you're not doing fine.

281
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,020
Why don't you take some days off?

282
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm fine, really.

283
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,980
Talk to me if you change your mind.

284
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,100
Come with me.

285
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,900
What do you get out of framing me?

286
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,300
I could ask you the same.

287
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
You think I don't know

288
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
what you've done?

289
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,380
You said you were stalked, right?

290
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,380
Take a look at yourself first.

291
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,620
Who would stalk you?

292
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Listen.

293
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,340
Lying to gain attention

294
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,260
is fine.

295
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,020
But now you're slandering me.

296
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,500
For that,
you have to bear responsibility.

297
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,340
I bear responsibility?

298
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,540
You should be the one held responsible.

299
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,780
What are you saying?

300
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,500
You took my opportunity to present.

301
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
You locked me up in the office.

302
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,940
I'm sure you were the one
who sent me the parcel

303
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,660
to scare me, right?

304
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,620
What I did to you

305
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,820
was merely to teach you

306
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,780
a lesson.

307
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,580
You know well what you have done to me.

308
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,100
Hang on.

309
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,420
What on earth are you talking about?

310
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,140
(Before the last meeting,)

311
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,060
(I didn't even see you.)

312
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,380
Even if you do a good job,

313
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,540
newbies like us
won't be given the chance.

314
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,020
(I was sending
a voice message to my friend.)

315
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,340
(I wasn't criticizing you at all.)

316
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:34,900
Mr. Zhang.

317
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,500
This is a new recruit
of the Planning Department,

318
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,020
Luna.

319
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,980
Where is Yuanyuan?

320
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,180
(When Ms. Lan asked me,)

321
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,580
(I didn't know where you were at all.)

322
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
I think she's not here yet.

323
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,820
Wang.

324
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,900
There's no one upstairs.

325
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,540
Don't forget to lock the doors.

326
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,340
Got it, Mr. Zhang.

327
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,580
You guys hurry home.

328
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,380
There's a storm coming.

329
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,900
Stay safe.

330
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,900
Okay.

331
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,660
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

332
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,180
(The day you stayed back to work,)

333
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,980
(Mr. Zhang had asked us
to leave earlier.)

334
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,180
(I have no idea)

335
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,620
(who locked you in the office.)

336
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,500
(Until I heard
our colleagues talk about)

337
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,740
(the little teddy you found.)

338
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,620
I had thought

339
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,860
you were just timid

340
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,660
and an introvert.

341
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,340
I didn't think you'd have
such an active imagination.

342
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,780
Frame you?

343
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,100
Why should I do that?

344
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,100
No.

345
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,100
The teddy sent in a parcel.

346
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,020
You sent it, right?

347
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,820
Did you start believing your own lies

348
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,900
because you lied too much?

349
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,380
What makes you think

350
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,180
I know your address?

351
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,820
The mooncakes for Mid-Autumn,

352
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,740
you were tasked to send them out.

353
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,500
So you know everyone's address.

354
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,820
My gosh.

355
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,820
I only arranged for the courier.

356
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,500
Do you know how many people there are

357
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,140
in the company?

358
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,060
Plus the names and addresses
of the clients,

359
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,140
there are more than 600.

360
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,980
I made copies,

361
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,820
I made a list,

362
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
then I sorted everything.

363
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,060
Do you know how much time I spent?

364
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,980
I was so exhausted,

365
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,020
you think I had the time
to single you out?

366
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,500
Stop thinking the world
revolves around you.

367
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,540
You're not that important.

368
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:23,150
(Dad)

369
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,300
(Diagnosis: The patient has neurasthenia
caused by high work pressure)

370
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,100
Why didn't you pick up my calls

371
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,980
these past few days?

372
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,740
Did something happen?

373
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,580
I'm busy.

374
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
How is work?

375
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,300
Not going well?

376
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:57,980
Dad.

377
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,820
Aside from asking me about my work,

378
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,860
whether or not I made new friends,

379
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,340
if I bought a new home yet,

380
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,900
Neurasthenia caused by work pressure

381
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,900
do you have anything else

382
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,740
to ask me?

383
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,500
If not, I'll hang up.

384
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,180
What do you expect me to ask then?

385
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,340
Forget it.

386
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
There's no way to explain it to you.

387
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,420
(From now on, nothing matters.)

388
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
(Before, I invested my efforts
in the wrong place.)

389
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,750
(Resignation Letter)

390
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,500
Ms. Lan.

391
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,100
I used to think

392
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,740
I only need to work hard

393
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,260
and I'll gain recognition from others.

394
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,300
But I was wrong.

395
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,100
I don't have to be so persistent

396
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,380
on everything.

397
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,180
I still have time

398
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,540
and more opportunities

399
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,140
for me to find a job that suits me.

400
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,580
Thank you for your guidance
all this while.

401
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,300
What's happened?

402
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,500
She suddenly told me she was quitting.

403
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,260
No idea.

404
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,660
She gave a weird speech

405
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,420
and just left.

406
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,740
(A few months later)
(Can you share with us the inspiration)

407
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,340
(to write the book
"Anti Workplace Manipulation,)

408
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,820
(Be Your Own Boss")

409
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
(I got the inspiration)

410
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,660
(from my previous working experience.)

411
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,620
(I'd like to use the book
to tell everyone)

412
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,740
(that the workplace
isn't the only thing in your life.)

413
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,375
(Anti Workplace Manipulation)
So what is the message

414
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:32,020
(Be Your Own Boss)
that you're trying

415
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,740
to convey through your book?

416
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,540
Previously, due to pressure
at the workplace,

417
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,900
I began to develop hallucinations.

418
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,060
I'd picture my colleagues
as illusory enemies.

419
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,780
But they were all my imagination.

420
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,900
(Competition within the rat race
is meaningless.)

421
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,420
(Break free
from the twisted environment.)

422
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,500
(Our life)

423
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,620
(can become more wonderful.)

424
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,100
(Yuanyuan chose to resign)

425
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,140
(so that she could do what she likes)

426
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,140
(and get rid of people who repress her.)

427
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,540
(With that,)

428
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,780
(she's welcomed
a new chapter in her life.)

429
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,340
I get it now, Ms. Wang.

430
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,420
You're trying to say

431
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,780
that we're always doing our best

432
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,540
to earn the attention
and approval of others

433
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,660
and ultimately become successful.

434
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,260
However,

435
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,380
there is no shortcut to success.

436
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,300
One needs to put in real effort

437
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,820
in order to have the chance to succeed.

438
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,675
(Recording)

439
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,580
As an editor,

440
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,460
you say that my ideas are dull.

441
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,500
They're neither scary nor fantastical.

442
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Come to think of it,
you're pretty old-school.

443
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,820
The company must be crazy
to have chosen me.

444
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,380
Right?

445
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,140
Ms. Wang.

446
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,820
This means, as an editor...

447
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,580
I'll shut up.

448
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,220
I'm just an emotionless driver.

449
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,140
Ms. Wang.

450
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,020
To me,

451
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,380
whether or not someone has worked hard

452
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,220
or gets acknowledged,

453
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,740
isn't that important.

454
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,540
So in your opinion,

455
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,060
as an editor, what do you think

456
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,860
is the most important?

457
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,540
The most important thing is being...
your editor.
