00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,900
=Episode 11=

4
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,840
I came here today to bid you farewell.

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
This is the voice recorder.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,400
I've handed over all my work

7
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,600
and submitted my resignation
to the company.

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,280
I'll arrange for someone to take over.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,560
Don't be ridiculous.

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,200
Ms. Wang,

11
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,560
goodbye.

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,520
All I did was have a drink.
Did he need to go that far?

13
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,960
Hello, are you Miss Wang Putao?

14
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,720
Yes, I am.

15
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm a delivery rider from Ledao.

16
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,280
We received an order

17
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,960
from Mr. Feng Tianlan

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,680
to send you back to the hotel.

19
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,880
So are you ready to leave now?

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,400
What?

21
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,640
What did you say?

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,280
"Hello,

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,120
are you Miss Wang Putao?"

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,840
Yes.

25
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Mr. Feng Tianlan said
he consulted the doctor.

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
Other than having too much drink,

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
you're fine.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,360
So he asked me
to send you back to the hotel.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,120
He hired a food deliveryman
to "send" me back to the hotel, huh?

30
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,360
Feng Tianlan,

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,400
you definitely ranked top three

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,160
in the Global Absurdity Rankings.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,720
You have to return the hospital gown.

34
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,280
I'm not leaving.

35
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,960
Hello, Miss Wang.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
Mr. Feng Tianlan asked me
to give this to you.

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,960
Based on Mr. Feng Tianlan's request,

38
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
I've arranged another room for you.

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
He must be your boyfriend.

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
He's really good to you.

41
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
What are you talking about?

42
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,400
At most, it's a business relationship.

43
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,970
(Remember to eat this.)

44
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,280
Hello?

45
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,280
Ms. Wang,

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,200
good morning.

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,560
Get to the point.

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
I just wanted to talk to you

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,440
about Feng Tianlan's resignation.

50
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,200
So he really resigned?

51
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,760
I didn't see this coming, either.

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
After all, he has been

53
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
your longest-serving editor recently.

54
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,640
I even had a tiny illusion

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,900
(Remember to eat this)
that he would stay with you

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,200
(Remember to eat this)
until the completion of the manuscript.

57
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
But who would have known

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,520
that Feng

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
would waste my good intention?

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
However, Ms. Wang,

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,760
you can't stop
the progress of the manuscript.

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
Many readers

63
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
are eagerly anticipating your work.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
You seem to have
some stories in mind already.

65
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,680
Why don't you start writing the book?

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm not rushing you to update.

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,080
Just try to start writing it, OK?

68
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,880
No matter what happens,

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll be there with you.

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
Shall I stay a little longer?

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,880
(I think...)

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,320
(it's recording.)

73
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,120
(Ms. Wang,)

74
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,520
(I'm leaving.)

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,200
(You may not understand.)

76
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,640
(Of course,)

77
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,120
(I don't expect anyone
to understand, either.)

78
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
(When I saw you lying in the bathtub,)

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,680
I admit

80
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,560
I felt fear at that moment.

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,880
This fear made me timid

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
(and unable to face it.)

83
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,320
(Before I leave,)

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
I also want to tell you a story.

85
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
I hope this story

86
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
can clear up
your misunderstanding about me...

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,880
Never mind.

88
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,280
I should start the story from here.

89
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
(You already know)

90
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,080
(that I'm rather timid.)

91
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,520
(Specifically,
someone who tends to obey)

92
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,200
(and doesn't know how to refuse.)

93
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
(After all, with so many siblings)

94
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,760
(and nearly a hundred family members,)

95
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,760
(there's always a need
for survival skills.)

96
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,520
(This situation improved significantly)

97
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
(during my rebellious phase
in high school.)

98
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
(But unexpectedly,)

99
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
(just as I began to rebel,)

100
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,920
(fate struck me down.)

101
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,640
(I wanted to let loose a little
after the high school entrance exam,)

102
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
(but I ended up breaking my leg.)

103
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,720
(As a result, I spent my first semester)

104
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,760
(in high school in the classroom)

105
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
(so I didn't make that many friends.)

106
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Guys,

107
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,640
this

108
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,680
is a new transfer student in our class.

109
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,760
His name is Zhang Haibei.

110
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's welcome him.

111
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,920
Haibei, you can sit there.

112
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
Go and sit over there.

113
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,360
All right, guys.

114
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,760
We'll start
with your self-study session.

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
This guy

116
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
is the son of my dad's new boss

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,720
at the company.

118
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
His family must be rich, then.

119
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes.

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
But we are people
of two different worlds.

121
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,640
My dad said

122
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,360
this city is waiting for his dad

123
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,360
to revive the local economy.

124
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
They have meetings every day.

125
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,480
That's a big deal.

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
You're really nosy.

127
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,570
(I Can Still See Her)

128
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
Feng Tianlan?

129
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,160
Is that character "Tian" or "Fu?"

130
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,280
It's "Tian".

131
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
Mr. Feng Tianlan,

132
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
I like your seat.

133
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
How about you scoot over

134
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,000
and let me sit here?

135
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,520
What a weirdo.

136
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,080
Didn't you say you want this seat?

137
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,400
(After that unfriendly encounter,)

138
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,040
(I hardly talked to Zhang Haibei.)

139
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,640
Tianlan, can you lend me five yuan?

140
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
I want to buy water.

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,640
Sure.

142
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:56,830
Hey.

143
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,280
Do you know
why the teacher called us here?

144
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
Come in.

145
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,920
I called you two here for one thing.

146
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
The new semester of Grade 11 is starting.

147
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,280
Last year,

148
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,080
Tianlan missed military training
because of the fractured.

149
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,560
And Haibei,

150
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,540
you also missed it
because you transferred here.

151
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm sure you know that for our school,

152
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,000
you won't receive
your graduation certificate

153
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,480
if you don't participate
in military training.

154
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
So we have discussed this

155
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
and decided to let you

156
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
join the military training
with the new students next week.

157
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,480
(At the thought
of attending military training at 17,)

158
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,000
(my rebellious side emerged once again.)

159
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,600
(It was during the time)

160
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
(League of Legends was so popular.)

161
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
(That night, my classmates and I)

162
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,640
(planned to skip class
to go to an Internet cafe.)

163
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,120
(As a result...)

164
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,360
(It really hurts.)

165
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,760
At ease!

166
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,400
Reporting, sir.

167
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,000
What's the matter?

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,520
I don't feel well.

169
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,920
Go get some rest for now.

170
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,400
Thank you, sir.

171
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,400
Attention!

172
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,560
Count off!

173
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,720
What happened to your arm?

174
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
It was just bad luck.

175
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
I hurt my arm.

176
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,240
So you're joining with an injured arm?

177
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
You have a problem with it?

178
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,040
What's so interesting about the plane?

179
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,240
No idea.

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
Small airplane.

181
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,000
I love Marvel superheroes.

182
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,200
They are so cool.

183
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
But I'm a fan of DC.

184
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm a Manchester United fan.

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I like Barcelona.

186
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,320
I enjoy eating at McDonald's,

187
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,160
and I don't like KFC.

188
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,480
I like KFC

189
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,640
and don't like McDonald's.

190
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,720
I love reading
Wang Putao's detective novels.

191
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,400
Who?

192
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,480
Wang Putao is a rising novelist

193
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,080
who's extremely mysterious

194
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,240
but has a great imagination.

195
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,960
Her recently published novel
is really good.

196
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,280
I even thought about calling
the publishing company

197
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,760
to rush her for a new novel.

198
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
But there is no information

199
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,920
about her online.

200
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,000
Apart from the publishing company,

201
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,240
we, as her fans, know nothing about her.

202
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,600
Then, I'll buy one and read it too.

203
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Don't push yourself to read them.

204
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,520
Her novels

205
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,360
are on the darker side.

206
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,720
The police officers will catch me soon.

207
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,240
Don't sleep.

208
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,920
- Stand still.
- What's so funny?

209
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,480
Chin up, chest out, stomach in.

210
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,000
(Why aren't you sleeping
so late at night?)

211
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,560
(During that time,)

212
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,520
(Haibei introduced me to your novels.)

213
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
(They were thrilling
and full of suspense.)

214
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
(There were many elements
in your stories.)

215
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,520
Feng Tianlan!

216
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,320
- Let's go.
- Okay.

217
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,640
I suddenly thought of something.

218
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,640
What is it?

219
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,360
It's nothing.

220
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,640
We're going to be late. Hurry.

221
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,040
But what is it?

222
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,520
Nothing.

223
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,240
Let's go

224
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
or we'll be late.

225
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,400
Come on.

226
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,760
Hurry. Go, go, go.

227
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,240
(Back then,)

228
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
(Haibei told me)

229
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,120
(that youth was short)

230
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,480
(and that we should try
interesting things)

231
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,080
(that we hadn't done before.)

232
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,480
Come on.

233
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,720
Let's go to the beach.

234
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't just stand there. Come on.

235
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,650
(Zhengzhengnan Beef Brisket)

236
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,760
Eat it.

237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,760
Thank you.

238
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,440
This place is even better
than the time-honored restaurant.

239
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,880
The time-honored restaurant
is already closed

240
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,520
because it's already late.

241
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,680
Boss,

242
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
two bottles of beer, please.

243
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
You're ordering beer?

244
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,880
Yeah.

245
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,880
Cycling under the influence?

246
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
Let's make a deal.

247
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
After our 18th birthday next year

248
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,720
when we can legally drink,

249
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,960
let's drink a whole crate.

250
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,440
Deal.

251
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,360
Drink until we're drunk!

252
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,600
Come in.

253
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,770
(Feng Tianlan. Zhang Haibei)

254
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,640
Do you know

255
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,560
why I called you two here?

256
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,120
Stop pretending.

257
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,440
You ranked bottom two

258
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
in the class.

259
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,440
Tell your parents to come tomorrow.

260
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
I need to have a good chat with them

261
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
about what we'll do
regarding your grades after this.

262
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,600
You rank second to last
in the entire grade.

263
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,000
For goodness sake, Feng Tianlan.

264
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,960
You're such a disappointment.

265
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,480
You weren't like this
when you were younger.

266
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
How did you become like this?

267
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,400
If you ask me,

268
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
Zhang Haibei must be the bad influence.

269
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,200
How can you be compared to him?

270
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,760
He

271
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,360
already has a path paved for him.

272
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,280
Maybe he'll go abroad in a few days.

273
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,120
You always hang out with him.

274
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,360
Do you think you can go abroad too?

275
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,720
From now on,

276
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
don't hang out with him,

277
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,880
do you hear me?

278
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,200
You...

279
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Did you get scolded?

280
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,040
Me, too.

281
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,360
Why are you so happy about it?

282
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,360
It's pretty nice to get scolded.

283
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
At least, I get their attention.

284
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,440
I told my parents

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
that I didn't want to go abroad.

286
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,440
I'm not like you

287
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,320
and you're not me.

288
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,920
I'll just be honest with you.

289
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,160
I don't want to go to a university.

290
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,880
With my current grades,
I won't make it anyway.

291
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,480
Don't be ridiculous.

292
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,480
You must get yourself into a university.

293
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,600
I heard studying at the university
is pretty cool.

294
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,760
You won't be forced to do anything.

295
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,600
You'll have more freedom.

296
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Your watch is ringing.

297
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,520
Your watch.

298
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,240
It's yours.

299
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,080
Oh, sorry about that.

300
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,080
How about this?

301
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,520
Let's make a pact then.

302
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,840
Well, let's make a promise
to enter the same college

303
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,480
and continue with our crazy adventures.

304
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,720
So what are we going to do?

305
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,680
Well,

306
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
let's start

307
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,960
by making a to-do list with 20 things.

308
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,880
Write down anything

309
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,760
we want to do.

310
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,520
All right.

311
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
Let me think.

312
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,400
I want to learn to play the guitar.

313
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,720
Me, too.

314
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,600
Then, we can form a band.

315
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,720
What else do you want to do?

316
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,960
I want to ride a motorcycle.

317
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Do you have a motorcycle license?

318
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
No, but I will take the test.

319
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,880
I'll be an adult then.

320
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,160
We'll be adults
when we study at the university.

321
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,520
Okay, fine.

322
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,370
(4. Perform rap together)

323
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:20,070
(5. Be accepted into the Chinese Department
to work as Wang Putao's editor.)

324
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,240
(I suddenly thought of something.)

325
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,440
(What is it?)

326
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,400

00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
(He didn't keep)
