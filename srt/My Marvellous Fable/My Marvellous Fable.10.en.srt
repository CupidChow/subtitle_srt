=My Marvellous Fable=

3
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 10=

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,900
(I can't let her wallow in depression.)

5
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,020
(Should I)

6
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,380
(try to cheer her up?)

7
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,340
By the way, Ms. Wang.

8
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,580
Your room faces the east, right?

9
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,020
4404, fourth floor.
At the end of the alley

10
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,500
Don't you think
it's a little bit unlucky?

11
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,180
I've been thinking about it
since yesterday.

12
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,580
Do you want me
to switch the room for you?

13
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,340
Why are you so superstitious?

14
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,420
Ms. Wang.

15
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,860
You need to be respectful
and wary of the unknown.

16
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,980
(Going down.)

17
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,620
Did someone press for the elevator
in the parking lot?

18
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,220
By the way, Ms. Wang.

19
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,420
I know that you don't believe
in superstitions.

20
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,860
But there are things

21
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,060
that can't be explained through science.

22
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,020
We'd better

23
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,700
adhere to the knowledge
that has been passed down to us.

24
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,700
You won't lose anything.

25
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,980
For example,

26
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,940
knock on the door before you go in.

27
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
The room has been empty for too long.

28
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,020
You have to break the deathly quiet.

29
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,380
(B1.)

30
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,140
(Going down.)

31
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,540
Another thing.

32
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,740
After you enter the room,

33
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,420
turn on the television at once.

34
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,220
But I don't watch television.

35
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,980
I'm not asking you to watch television.

36
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,500
I just want you to create some noise

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
so that the room will be alive.

38
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,980
(B2.)

39
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
(Going down.)

40
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,260
Why is it still going down?

41
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,300
Someone pressed the button
for the elevator maybe.

42
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,860
By the way,

43
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,260
when you reach your room later,

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,540
don't just keep quiet.

45
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Turn on all the taps.

46
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,460
Better to open the wardrobe too.

47
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,300
(B3.)

48
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
(Going up.)

49
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,940
By the way, Ms. Wang.

50
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,860
Room 4404 has a king-size bed.

51
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,900
You'd better put...

52
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,220
Are you done yet?

53
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,260
For this kind of thing,

54
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900
you don't have to mind it

55
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,020
if you aren't superstitious.

56
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,980
Yes.

57
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,900
Yes.

58
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:43,980
We are here.

59
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,500
Thank you.

60
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,860
Call me if anything happens.

61
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,020
The water pressure
of this hotel is terrible.

62
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,420
(We wasted a day doing nothing.)

63
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,300
(When will we reach Qionghai?)

64
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,580
(If...)

65
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,780
(Xu Youguang was once
in Wang Putao's life,)

66
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,300
(could it be that her previous stories)

67
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
(were also true?)

68
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,340
(Yuanyuan.)

69
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,740
(Luna.)

70
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,900
(Mr. Zhang.)

71
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,740
Hello, Ms. Wang.

72
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,620
Ms. Wang?

73
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,420
Putao.

74
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,060
Wang Putao!

75
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Ms. Wang!

76
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,980
Ms. Wang!

77
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
Ms. Wang.

78
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,460
Are you looking for me?

79
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,100
Are you not asleep yet?

80
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,100
No.

81
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,460
I'm still awake too.

82
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,380
You accidentally called me, right?

83
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,180
Yes.

84
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,820
I guess.

85
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,460
It's good that you are fine.

86
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,020
Well.

87
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,260
I'll return to my room now.

88
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,660
Go ahead.

89
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,540
What is it?

90
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,300
Do you...

91
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,260
want me to stay with you?

92
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,220
What?

93
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,220
Nothing.

94
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,460
Nothing.

95
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,740
Have a good rest.

96
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,180
(Do you want me to stay with you?)

97
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,260
(What were you doing,)

98
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,180
(Feng Tianlan?)

99
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,540
(Stay with you?)

100
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,980
(But she didn't reject me.)

101
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,820
(Don't let your imagination run wild)

102
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
(just because she's pretty.)

103
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,300
(You two are just working partners.)

104
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,140
(Working partners.)

105
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,380
(Maybe I'm overthinking this.)

106
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,740
(Who is it?)

107
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,140
(Who's calling me so late at night?)

108
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,980
(Ms. Wang)

109
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,340
(Wang Putao?)

110
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,500
Hello.

111
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,380
Ms. Wang.

112
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
Why are you still awake?

113
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,020
Do you have

114
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,100
sleeping pills?

115
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,980
No.

116
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
But I have melatonin.

117
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,500
Come in.

118
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,300
Here. Give it to me.

119
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,980
Okay.

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,340
What's wrong?

121
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,580
Can't you sleep?

122
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,020
Sleeping pills are not good
for your health.

123
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Although melatonin can help with sleep,

124
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,740
it'll still affect your health.

125
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,500
Ms. Wang.

126
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,140
You are so talkative.

127
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,420
This will do.

128
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,300
It's hot.

129
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,540
It's not.

130
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,940
How do you know?

131
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,820
I made sure it's not.

132
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,060
What are you doing?

133
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,820
Your hand is too cold.

134
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
If it's too cold,

135
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,340
you can't sleep well either.

136
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,140
(Body Warmer Patch)
After I leave,

137
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,300
stick this on your clothing.

138
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,980
I'll go to my room now.

139
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,820
Call me

140
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,700
if you need anything.

141
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,900
Okay.

142
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,460
Goodnight.

143
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,580
Goodnight.

144
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,100
Ms. Wang.

145
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,900
I'm fine.

146
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,060
I'll hang up now.

147
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,900
Ms. Wang.

148
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,140
Maybe

149
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,980
you shouldn't hang up.

150
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,860
Actually, it's quite strange today.

151
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,500
I can't fall asleep either.

152
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,180
Nonsense.
I'm not having trouble falling asleep.

153
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,980
What I meant is...

154
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,940
No. I'm not scared.

155
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,980
I just wanted to ask,

156
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,020
are you having trouble falling asleep?

157
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,620
After all,

158
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,660
when we are in an unfamiliar place,

159
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,380
we usually suffer from insomnia.

160
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,260
I can't sleep either.

161
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm very sleepy.

162
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,140
But I'm not feeling well after dinner.

163
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,660
It was your fault.

164
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,820
Yes.

165
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,980
It was my fault tonight.

166
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,060
I shouldn't have mentioned
those scary things to you.

167
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,860
Stop it.

168
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,620
Okay.

169
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,980
I won't mention it anymore.

170
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,100
It's okay.

171
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
I'll be with you.

172
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,460
You'll be with me?

173
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,820
No matter what happens,

174
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,340
I'll be with you.

175
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,740
Feng Tianlan.

176
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,940
I'm not afraid of the past

177
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,580
but something
even more terrifying than the past.

178
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,060
But I can face it myself.

179
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,380
As I said,

180
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,580
I'll be with you.

181
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,180
You don't have to face it yourself.

182
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,260
(I think I had a dream.)

183
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,060
(I saw my younger self again.)

184
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,500
(But no matter how I shouted,)

185
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,180
(I couldn't make a sound.)

186
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,740
(I was only surrounded)

187
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,260
(by the sound of the sea.)

188
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,980
Ms. Wang.

189
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,540
Ms. Wang.

190
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,820
Ms. Wang.

191
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,860
Ms. Wang!

192
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
(Do you believe)

193
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,620
(in spirits in the afterworld?)

194
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,260
Putao.

195
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,940
Putao!

196
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,420
(Fallen ill.)

197
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,900
(Ms. Wang)
(Do you have)

198
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,180
(sleeping pills?)

199
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,620
She'll be fine.

200
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,780
(She'll be fine.)

201
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,620
(She'll be fine.)

202
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,660
(Wang Putao.)

203
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,380
(Why did you do that?)

204
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,900
(Inpatient Department)

205
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,740
Doctor,

206
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,540
is she okay?

207
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,980
She's fine.

208
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,100
There are some grazes and bruises

209
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,300
on her left leg and right hand.

210
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,260
I asked her about it just now.

211
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,260
She was in a daze,
but she understood me.

212
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,980
She just wanted to take a bath.

213
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,580
But the tub was too slippery.

214
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,380
Luckily,

215
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,420
you got to her in time.

216
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,260
Otherwise...

217
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,420
(No wonder he liked your books.)

218
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,820
(Maybe the two of you)

219
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,260
(think alike about a lot of things.)

220
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,740
(Maybe I can only stop here.)

221
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,260
(I don't want)

222
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,460
(to go through
this kind of thing again.)

223
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,620
Where am I?

224
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,740
You are awake.

225
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,380
Last night,

226
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,380
you got drunk

227
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,860
and fell into the tub.

228
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,020
Ms. Wang.

229
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,260
This is the voice recorder.

230
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
I've put those previous recordings

231
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,580
into words

232
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,140
and sent them to my team leader's email.

233
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,540
I've already handed over my work.

234
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,620
And I've sent my resignation letter
to the company.

235
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I'll arrange

236
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,140
for someone to take over.

237
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,460
I'm here today

238
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,780
to bid farewell to you.

239
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,340
Don't be ridiculous.

240
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,460
Ms. Wang.

241
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,100
Goodbye.

242
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,340
(Ms. Wang.)

243
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,940
(I'm leaving.)

244
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,820
(Maybe you won't be able to understand.)

245
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,740
(But I want to tell you a story, too.)

246
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,140
(I hope)

247
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,540
(that this story can clear up)

248
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,580
(your misunderstanding about me...)

249
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,460
(Forget it.)

250
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,740
(I should start)

251
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,420
