=Episode 21=

4
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
(Go pick up my dad first.)

5
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,300
(I still have something to do.)

6
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,700
(I'll join you as soon as possible.)

7
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,340
I'll get going, then.

8
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,420
Let me know once you've arrived.

9
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,700
Do you think
it's a little too sudden for me

10
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,620
to meet your dad like this?

11
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,340
No, it's fine.

12
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,540
I'm leaving, then.

13
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,260
Okay.

14
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,020
Hello?

15
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,860
Hello.

16
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,540
You must be Mr. Wu, right?

17
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,660
I'm Feng Tianlan.

18
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,540
I'm almost there.

19
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,540
Oh, Feng.

20
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,300
Putao informed me earlier.

21
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,260
You can come and find me directly
when you're here.

22
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,580
OK.

23
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,820
I'll see you later, then.

24
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,940
(Kangle Nursing Home)

25
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,140
(Fortune and misfortune
are often interconnected.)

26
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,260
(When he's questioning me,)

27
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,300
(it can also be seen
as me questioning him.)

28
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,260
Mr. Wang.

29
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,980
(Yes, my surname is Wang.)

30
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,420
(You get one point.)

31
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,540
Can you still remember

32
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,260
what you did yesterday?

33
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,540
(What else could it be?)

34
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,420
(You all know what I did.)

35
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,260
Can't you recall anything at all?

36
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,820
Even a small part will do.

37
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
(Every day is the same.)

38
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,860
(I can even memorize it
backward perfectly.)

39
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,380
(But I won't tell you.)

40
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,980
The nurse told me
that you hadn't taken

41
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,380
any of the medication they gave you.

42
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,380
You secretly buried them in the garden.

43
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,980
You need to cooperate with us.

44
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,180
Only then can you get better day by day.

45
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,180
Am I right?

46
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,300
(They make me take medicine every day)

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,300
(and make me lie down.)

48
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,700
(Can I even get better?)

49
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,740
Don't worry.

50
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,300
We're currently making every effort

51
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
to contact your family.

52
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,940
(I have a family?)

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,540
I...

54
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
I...

55
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,740
You remember them?

56
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,820
- Ship.
- Ship?

57
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,740
When you were a mariner

58
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,140
or when you were a ship captain?

59
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,380
(I was a ship captain?)

60
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,980
(Ship)

61
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,140
Do you still remember when that was?

62
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,980
The year 2000.

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,180
The year 2000?

64
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,820
That was 21 years ago.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,620
Has it been that long?

66
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,980
Yes.

67
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,740
You said I have a family.

68
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
You do.

69
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,620
You have a wife

70
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,700
and a daughter.

71
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,260
(Temporal disorientation)
You show good recovery signs today.

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,180
If it continues like this,

73
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,940
I think...

74
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,940
Why haven't they come to visit me, then?

75
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,180
You've been quite busy lately.

76
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,380
Same as always.

77
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:34,940
As for me,

78
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,700
I feel like you're all busy

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,060
when there are many patients.

80
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,620
I actually wish you weren't busy.

81
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,140
If we're not busy,
we'd all be out of jobs.

82
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,500
That would be a good thing.

83
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,380
If you're unemployed,
it can prove one thing.

84
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,860
There are fewer patients or no patients.

85
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,940
Everyone in the country is healthy.

86
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,540
Am I right?

87
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,540
Is he getting any better?

88
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,300
He's still a little confused.

89
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,860
It's a bit worse

90
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
than when he was first brought here.

91
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,380
But this kind of illness

92
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,060
can only be slowly alleviated.

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,820
There's no cure for it.

94
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,740
The labor union

95
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,740
just sent off someone last month

96
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,380
who was in a similar situation.

97
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,980
An elderly person who lived alone.

98
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,060
I heard you managed
to contact his daughter.

99
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,060
A young man will come by later.

100
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,620
I don't even know how many calls I made.

101
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,260
She only agreed these past two days.

102
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,620
You can imagine
how much resentment there is.

103
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,380
It's been so long,

104
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,860
and she doesn't care
about her dad at all.

105
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,380
Every family has its own problems.

106
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,620
As to what exactly happened,

107
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,740
we don't know, either.

108
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,420
Doctor,

109
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,820
I'd like to know

110
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,700
how Mr. Wang Heping's

111
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,860
condition is now.

112
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Who are you to him?

113
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,500
His daughter, Wang Putao,

114
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,620
is an author.

115
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,860
I'm the editor

116
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,660
as well as her friend.

117
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,500
Wait.

118
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,260
That sounds a bit distant.

119
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,340
Her boyfriend?

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Then why isn't she here, then?

121
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,380
She's occupied with some matters now.

122
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,260
But she'll come later.

123
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,780
More precisely, she'll be here tonight.

124
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,860
Then tell her to come herself.

125
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,220
But Doctor,

126
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,780
it's like this.

127
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,580
She entrusted me to visit her father

128
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,140
and bring him back to stay
for a couple of days.

129
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Wang Heping has Alzheimer's disease.

130
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,140
The hospital requires a direct relative

131
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,220
to approve the discharge.

132
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,460
What?

133
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,740
Doctor, how about...

134
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,260
Tell her to come herself.

135
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,500
By the way,

136
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,220
you should go and visit him now.

137
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,100
No one has visited him in a long time.

138
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,820
OK.

139
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,500
(Zhang is exercising.)

140
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,460
(They're delivering dinner.)

141
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,620
(Another jab coming.)

142
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,860
(Great.)

143
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,580
(A new day begins.)

144
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,260
(There are people watching everywhere.)

145
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,340
(I have no chance to escape.)

146
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,260
Wang,

147
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,260
someone is here to visit you.

148
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,620
Who are you?

149
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,660
Mr. Wang,

150
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,260
I'm your daughter's friend.

151
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,260
Daughter?

152
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,580
Yes, your daughter.

153
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,860
(Ah, yes.)

154
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,580
(I have a daughter.)

155
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,980
Wang,

156
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,260
Feng was kind enough
to come all the way here to visit you.

157
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,740
Be more friendly to him.

158
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,460
I don't know him.

159
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:30,860
Okay.

160
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,260
I'll leave you two to it.

161
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,900
Thank you.

162
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,740
Mr. Wang,

163
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,260
I brought you some fruit.

164
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,020
Mr. Wang,

165
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,140
it was Putao...

166
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,140
I mean

167
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,620
it was Xiwen

168
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,380
who asked me to come
and visit you first.

169
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,660
Xiwen?

170
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,100
Yes, Xiwen.

171
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,380
(Nice.)

172
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,860
(My chance is here.)

173
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,340
Mr. Wang,

174
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
do you still remember your daughter?

175
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,260
Yes.

176
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,380
It's Xiwen.

177
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,620
I'm glad you still remember her.

178
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,380
And who are you?

179
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm her...

180
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,140
I'm her friend.

181
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,100
Her friend?

182
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,780
How old are you?

183
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,020
I'm 25 this year.

184
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,140
He can't be her friend.

185
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,020
Xiwen is only 17.

186
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,100
What are you trying to do to her?

187
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,620
Who are you?

188
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,340
What exactly are you up to, huh?

189
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,860
Mr. Wang,

190
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,980
I'm really her friend.

191
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
You said you were...

192
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm 18.

193
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,740
I remember now.

194
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,220
I'm 18 this year.

195
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,260
Please sit down.

196
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:22,980
Here you go.

197
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,460
You're 18?

198
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,260
Yes.

199
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,780
You look a bit older than that.

200
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,260
You said you're her friend, right?

201
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,500
Yes,

202
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,460
I'm her friend.

203
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,740
How tall are you?

204
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm 183 cm.

205
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,100
You're quite tall.

206
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,380
Where are you from?

207
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,900
I'm from Shandong.

208
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,660
Are your parents still around?

209
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,500
Are they in good health?

210
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,260
Do you have any siblings?

211
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,780
Will you go back to Shandong
in the future?

212
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,580
I would still be working in Beijing.

213
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
It's not far away, anyway.

214
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,980
Did you come to see me first,

215
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,900
or did you take her
to visit your parents first?

216
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,340
My parents?

217
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,380
Do your parents not support you?

218
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,580
They actually want me to go back home.

219
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,140
After all, it's...

220
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,500
It doesn't matter.

221
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
Those things don't matter.

222
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,100
Anyway, I feel that I'm still young

223
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,980
and can try different things.

224
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,020
Are you just "trying things" with my daughter?

225
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,860
I've been working hard.

226
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
Especially during this time,

227
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,540
your daughter quite trusts me.

228
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,580
She's just a little girl!

229
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,060
Mr. Wang.

230
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,460
This is a misunderstanding.

231
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,100
We misunderstood each other.

232
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,180
Misunderstood each other how?

233
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,620
No, we didn't.

234
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,180
Yes, we did.

235
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,980
We didn't. Not at all.

236
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,820
What exactly are you up to?

237
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,980
You're just taking advantage of her.

238
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,220
No.

239
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,580
You're trying
to take advantage of her, right?

240
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,100
Your family has found
a future wife for you.

241
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,620
Why are you pestering my daughter, huh?

242
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,740
What are you doing in Beijing, huh?

243
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,100
If she's going to Beijing,
what about her study?

244
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,580
I begged someone to get her a job.

245
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,980
I have been waiting for her to graduate.

246
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,460
How could you...

247
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,980
You're way older than her.

248
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,980
Shameless!

249
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,100
How am I being shameless?

250
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,820
I'm not.

251
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Xiwen is only 17.

252
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,460
She passed the age of 27 long ago!

253
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,340
What? 27?

254
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,820
She's already in her thirties.

255
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,100
Why are you and your daughter

256
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,980
the same?

257
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,580
Starting an argument

258
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,180
whenever you want to.

259
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,300
You're both so unreasonable.

260
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,940
Xiwen...

261
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,580
She's over 30 already?

262
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,460
Xiwen is over 30.

263
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,980
I have to go home and cook.

264
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,100
Xiwen will come home from school soon.

265
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,620
I must cook something for her.

266
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,180
I must tell you

267
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,420
the food here is terrible.

268
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,700
I'm serious.

269
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,460
My daughter can't eat the food here.

270
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:10,980
Oh,

271
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,340
how did you come here?

272
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,740
Can we get home by bus?

273
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,060
I drove here.

274
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,220
That's great.

275
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,500
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

276
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,460
My surname is Feng.

277
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,820
Do you prefer the surname, Feng?

278
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,180
(This is outrageous)

279
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,460
(and it seems so familiar.)

280
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,340
This way.

281
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,180
(I had the same feeling)

282
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,700
(when Wang Putao asked me)

283
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
(to drive her back to Hainan.)

284
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,860
Let's go.

285
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,100
Go downstairs.

286
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't run.

287
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,140
Watch your steps.

288
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:10,980
Be careful.

289
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,020
This way.

290
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,100
Wait.

291
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,540
Wait.

292
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,700
Wait for me.

293
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,300
Mr. Wu.

294
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,980
What's going on here?

295
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,060
Luckily, I had the habit
of observing the terrain.

296
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,420
Or else

297
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,980
it wouldn't be easy for us to escape.

298
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,220
You and your daughter
are really the same.

299
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,660
What... What did you say?

300
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,220
Nothing.

301
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,220
Nothing.

302
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,420
You're already driving when you're 18?

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,780
Mr. Wang,

304
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,980
I have a driver's license.

305
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,460
Besides, it's legal to drive at 18.

306
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,980
You can see my license
if you don't believe me.

307
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,140
Excuse me.

308
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,980
I have to take this call.

309
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,940
Hello, Mr. Wu.

310
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,140
How could you bring an elderly person

311
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,220
and wander around like this?

312
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,140
No.

313
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,940
It wasn't me who brought him out.

314
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,700
It was...

315
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,180
He was the one who led the way.

316
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,740
Don't give me that excuse.

317
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,980
If anything happens to him,

318
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,180
can you afford to take responsibility?

319
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,060
Bring him back here now.

320
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,980
I don't want to go back there.

321
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,980
It's dangerous.

322
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,980
He said he didn't want to go back.

323
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,180
Mr. Wu,

324
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,700
this happened all of a sudden.

325
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,940
Don't worry.

326
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,460
We'll just go home for a couple of days.

327
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,380
He's a patient.

328
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,700
Why are you listening to him?

329
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Xiwen is coming home to eat.

330
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,180
I only come back once a year.

331
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,500
I want to go home and cook.

332
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,300
Okay.

333
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,500
I know.

334
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,140
Mr. Wu,

335
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:06,900
you see.

336
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,660
We'll go home for one day.

337
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,300
Just one day.

338
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,180
Don't worry.

339
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,900
I'll take good care of him.

340
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,700
Tomorrow,

341
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,420
I'll definitely
send him back here safely.

342
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,980
Is that okay?

343
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,660
Come on, give in a little.

344
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,020
Are you talking to an ant?

345
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,460
Yes,

346
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
the ant kingdom.

347
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,660
Mr. Wu,

348
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,500
you see.

349
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,180
His daughter is on her way home.

350
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,660
And her father

351
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,300
just wants to make her a meal.

352
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,620
Don't worry.

353
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
I'll send him back here tomorrow.

354
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,220
All right, fine.

355
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,860
Okay, listen.

356
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,300
If there's any issue,

357
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,700
let's stay in touch at all times.

358
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,460
I'll give Putao a call, too.

359
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,260
All right.

360
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,060
Thank you.

361
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,060
Mr. Wang,

362
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,020
let's go home.

363
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,860
Okay.

364
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,500
(Today marks the 25th day)

365
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,460
(since I met Wang Putao.)

366
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,300
(I've finally arrived at the home
she has been hesitant to return.)

367
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,540
(I also met her father,)

368
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,740
(who is at times clear-headed)

369
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,980
(and confused.)

370
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,780
These are the small toys
I bought for her

371
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,500
and the seashells
she picked up by herself at the beach.

372
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,700
Well...

373
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,820
I made her that net

374
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,860
so she can hang trinkets on it.

375
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,220
(This is the first time)

376
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,020
(I've truly gotten)

377
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,980
(to know her past.)

378
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,260
These dishes
were freshly made yesterday.

379
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,460
Xiwen said she wanted
to eat braised meat.

380
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,540
And she's sitting
for her grade exam tomorrow.

381
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,220
Why is it...

382
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,020
Mr. Wang,

383
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,060
calm down.

384
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,780
There's no need to rush.

385
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,220
Calm down?

386
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,020
How can I calm down?

387
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,220
The market is already closed.

388
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,020
I can't buy

389
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,980
or cook anything.

390
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,740
It's okay.

391
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,740
We can order some.

392
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,700
Order? How?

393
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,220
Order what?

394
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,140
A rocket?

395
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,060
Hello.

396
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,620
Your takeaway is here.

397
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,420
Oh, hello.

398
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,420
Okay.

399
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,980
Thanks, man.

400
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,020
How did you order it?

401
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,500
Mr. Wang, you see.

402
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,860
I'll show you how.

403
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,980
It's actually very simple.

404
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,060
First, we open this APP.

405
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,620
Then

406
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
up here is the address.

407
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:38,940
It's sweet.

408
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,900
We should braise it for another minute.

409
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,500
One minute?

410
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,460
Okay.

411
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,780
Don't you think the fire
is a little too big?

412
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,220
Not at all.

413
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,140
All done.

414
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,900
Let's eat.

415
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,980
Here you go, Mr. Wang.

416
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,660
Take these chopsticks.

417
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,220
Xiwen has loved braised meat
since she was a kid.

418
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,500
And she's very picky.

419
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,580
It has to have a good balance
of fat and lean meat,

420
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,780
and it must be sweeter

421
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,260
than the regular braised pork.

422
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
(When I was young, my favorite dish)

423
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,620
(was the braised pork my family made.)

424
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,740
You know what?

425
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,980
The braised pork we made at home

426
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,860
was different from others'.

427
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
We added fried coconut to it

428
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
when we made it.

429
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,060
Yes.

430
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,140
She did mention

431
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,460
her mom's braised meat.

432
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,300
Nonsense.

433
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,940
Sweetie,

434
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,620
why are you crying?

435
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,460
I lost the toy Niu gave me.

436
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,740
You lost your toy?

437
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,940
There, there. Don't cry.

438
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,300
I'll think of something.

439
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,140
Here.

440
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,460
We'll make a hanging net,

441
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
just like that one.

442
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,140
We'll hang the toys on it.

443
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
That way, you won't lose them again.

444
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,780
Okay?

445
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,260
Here's one for you.

446
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,540
Do you know

447
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
why Xiwen loves eating braised meat

448
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,660
so much?

449
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,620
Because her mother couldn't make it.

450
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,660
Her mom could never make one
that tasted like this.

451
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,980
Only the braised pork I make

452
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,980
is Xiwen's favorite.

453
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,860
I know my daughter.

454
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,180
That's why she always talks about it.

455
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,900
It isn't her mom's signature dish.

456
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,380
It's mine.

457
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,180
(Ms. Wang)

458
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,700
(Putao,)

459
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,740
(where are you now?)

460
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,460
(Your dad and I have finished cooking.)

461
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,180
