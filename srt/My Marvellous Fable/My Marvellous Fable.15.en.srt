3
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,660
=Episode 15=

4
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,000
Why are you here?

5
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,500
Do you live here too?

6
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,620
Which floor do you live on?

7
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,420
Do you want to eat together?

8
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,220
You don't seem to talk much.

9
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,500
I understand.

10
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,660
(This person is really strange.)

11
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,460
(He doesn't say a word.)

12
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,500
(Yet, he loves
drinking pig's trotter soup.)

13
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,940
(He seems cold and indifferent.)

14
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,660
(He's more down-to-earth)

15
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,100
(than I thought.)

16
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,060
Do you still want some more?

17
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,020
(This is the first time Sun Xuan)

18
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,500
(has invited a guy
to her house for a meal.)

19
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,900
(Although it's only
the second time they've met,)

20
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,380
(Sun Xuan feels)

21
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,340
(an inexplicable sense of closeness
to this guy.)

22
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,780
(He's pretty considerate.)

23
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,060
Do you still want some?

24
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:10,660
If you don't,

25
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,180
I'll clear the table.

26
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,100
Are you living nearby?

27
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,100
I'll take care of that.

28
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,340
I'll do it.

29
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,660
Your hands are cold.

30
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,100
Tomorrow,

31
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,180
do you want to eat together?

32
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:01,980
(Is she seriously)

33
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,740
(inviting this guy out
for dinner again tomorrow?)

34
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,900
(Why do you care?)

35
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,340
(Ever since she made plans
with that guy yesterday,)

36
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,620
(Sun Xuan)

37
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,620
(has been looking forward
to tonight's dinner.)

38
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,340
(It's making it hard for her)

39
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,300
(to focus on work.)

40
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,980
(She can't help)

41
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,540
(but think about making
a delicious meal today.)

42
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,980
(Could he have forgotten?)

43
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,220
You know what?

44
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,740
I've been living here for five years,

45
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,220
and today is the first time
I'm using my kitchen.

46
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,100
(Although they've only met a few times,)

47
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,340
(Sun Xuan has endless things)

48
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,460
(to say to this guy.)

49
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
(She has decided)

50
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,480
(to make a dish she loves
since childhood.)

51
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,100
When I was young,

52
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,300
I loved eating braised pork the most.

53
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,420
You know,

54
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,780
the braised pork my family makes

55
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,540
is different from others.

56
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,540
My family

57
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
would add dried coconut.

58
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,020
And a bit

59
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,180
of dark soy sauce

60
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,020
and light soy sauce.

61
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,980
Then, we'll let it stew slowly.

62
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,780
The fragrance of the dried coconut

63
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,540
would come out,

64
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,540
and it'd become exceptionally delicious.

65
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,340
Let me open it.

66
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,220
Let's dig in.

67
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,100
(This guy)

68
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,460
(could actually cook well.)

69
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,620
It tastes like the one
I had in my childhood.

70
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,740
(But)

71
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,420
(it seems like he has never had
any food before.)

72
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,340
Is it delicious?

73
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,980
(However,)

74
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,340
(what Sun Xuan doesn't know)

75
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,860
(is that the guy
who shared three meals with her)

76
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,580
(is actually there to take her life.)

77
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,780
(He's a space-time patrol officer.)

78
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,740
(Wait a minute.)

79
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,580
Ms. Wang,

80
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,640
are you saying

81
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
the space-time patrol officer

82
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,420
is there to kill Sun Xuan?

83
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,900
Why do you ask so many questions?

84
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,540
Do you like spoilers that much?

85
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,100
Spoilers are annoying.

86
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,460
I mean,

87
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,580
since this is a fantasy story,

88
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
why can't it be a bit more uplifting?

89
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,740
You see.

90
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,540
You write suspense stories

91
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,580
and people may be killed

92
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,940
in them

93
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,940
but

94
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,060
we shouldn't have
a single woman living alone

95
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,820
getting killed
as a warning to the world.

96
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,940
A suspense plot

97
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,180
where the female lead brings
a strange man home

98
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,980
usually means

99
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,540
she is going to die.

100
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,180
At least, in real life,

101
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,100
have you ever seen

102
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,660
a single woman living alone

103
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,180
bringing a strange man home?

104
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,700
Well,

105
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,700
you're right.

106
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,660
But novels,

107
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,340
movies, and such,

108
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,180
aren't they meant
to create dreams for people?

109
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,340
Since it's about creating dreams,

110
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,580
why can't we let people believe

111
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
that there's hope?

112
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,940
Okay.

113
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,820
Fine.

114
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,100
Tell me a story with hope.

115
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,220
Well,

116
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,420
if you ask me,

117
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,020
after Sun Xuan finishes eating,

118
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,300
she falls asleep in a daze.

119
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,180
That's it?!

120
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,220
The next day,

121
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,220
when Sun Xuan returns to work,

122
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
she starts to look forward

123
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,980
to what to have for dinner tonight.

124
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,220
(Will it be pig's trotters soup)

125
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,940
(or onion-braised sea cucumber?)

126
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,460
(They both seem delicious.)

127
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,060
(Who would have
onion-braised sea cucumber on a date?)

128
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,940
(Don't ruin the beauty of my story,)

129
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,700
(okay?)

130
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,060
(Sun Xuan gets lost in her thoughts.)

131
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,700
(Her colleague calls her
multiple times,)

132
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,940
(but she doesn't hear them.)

133
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,820
Xuan.

134
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,340
I've sent the data to you.
Please take a look.

135
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,580
Xuan?

136
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,580
All right.

137
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,220
She must be dating someone.

138
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,180
Impossible.

139
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,060
Maybe something has happened back home.

140
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,580
It can't be.

141
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,100
She looks fine to me.

142
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,820
Do you know which restaurant
serves the best pig's trotters soup?

143
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,340
- I don't know.
- No idea.

144
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,700
Do you guys ever have that feeling?

145
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,220
Even though you tend to avoid extra work

146
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,700
and don't like talking to others,

147
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,300
you just don't know

148
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,420
why you can't let go

149
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
of that familiar warmth.

150
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,180
Even if that person doesn't say a word,

151
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,220
you seem to know everything.

152
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,700
Why am I telling you this?

153
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,940
Yeah.

154
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Did you hear that?

155
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,220
Yes.

156
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,660
I did.

157
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,940
Oh, my God.

158
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
A miracle has happened.

159
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,580
Pig's trotters soup.

160
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,140
I'm exhausted.

161
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,940
Homemade pig's trotters soup
is the best.

162
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,740
I think this one is good enough.

163
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,700
You can submit it tomorrow.

164
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,460
Am I right?

165
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,180
I think so too.

166
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,820
So I think

167
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,980
we should work overtime

168
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
if it's not good enough.

169
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,740
Work overtime. OK.

170
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,940
Thank you for your hard work today.

171
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,580
If there's nothing urgent,
you can go home now.

172
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,540
Okay.

173
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,740
Stay trip home.

174
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,580
We're getting off work now?

175
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,220
"If there's nothing urgent,
you can go home now"?

176
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,820
What did I tell you?

177
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,220
She's really dating.

178
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,700
Come on.

179
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,220
Let's go.

180
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
♪It's a nice day today♪

181
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,700
Wait for me!

182
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,940
(After getting along for a few days,)

183
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,540
(their relationship
has progressed rapidly.)

184
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
(The space-time patrol officer)

185
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,460
(is curious about everything.)

186
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,740
(He drinks Sun Xuan's
pig's trotters soup)

187
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,340
(and listens)

188
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,180
(as she tells him
a lot of strange stories.)

189
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,500
(How the space-time patrol officer
wishes)

190
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,940
(time)

191
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,100
(could slow down a little.)

192
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,820
Xuan,

193
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,180
thank you for inviting me for meals

194
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,300
during these time.

195
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,780
Hold it right there.

196
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,540
The space-time patrol officer
has started to speak?

197
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,700
Which law states

198
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,220
that space-time patrol officers
can't speak?

199
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,700
You're obstructing creativity,
I'm telling you.

200
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,980
Okay, keep going.

201
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,820
So you can speak.

202
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,100
Who said a space-time patrol officer

203
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,460
couldn't speak?

204
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,700
What?

205
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,180
Space-time patrol officer?

206
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,420
A space-time patrol officer

207
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,700
is a position
in the Time Management Bureau.

208
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
So am I dying?

209
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,540
Indeed.

210
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,740
In the beginning,

211
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,060
I came here with a mission.

212
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
But this mission

213
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
is different from what you thought.

214
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
They informed me

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,420
that you are my successor.

216
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,540
What?

217
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,580
What?

218
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,340
The space-time patrol officer
continues explaining.

219
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,980
My time is running out.

220
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,980
They have selected

221
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,180
a recruit among those

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,300
who are about to die

223
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,460
to continue this job.

224
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
But don't worry.

225
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,100
I've already taken care of this.

226
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,660
Today,

227
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,220
I'm here to bid farewell.

228
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,820
Actually, I was happy at first.

229
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,380
(The space-time patrol officer knows)

230
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,580
(they don't have much time together.)

231
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,060
(Ever since he knew)

232
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,460
(that Sun Xuan would be his successor,)

233
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,220
(the space-time patrol officer)

234
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,580
(has been waiting)

235
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,740
(for this moment to come.)

236
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,340
(But when he discovered)

237
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,100
(that Sun Xuan was as lonely as he was,)

238
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,180
(he gradually)

239
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,220
(didn't want Sun Xuan)

240
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,940
(to bear this loneliness.)

241
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,860
(All he could do)

242
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,220
(was to be with her)

243
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,340
(and wait.)

244
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,540
As time went by,

245
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
I suddenly had the idea
of accompanying you.

246
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,020
Even if it's just for a few days.

247
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,460
I'm getting more and more confused.

248
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,300
Am I dreaming?

249
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,420
Then, take it as a dream.

250
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,420
The dishes you make are delicious.

251
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,180
Thank you.

252
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,900
I have been happy during this time.

253
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,260
(He finally gathers up the courage)

254
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,380
