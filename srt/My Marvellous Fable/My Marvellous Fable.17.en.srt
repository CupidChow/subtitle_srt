4
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:45,900
Here's your parcel.

5
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,820
Okay.

6
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,460
Thank you.

7
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,700
(Sender: Wang)

8
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,620
(Wang?)

9
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,020
(Putao?)

10
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,500
(She didn't answer my call)

11
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,140
(or reply to my text messages.)

12
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,980
(What does she mean by this?)

13
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,140
(I wonder what she's doing right now.)

14
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
I think someone

15
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,540
sat beside you

16
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,140
and drank with you a few days ago.

17
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,340
To be honest,

18
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm pretty fond of Tianlan.

19
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,820
What?

20
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,100
You can't shut up after drinking, huh?

21
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,700
Why did you bring him up again?

22
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,820
What?

23
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,980
Can't I even bring up his name now?

24
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,260
No, you can't.

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,980
You're funny.

26
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,380
You ran away all of a sudden.

27
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,780
What would he think of you?

28
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,380
All of a sudden, huh?

29
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,420
Why is someone being
a busybody all of a sudden?

30
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,060
You reminded me of something.

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,500
I have to be a busybody now.

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,820
I'll call him right now

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,260
and ask him how he feels about you.

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,380
Don't!

35
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,260
(Should I)

36
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,380
(check it out?)

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,380
(Forget it.)

38
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,540
(We'll see tomorrow.)

39
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,100
Are you exhausted?

40
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
You two are torturing each other.

41
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,500
That's right.

42
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,420
You hit the nail on the head.

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,660
I'm exhausted.

44
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,580
I'm extremely exhausted.

45
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,220
The first day when I saw Feng Tianlan,

46
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,500
he was so naggy.

47
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
He was so annoying.

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,580
It exhausted me.

49
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,220
And you know what?

50
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,860
Feng Tianlan is a good guy at heart.

51
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,940
He never rejects

52
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,820
anyone or anything.

53
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
However, we only knew each other
for a short while.

54
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
I'm unsure about his perspective

55
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,860
on many matters.

56
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,180
Judging from what you said,

57
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,660
I think it's...

58
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,580
I knew he was nice to me.

59
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,540
But I couldn't help

60
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
testing his limits.

61
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,660
That's why I kept torturing him.

62
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,700
But no matter how I tortured him,

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,340
he always stood up to the challenges.

64
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,140
It made me fall for him

65
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,900
and rely too much on him.

66
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,140
I shouldn't, right?

67
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,260
You!

68
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,900
Can you not bring
the weird ideas into real life?

69
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,820
I...

70
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,140
Was it his fault for being nice to you?

71
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,020
Can you stop being so pretentious?

72
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,980
Me? Pretentious?

73
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,260
(She only excels at torturing me.)

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,220
(I don't care anymore.)

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,540
(Here goes nothing.)

76
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,275
(Class Reunion, By Wang Xiwen)

77
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,020
Wang Xiwen?

78
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,540
Who's Wang Xiwen?

79
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,660
So, you plan to stop seeing him

80
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,700
because

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,660
he's too nice to everyone?

82
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,380
Yeah.

83
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,020
Or what?

84
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,460
Wait, you...

85
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,380
I can never understand you

86
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,780
and that artistic brain of yours.

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm afraid.

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm afraid that I'm only fond
of what he showed me.

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm also afraid
that I'll keep torturing myself in love.

90
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,460
I have no confidence in him.

91
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,580
I have no confidence in myself either.

92
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,380
I...

93
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm worried that Feng Tianlan might...

94
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,780
There's no future between us

95
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,140
if he can't even withstand this test,

96
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,900
am I right?

97
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,700
I've already

98
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,140
(I know you'll come, so I'll wait.)
set the test.

99
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,140
We shall see if he will answer it.

100
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,140
(Yuanyuan, Ziyun.)

101
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
(Zhang, Sun Xuan?)

102
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,275
(By Wang Xiwen)

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,140
(A murder.)

104
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,460
(A suspense novel?)

105
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,700
(Why are all these names)

106
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,780
(included in this novel?)

107
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,340
(If so, who exactly)

108
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,100
(is Wang Xiwen?)

109
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,380
(Wang Putao,)

110
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,780
(it should be you, right?)

111
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,700
That's right.

112
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,820
Feng Tianlan!

113
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,460
Why are you calling me

114
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,700
at this hour?

115
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,580
Sorry, sir.

116
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,780
I forgot to check the time.

117
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,380
What's the matter?

118
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,140
What happened?

119
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,580
It's like this.

120
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,700
Do you know an author

121
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,220
called Wang Xiwen?

122
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Wang Xiwen?

123
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,380
How did you know about her?

124
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,780
She sent me a novel.

125
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,140
All right, I got it.

126
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,820
We can talk about it tomorrow.

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,340
I'll hang up first.

128
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,900
Hello?

129
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,020
(Talk about it tomorrow?)

130
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,820
What should I do then? I can't sleep.

131
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,580
Hello?

132
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,820
Did you read my text message?

133
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
Everything is proceeding smoothly.

134
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,700
Sir,

135
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,460
thank you.

136
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,180
Okay.

137
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,700
I'll make arrangements
for the next step.

138
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,380
I'll hang up now.

139
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,460
Do you think this is appropriate?

140
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,620
Wait.

141
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,820
Let me ask if I need to pay for them.

142
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,100
They are free.

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,700
So, Wang Putao

144
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,860
is Wang Xiwen, huh?

145
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,220
So, she replied to you?

146
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,420
No.

147
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,620
But she sent me a novel.

148
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,420
And a map as well.

149
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,580
Let me see.

150
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,820
Sir,

151
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,460
I've read the novel.

152
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,980
It's completely different

153
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,940
from the previous novels Putao wrote.

154
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,580
What did you call her just now?

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,580
Putao.

156
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,700
This is nostalgic.

157
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,460
This was the first novel

158
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,980
Ms. Wang wrote when she joined us.

159
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Back then, our team leader

160
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,100
read it often.

161
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,340
Let me see.

162
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,940
It's pretty unpolished.

163
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
However,

164
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,460
it was Ms. Wang's debut work.

165
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,420
It's worth keeping it.

166
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,340
Hey, I was supposed to meet
our team leader alone today.

167
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,980
What are you two doing here?

168
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,060
I haven't had dinner yet.

169
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,180
Can I have some iced water?

170
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,220
It'll be 25 yuan.

171
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,700
Forget about the water.

172
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,500
Can I have some ice then?

173
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,860
Let's try to locate some clues

174
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,100
from this novel.

175
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Look.

176
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Yuanyuan,

177
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,220
Ziyun,

178
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,060
and Zhang,

179
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,060
they are her classmates

180
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,820
in the novel.

181
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
My surname is Zhang.

182
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,380
I'm Yuanyuan.

183
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,620
I'm Ziyun.

184
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,220
I thought Ziyun was a girl.

185
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,380
Don't judge me by my name.

186
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,020
You!

187
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,140
So, the characters in Another Life

188
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,780
have nothing to do with reality.

189
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,780
Another Life?

190
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,140
Actually,

191
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,260
the "Another Life" you just mentioned

192
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,340
was...

193
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,020
Feng is one of us.

194
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,140
We don't need to hide anything.

195
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,900
(Ms. Wang got to know)

196
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,620
(her ex-husband at university.)

197
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,620
(He was her senior.)

198
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,500
(His name was Liang Wenkai.)

199
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,900
Xi.

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,380
Wenkai, you're here.

201
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,780
Yeah.

202
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,420
It's the holidays.

203
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,260
I'm here to visit you.

204
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,660
Let's go.

205
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,300
Let's grab a bite.

206
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,020
Okay.

207
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,140
Hurry.

208
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,980
Wenkai,

209
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,140
you call me every day.

210
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,540
My dormmates are calling
the dorm's phone

211
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,260
"Wang Xiwen's Personal Phone".

212
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,740
They're not too happy about it.

213
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,740
This is for you.

214
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,860
This way, we can keep in touch anytime.

215
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,020
The latest model?

216
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,140
Do you like it?

217
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,780
I do like it.

218
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,380
But Wenkai, I don't think
I should keep it.

219
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,660
This is very expensive.

220
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,780
I'm just buying a gift

221
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
for the girl I'm fond of.

222
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,860
You must keep it.

223
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,540
(At first,)

224
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,500
(he acted like a decent man.)

225
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,580
(He was pretty nice to Ms. Wang.)

226
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,260
(But after they got married,)

227
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,380
(he turned into another person.)

228
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,380
(He often abused her.)

229
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,460
(After that,)

230
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,820
(that man tried to hinder Ms. Wang)

231
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,700
(when she commenced writing.)

232
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,620
(Therefore, in her novels,)

233
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,380
(there's always a dangerous man.)

234
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,380
(The ex-husband of the influencer
in Another Life)

235
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,380
(should be based on her ex-husband.)

236
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,100
That jerk!

237
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,100
(Class Reunion)

238
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,420
We should call the cops.

239
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,260
Youguang already
handled the matter for me.

240
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,460
I've already received
the divorce settlement.

241
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,300
I've changed my address, too.

242
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,100
I'll be fine.

243
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,980
Don't worry.

244
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,860
How could I not worry?

245
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,420
You just published a new novel.

246
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
What should we do

247
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,420
if he finds you again?

248
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,140
Sir,

249
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,260
maybe I should use another name.

250
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,940
I will hand in the manuscripts on time.

251
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,820
Don't worry.

252
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,740
It's not about the manuscripts.

253
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,540
I'm serious.

254
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,020
He's lucky that I'm a literati

255
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,500
with no strength to defend myself.

256
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,140
If not,

257
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,620
I would have given him

258
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,620
a thrashing!

259
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,660
I'll use my Snake Fist!

260
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,180
I'll poke his eyes!

261
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
And I'll kick him!

262
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,020
What name

263
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,740
should I use?

264
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
Wang Jufeng.
(*Jufeng is the variety of the grapes.)

265
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,260
Wang Putao.
(*Putao means grapes in Chinese.)

266
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,620
Good.

267
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,620
Wang Putao is a good name.

268
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,300
That's a great name.

269
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
Wang Putao.

270
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Wang Putao.

271
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,060
Changing my name

272
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,020
and starting anew.

273
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,860
That's pretty good.

274
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,780
What do you mean by that?

275
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,140
If so, what's her relationship
with her ex-husband now?

276
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,020
I heard that he found her

277
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,260
and pestered her.

278
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,380
She would move from time to time.

279
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,660
After that, she even
changed her name.

280
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,380
But it's become much better since then.

281
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,780
However, there are downsides to it too.

282
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,620
She moves frequently.

283
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,260
And we can't even find her.

284
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,060
I think

285
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,180
we don't understand Ms. Wang
as well as we think.

286
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
No wonder I couldn't reach her.

287
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,180
That's not the case.

288
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,780
It's obvious that she's ignoring you.

289
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,460
We have a map here.

290
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,540
Ms. Wang left it to us.

291
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,060
Let's see if we can find any clues.

292
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,260
I heard that there's a type of fluid

293
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,180
that can help develop images.

294
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
We can see things

295
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
that we can't see usually

296
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,020
through the heating process.

297
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,020
Let's give it a try.

298
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,500
I need fire.

299
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,500
Understood.

300
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,340
So you're a smoker?

301
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,820
That's none of your business.

302
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,780
Pick it up.

303
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,020
Well,

304
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
what should we do now?

305
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,780
I have one person in mind.

306
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm sure she knows where Ms. Wang is.

307
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,340
Who is it?

308
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,460
- Luna.
- Luna?

309
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,260
That's right.

310
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,340
Luna.

311
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,660
This is our only clue.

312
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,260
Maybe she knows something.

313
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,500
I wonder who made Luna
the only clue we have left?

314
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,500
Hey, don't say that.

315
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,940
This...

316
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,540
What's done can't be undone.

317
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,220
Do you guys remember?

318
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,500
There was a time

319
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,660
that we couldn't find Ms. Wang
for over three months.

320
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,260
In the end,
Luna was the one who found her.

321
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,660
- That's right.
- That's right.

322
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,180
- You need to find Luna.
- You need to find Luna.

323
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,140
(So, what she wrote in The Last Secret)

324
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,500
(was her deepest secret.)

325
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,180
(Wang Putao,)

326
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,780
(you're really something.)

327
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,260
(Seems like)

328
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,020
(Luna is my only clue)

329
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,100
(to locating Wang Putao.)

330
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,100
(This might also be my last chance.)

331
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,660
Hello,

332
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,260
sir?

333
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,780
Listen.

334
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,020
Cut the crap.

335
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,500
Just proceed according to our plan.

336
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,820
He...

337
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,180
He's already here!

338
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,660
I'm hanging up.

339
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,420
Feng Tianlan,

340
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,340
Zhang has already notified me.

341
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,180
Come inside.

342
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,780
Okay.

343
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,860
(Not bad at all,)

344
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,460
(Wang Putao.)

345
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,180
(He's pretty hot.)

346
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,620
(So, this is Luna?)

347
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,380
(She's quite different
from what I had imagined.)

348
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,780
So,

349
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,660
you're Ms. Luna?

350
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,260
What's wrong?

351
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,500
Don't I look like Luna to you?

352
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,860
That's not it.

353
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,580
You do.

354
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,460
You do.

355
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,740
It's just that...

356
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,780
It's just that I'm different
from what you've imagined.

357
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,700
That's right.

358
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,100
So, Ms. Luna,

359
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,780
regarding Wang Putao,

360
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,300
she...

361
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,100
In "Last Night",

362
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,260
I'm the female killer
who killed the pervert.

363
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,420
But

364
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,340
in "After Dawn,"

365
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,340
I'm a victim.

366
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Basically, she always
creates a character based on me

367
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,700
in every novel she writes.

368
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,180
However, in reality,

369
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,700
I'm just a mother

370
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,540
who's trapped at home
because of her child.

371
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,260
However,

372
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,660
I had a successful career.

373
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,980
Xiwen and I

374
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,540
joined the design firm together.

375
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,060
I was once the director
of the department.

376
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,100
Now, I'm stuck in everyday life.

377
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,060
My shoulders became stiff
from looking after my child.

378
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,020
Sorry about that.

379
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,780
I...

380
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,340
Why did I tell you all of that?

381
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,820
Not at all.

382
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,700
It's fine.

383
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,020
I heard from Zhang

384
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,740
that you're here
to look for Xiwen, right?

385
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
What's the relationship

386
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,700
between you two?

387
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,260
We are...

388
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,580
She's an author.

389
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,500
And...

390
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,220
I'm her editor.

391
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,940
That's right.

392
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,380
We're business partners.

393
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,820
So, you guys are just colleagues, huh?

394
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,420
If so, why do you
care so much about her?

395
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,340
Because...

396
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,300
I need her manuscripts.

397
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,020
Manuscripts, huh?

398
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,940
(Xiwen was right about him.)

399
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,740
(If so, sorry about this,)

400
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,740
(Mr. Feng.)

401
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,500
I need to make a call.

402
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,260
Please wait a moment.

403
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,020
Okay.

404
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,340
Hello?

405
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,460
Right now?

406
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,260
I'll be there in a second.

407
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,180
I'll be there immediately.

408
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,860
Mr. Feng,

409
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
I have an emergency to attend to.

410
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
Please take care of my child,

411
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,500
okay?

412
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,860
Huh?

413
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,500
Wait!

414
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Take care of your child?

415
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,780
Yeah.

416
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,540
Take care of my child for me.

417
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,180
You see,

418
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,540
Ms. Luna,

419
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,060
we just met.

420
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,180
I don't think this is appropriate.

421
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,660
You're Xiwen's friend, right?

422
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,580
There's nothing inappropriate
about this.

423
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,180
I'm in a hurry.

424
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,260
I'll return in a second,

425
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,700
okay?

426
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,500
Thanks!

427
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,860
Wait.

428
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,580
But Wang Putao...

429
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,340
I haven't finished...

430
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,660
my words yet.

431
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,020
Hello,

432
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,580
sir?

433
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,700
How did it go?

434
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,260
Everything's fine.

435
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,180
Did everything go smoothly?

436
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,060
Don't worry.

437
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,980
My baby

438
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,860
is a mental torture device.

439
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,300
I'll have coffee in the nearby cafe.

440
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,260
Don't worry.

441
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,780
Okay.

442
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
I'll make a move first.

443
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,260
Bye.

444
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,740
(Poor guy.)

445
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,860
(Why not just admit
that you two are a couple?)

446
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,500
(This is the longest
five hours of my life.)

447
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,460
(For a moment,)

448
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,660
(I actually thought
this child could rival Wang Putao)

449
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,020
(when it came to torturing people.)

450
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,780
Dear.

451
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm back.

452
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,220
Mom!

453
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Baby,

454
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,260
what have you been doing?

455
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,300
Mr. Feng,

456
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,020
I was late.

457
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,820
Sorry about that.

458
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Are you okay?

459
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,060
Ms. Luna,

460
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,260
let's add each other on WeChat.

461
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,500
Just now, when my soul left my body,

462
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
I realized
that I had no way to reach you.

463
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,060
I'm so sorry about that.

464
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,020
- Here.
- Come on.

465
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,940
Please scan my QR code.

466
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,340
Okay.

467
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,780
Okay.

468
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,860
I've approved your friend request.

469
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,020
What about this?

470
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,540
Shall we have lunch together?

471
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,820
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet.

472
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,660
Okay?

473
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,180
Let's have lunch together.

474
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,500
Come on.

475
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Let's go.

476
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,460
Let's have lunch with this gentleman.

477
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,700
Come on.

478
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Have lunch with this gentleman.

479
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,180
Let's go.

480
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,940
Lunch?

481
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,980
(I should've left by then.)
