4
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,740
Hello,

5
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,620
sir.

6
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,180
Regarding the sample book,

7
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,540
I will reconfirm it with Putao.

8
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
However,

9
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,180
if she doesn't wish to confirm it,

10
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,540
I hope you'll stop forcing her.

11
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,580
Hello?

12
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,540
Feng Tianlan.

13
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,540
What are you saying?

14
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,020
It's the same for me.

15
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,340
Maybe we won't be able
to publish this book at last.

16
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,060
I hope you can understand.

17
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,580
But now,

18
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
I have to go to her.

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,980
Feng Tianlan,

20
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,740
I'm not done yet...

21
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,420
(Within one month)

22
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,380
(of knowing Wang Putao,)

23
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,340
(I'd driven from Beijing to Qionghai)

24
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,860
(and made a return trip to Beijing.)

25
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,820
(Now,)

26
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
(I'm on the expressway toward Qionghai.)

27
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,540
(However, I have something to do)

28
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,100
(before I reach)

29
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,060
(Qionghai.)

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,020
(Jinan)

31
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,260
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang.

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Long time no see.

33
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,820
Long time no see,

34
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,220
Feng.

35
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,780
Hello.

36
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,700
Please take a look at the menu.

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,540
Okay.

38
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,700
See what you would like to order.

39
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,100
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang,

40
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,340
please check out the menu.

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,580
No need for that.

42
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,380
You make the order.

43
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,060
Can you take spicy food?

44
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,260
Is there anything you don't take?

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,220
We're fine with anything.

46
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,820
Everything is fine.

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,660
I'll make the order then.

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,580
This one,

49
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,660
this one,

50
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:51,780
this one,

51
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,580
and three bowls of rice.

52
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,100
Thank you.

53
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,060
Please wait a moment.

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,820
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, you must be thirsty.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,260
Let me pour you some water.

56
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,060
Here.

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,380
Okay.

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,580
Thank you.

59
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,140
Here, Mrs. Zhang.

60
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,860
Mrs. Zhang, please have a seat.

61
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,540
Sorry about that.

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Please wipe your hands.

63
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,260
Okay.

64
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,700
It's fine.

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,100
I'll do it.

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,140
Let me do it.

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,100
Let me do it.

68
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
I'll leave it here.

69
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,900
Have you received the items

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,660
I sent to you?

71
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,020
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,780
We received it.

73
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,340
And the text you sent too.

74
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,700
However,

75
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,100
Feng,

76
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,580
my wife and I are doing well.

77
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,100
There's no need for you to do this.

78
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,540
No.

79
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,020
Mr. Zhang,
that's what I'm supposed to do.

80
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Nobody

81
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,980
is supposed to do anything.

82
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,340
Ever since

83
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,820
his passing...

84
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,540
Feng,

85
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,700
you invited us over out of the blue.

86
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,020
Did something happen?

87
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,780
Yeah.

88
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,340
It's been too long since we last met.

89
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,380
We thought something had happened

90
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,340
when you asked us to meet you.

91
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,540
It's nothing.

92
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,980
Nothing happened.

93
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,220
I just happened

94
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,020
to miss both of you.

95
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,380
Actually, there's something.

96
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,100
There's something

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,900
I want to tell you two.

98
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,820
He came to find me

99
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,980
before he passed away.

100
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
I've kept this to myself
for a long time.

101
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,100
The day he came to find me...

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,620
You should work harder

103
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,420
to get good grades.

104
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,780
Don't be distracted by other things.

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
With this grade,

106
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,620
and given your academic performance,

107
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,100
you can never get into a university.

108
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,620
That's right, Tianlan.

109
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,540
You have less than 100 days
before the NCEE.

110
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,220
Can't you just stick to the end?

111
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,460
You only want to have fun

112
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,540
and play video games all day long.

113
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
I will stay out of your way

114
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,420
once you get into a university.

115
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,420
You can do whatever you want by then.

116
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,900
(I had a tense relationship
with my parents)

117
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,220
(when he came to find me.)

118
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,060
That's why

119
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,100
I didn't go downstairs.

120
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,780
As a friend, I didn't do the things

121
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,340
that I was supposed to do.

122
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,740
(That was the last time)

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,420
(I saw him.)

124
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,660
(After that, I kept thinking to myself.)

125
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,060
If I had gone downstairs back then,

126
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,860
if I had seen him back then,

127
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,300
maybe everything
would've ended differently.

128
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,300
(Maybe everything would have changed.)

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,840
(Letter of Admission)

130
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,060
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,900
Tianlan,

133
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,260
this isn't your fault.

134
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,420
Boy, I'm serious.

135
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,900
This isn't your fault.

136
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,780
We once blamed ourselves
for a long time.

137
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,300
But you see,

138
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,540
life still goes on,

139
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,020
my boy.

140
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,180
Although Haibei didn't live long,

141
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,140
it was lucky

142
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,660
that he met you.

143
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,300
We felt that he was happy

144
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,300
because of you.

145
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,900
Mrs. Zhang.

146
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,420
Thank you.

147
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,540
Mr. Zhang.

148
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,060
Please enjoy.

149
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,820
You too.

150
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,300
Okay.

151
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,780
All right.

152
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,300
Okay.

153
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,300
Help yourself.

154
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,820
Okay.

155
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,180
We're going home.

156
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,300
Okay.

157
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,340
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, goodbye.

158
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,660
Goodbye.

159
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,300
Feng Tianlan!

160
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,460
Let's go.

161
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,420
Let's go.

162
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,060
Something suddenly popped up in my mind.

163
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,940
What is it?

164
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,660
It's nothing.

165
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,700
We're getting late.

166
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,420
Let's go.

167
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,180
But why?

168
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:51,900
It's nothing.

169
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,540
Let's go.

170
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,020
We're late!

171
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,900
We're already late!

172
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,820
Hurry!

173
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,260
(We are just ordinary people.)

174
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
(We'll die)

175
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,660
(one day.)

176
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,540
