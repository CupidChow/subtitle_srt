I'm going to take my beauty sleep.

13
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,060
Mengmeng.

14
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,980
Hello.

15
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,540
Here, cheers.

16
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,820
Hello?

17
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,825
(Agreement)

18
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,860
(20 percent of funds
will be given to Party B as dividends)

19
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,660
What?

20
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,660
So this is what you meant by 20-80?

21
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,780
You unscrupulous scum!

22
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,660
I've already done my best.

23
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Compared to before,

24
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,340
you'd get 10, and I get 90.

25
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,660
This is already much better.

26
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,980
Based on what?

27
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,420
What?

28
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,820
Based on what you owe me!

29
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,820
All the money I wasted on you.

30
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,380
It's tens of millions.

31
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,140
With my help,

32
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,540
you were able to marry
your current husband.

33
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,140
Did you forget?

34
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,875
(Dear Lu Ziyun.
Please choose a renewal plan. Permanent)

35
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,780
Also,

36
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,340
although you managed
to sell a lot during the stream,

37
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,700
the rate of returns
was exceptionally high.

38
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,140
If it weren't for me

39
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
and the platform,

40
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,580
you would be as good as nothing.

41
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,900
The goods that are worth
one million at the front,

42
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,020
I was the one who paid for it!

43
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,580
Boss...

44
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,660
Bad news.

45
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,460
The snacks we sold previously are fakes.

46
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,700
The real thing has come after us.

47
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,580
They want us to pay up.

48
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,820
This is a demand letter.

49
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,140
Calm down.

50
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,460
(You have no shame.)

51
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,580
(Why did I even like you?)

52
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,020
(You sold us fake products?)

53
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,340
(Where is your conscience?)

54
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,820
(You're evil, Mengmeng.)

55
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,260
(So much for driving a luxury car
and showing off.)

56
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,580
(I want my money back.)

57
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,660
(You're plastic, aren't you?)

58
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,020
The Liang family is one of stature.

59
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,900
I won't dwell on the fact
you can't give birth to a baby.

60
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
But now you got yourself covered in mud

61
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,460
and slander.

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,460
You don't deserve my son.

63
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,780
Get a divorce.

64
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,980
You can pay minimal compensation.

65
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,340
What is ours is still ours.

66
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
You won't get a penny from the divorce.

67
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,100
Fine.

68
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,100
I'll sign it.

69
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,660
You think you could control me

70
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,580
with just this bit of money?

71
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,580
Even if you gave me more,

72
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,460
I wouldn't stay.

73
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,420
I'm not ordering yet.

74
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,980
I'm waiting for someone.

75
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,100
Miss.

76
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,460
I didn't come to take your order.

77
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,340
We are currently doing a surprise event.

78
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,260
Today is our tenth anniversary.

79
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,500
You happen to be our Table Ten.

80
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,260
We'd like to offer you our Set Ten meal

81
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,020
for free.

82
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,340
You guys seem
to have events all the time.

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,540
There aren't actually free lunches
in the world.

84
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,340
You're having one right now, though.

85
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,140
(With the Set Ten meal,)

86
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,100
(you'll get the life
you've always wanted.)

87
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,140
(A permanent exchange)

88
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,420
(for a real life.)

89
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,000
(Free first exchange. Exchange)

90
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,775
(Exchange)

91
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,540
What is ours is still ours.

92
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,020
You won't get a penny from the divorce.

93
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,220
Are you ordering, miss?

94
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:43,900
Never mind.

95
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,580
I'm waiting for someone.

96
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,860
Get me a cup of coffee.

97
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,100
You're here.

98
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,340
Was what you said that day true?

99
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,260
What did I say?

100
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,420
What?

101
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,260
That day, you said

102
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,980
you could be with me right away.

103
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,340
Forget I said it.

104
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,780
You're no longer of any use.

105
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,980
Forget it?

106
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,020
Wait.

107
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,060
Hey!

108
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,460
You said...

109
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,860
You said you wanted to be with me.

110
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,700
Crazy woman.

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,980
Hello.

112
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,220
How may I help you?

113
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
Give me back my life right now!

114
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,220
Hello, ma'am.

115
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,340
We will process
the refund for you for free.

116

Okay.

118

Tell me what I have to do.

119
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,180
I've entered it.

120
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,940
What now?

121
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,380
We've received the detail.

122
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Now, please enter the verification codes

123
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,380

124

to complete the process.

125
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,580
Verification codes for both phones?

126
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,700
What do you mean?

127
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,220
Ma'am.

128
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,980
Our exchange and return service

129
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,500
requires the codes from both parties.

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,580
What?

131
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,740
You need both sides to agree to it?

132
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,580
Ma'am.

133
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,180

Identity exchange service activated.

146

The other party
has chosen the experience mode.

147
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,180
It differs from your choice
of permanent mode.

148
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,740
Would you like to top up?

149
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,500
No need.

150
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,620
She will top up.

151
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Lu Ziyun, stop right there!

152
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,380
Isn't she that influencer

153
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,700
who has been in all the scandals recently?

154
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,860
Mingfang.

155
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,620
You go ahead.

156
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,340
I'll deal with her.

157
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,100
Okay.

158
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,060
You be careful.

159
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,540
You set me up, didn't you?

160
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,460
Set you up?

161
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,340
Isn't it what you wanted?

162
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,220
Recently,

163
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,100
I've lost weight.

164
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,860
And I even got a new boyfriend.

165
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,100
I have a plastic surgery lined up.

166
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,980
I'm going to make you better.

167
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,500
Not you.

168
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,580
I meant me.

169
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,100
So your intention had always been...

170
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,620
My life that is in your body

172
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
had been a mess.

173
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,700
I had no choice

174
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,100
but to give it up.

175
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
Who knew you'd willingly take it?

176
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,620
Give me my life back!

177
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,340
You were the one who chose permanent.

178
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,220
This is my body now.

179
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,340
Not yours!

180
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,980
You greedy woman!

181
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,740
No!

182
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,460
Give it back!

183
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,980
This is supposed to be my body!

184
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
Give it back to me, Lu Ziyun!

185
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,400
(Exchange)

186
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,000
(Exchange in process)

187
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,380
Hello, is that Ziyun?

188
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,980
What? What did you say?

189
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,740
Hold on.

190
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,140
So,

191
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,940
Ms. Wang.

192
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,060
Are you trying to say that...

193
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,820
Are you really that naive?

194
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,100
Or are you

195
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,980
just dumb?

196
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,580
You like movies, right?

197
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,060
How come you didn't pick up
on the essence?

198
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,700
Hang on.

199
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,100
Ms. Wang.

200
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,060
I'm still confused.

201
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,260
What happened to Ziyun in the end?

202
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,900
Every person

203
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
has moments
when they're envious of other people.

204
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,260
They think the life they don't have

205
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,700
is the happy one.

206
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,700
But they forget

207
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,620
the happiness they already have.

208
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,420
The readers will have

209
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,500
to experience that themselves.

210
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,740
I get it.

211
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,860
I'm just curious

212
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,700
about who she ended up...

213
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,420
with.

214
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,980
I really don't get you sometimes.

215
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,300
Your stories

216
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,820
seem like they're about you.

217
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,220
But it also sounds like
they're about another person.

218
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,300
Where do you get your inspiration from?

219
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,580
Feng Tianlan.

220
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,860
You have too many questions.

221
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,340
Ms. Wang.

222
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,460
I need the loo.

223
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,220
(It doesn't seem like she's going back
to pay respects to her ancestors at all.)

224
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,220
Hurry and go.

225
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,380
What's happened?

226
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
No time to explain.

227
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,340
Okay.

228
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,740
(She came out in such a hurry.)

229
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,460
(Did something happen?)

230
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,100
(This won't do.)

231
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,860
(I should ask her.)

232
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,340
Hey.

233
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,700
Ms. Wang.

234
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,860
Are you all right?

235
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,180
What's all right?

236
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,860
Do you want me to say yes

237
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,700
or no?

238
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,980
(She's doing the runaround.)

239
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,220
(Something is definitely wrong.)

240
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,260
Here.

241
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,860
Have some water.

242
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,140
Thanks.

243
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,740
Do you want this?

244
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,140
You have quite the sweet tooth, huh?

245
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,020
I don't eat often.

246
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,620
More a spur-of-the-moment.

247
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,060
Spur of the moment?

248
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,780
What do you mean?

249
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,100
It was right there,

250
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
so I just grabbed two.

251
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,380
Grabbed?

252
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,340
You just grabbed two?

253
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,420
You took two on the spur of the moment.

254
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,780
Hurry and go.

255
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,940
What's happened?

256
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
There's no time to explain.

257
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,660
Hurry.

258
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:09,940
Okay.

259
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,580
I was wondering
why you came out running.

260
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,380
Did you not pay for them?

261
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,580
I knew you were cultured.

262
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,260
That's right.

263
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,500
I did not pay.

264
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,660
Why didn't I think of it?

265
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
You didn't?

266
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,860
That means you stole them.

267
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,780
What the heck is wrong with you?

268
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,180
Why are you following me if I'm crazy?

269
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,420
I'm not going to bother explaining.

270
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,780
I have to go back.

271
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
You're the one who's crazy.

272
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,020
It's just a piece of bubble gum,

273
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,540
two lollipops, and a bottle of water.

274
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,620
Indeed.

275
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,420
And you just committed a crime.

276
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,020
Wang Putao.

277
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,380
I can't believe
you're that kind of person.

278
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,100
Adding all of them up

279
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,140
is slightly more than ten yuan      .

280
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,580
We're already an hour away

281
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,580
from that place.

282
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,140
Feng Tianlan.

283
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,100
How much time and money it cost

284
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
do not matter.

285
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,620
This is about principles and morals.

286
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,380
Understand?

287
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,660
Oh, yeah? You want to talk about morals?

288
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,500
Do you want the book or not?

289
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Are you going to accompany me
to the funeral or not?

290
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,860
You're basically saying no if you want

291
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,660
to go back the way we came.

292
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,100
Do you think my dad
needs more time to die?

293
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,180
Ms. Wang Putao.

294
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,100
Please watch your words.

295
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,140
You're disrespecting your parents.

296
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,380
Feng Tianlan.

297
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,140
Editor at Shanguan Culture.

298
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,900
An intern editor.

299
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,140
I don't know what you're trying to say.

300
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,260
This place

301
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,180
is connected
to the world wide web, right?

302
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,860
You can check. This is my first offense.

303
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,420
I just lost my sense of self.

304
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,340
What did you steal?

305
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,340
A piece of bubblegum,

306
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,940
two lollipops,

307
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,180
and a bottle of water.

308
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,940
Do not commit an evil act
just because it is small in scale.

309
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,340
I will be responsible
for my own actions.

310
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,820
Kill me or beat me up.

311
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,340
I will accept it.

312
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,620
Is this how young couples

313
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,020
joke around these days?

314
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,860
You already paid for the goods,

315
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,540
but you said you didn't.

316
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,340
You just put us in a dilemma.

317
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,140
Your boyfriend is a weird one, though.

318
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,820
He insisted on paying again.

319
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
We are running

320
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
a legal business, okay?

321
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,380
Why are you doing this to us?

322
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,060
How much?

323
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,860
Five yuan.

324
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,660
(Forget it,)

325
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,140
(Feng Tianlan.)

326
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,300
(It's just a job.)

327
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,940
(Just get her to Qionghai quickly.)

328
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,420
(My top priority is getting her draft.)

329
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:06,375
(Protect the environment; No littering)

330
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,780
How much?

331
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,780
Petrol 95 full tank.

332
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,620
Thanks.

333
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,580
I think I've got a fuel card.

334
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:49,860
Excuse me.

335
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,540
We have a fuel card.

336
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,100
Please hang on.

337
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,620
Okay.

338
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,580
Thanks.

339
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,700
Where did the little teddy come from?

340
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,500
Who knows who left it here
when they borrowed the car?

341
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,340
Why did you throw it away?

342
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,580
It's a cute teddy.

343
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,340
Throw it away.

344
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,300
Throw it away?

345
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,500
Shut it.

346
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,100
Or else you won't get the story.

347
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,820
What...

348
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,420
Your fuel card.

349
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:02,820
Okay.

350
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,140
Thanks.

351
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,900
Take this teddy to keep you company.

352
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,060
Ms. Wang.

353
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,380
Are you okay with ordering this?

354
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,300
What about this one?

355
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,580
Or this?

356
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,660
Ms. Wang, please take a look.

357
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,060
I'll get this call.

358
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,300
Hello, sir.

359
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:14,940
Hello.

360
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,580
Feng.

361
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,780
What's the situation?

362
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,780
What's this about a police report?

363
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,020
Sir.

364
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,820
I can't take it anymore.

365
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,860
I'm at my limits.

366
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,020
Can you get someone else to come

367
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,700
to at least take a shift?

368
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,740
Tonight,

369
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,340
I'll look for a place to stay.

370
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,020
Please get someone to help me.

371
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,660
Can you?

372
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,940
Feng.

373
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,820
Up till now, you've been the only intern

374
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,660
who lasted this long.

375
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,180
Ms. Wang

376
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,780
has probably been feeling

377
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,660
a lot of pressure lately.

378
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,780
Please be more patient.

379
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,660
No.

380
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,620
Sir.

381
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,620
I'm not an irresponsible person.

382
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,020
But the situation is not what you think.

383
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,180
It's fine that she's a drunkard.

384
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,740
But...

385
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,740
But she's got sticky hands.

386
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,860
Tianlan.

387
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,100
I guess you're stressed out.

388
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,820
Do you know

389
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,580
she's one of the top ten

390
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,060
best-earning writers in the country?

391
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,260
Listen.

392
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
We'll move up
your permanent staff appointment.

393
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,940
I'll give you
the title of exclusive editor.

394
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,860
No.

395
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,540
Sir.

396
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,660
This doesn't work for me.

397
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,260
I'm an upstanding youth

398
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,940
with great ambition.

399
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm not going to let
Ms. Wang destroy me.

400
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,780
Tianlan.

401
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,620
Wang Putao is ill.

402
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,780
Sir.

403
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,300
You can save your jokes.

404
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,900
She eats well, sleeps well.

405
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,500
I often found her

406
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,140
taking naps,

407
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,020
even snoring loudly.

408
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,180
She's alive and kicking.

409
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,140
How can she be ill?

410
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,420
You might as well say I was ill.

411
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,540
That's more believable.

412
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,820
It's true.

413
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,900
I don't know what happened this year.

414
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,500
Ms. Wang suddenly stopped
submitting her drafts.

415
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,540
When she's in a good mood,

416
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,140
anything goes.

417
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,780
When she's in a bad mood,
it's heck for us.

418
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
I've got a test with me here.

419
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,380
Go and get her tested.

420
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,900
If the score is very high,

421
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
inform me immediately.

422
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,340
We'll get her help.

423
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,420
Maybe we could find out
what the problem is.

424
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,460
Use your wit

425
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,500
to make Ms. Wang do the test,

426
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
not by force.

427
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,700
All the best,

428
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,660
Feng.
