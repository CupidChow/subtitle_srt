3
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,300
=Episode 23=

4
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,740
Hello?

5
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,300
Hello.

6
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,660
This is Kangle Nursing Home.

7
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,380
Your dad was diagnosed with

8
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,660
Alzheimer's disease six months ago.

9
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,740
Please come back to handle it soon.

10
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,140
(And for this reason,)

11
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,020
(you have no choice but to set out)

12
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
(to meet)

13
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,660
(a familiar stranger)

14
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,780
(in your life.)

15
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,580
Why don't we go by plane?

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,900
Maybe, I wish to prolong the journey.

17
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,220
(Fear and hesitant.)

18
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,580
(Because you don't know
how to face that person.)

19
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,220
He won't recover

20
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
even though I go back.

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm just going back to lift the burden

22
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,140
from my conscience a little.

23
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,220
(You made up all kinds of excuses)

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,060
(to deny what had happened.)

25
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,980
(Deep in your mind,)

26
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:50,980
(you've already rehearsed)

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,340
(how you meet him countless times.)

28
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
(It might be a fight,)

29
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,260
(a happy reunion,)

30
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,380
(a touching moment,)

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,420
(or a sad meeting.)

32
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,500
(But)

33
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,020
(when this day actually arrives,)

34
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,020
(he)

35
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,700
(has forgotten you completely.)

36
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Do you still remember me?

37
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,980
Who are you?

38
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,900
What are you doing in my home?

39
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,820
Why didn't you call and tell me

40
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
about your sickness?

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,340
Who's sick?

42
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,820
- What's with your attitude?
- What's with your attitude?

43
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,500
Please talk calmly.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,420
Don't be angry.

45
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,700
No arguments.

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,100
She said I was sick.

47
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,100
No.

48
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,940
Of course you're not.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,900
Hadn't Mr. Wu
of the labor union phoned me

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,940
and told me about your sickness,

51
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,220
I wouldn't have known about this.

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,660
Putao.

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,780
What?

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
What grape?
(*Grape pronounced as "pu tao")

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,380
I don't want to eat grapes.

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,700
No.

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,660
It's not about grapes.

58
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,020
It's nothing.

59
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,660
You two are a couple.

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,260
This is ridiculous.

61
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,420
What about my daughter, Xiwen?

62
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm leaving!

63
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,740
Get out now!

64
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,820
That's enough, you two!

65
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,540
Stop bickering!

66
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,180
That's all you do!

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,540
No one's making a fuss!

68
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,300
You'll have another talk

69
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,380
later!

70
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,180
Why are you still standing here?

71
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,340
Putao.

72
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,740
I think we need to talk.

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,540
(This is what happened.)

74
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,180
(I thought)

75
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,740
I was fully prepared to confront him.

76
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,700
I wouldn't even dream

77
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,140
that he could be such a maniac.

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,180
To hide from him,

79
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,860
I changed my name

80
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,700
and many identities.

81
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,460
I hid from him all this time.

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,620
But he always found me

83
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,900
no matter how hard I tried.

84
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,860
But recently, I've thought it through.

85
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,420
If not,

86
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,740
I'd probably be crouching

87
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,780
under the long shadow of him all my life.

88
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,780
But Putao,

89
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,900
as long as we stay together...

90
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,940
I started all of this.

91
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,100
I fear that he might hurt you.

92
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,260
Tianlan.

93
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,860
Can you do me a favor?

94
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Please take my dad

95
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,540
back to the hospital.

96
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Take him back to the hospital?

97
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,020
But you just met him.

98
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,180
It's dangerous

99
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,580
for him to stay with us.

100
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,260
Listen.

101
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,500
Don't be afraid.

102
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm with you.

103
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,660
(Where's my money?)

104
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,220
(Oh, no.)

105
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,140
(I hide all of it in the hospital.)

106
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,220
(Mr. Wang.)

107
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
(Where are you?)

108
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,780
(Come on, time for lunch.)

109
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,180
Let me help you.

110
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,820
Here.

111
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,500
We're going back to the hospital later.

112
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,860
Yes.

113
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,980
We're going back.

114
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,220
Feng.

115
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,580
Is Xi

116
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,900
about to finish school soon?

117
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,100
You might lose the key

118
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,940
if you put it there.

119
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,220
It won't happen.

120
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,580
No one sees it here.

121
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,380
Otherwise, Xi can't open the door

122
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,020
when she comes back.

123
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,820
Nice to meet you.

124
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,500
Nice to meet you.

125
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,980
Feng.

126
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,220
Tell Xi

127
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,060
don't forget to eat the braised pork

128
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,180
when she comes back.

129
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,980
Sure.

130
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,220
Well, tell her

131
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,180
I miss her.

132
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,100
If she has time,

133
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,700
ask her to visit me.

134
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,580
I will.

135
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,700
Tell her

136
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,860
that I couldn't take care of her

137
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,220
all these years,

138
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,500
because I have to go out to sea and work

139
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,820
to provide for the family.

140
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
This is the only thing I can do.

141
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,220
I don't know anything else.

142
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,700
I've done everything I can.

143
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,980
Please don't hate me.

144
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,220
We should leave now.

145
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,100
(When I truly realize
I should cherish my dad)

146
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,620
(and want to make amends for him,)

147
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,980
(I find)

148
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,620
(that his memory has been frozen
in the past.)

149
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,460
(Perhaps,)

150
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,700
(he can never remember
who I am anymore.)

151
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,860
His condition has worsened

152
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,580
and fluctuated since last night.

153
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:23,980
I know.

154
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm anxious, too.

155
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,220
When he was sent here,

156
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,460
he never stopped mentioning
his daughter.

157
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,060
The girl is quite cruel, though.

158
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,380
Yeah.

159
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,860
My money.

160
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,860
My money.

161
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,980
My money.

162
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,300
What have you done to me?

163
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,740
Why does my face become so old?

164
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,860
Calm down.

165
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
Please listen to me.

166
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,380
Actually...

167
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,700
How can I calm myself?

168
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,220
Can you stay calm

169
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,100
when your face ages overnight?

170
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,980
Can you

171
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,340
still saunter around

172
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,340
with your hands behind your back

173
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,820
as if nothing has happened?

174
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,980
You tell me.

175
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,580
What...

176
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
What should I do now?

177
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,820
It must be your scheme.

178
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,500
I know it.

179
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,740
Mind your words.

180
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,740
We're concerned about you.

181
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,500
Concerned?

182
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,220
If it's true, why did you turn me

183
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,300
into an old man?

184
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,820
I was a young chap

185
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,700
sailing on the sea yesterday.

186
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,740
How come

187
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm so old today?

188
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,620
The patient gown makes you look fairer.

189
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,820
Give me back my young face.

190
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,580
You...

191
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,180
Why did my hands become rough?

192
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,340
My hands.

193
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,300
What has happened to my hands?

194
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,820
My hands weren't rough

195
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,580
when I was working on the ship.

196
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,860
Ship?

197
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,980
Does it

198
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,300
ring a bell?

199
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,940
Yes, the ship.

200
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,620
I've been on the ship for years.

201
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,180
Right.

202
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Many years.

203
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,300
I've been watching the sun

204
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,340
rises and sets every day.

205
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
The first mate

206
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,340
and the third mate fought each other.

207
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,060
And they fell into the sea.

208
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,220
They're so crazy.

209
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,620
One at the front and one behind.

210
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
(I must get out of this place.)

211
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,220
I'm so sorry about that.

212
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,940
What's wrong with me?

213
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,300
Um...

214
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,700
Can I get some fresh air out there?

215
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,980
Sure.

216
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,940
I'll go with you.

217
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,380
Right.

218
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,140
Hello.

219
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,860
I'm not in my office now.

220
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,580
Well,

221
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,140
you can put it in the doorkeeper's room.

222
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,580
All right.

223
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,260
Thank you.

224
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,580
Wang?

225
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,020
Wang!

226
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,500
Wang!

227
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,540
Wang!

228
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,380
Wang!

229
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,180
Wang!

230
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,180
Wang!

231
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,780
Xiwen.

232
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,900
Yes, Mr. Wu?

233
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,140
Your dad ran away again.

234
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,020
What has happened?

235
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,940
Mr. Wu said

236
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,860
my dad had run away again.

237
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,620
Hey.

238
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,500
Calm down.

239
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,580
He's familiar with the hospital.

240
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,780
He'll be fine.

241
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,420
Let's call the police

242
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,660
and look for him afterward.

243
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,540
Name.

244
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,260
Wang Heping.

245
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,620
Age.

246
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,420
Sixty.

247
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,780
Identity card number.

248
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,740
Here it is.

249
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,660
Tell the officer

250
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,140
based on the information on this sheet.

251
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,740
It's updated every year.

252
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,420
(Memory loss, impaired judgment,
losing track of time)

253
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
(His time recognition recedes
by 21 or 16 years.)

254
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,820
(His favorite food is bananas.)

255
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,540
(He hates to be asked about the past.)

256
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,140
(Missing)

257
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
So my dad

258
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,180
is 53 years old.

259
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
May I charge my phone here?

260
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,740
We don't have this cable.

261
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,660
How much is this?

262
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,860
One yuan.

263
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,020
Thank you.

264
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,860
Your Popsicle.

265
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,860
Wang Heping.

266
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,060
Mr. Wang.

267
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,340
Wang Heping.

268
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
Wang Heping!

269
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,100
Mr. Wang.

270
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,380
Let's split up.

271
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,340
Wang Heping!

272
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,780
Mr. Wang!

273
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,620
Wang Heping!

274
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
(Mr. Wang: Where are you?)

275
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,860
(Please reply to me once you read this.)

276
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,580
(Xiwen and I are worried about you.)

277
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,500
Dad.

278
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,580
Dad.

279
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,620
(He must have come back.)

280
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,580
(Because)

281
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,220
(since I was young,)

282
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,860
(whenever I see a 100 yuan bill here,)

283
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,740
(I know that my dad is back.)

284
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,860
You pamper her too much.

285
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,620
You put in a new bill
after she takes it.

286
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,340
You've given her too much.

287
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,180
You know nothing.

288
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,620
Daughters should be well provided for.

289
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,620
Besides,

290
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,300
I don't come back often per year.

291
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,700
Dad.

292
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,620
You're home, sweetheart.

293
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,540
(Since then,)

294
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,420
(I had never returned home for him.)

295
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,820
(When I came home yesterday,)

296
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,940
(I saw the 100 yuan bill
that I didn't take out of anger)

297
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,660
(was still there.)

298
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,620
(It's been a really long time)

299
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,780
(since I last came home.)

300
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,020
(Dad.)

301
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,780
(Did you come back for this?)

302
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,020
(Turns out)

303
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,540
(he remembers everything.)

304
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,860
Food in the hospital is just terrible.

305
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,140
Why are you here?

306
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Mr. Wang!

307
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Mr. Wang!

308
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
Mr. Wang!

309
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
