(An intern editor at Shanguan Culture.)

4
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,580
(The woman who has just exited the car)

5
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,380
(is called Wang Putao.)

6
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,780
(The author who I'm trying
to get the draft from.)

7
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,820
(One of the top ten best-selling
female authors.)

8
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,620
(Also known as)

9
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
(the Ogress.)

10
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,060
(This half-naked man on the beach)

11
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,740
(who's afraid to get into the water)

12
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,580
(is me.)

13
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,380
(If you want to know
why I have to go so far)

14
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,860
(as to jump into the sea
just to get the draft,)

15
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,700
(we have to go back to
when I was young.)

16
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,540
I don't want to play
hide-and-seek anymore.

17
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,940
I'm always the seeker.

18
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,500
It has been three months.

19
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,700
I want to play it.

20
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Tianlan.

21
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,820
You've been the seeker
for so many times.

22
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,860
So why don't do it one more time?

23
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,900
My mom told me

24
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,420
that we have to love what we do.

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,300
Look at how happy we are.

26
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,340
(Yes.)

27
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,740
(I've never been able to say no
since I was young.)

28
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,100
Well.

29
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,980
Okay then.

30
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,700
It'll be the last time
for this year then.

31
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,620
Let's go.

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,500
Let's go.

33
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,820
(If I had said no,)

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,260
(maybe none of this would've happened.)

35
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,140
(Or if I had listened
to my parents back then)

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,500
(and not included being
Wang Putao's editor)

37
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,940
(in my career plan.)

38
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,540
We won't interfere

39
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
with what you want to do.

40
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,220
But you have to listen to us

41
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,540
when it comes to your job.

42
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,100
Dad.

43
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,100
Mom.

44
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,980
There are things that I want to do.

45
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,660
(No.)

46
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,380
(I don't want to do it.)

47
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,620
(Copy Editor:
Shanguan Culture Co., Ltd.)

48
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,950
(The Last Night)

49
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,980
Feng Tianlan.

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:02,940
Come in.

51
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,380
Okay.

52
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,700
Age.

53
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm 25.

54
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,980
Height.

55
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm 183 cm tall.

56
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,980
Weight.

57
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,540
I weigh 69 kilograms.

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,540
Academic qualifications.

59
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,500
I graduated from a national key university
and hold a double bachelor's degree

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,380
in Chinese
and Film Directing and Production.

61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,820
I studied Chinese Literature
and Foreign Philosophy.

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,980
What are your strengths?

63
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,420
I have a stronger sense
of self-management

64
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
and obedience.

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,940
I'm not afraid to sacrifice...

66
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,860
Enough.

67
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,060
Have you read her book before?

68
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,820
I think so.

69
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,500
But...

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,400
(The Last Night)

71
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,420
I've never read it before.

72
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:46,820
Okay.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,380
Your salary as an intern will be 20,000.

74
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,820
Twenty thousand?

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,860
It's not nine-to-nine, six days a week.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
And it's not 12-12, seven days a week.

77
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,300
Your salary is guaranteed.

78
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,300
And you can get commissions
from your project.

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,540
If you continue to work for us,
you'll get a 30% increase in salary.

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,300
Aren't you satisfied with it?

81
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,740
I think it's too good for me.

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,300
You think that everyone in the world
is excellent

83
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,700
except for you.

84
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,740
I really like how humble you are.

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,540
You've been wearing second-hand clothes
since you were young

86
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,980
and bullied by everyone every day.

87
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,420
When you are used to disappointment,

88
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,740
you won't be afraid
to face it again and again,

89
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,180
living a plain and diligent life.

90
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,860
There aren't many young people
like you now.

91
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,500
We've interviewed more than 100 people.

92
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,500
I've never met

93
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,420
someone

94
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,300
as diffident, timid,

95
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,900
weak, and cautious as you,

96
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,420
who has a little bit of OCD.

97
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,980
Yes.

98
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,380
My goodness.

99
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,180
I love that a lot.

100
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,580
The important thing here

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,380
is we've chosen you.

102
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,740
Are you willing to join us

103
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,740
and accept this challenge together?

104
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,420
- Come to us.
- Come to us.

105
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,940
Come to us.

106
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm worth 20,000?

107
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,180
Are you willing to accept the challenge?

108
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,940
An annual salary of 200,000
is waiting for you.

109
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,300
That's 40,000 less.

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
- That's not important.
- That's not important.

111
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,260
The important thing is you are the best.

112
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,740
- You are the best!
- You are the best!

113
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
I am the best.

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,620
- You are the best!
- You are the best!

115
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,700
Are we too ruthless?

116
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,860
He just graduated.

117
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,820
A university student.

118
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,940
I can only wish him all the best.

119
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,500
(Yes.)

120
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,260
(I should've left back then.)

121
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,180
(The three of them)

122
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,860
(looked at me with pity,)

123
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,940
(with genuine tears in their eyes.)

124
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,700
(Foreshadowing the torment)

125
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,940
(that has just begun.)

126
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,980
Can I help you?

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,820
Hello.

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Is Ms. Wang Putao, the writer,

129
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,420
at home?

130
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,180
I am Wang Putao.

131
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,300
You are Wang Putao?

132
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,860
The Wang Putao who kills
a dozen people in every novel

133
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,620
and writes millions of words every year?

134
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,860
Yeah. Can I help you?

135
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,300
Nice to meet you.

136
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Let me introduce myself.

137
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,300
I am Feng Tianlan.

138
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
I'm the new intern editor
at Shanguan Culture.

139
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,740
I'm now in charge
of publishing your books.

140
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,700
I don't want to write anymore!

141
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,420
Wait.

142
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,860
You

143
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
are not Wang Putao, right?

144
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,820
How do you know?

145
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,580
You are supposed
to be from Qionghai, right?

146
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,900
But you have a different accent.

147
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,940
Wang Putao,

148
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,740
Ms. Wang,

149
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,940
I know that you are in there.

150
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,740
Please come out.

151
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,100
Wang...

152
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
You're

153
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,300
so annoying!

154
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,420
(No.)

155
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,540
(There's no such thing as "ifs".)

156
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,820
(Maybe everything)

157
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,340
(is destined to happen.)

158
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,820
Come in.

159
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,460
Ms. Wang Putao.

160
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,180
Writer Wang.

161
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,700
Nice to meet you.

162
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,780
I'm an intern editor
from Shanguan Culture

163
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,300
who will be in charge of you.

164
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,180
I am Feng Tianlan.

165
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,180
It's my pleasure

166
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,900
to be able to help you
with your newest book.

167
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,340
Although I'm not that experienced,

168
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,540
I'll do my very best

169
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,700
so that it's to your approval.

170
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,060
You have always been highly acclaimed
among emerging writers.

171
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,540
I have always admired you.

172
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,420
What have I written before?

173
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,420
The Tragic Land Reclamation.

174
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,340
The July Reincarnation.

175
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,820
Harvest Celebration.

176
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,020
Which of them is not mine?

177
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,780
They all are.

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,980
What is this?

179
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,300
Your internship is tied to my new book,

180
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,660
right?

181
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,820
Without a new book,

182
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,060
you'll lose your job, right?

183
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,300
Yes.

184
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,060
Am I hard to get along?

185
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,340
Yes.

186
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,420
No.

187
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,060
Am I easy to handle?

188
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,060
That's not what I mean.

189
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,420
By the way,

190
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,820
where's my car?

191
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,700
I don't know

192
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,700
where your car is.

193
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,780
I can't write without my car.

194
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
I have never seen an author

195
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,500
who can't write without a car.

196
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,980
Looks like you don't know me at all.

197
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,620
And you are not that smart.

198
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,900
I don't want an editor，

199
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,020
but a partner.

200
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,940
In sports, you have the striker and...

201
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,540
The defender?

202
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,780
In war, you have the vanguard and...

203
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,940
Logistics support?

204
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,300
Well...

205
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,300
Ms. Wang.

206
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,460
I'm here to talk to you
about the new book,

207
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,820
not to talk about me.

208
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,580
I'm talking about the new book.

209
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,300
But something has happened in my family.

210
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,180
I can't write.

211
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,940
What happened?

212
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,340
Didn't they tell you about it?

213
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,460
What is it?

214
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,660
Yesterday,

215
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,820
my dad...

216
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,060
Your father...

217
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,660
No. Ms. Wang.

218
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,420
Don't be sad.

219
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,700
Life is like a journey.

220
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,180
Leaving doesn't mean that it is the end.

221
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,180
There are many things
that cannot be explained by science.

222
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,340
Maybe in another dimension

223
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,540
lies the ultimate happiness.

224
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,700
Never mind.

225
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,780
I'll go back and tell the company
about your situation.

226
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,060
My condolences to you.

227
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,300
Well...

228
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,060
I'll leave now.

229
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,300
Do you have a life motto?

230
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,420
Work hard
so that everyone can see my effort.

231
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,060
See your effort?

232
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,580
What can they see?

233
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,420
I should ask you this instead.

234
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,700
Do you have any codes of conduct?

235
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,140
On which aspects?

236
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,060
Anything.

237
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,580
Don't lie to anyone.

238
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,180
Treat everyone nicely.

239
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
Treat the people around me well.

240
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,060
Be considerate of others.

241
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Obey the law.

242
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,220
Take care of the plants around you.

243
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,060
You are so righteous!

244
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,660
You are indeed the editor
that Shanguan Culture has hired.

245
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,540
Well said.

246
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,820
You are the one I'm looking for.

247
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,460
No one has ever understood me so well.

248
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
You are the editor
who I've been looking for.

249
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,020
What?

250
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,940
Ms. Wang.

251
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,460
What did I say?

252
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,900
Aren't we talking

253
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,020
about your father now?

254
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,300
Although my father is still alive,

255
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,420
you'll never know

256
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,140
where he'll be tomorrow.

257
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,780
Your father is still alive?

258
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,460
What is the meaning of that?

259
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,540
Are you cursing my dad?

260
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,020
No.

261
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,700
That's not what I mean.

262
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,540
But, Ms. Wang,

263
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,220
you can't joke

264
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,020
about your parents and elders like that.

265
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:13,940
Let's set it aside for now.

266
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,140
I'm a little bit excited.

267
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,940
Can you drive?

268
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,700
Yes.

269
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,340
Have you been on the freeway before?

270
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,060
Of course.

271
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,180
How about this?

272
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,420
Drive my car here,

273
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,780
and I'll give you two chapters.

274
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,060
You have to keep your word.

275
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,940
I'll keep my word.

276
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,700
By the way,

277
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,420
Ms. Wang.

278
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,940
What's your number plate?

279
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,820
I don't remember.

280
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,580
(Bar Addresses)
(These are the bars she often visits.)

281
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,700
(Maybe her car is parked
at one of them.)

282
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,060
(All the best.)

283
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,700
(TIKI)
(You can do it.)

284
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,700
Hello.

285
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,380
Sir.

286
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:35,980
It's me.

287
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
I had gone to more than 20 bars

288
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
that she often visits

289
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,900
based on your list.

290
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,820
But I couldn't find her car.

291
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm at the last address now.

292
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,700
Sir.

293
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,300
What should I do

294
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,620
if I can't find her car?

295
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,060
Will you fire me?

296
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,540
It's okay, Feng.

297
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,180
You'll find the car.

298
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,780
Relax.

299
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,460
By the way,

300
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,020
if she owes the bar some money,

301
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
get the invoice for me

302
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,940
and settle the bill yourself first.

303
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,140
Sir.

304
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,820
For every bar I went to,

305
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,060
I was asked to settle her debt.

306
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,340
I already paid 35,000 in total.

307
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,580
That's two months of my salary.

308
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,540
About the invoice,

309
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,940
do I really need the invoice
to claim the money?

310
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,060
I'm hanging up.

311
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,460
I think it's him.

312
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,220
Yes.

313
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,820
Get the money from him?

314
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,180
Okay.

315
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,820
I'll hang up now.

316
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,700
Hello.

317
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,060
Are you the owner here?

318
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,340
Can I help you?

319
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,580
Do you know Wang Putao,

320
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,900
Writer Wang?

321
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,700
Writer Wang?

322
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,220
What does she write?

323
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,580
Romance, suspense, and science fiction?

324
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,140
Aliens and beasts romance?

325
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,300
Or is it time traveling
and the reincarnation of AI?

326
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,540
Heart-wrenching love?

327
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,700
The mysteries of the universe?

328
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,540
I don't know Wang Putao.

329
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,700
But there's a woman

330
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,180
who drinks here every day.

331
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,580
She is drunk

332
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,060
every time.

333
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,460
And she owes me money.

334
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,940
Again?

335
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,140
How much does she owe you?

336
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,700
Let me check.

337
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,900
It's 38,000.

338
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,700
How much?

339
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:53,180
(You have made a payment of 38,000.)

340
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,700
Here you go.

341
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
You are such a responsible person.

342
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,300
Wait.

343
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,020
Sir.

344
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,820
Where's her car?

345
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,220
Her car?

346
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,100
How would I know where it is?

347
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,460
Maybe you should ask her.

348
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,500
You can leave now.

349
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,940
Wait.

350
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,260
Can you give me an invoice?

351
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,940
There's no invoice.

352
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,100
And there's no car.

353
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,420
Maybe I can get you a bottle of Coke.

354
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,980
You look like a good boy.

355
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,100
So, I'll tell you where it is.

356
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,660
Don't tell anyone
that I told you about it.

357
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,780
Otherwise, I may lose my bar.

358
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,580
What is the number plate?

359
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,950
(4F Parking Lot)

360
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,980
Which car is it?

361
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:11,940
Hello,

362
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,380
sir.

363
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,500
Feng.

364
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,980
How is it?

365
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,740
Is it going well?

366
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,940
Sir.

367
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,380
I really

368
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,020
can't figure out Ms. Wang.

369
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,380
Feng.

370
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,620
You have to work harder.

371
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,940
I've already come up
with a publicity plan for the new book.

372
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,140
If there's no book,

373
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,020
I have nothing to promote.

374
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,620
I can't do this anymore.

375
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,420
Yesterday,

376
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,340
I searched the parking lot
the whole night.

377
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,340
And I even spent the night here.

378
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,500
I...

379
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,940
I'll give you 25,000.

380
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,580
Okay, sir.

381
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,180
I'll go find the car now.

382
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,700
Feng.

383
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Haven't you found the car yet?

384
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,420
We are running out of time.

385
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,340
I forgot to put the batteries in.

386
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,900
If it weren't

387
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,380
because you could drive
on the freeway,

388
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,420
I really didn't want to bring you along.

389
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,700
You have to love what you do.

390
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,700
As long as I work hard,
everyone will see my worth?

391
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,900
Even paying me 25,000 a month
can't make me stay.

392
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,700
I'm really touched

393
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,980
by the effort that you've put in.

394
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,340
Look. What is this?

395
00:21:59,420 --> 00:21:59,940
How about this?

396
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,900
I'll revise the conditions.

397
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,780
If you send me home by car,

398
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,700
I'll tell you the full story

399
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,620
in the car.

400
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,740
Listen carefully.

401
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,740
I'll tell you the full story.

402
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:09,900
Then,

403
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,140
you can turn it into a manuscript.

404
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
Then, you'll be able

405
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,460
to send in the work every day.

406
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,460
Isn't that perfect?

407
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,900
Send you home by car?

408
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,140
I can send you home right now.

409
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,980
Are you joking with me?

410
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,940
Not that house.

411
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,980
It's the other one
through the freeway.

412
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,700
Is it far from here?

413
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,180
I don't think so.

414
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,740
Why?

415
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,900
Are you not willing to do it?

416
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,100
You want people
to see your worth, right?

417
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,780
Opportunity

418
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,020
knocks but once.

419
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,140
Fine.

420
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,900
I've changed my mind.

421
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,620
Please don't.

422
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,860
Well...

423
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,980
Ms. Wang.

424
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,660
Can I ask you

425
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,420
why you want to go back?

426
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,940
I didn't lie to you.

427
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,900
My dad has really fallen sick.

428
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,220
Ms. Wang.

429
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,500
Although I'm doing this

430
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,620
for my salary of 25,000,

431
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,020
nothing is more important

432
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,860
than sending you home right now.

433
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,860
Ms. Wang.

434
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,700
Where's your house?

435
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,580
I need to input the location
into the GPS.

436
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,700
Qionghai.

437
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,740
Qionghai?

438
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,740
Qionghai in Hainan?

439
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:42,980
Yes.

440
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,060
Ms. Wang, we are in Beijing now.

441
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,780
(When I saw that smile,)

442
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,620
(I knew there must be
more to it than meets the eye.)

443
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,340
(The distance
between Beijing and Qionghai)

444
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,420
(2,367 km away from Qionghai, Hainan)
(is 2,367 km.)

445
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,940
(Capital Airport)
(It'll take only four hours by plane.)

446
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,340
(It'll take 33 hours by train.)

447
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,980
(But Ms. Wang insisted
on going home by car.)

448
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,180
(Do you think that's the end?)

449
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,740
(Actually,)

450
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,940
(she doesn't want to go home)

451
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,580
(at all.)

452
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,940
(Ms. Wang.)

453
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,420
(We should hit the road today.)

454
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,700
(My car can't be on the road today
because of road space rationing.)

455
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,420
(We can't leave.)

456
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,700
Ms. Wang.

457
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:52,700
We need another person.

458
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:52,980
Hurry up.

459
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,100
North wind.

460
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,700
Feng.

461
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,420
Please help Ms. Li pick up

462
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,380
her two daughters.

463
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,260
Cheers.

464
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,620
Let's drink.

465
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,860
Not bad.

466
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,940
I've learned this tonight.

467
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,740
What do you think?

468
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,420
Amazing.

469
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,340
Aren't I great?

470
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,340
Let's do it again.

471
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,100
My mom told me

472
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,500
that we have to love what we do.

473
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,740
(But you have to listen to us)

474
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,780
when it comes to your job.

475
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,620
Your salary as an intern will be 20,000.

476
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,860
You are so annoying!

477
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,900
Qionghai.

478
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:44,980
(No.)

479
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,980
(You can't keep this up, Feng Tianlan.)

480
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,420
(You have to put up a fight.)

481
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,620
(You have to resist.)

482
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,420
(You have to...)

483
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,380
Ms. Wang.

484
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,700
You can reject me

485
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,500
and not give me the manuscript.

486
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,340
You can also torture me

487
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,300
by making me search everywhere
to look for your car.

488
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,620
I just want to know this.

489
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,980
You lied to me,
saying that your father was ill.

490
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,700
And that you wanted to visit him.

491
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,780
Now, you are just out drinking,
walking your dog,

492
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,860
and playing mahjong.

493
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,700
I got bitten

494
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,860
for trying to bathe your dog.

495
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,180
Is your father even ill?

496
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,580
Is it fun to lie to me?

497
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,180
Let me be honest with you.

498
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,460
I can't write anymore.

499
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,340
What?

500
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,780
After completing The Last Night,

501
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,020
I can't write anymore.

502
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,260
I have so many things on my mind

503
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,700
when I sit in front of the computer.

504
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,900
Still, I can't write.

505
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,700
So many things
are weighing down on my mind.

506
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,940
I don't know what to do about myself.

507
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,700
You are very earnest

508
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,340
and kind.

509
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,420
So, let me tell you the truth.

510
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,540
My father is not ill.

511
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,500
