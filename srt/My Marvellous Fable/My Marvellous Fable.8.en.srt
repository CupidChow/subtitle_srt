=My Marvellous Fable=

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,020
=Episode 8=

4
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,375
(A year later)

5
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,820
(Xu Youguang became)

6
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,940
(the face of Star Film Company)

7
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,820
(after the success of several films.)

8
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,500
(Not only did he build
a successful career,)

9
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,780
(but he also)

10
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,620
(attracted the attention)

11
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,420
(of the daughter of his boss.)

12
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,460
The food is not to your liking?

13
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,580
No.

14
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,460
I've been working

15
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,220
with the theatrical troupe
since I was young.

16
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,100
After that, I worked for my senior.

17
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,220
I've encountered a lot of hardships.

18
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,500
I seldom get a chance

19
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,860
to eat meat like this.

20
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,700
See.

21
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,020
It's all good now.

22
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,020
That's not what I meant.

23
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,540
The steak is delicious.

24
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,340
I meant it.

25
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,260
Youguang.

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,180
Just let me know if you need any help

27
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,100
in the future.

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,300
Cheers.

29
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,260
Miss Zhang.

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,300
Thank you.

31
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,620
Mr. Xu.

33
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,220
The boss has mentioned before

34
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,220
that it's not good for you to show up

35
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,500
at this kind of place.

36
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,980
Mr. Xu?

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,780
Let's go.

38
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,940
(Xu Youguang could only leave quietly)

39
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,980
(after hearing
what the ricksha puller said.)

40
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,780
(After all, he still needed
Mr. Zhang's support.)

41
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,220
Madam, a bowl of wonton, please.

42
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,820
Coming.

43
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,500
(On one hand, he didn't dare to reject
Miss Zhang directly)

44
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,540
(on the other, he didn't want to let go
of his love for Guixiang.)

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,340
(Xu Youguang was facing a dilemma.)

46
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,660
(It's okay.)

47
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
(It's fine
as long as I'm with Youguang.)

48
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
What is there to be proud of

49
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,900
for being a toy boy?

50
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,780
He's relying on Mr. Zhang's daughter.

51
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,980
Just a wimp who depends on a woman.

52
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,220
Have you heard about it?

53
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,140
He even wanted to compete
with Bai Guangnan for a role.

54
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,780
Do you see his poor appearance?

55
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,900
He definitely doesn't stand a chance.

56
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,460
What is it?

57
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,500
Who are you talking about?

58
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,740
Who else?

59
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,700
Xu Youguang.

60
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,060
Before this,

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,380
he was acting a dead man
just like we did.

62
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,540
But his situation has changed now.

63
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,940
What do you mean?

64
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,940
Why are you guys here?

65
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,220
Do you still want to work?

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Work? How?

67
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,460
We're bored to death.

68
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,980
We still need to wait for Xu Youguang.

69
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,220
We have waited for a long time.

70
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,460
Yet, the shooting still hasn't started.

71
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,260
What do you guys know?

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,740
Youguang is looking
for the vibe, okay?

73
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,500
He's finding the feeling.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,740
He's composing.

75
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,060
What do you know?

76
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,420
Get out of here.

77
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,220
Get lost!

78
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,980
Unbelievable.

79
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,500
Director.

80
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,380
Is everything ready?

81
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,380
It's almost ready.

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,220
We're just waiting for you.

83
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,500
Be quiet.

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,540
The shooting is going to start.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,020
(When it's time, you all will know)

86
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,500
(I, Xu Youguang, am really capable.)

87
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,260
Youguang.

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,020
I heard the foreign director

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,740
is coming to Shanghai
to pick a male lead.

90
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,540
I have auditioned for it.

91
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,740
I heard that it's very competitive.

92
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,900
Shall I ask my dad

93
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,500
to talk with that director?

94
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:36,675
(Wonton)

95
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,820
Thank you for your kindness.

96
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,460
Miss Zhang.

97
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,740
I'll figure it out on my own

98
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,780
about the role.

99
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,020
This little brat doesn't know
his position at all.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,980
How dare he reject my daughter!

101
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,140
Ask Bai Guangnan to come here!

102
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,380
Breaking news!

103
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,500
The famous director
is preparing for a new film,

104
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,980
and Star Film Company
changed the actor at the last minute.

105
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,980
Bai Guangnan took the limelight!

106
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,700
Let's buy a newspaper.

107
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,660
Breaking news!

108
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,900
Star Film Company
changed the actor at the last minute.

109
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
Breaking news!

110
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,140
Bai Guangnan took the limelight!

111
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,060
You're back?

112
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,180
Come on.

113
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
I made wonton for you.

114
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,100
Here you go.

115
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,100
You don't...

116
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,980
like it?

117
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,260
No.

118
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,540
It's not your problem.

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,540
I failed the audition.

120
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,380
Why am I never good enough

121
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
when I've worked so hard

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,620
and sacrificed so much?

123
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,420
Youguang.

124
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
You are always the best

125
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,940
in my heart.

126
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,620
I'm the best in your heart?

127
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,260
Yes.

128
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
But what good will that do?

129
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
Youguang.

130
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,660
My dad sent me a letter.

131
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,140
He said

132
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,140
he wanted to see us
during the Mid-Autumn Festival

133
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,020
next month.

134
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,980
I've picked a good day

135
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
and bought the train tickets.

136
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,475
(Train tickets)

137
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,620
Sorry.

138
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,580
I can't go.

139
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,180
This is not the life that I want.

140
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,620
And I don't want to live like this.

141
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,980
I don't want to eat wonton every day

142
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,860
in this crappy house!

143
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,940
I just want to be with you.

144
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,500
I can always be there for you.

145
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,820
You can do everything

146
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,660
you want to do to your heart's content.

147
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,780
Isn't that...

148
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,580
enough?

149
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,580
But this is not the life that I want!

150
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,420
You want to have it all

151
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,660
and don't want to lose a thing.

152
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,660
You

153
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,060
are truly unreasonable.

154
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,540
It can be a relationship,

155
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,660
your love for someone,

156
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,540
or your true heart.

157
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,260
You have no idea

158
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,940
how much I've sacrificed for you.

159
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,580
Besides making and selling wonton,

160
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,620
what else do you know?

161
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,580
Youguang.

162
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,500
(How can others)

163
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,140
(replace me that easily
when I have sacrificed so much?)

164
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:25,940
(No.)

165
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,380
(I won't allow it!)

166
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,580
(I refuse to give in!)

167
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:42,575
(Fable Grocery Store)

168
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,900
Sir.

169
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,420
What are you wishing for today?

170
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,540
I want to get that role.

171
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,780
So what

172
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,300
are you going to give

173
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
to make the exchange with me?

174
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,860
My lover, Guixiang.

175
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,580
Are you sure?

176
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,420
Yes.

177
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,020
I'm aware.

178
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,780
She'll most likely forget about me.

179
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,020
At the worst,

180
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,020
we can get to know each other again.

181
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,340
Once you lose it,

182
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
you can never get it back again.

183
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
(Youguang.)

184
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,020
Youguang.

185
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,940
No.

186
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,340
Let me reconsider it.

187
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,140
No regrets

188
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,300
for your wish.

189
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,580
(Xu Youguang
was wandering on his way home,)

190
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,660
(regretting what he did out of impulse.)

191
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,820
(He was scared to go home.)

192
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,340
(He was afraid of facing
everything that might happen.)

193
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,500
Guang.

194
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,700
Guang.

195
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,500
Later, we're going to shoot the scene

196
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,980
where you sing and play the piano.

197
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,660
We can start at any time

198
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
after you're ready,

199
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,180
okay?

200
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,180
Guang.

201
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,940
Once you get started,

202
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,620
there won't be any problems anymore.

203
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,260
Right?

204
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,500
In my opinion,

205
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,900
you will just need to play a song.

206
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,340
After this movie is released,

207
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,620
it will definitely be a blockbuster.

Is it true?

Mr. Xu, what is your comment
on this matter?

223

Guang.

236
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,460
I heard from the doctor

237
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,180
that

238
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
you don't have any serious illness.

239
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,140
It's just that you're too tired

240
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,420
and mentally exhausted.

241
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,020
It's not that I wanted to nag you.

242
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,620
You're rich,

243
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,300
famous,

244
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,820
and have so many admirers,

245
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,660
but why are you feeling dejected?

246
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,100

247

You're incurable.

248
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,300
(Wonton)
Once you lose it,

249
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,860
you can never get it back again.

250
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,860
(That's why
even after I have become successful,)

251
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,980
(all I can feel)

252
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,020

254

I heard that you wanted to have wonton.

255
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,940
I have bought it for you.

256
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,780
This is the wonton that you love.

257
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,580
Thank you.

258
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,860
You don't have to do this.

259
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,180
You know my feelings,

260

don't you?

(I regret it.)

263

(I wish my senior and Guixiang)

264
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,180
(could come back to my side.)

(What should I do?)

Sir.

271

Please give me a bowl of wonton.

272
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,860
Okay.

273
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,100
Sir.

274
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,260
How do you make this wonton?

275
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,300
This is my family's recipe.

276
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,660
The key is to add half a spoon of lard

277
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,980
and my secret recipe.

278
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,820
There was a girl

279
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,340
who used the same recipe as yours.

280
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,260
Are you talking about Guixiang?

281
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,260
She is my niece.

282
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,500
Recently,

283
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,380
she just went back to her hometown.

284
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,500
Her family found a marriage for her.

285
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,460
She told me
that this was a good business.

286
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,380
That's why I'm here.

287
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,100
It's true

288
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,420
that this business is good.

289
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,820
I see.

290
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,180
That's good.

291
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,060
(I should have satisfied
my desire by working hard)

292
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,860
(instead of making the exchange
to possess it.)

293
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,260
(Perhaps, happiness
does not lie in wealth)

294
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,620
(but in contentment.)

295
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,460
(Surprisingly, the success
that I've exchanged for)

296
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,900
(couldn't even be compared
to this bowl of wonton.)

297
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,620
(Without Guixiang,)

298
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,700
(what's the purpose
of having everything?)

299
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,820
(I'm going to use everything
that I have to exchange for Guixiang.)

300
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Xu Youguang, this little liar.

301
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,620
He's really shameless.

302
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,340
He rejected my daughter

303
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,220
and made me lose so much money.

304
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll make sure
he won't be able to see tomorrow's sun.

305
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,780
(Guixiang.)

306
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
(Hope this letter finds you well.)

307
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,180
(Maybe you don't know me.)

308
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,060
(But I have known you for a long time.)

309
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,940
(If you don't mind)

310
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,500
(meeting me,)

311
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,940
(will you wait for me
under the Chinese parasol tree)

312
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,020
(at the end of the village bridge
on the full moon night of the 15th?)

313

(To Guixiang)

316
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,100
This story tells us

317
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,500
that humans are always thinking

318
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,420
about what they want

319
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,980
and never think about what they have.

320
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,860
They don't know

321
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,100
things that they own in the present

322
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,900
are just as precious as life.

323
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,900
(What is true happiness)

324
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,700
(in a person's life?)

325
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,780
(Actually, power and wealth)

326
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,140
(are not the only answers.)

327
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,460
(Worldly possessions
are not that important at all.)

328
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,460
(Cherish everything
that you already have around you.)

329
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,860
(Don't be bound by too many desires.)

330

(That's how you grasp
the true beauty of life.)

331
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,380
I want to go alone.

that Ms. Wang made for love)

for granted by someone.)
