00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,020
=Episode 9=

4
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,420
I thought that you had moved out.

5
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,340
I never thought
that you would still be staying here.

6
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,620
You know

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,980
that I once moved to a bigger house.

8
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,620
But I couldn't get used to it.

9
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,900
This house is quite old.

10
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,540
But at least it's where
we used to live together.

11
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,340
I'm too used to this house.

12
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
But I never thought

13
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,780
that you would agree to see me.

14
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,900
Don't misunderstand me.

15
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,900
A while ago,

16
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,500
someone asked me
to take something from here.

17
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,020
But I was busy previously.

18
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,900
I happened to pass by today.

19
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,620
So I came.

20
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,340
Wait a minute.

21
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,460
I think all of your things

22
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
are here.

23
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,620
Take a look

24
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,540
and see if there's anything missing.

25
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,500
I thought you threw them away.

26
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,980
After all, it has been so long.

27
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,020
I kept them here

28
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,940
because I thought that you might one day

29
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,860
come back to collect them.

30
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,860
By the way,

31
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,780
I sorted out things a while ago.

32
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,460
And I sold that old wardrobe.

33
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,780
Then, I remembered

34
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,980
that all of your things were inside it.

35
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,020
I chased the person

36
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,140
who recycled old furniture
across two streets

37
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,980
to finally reach him.

38
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,300
At first, he refused to give it back.

39
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,740
He thought

40
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,140
that there would be money inside.

41
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,700
I pleaded with him for so long.

42
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,860
Only then did he agree to give it back.

43
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,860
When I opened it,

44
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,620
it was full of your photos.

45
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,860
He told me,

46
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,580
"Your girlfriend looked beautiful."

47
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,100
Xu Youguang.

48
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,180
How have you been?

49
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,380
This place is too remote.

50
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,020
Are we in the right place?

51
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,940
We are in the right place
according to the GPS.

52
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,260
I wonder if anyone

53
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,420
is still living there.

54
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,180
It looks so run down.

55
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,380
Look.

56
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,740
This is where Guang stayed

57
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,700
when he worked on a project.

58
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,020
He stayed here?

59
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,860
It was many years ago.

60
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,700
At that time,
we were still in the university.

61
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,740
Let's go in and take a look.

62
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,940
Come on. Let's go and take some photos.

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,140
Guang?

64
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,100
Xu Youguang.

65
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,740
Is this just a coincidence?

66
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,820
(Xu Youguang's last release
before his death.)

67
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,540
(21st of January, 2019)
(Xu Youguang died from brain cancer)

68
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,900
(at the age of 29.)

69
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,100
(It's exactly the same name.)

70
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,580
(Could it be...)

71
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,820
(I thought that she made up
all of her stories.)

72
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,140
(So she came here today)

73
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,620
(for him.)

74
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,540
(But Xu Youguang
has passed away, right?)

75
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,540
Hello.

76
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,660
Are you Wang Putao, Ms. Wang?

77
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,220
Yes, I am.

78
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,180
I am Youguang's neighbor.

79
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,620
The one who contacted you
a few days ago.

80
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,780
Youguang asked me to give this
to you when he was still alive.

81
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,300
He stayed here
in the last moments of his life.

82
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,860
Do you have a laptop with you?

83
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,540
Yes.

84
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,780
Here you go.

85
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,706
(NO NAME)

86
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,660
So,

87
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,900
we are here for him.

88
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,300
I'll go and get you a bottle of water.

89
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,300
(I don't know
what she has just gone through.)

90
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,020
(When I see her standing in the rain
with her back to me,)

91
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,420
(I don't know if I should)

92
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,660
(shield her with the umbrella.)

93
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,060
Are you hungry?

94
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,540
Do you want to eat something?

95
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,300
Do you believe

96
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
in spirits in the afterworld?

97
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,180
If you think about someone,

98
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,660
he'll appear in your dream.

99
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,180
That scoundrel doesn't deserve
to appear in my dream.

100
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,060
Scoundrel?

101
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,180
Yes.

102
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,300
(He was a scoundrel.)

103
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,460
(It happened eight years ago.)

104
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,420
(I was 24 back then.)

105
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,140
(When I first met him,)

106
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,660
(he was still an unrecognized musician.)

107
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,500
Actually,

108
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,380
I don't really know how to do this.

109
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,460
It's okay.

110
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,540
I'm fine with anything.

111
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,660
Thank you.

112
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,660
(He looked like he was good
at taking care of others.)

113
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,660
(But, like you,)

114
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,460
(he was bad at everything.)

115
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,700
Your house is in such a remote place.

116
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,060
The rent in Tianjin is cheaper.

117
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,980
Those like us who work from home

118
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,020
don't need an expensive place to live.

119
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,660
By the way,

120
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,380
Yuanyuan is the one
who told me about you.

121
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,460
She said that you needed a lyricist.

122
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,580
Yes. Yuanyuan.

123
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,220
I wrote a new song recently.

124
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,900
Maybe I can play it for you.

125
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,780
Sure.

126
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,660
(The way he played his guitar
under the sunlight)

127
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
(looked so innocent.)

128
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,420
(Now that I think about it,)

129
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,180
(he must have tricked)

130
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,940
(a lot of young ladies in that way.)

131
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,780
(For instance, me at that time.)

132
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,820
It sounds great.

133
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,260
I wrote a lot of songs before this.

134
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,020
But I sold them all.

135
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,060
This one... I want to save it

136
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,900
for myself.

137
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,540
It's the most heartfelt song
that I've ever written.

138
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,020
It sounds great.

139
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,900
I feel it, too.

140
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,780
My stomach is also feeling it.

141
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,780
Where's the toilet?

142
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,540
You put milk into it, right?

143
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,060
I'm lactose-intolerant.

144
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,260
(Back then, I was in a situation
that I couldn't get out of.)

145
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
(He showed up)

146
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,700
(when I needed help the most.)

147
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,900
I'll teach him a lesson.

148
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,180
You are fine now.

149
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,060
You can stay here without worries.

150
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,060
Leave the rest to me.

151
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,780
No!

152
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,700
(He treated me very well.)

153
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,180
(But I think this was not for me alone.)

154
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,660
Actually, you don't have to help me.

155
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,580
And you don't have to take me in.

156
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,580
What if I told you

157
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,540
that I fell for you

158
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,780
the first time I saw you?

159
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,700
So I'm not helping you.

160
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,660
I'm just helping myself

161
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,420
to get the chance to approach you.

162
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,900
Youguang.

163
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm not a good match for you now.

164
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:31,660
You know...

165
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,180
It's okay.

166
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,580
I can wait.

167
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,740
As long as I can see you

168
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,460
when I wake up every day,

169
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,540
eat with you sitting across from me,

170
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,420
and have you with me every day,

171
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,180
it'll be enough.

172
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,300
This song

173
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,260
is called

174
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
"All About You".

175
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,460
(He wrote songs for me.)

176
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,780
(But I think)

177
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,420
(it was just
a spur-of-a-moment thing for him.)

178
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,820
(I used my new pseudonym, Wang Putao,)

179
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,660
(to publish my first book.)

180
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,300
(I thought)

181
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,180
(Save Me from the Dark)
(that my new life would begin.)

182
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,420
(But people always change eventually.)

183
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,460
A cup of coffee
whenever it's raining.

184
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,540
You are back.

185
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,700
What are we eating tonight?

186
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,060
They said no!

187
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,540
They told me that my songs
were not good enough.

188
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,260
They asked me to practice
for a few more years!

189
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,300
They didn't even listen to my song

190
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,460
for more than 20 seconds.

191
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,180
I don't know

192
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,820
who they are

193
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,300
to make that decision
in their catbird seats.

194
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,980
Even a newbie at the company

195
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,140
dared to criticize me.

196
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,420
I've been writing songs

197
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,740
way longer than any of them.

198
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,660
Hello.

199
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,660
I'm sorry.

200
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,020
I'll amend it again.

202
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,220
Youguang, I know.

203
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,660
Shall we go for a barbecue today?

204
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:28,980
Wait.

205
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,460
We can...

206
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,900
Be quiet.

207
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,660
Don't bother me.

208
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,980
I want to write something.

209
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,620
Just give me a moment.

210
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,020
Sir.

211
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,220
Hello.

212
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,460
Yes.

213
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,140
I've read the proposal
for the next book.

214
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,460
Can you give me

215
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,980
more time to work on it?

216
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,860
Wang Putao, what are you thinking?

217
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,820
Everyone is like this now.

218
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,940
The platform has high hopes
for your works.

219
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,820
Time is money.

220
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,860
I wanted to give you a chance

221
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,020
so we could talk about signing
a long-term contract with you.

222
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,180
You have to seize the chance.

223
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,740
Yes, sir.

224
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,660
I understand.

225
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,660
But...

226
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,340
I need to take care of my family.

227
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,460
How about this?

228
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,420
Sir,

229
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,700
can you give me

230
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,820
two more days?

231
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,100
Just two days.

232
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,980
That way, I can arrange my time better.

233
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,740
Can you be quiet?

234
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,660
Do you know

235
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,900
how important it is to me now?

236
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,660
Can you stop bothering me?

237
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,380
(Yes.)

238
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,660
(People always change.)

239
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,100
(The gentleness and love
that he once had)

240
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,500
(were worthless)

241
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
(compared to what he wanted.)

242
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,580
(He would lock himself)

243
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,180
(in his room for days and nights.)

244
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,020
(And he became
more and more short-tempered.)

245
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,620
We haven't had meals together
in a long time.

246
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,420
I've cooked all of your favorite dishes
for you today.

247
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,820
Thank you.

248
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,940
Why are you being so courteous?

249
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,780
I should be frank with you.

250
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,620
A label wants to sign me lately, Putao.

251
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,140
Isn't that great?

252
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,900
You know how important it is to me.

253
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,100
I can't miss this chance.

254
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,380
And I don't want to offend anyone.

255
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
According to their plan,

256
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,140
I have to interact more with my fans.

257
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,940
Now that they know I have a girlfriend
living together with me,

258
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,420
they think it's a hindrance.

259
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,140
I can't think of any other way.

260
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,540
The only way that I can think of

261
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,660
is to move out from here.

262
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,380
How much can a songwriter

263
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,020
earn by selling songs?

264
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,860
I don't want to live

265
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,220
in this run-down house forever.

266
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,980
The longer I drag this one,

267
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,100
the more you'll hate me.

268
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
I don't want you

269
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,500
to think

270
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,860
that I'm just playing with your heart.

271
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,420
Putao.

272
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,140
Do you understand how I feel?

273
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,500
The song "All About You"

274
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,420
is a hit right now.

275
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,940
I don't want anything to go wrong.

276
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,940
I want to become
the most popular artist.

277
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,620
The kind of artist
who stands on top of the world.

278
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,740
Back then, you told me

279
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,420

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,180
Lately, I've been thinking

339
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,700
about what else

340
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,660
is worth remembering in my life.

341
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,100
After thinking about it,

342
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,660
the one I'm most indebted to is you.

343
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,140
(I called you many times.)

344
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
(I wanted)

345
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
(to be shameless)

346
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,980
(and see you again for one last time.)

347
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,860
(But you are just
as I remembered, Putao.)

348
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,820
(You didn't pick up any of my calls.)

349
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,660
Actually, I regretted it at once
after I said those things

350
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,100
to you that day.

351
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,580
(I was too selfish.)

352
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
(Putao.)

353
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,060
(I'm sorry.)

354
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,860
(Please forgive me for one last time,)

355
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,260
(okay?)

356
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,940
(I'm sorry.)

357
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,940
(I was wrong.)

358
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,180
(Bye.)

359
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,740
(I always thought)

360
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,980
(that the Wang Putao I knew)

361
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,940
(was a heartless
and invulnerable person.)

362
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,380
(I never thought)

363
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,660
(that she would have a soft heart)

364
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,980
(under her hard armor.)

365
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:51,820
(Maybe)

366
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,700
(she stood under the rain)

367
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,340
(so I wouldn't see her tears.)
