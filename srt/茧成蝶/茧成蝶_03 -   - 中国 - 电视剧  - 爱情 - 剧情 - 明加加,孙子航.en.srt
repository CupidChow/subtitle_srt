17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,280
(Jian Family)
Why did Zhou Yufeng cancel

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,240
(is big.)
the engagement?

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,150
Sorry, really sorry.

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,800
(Told you.)
Everyone, my apologies.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,695
(There's more)
We'll cancel

22
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:01,110
the engagement with the Jian Family.

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,250
(to Jian Cheng's incident.)
The kids don't get along.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,710
You holding up okay?

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,040
This girl is driving me crazy.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,050
- Good.
- Such a good match.

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,760
I was ready for this a long time ago.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Really?

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Of course.

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,320
Those people.

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,640
Go ahead, laugh louder if they want.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,000
Once I marry you someday,

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll shove our marriage certificate

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,590
right in their faces.

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,040
Alright.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,640
Why hold a press conference?

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,950
For something like this,

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,400
your Uncle Zhou finally agreed.

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,620
We have to lock it in now.

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,040
Otherwise, if Jian Cheng changes her mind,

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,150
she'll be clinging to you.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
Will this ever end?

43
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,480
Everyone knows the engagement is off.

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,680
If you ask me,

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Jian Cheng won't have the nerve

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,040
to bother you again.

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Mom.

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,590
But how will we explain this to Uncle Zhou?

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,760
The press conference already happened.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,350
He wouldn't risk Zhou Family's dignity

51
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,310
for her.

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,070
Jian Cheng.

53
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,030
Come out here.

54
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,590
We need to talk this through.

55
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,470
It must've been that night,

56
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,590
you made a mistake

57
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,400
and ended up upsetting Yufeng.

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,310
You're already engaged.

59
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,680
Why bother with that woman outside?

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,120
Your sister already told you,

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,870
Jiang Yawei is just from a small county.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,960
She'll never enter the Zhou Family.

63
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,170
Can't you just

64
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,150
let it slide?

65
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,590
Let it slide?

66
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,280
Back then, Mr. Jian kept a college girl.

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,080
She was from a modest family.

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,150
Couldn't enter our family.

69
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,590
Yet you went to her campus
to humiliate her.

70
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,310
You even threw money in her face

71
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,660
and stirred up online harassment.

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,960
Compared to you,

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm practically an angel.

74
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,560
- You...
- Mom.

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
What now?

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,710
We both had been cheated.

77
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,810
You couldn't stand it.

78
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,150
So why should I play the saint?

79
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,800
- Mom.
- I…

80
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,630
Want to silence me?

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,030
Wenqian, help your mom back to her room.

82
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,680
- You...
- Let's go, Mom.

83
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Come with me to apologize
to the Zhou Family.

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Go.

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Apologize?

86
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,360
What, do I really have to marry Yufeng?

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
Yes.

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,870
Before, you could mess around
all you wanted.

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,030
But this time,

90
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,310
you must apologize to them

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,150
and marry into the Zhou Family.

92
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,280
Otherwise,

93
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll break your legs.

94
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,080
Fine.

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Give me ten million.

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,150
Ten million?

97
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,560
You need to buy a gift

98
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,120
to make amends.

99
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,400
The Zhou Family is a rich family.

100
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,810
Even ten million won't impress them.

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
I'd have to chip in from my pocket.

102
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,590
See how thoughtful I am.

103
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Alright.

104
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,840
Gifts for others are easy to handle.

105
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,120
But Grandpa Zhou's...

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,310
That's harder to find.

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,870
Jian Youhui has lots of antiques.

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,150
How about I pick one?

109
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,710
Alright.

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,710
Go ask your brother.

111
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,360
If he says no,

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
tell him to come to me.

113
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm truly sorry.

114
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,460
If I'd known Jiang Yawei
could drive you crazy,

115
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,220
I wouldn't have invited her
on my birthday.

116
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,360
She's not the only one who makes me mad.

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,400
You count too.

118
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,510
You're insane.

119
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,720
You pushed me over the edge.

120
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,510
Just like you wanted.

121
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,390
And you're not happy?

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
You're really hard to please.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
You...

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
My dear sister,

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,040
how did I never notice
you were this capable?

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Keeping Jian Youhui on the hook,

127
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,510
while also coveting Zhou Tingyan.

128
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,310
How did you...

129
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,950
Find out about your mess
with Jian Youhui?

130
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,870
Take a guess.

131
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,150
Wenqian.

132
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,040
We shouldn't keep making mistakes.

133
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,510
Youhui, don't leave me.

134
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,110
Jian Youhui.

135
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,750
Mr. Jian said I can pick anything
from your collections.

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,560
Jian Youhui.

137
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,070
About Jian Wenqian,

138
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,000
I'd advise you not to walk into trouble.

139
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,100
(Jian Youhui, Jian Cheng's brother)

140
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,830
Keeping Jian Youhui on the hook,

141
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,920
while also coveting Zhou Tingyan.

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,960
(Jian Cheng,)

143
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,000
(you pushed me into this.)

144
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,270
On Qin Zhuo's birthday banquet,

145
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,870
if you don't want your dignity
stepped on,

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
there's only one way.

147
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,730
You'll have to take some heat.

148
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,350
Alright.

149
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
Go on.

150
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,700
(Qin Zhuo's birthday banquet)

151
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,070
Jiang Yawei will apologize in public,

152
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,310
all media set up already?

153
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,390
Of course.

154
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,950
Just wait for tomorrow's trending.

155
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,100
- Uncle Zhou.
- Qin Zhuo.

156
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110
Jian Cheng,

157
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
you look amazing.

158
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,230
Thanks.

159
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,470
Zhou.

160
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
Zhou.

161
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,990
Zhou, we have a meeting to attend.

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,950
What meeting?

163
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,240
No time, Zhou.

164
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Let's go.

165
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,150
Tang.

166
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,270
You're Qin Zhuo's fiancee.

167
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,830
You should be by his side.

168
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,830
Forget it.

169
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,630
He doesn't like me following him.

170
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,950
How would you know if you don't try?

171
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,230
Tang.

172
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,070
I hope

173
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,950
you get what you wish for.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,720
At least between the two of us,

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,270
one of us should be happy.

176
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,520
Go on.

177
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,260
Miss Jian.

178
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,200
You have a visitor.

179
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,710
Me?

180
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Yes.

181
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
Jiang Yawei.

182
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,510
What do you want

183
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,750
from me?

184
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,510
Tonight's event

185
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,510
was set up for you by Zhou Tingyan.

186
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,870
What else could I do?

187
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,120
I just want to ask you,

188
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,870
can you please let me go?

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,510
Please, no public apology.

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,920
Let you go?

191
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,230
Is that my fault?

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Do you know

193
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,910
why I kept letting you off even if

194
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,440
you provoked me behind Yufeng's back?

195
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,990
Why?

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,270
Because

197
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,000
on this matter,

198
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
the one I resent most is Yufeng.

199
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,270
No matter how many side flings you are,

200
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,720
he's the one who changed.

201
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,870
I don't have the time to deal with you.

202
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,030
You earned your spot.

203
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,510
That's your skills.

204
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,350
Let's go.

205
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm waiting for your grand apology.

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
Jian Cheng.

207
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,120
You pushed me into this.

208
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,630
Don't put this on me.

209
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,430
Ah!

210
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,630
Faking an accident?

211
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,910
Who can't do that?

212
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,860
