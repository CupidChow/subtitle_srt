Jiang Yawei is just too much.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,950
She actually pushed Cheng off

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,590
from such a high place.

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,900
How is she doing now?

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,830
She hasn't woken up.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,470
When will you and Zhou Tingyan get here?

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,550
Almost there.

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,630
Meng Tang.

25
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,680
Is Jian Cheng doing okay?

26
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,150
You're not welcome.

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,430
Get out.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,190
Meng Tang.

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,560
I just came to check on her.

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,760
How is Jian Cheng?

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,350
After all,

32
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,400
I feel responsible.

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,040
It was you who pushed her down.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,590
Then you jumped down yourself.

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,040
That's not true.

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,970
It is...

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,230
I did have her called out to meet me.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,510
But once I saw her,

39
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
I only begged her.

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
I wanted her to show mercy
and let me go.

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,740
She refused.

42
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,150
She even grabbed my chin

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,480
and threatened me.

44
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,790
Told me to break up with Yufeng.

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,000
She got more and more worked up,

46
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,480
then accidentally pushed me.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Jiang Yawei.

48
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,430
I don't believe
every single word you say.

49
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,560
You better hope Cheng's fine.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Otherwise,

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,200
you'll face consequences.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm not lying.

53
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,070
Everything I said is true.

54
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,350
I wronged Jian Cheng.

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,190
She pushed me down the stairs,
but I don't blame her.

56
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,710
I just want to make sure she's okay.

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
Meng Tang.

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Yawei came here

59
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,080
because she's kind-hearted.

60
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,710
What Jian Cheng did to her
is against the law.

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,630
Are you serious?

62
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,470
Yufeng, has your brain stopped working?

63
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,700
There is no CCTV.

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,510
Whatever Yawei says,
you just believe it?

65
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,710
You and Cheng grew up together.

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,460
Don't you know
what kind of person she is?

67
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,150
You rather trust a homewrecker?

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
What are you doing?

69
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,750
Yufeng, touch her again
and see what happens.

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,910
I'm okay.

71
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,030
Uncle Zhou.

72
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,190
The doctor said Jian Cheng needs rest.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,750
Take your girl and get out.

74
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,870
Let's go.

75
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,270
Cheng, you're awake.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
Zhou.

77
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,990
Zhou.

78
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Zhou Tingyan.

79
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,990
Uncle Zhou.

80
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,280
Zhou Tingyan.

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Give me a hug.

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,240
(She's using Uncle Zhou like a helper.)

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
(Got some nerve.)

84
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,720
(This is bad.)

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,750
(Cheng must have)

86
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
(messed up her head.)

87
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,400
Is your head hurting?

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,870
I'll go get the doctor.

89
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,270
Don't go.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My head's fine.

91
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,430
Honey.

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
This…

93
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,240
Yesterday,

94
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,310
when I fell down,

95
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
I was scared to death.

96
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,040
I thought I'd never see you again.

97
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,310
Cheng.

98
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,270
Maybe sleep a bit more?

99
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,350
Jian Cheng.

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,430
You're playing dumb.

101
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,560
What trick is it this time?

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
You really think

103
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,600
this is getting under my skin?

104
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,240
You called me honey.

105
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,600
Does that mean we're married?

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,720
No, we're not.

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
But we are engaged.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,290
After New Year,

109
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,950
we'll be getting married.

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
Why are you asking me
such weird questions?

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,510
Is this... memory loss?

112
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,510
Looks like a blessing in disguise.

113
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,270
Jian Cheng.

114
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,230
Stop pretending.

115
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,870
You asked me to call off the engagement.

116
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,830
So what is this act now?

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Uncle Zhou.

118
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,750
She's using you just to get at me.

119
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,590
Enough.

120
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,510
You hit your head on the fall.

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Get the doctor to check.

122
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,270
All tests came back normal.

123
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,270
She just needs rest.

124
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,750
As for the memory confusion,

125
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,900
it might just be temporary.

126
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,870
Don't worry, it won't affect daily life.

127
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,110
Doctor.

128
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,470
She's pretending, right?

129
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,070
How could such a thing even happen?

130
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,430
Beyond ridiculous.

131
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,390
Jian Cheng, get up.

132
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,250
Drop the act.

133
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,150
Leave.

134
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,630
She just woke up and needs peace.

135
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,150
(Jian Cheng,)

136
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,870
(let's see how long you can keep this up.)

137
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,750
Let's head back.

138
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,590
Come on.

139
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Cheng.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,190
Get some proper rest first.

141
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,230
Mm.

142
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,830
I'll check with the doctor.

143
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,790
Be back in a bit.

144
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,390
I hit my head pretty hard.

145
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,750
You look pretty happy.

146
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,870
Of course, I'm happy.

147
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,390
You forgot about that jerk Zhou Yufeng.

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,630
That's worth a bottle of wine
to celebrate.

149
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,910
I didn't forget.

150
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,950
You didn't?

151
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,070
Then what was that just now?

152
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,190
I was acting.

153
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,350
Come on.

154
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,270
What's going on
between you and Jiang Yawei?

155
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,750
She jumped on her own.

156
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,510
Knew it.

157
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,870
Definitely one of her dirty tricks.

158
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,070
That way she doesn't have to apologize

159
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,610
and can throw the blame on you.

160
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,750
That's just too much.

161
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,600
I'll go find her.

162
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,360
Don't go.

163
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,040
- Let her be.
- Seriously?

164
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,070
She's trying to ruin your reputation.

165
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,950
You owe this one to Qin Zhuo
and Zhou Tingyan.

166
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,000
Tingyan saw Jiang Yawei
lying next to you.

167
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,630
He instantly told Qin Zhuo

168
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,070
to keep it under wraps.

169
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,750
Otherwise, who knows
what rumors would spread.

170
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,590
Anyway,

171
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,630
you just focus on resting now.

172
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,830
Don't worry about a thing.

173
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,270
(Jian Wenqian)
(Jian Cheng)

174
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,510
(is playing dumb.)

175
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,950
(And Zhou Tingyan sealed off the news.)

176
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,830
(Last night's act was all for nothing.)

177
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,020
(Jian Wenqian)

178
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,230
How did it go?

179
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
Cheng said

180
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,270
she missed a step and fell on her own.

181
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,870
But I don't buy it.

182
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,790
Jiang Yawei.

183
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,950
You should be grateful.

184
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,390
Cheng doesn't remember all of you.

185
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,920
From now on,

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,720
if you try any more dirty tricks,

187
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,950
I'll crush your dream
of joining the wealthy elite.

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,880
- I...
- I heard everything.

189
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,140
I'll take care of the rest.

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Hey, Qin Zhuo.

191
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,950
Cheng wants to keep the peace.

192
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,800
She said she fell down on her own.

193
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,630
Maybe we should just let it go.

194
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,270
So she won't get upset later

195
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,920
and start an argument with them.

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Alright.

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Looks like

198
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
Jian Cheng is determined

199
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
to cut all ties with Zhou Yufeng.

200
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,910
Meng Tang is passing on Cheng's message.

201
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,550
Cheng can do

202
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,990
whatever she wants.

203
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,510
But Little Princess seems stuck on you.

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
What do you plan to do?

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,270
I gave her the chance

206
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,320
and made her cling to me.

207
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,030
What?

208
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm going to marry her.

209
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,350
What are you doing?

210
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,380
(Today's Trending)

211
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,280
(It really didn't make the trending.)

212
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,150
(Zhou Tingyan's crisis control
is impressive.)

213
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,510
Honey.

214
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,030
The doctor already told me.

215
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
(No way.)

216
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,870
(How could I be exposed this fast?)

217
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,870
(Oh my gosh.)

218
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,240
