=Episode 6=

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,880
I heard that the mischievous daughter
of the Jian Family

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,790
has hurt her head.

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,790
Now she lost her memory.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,070
No,

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,960
she didn't.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
That's memory confusion.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,960
She mistook Zhou Tingyan
for Zhou Yufeng.

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,730
She thinks the one she loves
is Zhou Tingyan.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,070
Didn't the Zhou Family
to call off the engagement?

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,310
Maybe she had a shock before.

27
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,480
Then she fell again.

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,790
But why did she only
forget Mr. Zhou Yufeng?

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,690
Could she be pretending on purpose?

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,960
Zhou Lu.

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,980
(Zhou Lu, Jian Cheng's buddy)
About today's gathering,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,980
you didn't need to come.

33
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,350
Going there will only make you a joke.

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,840
Since they want to see the fun,

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,790
let's give them one worth watching.

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,790
Jian Cheng,

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,440
how much longer are you going
to pretend?

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,270
Yufeng,

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,690
don't you hate it the most
when Cheng keeps pestering you?

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,350
Now she's forgotten you.

41
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,000
Isn't this exactly what you want?

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,910
This is between me and Jian Cheng.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,470
Step aside.

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,310
Step aside.

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,800
Don't get yourself involved.

46
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,080
Looks like there's drama coming.

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,920
Keep your voice down.

48
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,270
Zhou Yufeng,

49
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,840
about what happened between us,

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,710
I've been hearing a lot lately.

51
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,510
To sum it up,

52
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,800
the two of us

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
grew up together.

54
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,710
After we got engaged,

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,920
you had an affair

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,460
with your secretary behind my back.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,150
Even knowing you'd changed
for the worse,

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
I still clung to you desperately.

59
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,150
In the end, I fell from a building,

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,630
hit my head hard,

61
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,480
and forget you.

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,400
Right?

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Jian Cheng,

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
stop pretending.

65
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,590
I know you're not confused or lost.

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,000
You're just trying to make me miserable.

67
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,280
You haven't forgotten anyone,

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,150
except for me.

69
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,520
How is that even possible?

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,000
Why not?

71
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,990
Why don't you try it too?

72
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,710
Jump off a building.

73
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,040
Make sure you get the pose right.

74
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,430
Headfirst, of course.

75
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,720
Judging by Jian Cheng's attitude,

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,840
she doesn't love him at all.

77
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,000
But Mr. Zhou seems

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,100
to still want to cling on.

79
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,590
Come outside with me.

80
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,310
I've been hearing way too much

81
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,240
about things between us lately.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
I know

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
I used to always cling to you.

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,520
But now,

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
justice is on my side.

86
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,430
I hit my head and forgot all about it.

87
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,030
Now I don't pester you anymore.

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,680
You can go marry your sweetheart.

89
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,150
Didn't you already set a wedding date

90
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,810
with Jiang Yawei?

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Weren't you planning to marry her?

92
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,150
Then why are you still bothering me?

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,820
Jian Cheng, have you lost it?
Jian Cheng.

94
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,850
There are people watching.

95
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,560
I thought it was Miss Jian
causing trouble.

96
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,400
Turns out it's Mr. Zhou playing games.

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
What a buzzkill.

98
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Let's go.

99
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,430
Well said, Jian Cheng.

100
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,160
- We work for the rich by day,
- Playboys should be punished.

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,430
and enjoy the show they give us
at night.

102
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,270
I heard Jiang Yawei

103
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,600
took advantage
when Jian Cheng was abroad.

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Trouble doesn't come without a reason.

105
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,630
The guy's no saint either.

106
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,480
Jian Cheng even supported Jiang Yawei.

107
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,440
She's truly heartless,

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,680
repaying kindness with betrayal.

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,390
Zhou Lu's filming skills

110
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,740
are really impressive.

111
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,530
Jian Cheng must've hit her head hard.

112
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,830
(Could this whole thing)

113
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,040
(make Zhou Tingyan lose face?)

114
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,590
Hello?

115
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,870
Did you see the trending topic?

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,670
Yeah, I saw it.

117
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,860
Did I cause any trouble for you?

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,450
No,

119
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,840
you did great.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,840
As for what's next,

121
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,710
I'll handle this.

122
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah.

123
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,190
I'll take care of the Jian Family
myself.

124
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,150
Let's act separately.

125
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,950
(Zhou Tingyan is really kind to me.)

126
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,070
Then till when,

127
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,390
exactly?

128
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
Isn't Zhou Yufeng planning
to marry Jiang Yawei?

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's wait until they get married.

130
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,940
(Zhou Yufeng)
At 1:00 PM this afternoon,

131
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,470
bring Jiang Yawei to the old residence.

132
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,050
(1:00 PM)
It has already caused quite a stir.

133
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,200
You're still pretending here.

134
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,210
- You shameless woman!
- Mom!

135
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,400
- I didn't go to find you.
- Yawei.

136
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,060
You actually showed up here yourself!

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,310
Mrs. Zhou,

138
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,430
please let me explain.

139
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Explain what?!

140
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,780
What about the promise you made to me?

141
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,630
You told me you were leaving Yufeng.

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,160
You made me believe you.

143
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,230
From start to finish,

144
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,310
it was all a lie.

145
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,390
Mom!

146
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,630
You're still defending her?!

147
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,710
Mom...

148
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,190
- Step aside!
- Mom.

149
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,190
I said move.

150
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,030
Everyone's here.

151
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,470
Yufeng,

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
what's going on?

153
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,310
(Zhou Baichuan, Zhou Yufeng's father)

154
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,150
Dad.

155
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
What happened here?

156
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,310
My cousin brought his mistress

157
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,150
home.

158
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,510
But it seems Auntie

159
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,510
doesn't like the daughter-in-law.

160
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,950
And they ended up fighting.

161
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Zhou Lu,

162
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,400
watch your words.

163
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,970
I didn't say anything wrong.

164
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,150
What?

165
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,750
Dare to act but not admit?

166
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,830
Since the wedding date is set...

167
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,160
What wedding date?

168
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,390
There's no such thing.

169
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,720
Jian Cheng made stuff up.

170
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,560
Am I done talking yet?

171
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,510
I knew about this from the start.

172
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,510
Yufeng told me.

173
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,230
Well,

174
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,830
it's still Jian Cheng's fault.

175
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,190
She's the one who spread it.

176
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,600
She's nothing but trouble.

177
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,870
You were there that day.

178
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,150
Tell me, was Jian Cheng wrong?

179
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,470
No, she wasn't.

180
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,050
My cousin arranged the gathering.

181
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,170
There are security cameras in my club.

182
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,030
Auntie,

183
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,470
want me to pull the footage for you?

184
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,390
Either way,

185
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,510
Jian Cheng

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,170
humiliated Yufeng in front of everyone.

187
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,270
She was in the wrong.

188
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,470
If it wasn't for her,

189
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,190
this mess wouldn't have happened.

190
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,710
She's just relentless.

191
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,234
Well,

192
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,630
don't be so fake.

193
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,750
You all dislike Jian Cheng so much,

194
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,190
always picking on her,

195
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,130
and trying to shame her,

196
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,070
just because she once saved me.

197
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,870
My father liked Baichuan the most.

198
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,720
If I had died,

199
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,270
Qianyi would have gone to Baichuan.

200
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,630
You blame Jian Cheng

201
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,200
for accidentally messing up your plans.

202
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
But don't forget.

203
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,890
As long as the eldest brother is here,

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,750
you're not getting anything.

205
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,390
Tingyan,

206
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,960
no matter what, we're...

207
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:50,716
Well,

208
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,300
about how the eldest brother left,

209
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,300
you need me to remind you?

210
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,720
Now everyone knows
they're getting married.

211
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:03,044
Well,

212
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,870
if you don't agree,

213
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,870
why don't you teach me

214
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,260
how I should handle this?

215
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,350
Baichuan,

216
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,500
what's your take on this?

217
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,400
I've always advocated
for freedom in marriage.

218
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,670
Since it's Yufeng's choice,

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,150
I'll respect him.

220
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,750
Zhou Baichuan!

221
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,000
Yufeng and Jiang Yawei

222
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,270
aren't a good match.

223
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:49,426
Well,

224
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
I hope you think this through.

225
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,390
If you want me to send Yufeng abroad,

226
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,630
we can do that.

227
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Once he's gone,

228
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,790
the family won't have so much trouble.

229
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,570
Everything will be calmer.

230
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,870
Mom.

231
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,990
Mom.

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Mom, I...

233
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,870
I agree.

234
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,870
I agree they should get married.

235
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,200
The trending topic blew up so much.

236
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,700
It's normal for Dad and Mom to be mad.

237
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,240
Cheng, you should come back and explain

238
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,510
and then apologize to them.

239
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,630
The reason why I don't come back,

240
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,030
don't tell me you don't know.

241
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,870
It's all because of you.

242
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,120
What's that got to do with me?

243
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,000
Because

244
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,630
I like Zhou Tingyan.

245
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,750
That must make you feel uneasy.

246
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,660
Because you like Zhou Tingyan too.

247
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,070
And you want to marry him.

248
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,410
You and I

249
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,910
are rivals in love.

250
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,600
Jian Cheng, what nonsense
are you talking?

251
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,150
I am not talking nonsense.

252
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,630
Pan Yu told me.

253
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,470
He said

254
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,270
you used work as an excuse

255
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,910
to secretly flirt with his boss.

256
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,390
His boss

257
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,110
is already

258
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,470
tired of you.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
Wenqian,

260
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,150
you really like Zhou Tingyan, huh?

261
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,910
I've never heard you say that.

262
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,790
No, mom.

263
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,910
She dare not say it.

264
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,390
Because Zhou Tingyan warned her

265
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,510
that if

266
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,580
she kept pestering him,

267
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,870
he'd take over Jian's Changsheng.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,670
What?! Wenqian,

269
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,030
don't be reckless.

270
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,180
This is serious business.

271
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,670
Don't go provoke Zhou Tingyan.

272
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,870
Jian Cheng,

273
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,790
you

274
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,750
come with me.

275
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,250
Stop making trouble, will you?

276
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,600
Marrying Zhou Yufeng would
already be great for you.

277
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,320
Zhou Tingyan is out of your league.

278
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,390
Besides,

279
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,360
Zhou Yufeng

280
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,630
and that Jiang girl

281
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,120
are not married yet.

282
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,150
Zhou Tingyan owes you
a life-saving favor.

283
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,200
No matter if

284
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,390
you've totally lost your mind,

285
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,480
listen to me and go ask Zhou Tingyan
for help.

286
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
Jian,

287
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,480
let's make a bet.

288
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,320
A bet?

289
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,390
What kind of bet?

290
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,510
If I can marry Zhou Tingyan,

291
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,870
you'll give me 9% of the company shares
as a dowry.

292
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,750
9%?

293
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,600
If I give you 9% more,

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,390
you'll hold 11% in total.

295
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,390
Yeah.

296
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,390
Your sister

297
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,390
puts in a lot of effort for the company.

298
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,560
Yet she only has 10%.

299
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,870
And you haven't contributed anything.

300
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,910
You sure have a big appetite.

301
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,600
Jian, if I marry Zhou Tingyan,

302
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,630
that's worth more
than 9% of the company.

303
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,590
Think about it.

304
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,630
If you became Zhou Tingyan's
father-in-law,

305
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,390
you'd have every project
coming your way.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It sounds

307
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,630
you could actually marry Zhou Tingyan.

308
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,270
Quit while you're ahead.

309
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,510
I'm sparing your pride here.

310
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,750
My wager

311
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,630
is Changhuai Road that Grandma left me.

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Chang… Changhuai Road?!

313
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,750
Let's have a chat.

314
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,590
Mom,

315
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,280
what did Cheng

316
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,870
whisper to you just now?

317
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,630
You don't look too well.

318
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
You always say

319
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm stirring up trouble.

320
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,240
At least I'm openly going
after one person.

321
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,390
But your adopted daughter

322
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,600
has her eyes set on someone outside,

323
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
while stirring up trouble at home.

324
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,030
I really have to hand it to her.

325
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Nothing.

326
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,890
She said she wants
to marry Zhou Tingyan.

327
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,630
That little girl

328
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,000
is always daydreaming.

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
Just ignore her.

330
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,510
(Wenqian and Youhui?)

331
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,630
