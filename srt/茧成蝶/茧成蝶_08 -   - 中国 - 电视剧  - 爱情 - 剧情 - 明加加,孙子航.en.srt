Zhou Tingyan said

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,160
he wants me to move
into the wedding apartment.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,260
Do you want to move in?

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,700
Of course.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,620
You two are alone together in one room.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,420
If he wants to do something,

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,780
will you agree or not?

24
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,460
Of course I will agree.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,890
We've already got the certificates.

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,360
It's bound to happen sooner or later.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,420
No need to be overly resistant.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,590
♪Return to silence♪

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,140
But still,

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,340
in just three months,

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,980
you've changed partners,

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,380
got married,

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,580
moved in together,

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,020
and it won't be long

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,220
before you have a baby.

36
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,660
Honestly, comparisons are
truly infuriating.

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,380
I

38
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,500
am still only engaged.

39
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,020
So how are you and Qin Zhuo lately?

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,500
No real progress.

41
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,260
Lately,

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,300
he heard I've been getting closer
to his mom.

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,460
Now he doesn't even dare
to return to the Qin Family.

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,500
I honestly don't know what to do.

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,980
Tang,

46
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,390
Zhou Tingyan said he's arranged
a gathering this afternoon.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,220
He wants me to meet some of his friends.

48
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,220
Qin Zhuo will definitely be there too.

49
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,220
Do you want to go?

50
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,740
I'd like to.

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,700
But,

52
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,300
I...

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,660
Not sure if it's the right place for me.

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,940
Don't overthink it.

55
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,100
Just make sure you dress up nicely.

56
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,660
Forget about everything else.

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,980
OK?

58
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,410
OK.

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,730
(Zhou Tingyan)
Zhou Tingyan,

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,660
are you busy?

61
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,820
Sorry.

62
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,060
The person you're calling
is busy making money.

63
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,900
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

64
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,860
Send one even if it's...

65
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,220
I'm not busy.

66
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,300
Well…

67
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,820
it's just…

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,620
I am shy.

69
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,820
If I meet your friends alone,

70
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
I'll get really nervous.

71
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,020
Can I

72
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,720
bring Tang along?

73
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,320
Is this because of Qin Zhuo?

74
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,060
Yeah.

75
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,460
Tang wants to see Qin Zhuo.

76
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,900
But Qin Zhuo keeps avoiding her.

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,530
If Meng Tang comes,

78
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,130
Qin Zhuo might not show up.

79
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,380
Zhou Tingyan,

80
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,860
can you help me?

81
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Can you arrange for them
to meet outside?

82
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,660
Just once.

83
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,340
Alright.

84
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,900
I'll arrange

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,980
for them to meet.

86
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,420
Zhou Tingyan, you're really amazing.

87
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,460
I'll go shopping with Tang
and buy some gifts.

88
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,620
After that, I'll head straight over.

89
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,740
I won't pack my luggage for now.

90
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,870
Let's move tomorrow.

91
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,020
Wait a sec.

92
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,690
How about we go to the wedding apartment
after dinner tonight?

93
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,820
I can help you pack tomorrow.

94
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,060
Does it have to be tonight?

95
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,620
Can't we delay it for one day?

96
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,340
Let's go tonight, OK?

97
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,700
Jian Cheng.

98
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,220
(Could it be)

99
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,060
(he actually wants to...)

100
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,740
How about this?

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,590
After dinner, come back with me first.

102
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll drop you back later.

103
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,880
That might not work.

104
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,220
Tang will probably cry tonight.

105
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,130
I need to be with her.

106
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,180
Just half an hour.

107
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,460
I'll bring you back after that.

108
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,320
(Oh no.)

109
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,090
(Zhou Tingyan definitely
has plans tonight).

110
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,790
How about ten minutes?

111
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,740
Five minutes, deal?

112
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,780
Not a second less.

113
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,980
I'll finish quickly.

114
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
Then I'll take you back.

115
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,020
(Five minutes?)

116
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,860
(That fast?)

117
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,650
He agreed. He'll let you meet him.

118
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,620
Here you are.

119
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,860
Yeah.

120
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,020
(He should be healthy.)

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,860
(Why only five minutes?)

122
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,260
Cheng,

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,750
what are you looking at?

124
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,520
I'm just going to the restroom.

125
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,980
Take Tang to meet Qin Zhuo first.

126
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,060
Alright.

127
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,500
Let's go.

128
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,500
Yeah.

129
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,260
Meng Tang.

130
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,140
Meng Tang,

131
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,530
can you stop making a scene?

132
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,500
Let go of me.

133
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,500
Release me.

134
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,940
Cheng.

135
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,580
What happened?

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
I didn't do anything wrong.

137
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,460
I don't apologize.

138
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,260
It's fine.

139
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,140
You didn't do wrong. You don't need to.

140
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,100
Yeah.

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,290
Zhou Tingyan told me to wait
for Qin Zhuo in the private room.

142
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,700
But unexpectedly,

143
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,660
it was Mi Shan who showed up.

144
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,900
(Mi Shan?)

145
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,260
What did she say?

146
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,380
This restaurant

147
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,180
was acquired for her by Qin Zhuo
with his money.

148
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,100
She said she was afraid
I'd be upset and confront him.

149
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,740
Then,

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,890
she insisted on giving the money
back to me.

151
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,660
How ridiculous!

152
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,660
I didn't even know anything about it.

153
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,500
And then she added,

154
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,420
Qin Zhuo

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,980
has always only given to her

156
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,300
without asking for anything in return.

157
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,860
She even showed me a photo
of them kissing on a trip.

158
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,890
Cheng,

159
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,740
my engagement with him
hasn't even ended.

160
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,660
So why did he kiss another woman?

161
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,900
He must really hate me.

162
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
What's going on with Qin Zhuo?

163
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,180
When Qin Zhuo showed up...

164
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,860
Meng Tang, Meng Tang.

165
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,900
I was too abrupt just now.

166
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,290
Please don't be mad at me, OK?

167
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,770
Let me go.

168
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,060
Meng Tang, Meng Tang.

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,020
Meng Tang, I'm sorry.

170
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Meng Tang.

171
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,900
What are you doing?

172
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,100
What do you mean?

173
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,540
I didn't do anything.

174
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,140
I saw it. Why did you push her?

175
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
Apologize to her.

176
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,100
Why should I apologize?

177
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,330
I'm asking you to apologize.

178
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Why should I apologize?

179
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,040
It's not even my fault.

180
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,460
Don't be scared.

181
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,290
Mi Shan really loves to act.

182
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,650
Lately, you know,

183
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,030
I've been pretty into acting too.

184
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,370
I'm gonna go match her skills for a bit.

185
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,620
What's up?

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,180
Looking at you like this,

187
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,520
I feel bad hitting you.

188
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,610
But I still give you a couple punches.

189
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,330
Otherwise, I can't explain
to Jian Cheng.

190
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,990
Putting romance over friendship.

191
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,970
Who are you talking about?

192
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,940
If I'd known this was your ex's
restaurant,

193
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,940
I wouldn't have come.

194
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,300
I only knew it was run by Mi Shan,

195
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
but I came here to eat

196
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,940
just because the food's great.

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,600
Are there no good restaurants
in the whole Jiangyu?

198
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,990
Mi Shan said she wouldn't be in Jiangyu
these days.

199
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,440
I didn't expect to run into her.

200
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,260
Don't tell me

201
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,490
you haven't completely cut ties
with Mi Shan.

202
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,970
No way.

203
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,320
Before Meng Tang,
couldn't I date anyone?

204
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm not like you,

205
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,500
32 already,

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,100
still saving the first kiss.

207
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
Who says that?

208
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,640
Jian Cheng kissed me yesterday.

209
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,600
You got your first kiss at 32.

210
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,860
That's something to brag about?

211
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,220
Anyway, after Mi Shan and I broke up,

212
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,820
we made a clean cut.

213
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
We still kept in touch,

214
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,420
but only as friends.

215
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,180
After I got engaged to Meng Tang,

216
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,990
I stayed completely clean outside,

217
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,650
and never touched another woman.

218
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,580
As for Mi Shan,

219
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,540
I owe her.

220
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
So I have to take care of her.

221
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,860
What about Meng Tang?

222
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,420
What are you going to do?

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Meng Tang's really good.

224
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,640
Honestly, I don't dislike her that much.

225
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,900
I don't want to hurt her.

226
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,380
You asked me to explain it
to her clearly,

227
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,540
so I came.

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,580
I didn't expect Mi Shan to show up.

229
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,990
I don't know how important
Mi Shan is to Qin Zhuo.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,590
(Honey)
But I can't allow her to bully Tang.

231
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
Let me give you a quick update.

232
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,540
I'm heading over to confront Mi Shan.

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
You won't be able to stop me.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,640
Unless you knock me out
and drag me away.

235
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,500
Zhou Tingyan,

236
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,170
this gathering was arranged
by you today.

237
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,400
If you don't know

238
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,860
that Mi Shan is the restaurant owner,

239
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,600
I won't blame you.

240
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,060
But if you knew ahead of time,

241
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,540
I would ignore you for a month.

242
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,940
Because I'm really upset.

243
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
I don't want to talk to you.

244
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,540
If you're on my side,

245
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,060
come over in 30 minutes.

246
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,020
If you're siding with Qin Zhuo,

247
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,860
then I start to ignore you tonight.

248
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,180
Sorry, buddy.

249
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,020
What are you doing?

250
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,780
You forget me due to a woman.

251
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,620
So despicable!

252
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,020
Long time no see.

253
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,900
Do you remember me, Mi Shan?

254
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,500
Miss Jian, it's been a while.

255
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,700
Right now,

256
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,870
I'm married to Zhou Tingyan.

257
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,420
You should call me Mrs. Zhou.

258
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,380
Mrs. Zhou.

259
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,140
Yeah.

260
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,020
You bullied Tang

261
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,060
in this place?

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
What are you talking about?

263
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,300
The security cameras here

264
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,820
don't work today, do they?

265
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,880
What are you trying to do?

266
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,580
I've seen these little tricks

267
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,660
back in high school.

268
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,300
If you dare to bully Tang again,

269
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,740
I'll make you regret it.

270
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,890
Handle your own affairs

271
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,020
yourselves.

272
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,780
Jian Cheng.

273
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,660
Honey.

274
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,620
Qin Zhuo.

275
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
Cheng.

276
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,060
Be careful.

277
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,620
How is it?

278
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,380
Here.

279
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,140
Here. Here.

280
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,260
My head hurts.

281
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,140
My shoulder hurts.

282
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,180
My stomach hurts too.

283
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,420
And my legs.

284
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,190
- My whole body hurts.
- What happened?

285
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,610
She was the one who pushed me first.

286
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,280
The moment you showed up, she collapsed.

287
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,020
I…

288
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,140
Still covering for her, huh?

289
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,460
It really hurts.

290
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,630
Let's hear their side first.

291
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,220
- Let me talk.
- Stop that.

292
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,790
Treat the wound first.

293
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,780
Wait a sec.

294
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,060
Just a few words.

295
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,180
Only a few words.

296
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,700
Be good. Listen to me.

297
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,970
Zhou Tingyan, if you promise me now,

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,140
you can do whatever you want

299
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,390
at home tonight.

300
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,020
Qin Zhuo,

301
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,700
did you go on a trip with Mi Shan

302
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,320
during the New Year holiday?

303
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,290
She showed me the photo of your trip,

304
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,990
in which you were hugging and kissing.

305
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,020
What photo?

306
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,380
I have no idea.

307
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,940
I didn't show her any photo.

308
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,780
You must have it in your phone.

309
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,320
If not, then you deleted it.

310
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,660
Deleting it won't change a thing.

311
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,640
It's already in my head.

312
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,740
In the photo,

313
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
you were wearing

314
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,060
a gray hiking jacket,

315
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,660
black pants and black shoes.

316
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,660
Mi Shan was in a blue tracksuit.

317
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,420
Mi Shan?

318
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,260
I heard

319
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,940
this restaurant's theme

320
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
is love.

321
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,500
So it turns out

322
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,380
Miss Mi's so‑called love

323
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,300
is gained by destroying others'
relationship.

324
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,900
Jian Chen,

325
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,060
I didn't handle this matter well.

326
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,440
I apologize to you for her.

327
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,420
Honey,

328
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,300
this restaurant's values are skewed.

329
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Ours are solid.

330
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,220
Let's go.

331
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,030
Tang, come on.

332
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,060
It's not like that, Qin Zhuo.

333
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,060
