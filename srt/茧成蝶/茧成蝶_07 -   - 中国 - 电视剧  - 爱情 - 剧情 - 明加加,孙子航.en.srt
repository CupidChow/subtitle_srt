17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,020
(Half a month later, meeting between the parents
of Zhou Yufeng and Jiang Yawei)

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,790
Let me say something you don't like.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,640
Even if you called off
the engagement with Jian Cheng,

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,260
you still shouldn't be with Jiang Yawei.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,560
If you really like her,

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,430
just keep her as a mistress.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,120
Mom,

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
Yawei is actually great.

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,870
She's been putting up with a lot.

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,590
Putting up with it?

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,070
She and us

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
are from completely different worlds.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,150
Some circles

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,480
won't accept her
just because she endures.

31
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,400
Just now,

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,510
look at her humble attitude.

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,350
I felt embarrassed for you.

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,150
I wasn't embarrassed.

35
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,920
You weren't?

36
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,840
Then why are you sitting here alone?

37
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,760
If you ask me,

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,070
this Jiang Yawei

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,710
isn't even as good as Jian Cheng.

40
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,310
Best not bring her out so often.

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,430
She makes you look bad.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
I feel embarrassed for Jiang Yawei.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,280
Look at her mother-in-law's attitude.

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,980
Her life won't be easy
in the Zhou Family.

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
There's really boring.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,760
Right now,

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,590
I'm eager to see Jian Cheng
regain her memory.

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,590
Me too.

49
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,950
Days with Jian Cheng around
are way more interesting.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Congrats,

51
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,030
Jiang Yawei.

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
You're lucky.

53
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,360
You met the unyielding Cheng.

54
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,310
That's true.

55
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,120
Every time she stands her ground,

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
Zhou Yufeng

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,120
takes another step away from her.

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,630
Now you've got what you wanted.

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Welcome

60
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,080
to your own personal hell.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,630
(Ye Qi, third sister-in-law of the Zhou Family)
(What a petty way to act!)

62
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,140
(Guan Qingrou, Zhou Lu's mother)

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
(Why isn't my uncle here yet?)

64
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,480
(Could he be deliberately
keeping us waiting?)

65
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Everyone's here.

66
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,360
Long time no see, everyone.

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,190
Do you miss me?

68
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,560
Congrats, nephew.

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,740
What did you just call me?

70
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,030
Nephew?

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Yeah.

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm married now.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,960
No need to keep pretending.

74
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,800
Keep some dignity for yourself.

75
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,710
Just go.

76
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,960
Nephew, how many times have I told you?

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,150
In my heart,

78
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,360
there's only your uncle.

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
As for the past,

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,800
no matter how you talk it up,
I won't believe a word.

81
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,470
And now,

82
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm your aunt.

83
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,430
I've got a marriage certificate
with your uncle.

84
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,250
What marriage certificate?

85
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,910
What marriage certificate?

86
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,360
Why could he get married
with you?

87
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,870
(Jian Cheng is having another episode.)

88
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,750
See?

89
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,440
(Jian Cheng)
Isn't this me and your uncle?

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,760
(Marriage Certificate)
Aren't those our names?

91
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,980
Got a good look, nephew?

92
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,800
Got a clear look,

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,280
you guys?

94
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,590
Give me it.

95
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
Let me see.

96
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,590
It's gotta be fake.

97
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,160
What if you tear it up?

98
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,360
I won't tear it.

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,460
Let me check if it's a fake.

100
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,230
Ignorant of the law?

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,360
Making a fake one is illegal.

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,200
Don't you know?

103
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,280
Give it to me.

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
Give it to me.

105
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,000
Just try touching her again.

106
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,790
Are you OK?

107
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Honey, what took you so long?

108
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
Zhou Lu is waiting for you downstairs.

109
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,910
You go down first.

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,640
Yeah.

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Uncle,

112
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,780
her marriage certificate is fake,
isn't it?

113
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,550
How could you possibly marry her?

114
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,050
We've already registered the marriage.

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
So,

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,510
in exchange for your life-saving favor,

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,430
you demand my uncle to marry you.

118
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
Yeah.

119
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
You're perfectly sane.

120
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,680
Just to avoid embarrassment today?

121
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,030
Yeah.

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,400
Well,

123
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,510
given our relationship,

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,750
why didn't you tell me this earlier?

125
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400
You don't trust me?

126
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,030
That's not it.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Not at all.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm afraid you might get too excited
and spill it.

129
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,400
Alright then.

130
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,150
Uncle,

131
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,240
when she snaps out of it,

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
and finds out I'm already married

133
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
and she's married to you,

134
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,870
what if she loses it even more?

135
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,240
I'll make her fall for me before that.

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
So even if she wakes up,

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,160
she won't pester you anymore.

138
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,630
Everyone's happy.

139
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,150
What do you think?

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
In my opinion,

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
actually,

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,630
Tingyan marrying Jian Cheng
is the best choice.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,680
Jian Cheng is honestly a wonderful girl.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
Qingrou,

145
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,120
I've never heard you speak
so sweetly before.

146
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,630
But right now,

147
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,870
you're pretty good at it.

148
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,120
Guess we're just not high enough.

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,750
I'm marrying Jian Cheng.

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,800
Anyone still confused?

151
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
- But...
- I'm marrying Jian Cheng.

152
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,310
Who dares to object?

153
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,590
Tingyan,

154
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,200
(Zhou Guoqing, Mr. Zhou)
come with me.

155
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Tingyan,

156
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
this isn't like you.

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,070
If you really don't want to marry her,

158
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,240
whether it's problems from Jian Cheng

159
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,310
or Qianyi,

160
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,800
you've got other ways to handle it.

161
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,800
You don't have to drag yourself
into this.

162
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm not getting any younger.

163
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,310
It's time to get married.

164
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,400
But didn't you say

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,780
you'd never marry in this lifetime?

166
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,150
Tingyan,

167
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,000
while no one outside knows,

168
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,160
you quietly

169
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,340
get the divorce certificates.

170
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
Let's pretend nothing happened today.

171
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,640
As for Jian Cheng,

172
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,190
I'll inform her parents

173
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,270
to take her home

174
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,680
and send her abroad.

175
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,750
I'll cover the expenses.

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,560
Just as long as she's gone...

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
What?

178
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,790
Are you worried I'll embarrass you?

179
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,750
You weren't worried back then.

180
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,370
What should I be afraid of?

181
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,870
So,

182
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,480
you married Jian Cheng

183
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
just to spite me?

184
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
Spite you?

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,990
You're thinking too much.

186
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,870
I married Jian Cheng

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,510
simply because I wanted to.

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,590
It has nothing to do with you.

189
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,630
You dare to marry my uncle.

190
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,440
You've got some guts.

191
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,250
I should call you Bold Jian from now on.

192
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,790
You've already seen
how fierce Second Aunt can be.

193
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,390
You also know
what the Zhou Family is like.

194
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,440
Then there's Third Aunt,

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,840
Fourth Aunt,

196
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,160
and other aunts.

197
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
None of them are easy to deal with.

198
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,550
If it's not easy,

199
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
then we'll fall out completely.

200
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,390
I'm not backing down.

201
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,750
I remember

202
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,790
you once told me

203
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,550
that Ye Qi always picked on your mom.

204
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,550
If you don't speak,

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,450
it means she's still giving her
a hard time.

206
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,550
I just realized

207
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,790
their clothing styles look so alike.

208
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
Well, I have to say,

209
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,080
you two even have similar taste.

210
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,920
(Got something to do)

211
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,510
The things you like

212
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,080
are practically the same.

213
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,750
Ye Qi,

214
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,390
you're hitting menopause, huh?

215
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,790
What menopause?

216
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,150
Didn't you say

217
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,030
that you just saw Yawei

218
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
wearing the same style of clothes
as mine?

219
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,670
Well, she arrived this noon,

220
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,080
and you've been chatting with her.

221
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,840
How could you not know
what she was wearing?

222
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,790
Listen to me.

223
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,080
That's what menopause is like.

224
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,670
Your memory starts to slip.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,260
Your temper gets quick to flare.

226
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Even your skin loses firmness.

227
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,910
You two just talked for so long.

228
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,790
Yet you instantly forgot what she wore.

229
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,320
You really have a terrible memory.

230
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,790
I didn't mean it like that.

231
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,870
Ye Qi,

232
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,440
do you even know you're in menopause?

233
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
If you're not sure,

234
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
better go to the hospital.

235
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,550
Earlier diagnosis means
earlier treatment.

236
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,320
That's not what I mean.

237
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,320
I just blurted it out.

238
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,200
Maybe I didn't explain myself well.

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,150
I mean,

240
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,080
I simply didn't notice it earlier

241
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,510
and I just happened to notice it.

242
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,440
Cheng,

243
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,790
don't get hung up
on just a couple of words.

244
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,200
You really didn't make yourself clear.

245
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
You said

246
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,080
that Yawei and I

247
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,510
share the same taste

248
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,320
and we like the same things.

249
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,840
Are you really talking
about our preferences,

250
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
or

251
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,150
what you really meant was

252
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,270
I like Yufeng?

253
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,720
Yufeng?

254
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,440
I never mentioned Yufeng.

255
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Don't get me wrong.

256
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,030
Why bring up Yufeng suddenly?

257
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,600
Cheng,

258
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,630
you're Tingyan's wife now.

259
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,390
As for you and Yufeng,

260
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,600
don't bring it up...

261
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Ye Qi, look, you forgot again.

262
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,200
I hit my head before.

263
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,840
I don't remember things from before.

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,910
How could I keep thinking
about the past?

265
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,790
Ye Qi, this is just menopause.

266
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,670
Your memory's getting worse.

267
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Alright, enough.

268
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,560
Jian Cheng,

269
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,200
tone it down a bit.

270
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,300
Ye Qi

271
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,840
is older than you.

272
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,440
If she blames you,

273
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
you have to listen.

274
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,790
Is she older than me?

275
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm bad at math. Let me check.

276
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm

277
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,910
24 this year.

278
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,390
She's

279
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,510
48 this year.

280
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,890
I wouldn't have noticed
if you didn't say.

281
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,160
Ye Qi,

282
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,790
you're 24 years older than me.

283
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,320
Listen to me.

284
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,960
Women usually enter menopause

285
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,150
between the ages of 45 and 55.

286
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,550
That's risky for you.

287
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,080
Thanks for your concern, Cheng.

288
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,270
If I get the chance,

289
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,970
I'll definitely go to the hospital.

290
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,670
You really should go.

291
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,390
Honey.

292
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Let's head home.

293
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,870
OK.

294
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,390
It hurts.

295
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
You have no idea how impressive
I was just now.

296
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,230
Don't wear shoes

297
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,380
you're not used to next time.

298
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
No way.

299
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,510

300
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,550
Mrs. Zhou needs to stay elegant.

301
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,590
But I just want to see you run free
like a wild horse,

303
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
