2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,810
Bride and groom, bow to each other.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,760
The bride and groom
will exchange rings now.

4
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,220
(Episode 8: The Start of a Rift)

5
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,740
Gosh. Hello.

6
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,780
Slow down. Chew thoroughly.

7
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,420
Dad. Where's Mom?

8
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,080
Mom

9
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,150
had to go to work early.

10
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,220
Okay.

11
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,160
Dad, I've made up my mind.

12
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,660
About what?

13
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm going to become a chef.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,070
A chef? Why?
Didn't you want to become a fireman?

15
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,570
I did, but I changed my mind yesterday.

16
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,810
Now, I want to become a chef.

17
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,240
Yesterday? What happened yesterday?

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,380
It's a secret.

19
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,979
Anyway, I'm going to become a chef,

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,509
so you have to help me.

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,180
Just work hard.

22
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,780
I'll support you all the way.

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,420
And you know you have to study hard
as a basic principle, right?

24
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,460
I'm going to school now, Father.

25
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,900
-Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
(My woman)

27
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,890
(My man)

28
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,240
Sweetie. What are you doing?
It's eight o'clock already.

29
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,740
Okay.

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,910
Why didn't you put on your tie?

31
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Eun-sil.

32
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,590
I forgot how to tie it.

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,130
What? You forgot?

34
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,400
You've been tying it for decades,
but you forgot?

35
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,600
Exactly. How could I forget that?

36
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,470
You could've just asked me to do it.
Don't scare me like that.

37
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,050
Your skin became silky soft
from using a mask just once.

38
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,150
Is it? Really?

39
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,190
Yes.

40
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,230
I'll take care of your skin from now on.

41
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,730
Thank you.

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,060
And you know, sweetie.

43
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,399
I thought about it all night...

44
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,870
About what?

45
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,610
If you really want to get plugs,

46
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,240
I'll make you a wig using my hair.

47
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,010
Do you want to wear that?

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,050
-Your hair?
-Yes.

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,450
Sit down.

50
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,020
Look.

51
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,090
Ta-da. Like this.

52
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,460
It looks great on you.

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,290
You look 30 years younger. Oh my goodness.

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
I look like a baby.

55
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,580
-Gyeong-ja.
-Excuse me.

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,990
Where are you, Gyeong-ja?

57
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,690
-Darn it.
-Honey, what's with you?

58
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,790
Let me go!

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,290
-My goodness!
-My gosh!

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
-What is this mess?
-I'm...

61
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,600
Darn it. You idiot.

62
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,330
You've lost your mind!

63
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,870
You've lost your mind!

64
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,240
How could you not come home for two days
without even calling?

65
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,510
Do you think being in a slump
is a badge of honor?

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,010
Where were you?

67
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,150
Where's your head?
Why are you suddenly doing this?

68
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,620
What?

69
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,920
Tell me. You twerp. Tell me!

70
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,990
Are you trying to kill me, you jerk?

71
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,030
Why you...

72
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,659
Where are you going? I'm not done!

73
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,130
Where are you going?

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,670
You punk.

75
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,640
You should've just told us
that you got a girlfriend.

76
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,210
Your mom isn't that narrow-minded.

77
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,840
If you felt uncomfortable telling her,
you could've told me.

78
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm more progressive than others.

79
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,950
I've been waiting

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,590
for my only son to bring home a girl.

81
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,090
I don't have a girlfriend.

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,560
You brat. Must you lie to me too?

83
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,290
What do you mean?

84
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,500
Your mom found a girl's hair clip
in your room.

85
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,230
She clutched that hair clip

86
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,870
and mumbled all night long
like the world was ending.

87
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,440
I was terrified.

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,640
I thought she was going to lose her mind.

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,180
What does she do?

90
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,110
Is she pretty?

91
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,610
How old is she?
She isn't older than you, is she?

92
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,980
-I don't know yet.
-You don't know yet?

93
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,720
If you say you don't know yet,

94
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,990
it means you're still learning about her.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
There is someone.

96
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,330
You do have a girlfriend.

97
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,170
You punk. Now you're finally spilling it.

98
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,340
Did you know Mom was a porn star
from the moment you met?

99
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,410
Of course, I did. Why?

100
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,680
Just asking.

101
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,650
You liked her anyway?

102
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,820
I didn't just like her.

103
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,420
Your mom was the queen.

104
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,220
Porn stars now don't compare.

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,490
Hey. Even if she took off a stocking,

106
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,200
she pulled it down a millimeter at a time,
and put her soul into it,

107
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,830
and rolled it down.

108
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,409
When I saw that, I thought
my heart would explode.

109
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,940
Why do you ask?

110
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,850
Is your girlfriend a porn star?

111
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,330
If only you hadn't done that back then
to that jerk,

112
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,230
I could've directed that movie.

113
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,530
Kang Gyeong-ja.

114
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,610
All of this

115
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,380
is because of you.

116
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,080
It's your fault.

117
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,730
It's me, Kang Gyeong-ja.

118
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,140
Mom, how have you been?

119
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,110
I've been well.

120
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,020
No.

121
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,660
Actually, I haven't been well.

122
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,720
(The Late Seo Kyeong-hui)

123
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,490
I've been going through some tough times.

124
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
The thing is,

125
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,970
his first love showed up.

126
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,540
Do you remember Hae-suk?

127
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,340
We were close back in high school.

128
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,150
You're the pathetic one.

129
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,590
You're so wary of and on edge around

130
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,890
your husband's first love
from over 20 years ago.

131
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,660
But then again, I'm sure you're anxious.

132
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,730
You're the reason
something that horrendous happened.

133
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,670
I tried hard to forget,

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,010
but I can't seem to do that.

135
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,310
What am I going to do now?

136
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,710
What should I do, Mom?

137
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,560
The chairman is waiting for you.

138
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,010
Why are you here?

139
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,510
Do you think you have the right
to be here?

140
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm not here to see her.

141
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,780
I came to see you.

142
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,380
You came to see me?

143
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,520
Why is your face so worn out?

144
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,190
Why do you care how my face looks?

145
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,990
Then why did you ask me for a favor?

146
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,130
If you wanted to talk big
and act so arrogantly,

147
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,900
you should've lived a better life
without having to ask for favors.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,630
You acted as if
you're the most prideful in the world.

149
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,670
Why are you such a mess?

150
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,870
I paid you back right away the next day.

151
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,810
So what? That doesn't change the fact
that you asked for a favor.

152
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,910
Hate me for what I did wrong,
but you need to learn to thank me too.

153
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,710
You can't even tell such things apart.

154
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,050
What's the use of being a big professor?

155
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,880
I'll never ask you for another favor.

156
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,750
So I don't want to see you ever again.

157
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,290
It's a relief that he died.

158
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,130
What would you have done
if he had spread those pictures?

159
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,570
Did you get someone
to run a background check on me again?

160
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,710
How much do you know?

161
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,570
I lent you 500 million won.

162
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,380
Did you think I'd just sit on my hands?

163
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,080
I just know who the dead man is.

164
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,380
I don't know who killed him.

165
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,550
That's all I know.

166
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,490
Did you say
you'll never ask me for a favor again?

167
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,690
You said that to me 20 years ago

168
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,000
right before you went to study abroad.

169
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,700
You never know what might happen in life.

170
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,500
You never know

171
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,500
you might have to ask me
for another favor in 20 years.

172
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,840
But when that day comes,
I might be long gone already.

You should live long.

174

If you ended someone else's life,
you should live for them too.

175

Still, I'm relieved to see you holding out
and going on with life.

176

I thought you'd die after her.

177

I don't need her life,

178

No, it's nothing.

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,950
You left for work without a word,
so I was worried.

You weren't answering your phone either.

189

My so-called husband
isn't interested in sleeping together.

I thought he might be
sexually dysfunctional,

and the video you received

256
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,090
were from the same burner phone.

257
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,230
I was right.

258
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,400
That means Joo Gang-san's murderer

259
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,340
was at your friend's funeral.

260
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Probably.

261
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,210
Maybe we should check the guest list
from the funeral.

262
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,610
It may provide a lead.

263
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,610
Would someone who sent pictures like that

264
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,280
have signed the guest book?

265
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,950
Then we can check the security videos

266

from the funeral home.

267
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,150
I called and asked,

268
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,960
and the videos from that day
have been deleted already.

269

Mr. Ahn.

270

Have you heard of Dahan Care Home?

271
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,030
No, I haven't.

272
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,900
Your wife went there
the day of the incident.

273
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,540
My wife

274

That must be it.

275
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,850
Why? Is there a problem?

276
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,150
Your wife deleted the videos
from her dashcam that day.

277
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,350
She says she deleted them out of habit.

278
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,320
I wondered if you knew anything.

279
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,600
First you suspect me,
now you suspect my wife too?

280
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,600
-Mr. Ahn.
-My Jeong-hae would never.

281
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,270
How many times must I tell you that?

282
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,570
You should catch the killer.

283
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,740
Why are you suspecting
and following innocent people?

284
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,020
Married couples often think
they know the most about each other,

285
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,320
but it's more common
for them to know less than others.

286
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,990
Your wife may have

287
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,960
many more secrets than you think,

288
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,600
and a past you may not know about.
That's all I'm saying.

289
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,400
Where are you going?

290
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,470
I forgot I had plans to go golfing.

295
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,320
I'll throw you into the Han River.

296
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,560
Do you doubt me?

297
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,230
No. You're more than capable.

298
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,300
So behave.

299
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,780
Let me hold you.

300
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
What?

301
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,010
Why? Suddenly?

302
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,250
Get over here.

303
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,860
Don't drink because you're miserable.

304
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Got it?

305
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,470
Okay.

306
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,780
I didn't drink because I was miserable.
I drank because life is so hard.

307
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,280
That hurts.

308
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,340
I totally look like a college kid.

309
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,380
He was acting so suspicious,

310
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,480
that I sneaked a look

311
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,350
at his cell phone before he left for work.

312
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,030
And they were chatting about

313
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,200
Hae-suk opening a bar,

314
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,130
and what they should bring,

315
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,670
how they're going to dress...

316
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,310
How much they should chip in...

317
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,580
He was so excited.

318
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,180
No wonder.
He was doing yoga and working out

319
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,880
with dumbbells all night long.

320
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,520
(Exactly.)

321
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,260
I mean, he did a face mask,
which he never does.

322
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,400
He even brought up getting hair plugs.

323
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,100
I thought it was all for me,

324
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,410
but it was for that woman.

325
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,080
Stop crying. It's not worth crying over.

(Gyeong-ja.)

327
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,250
What do I do now?

You should fight it head-on.

331
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,090
What are you doing tonight?
Let's crash their little party.

332
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,360
Crash?

333
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,660
We should haze them
so they get their heads on straight.

334
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,770
Okay. Let's crash.

335
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,270
Okay. I'll call you after work.

336
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,570
You have to dress nicely.

337
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,840
Okay.

338
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,920
I won't forgive him.

339
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,090
Who cares if she's his first love?

340
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,520
I won't let you take my husband.

341
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,230
Hey you, Baek Hae-suk. Just you wait,

342
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,960
you old hag!

343
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,700
Oh, no. What do I do?

344
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,910
Oh, no. What do I do?

345
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,810
Thank you.

346
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,850
Stay here until you get a place.

347
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,550
I booked it for a month.

348
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,990
Bye. Take care.

349
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,150
Ms. Kang Gyeong-ja.

350
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,530
I'm so happy that you called.

351
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,530
Let's not waste time and go upstairs.

352
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,630
Already? That's good for me.

353
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,070
Isn't that Hyeong-u's wife?

354
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,980
(Ero Hyeong-u)

355
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,520
-Please make it pretty.
-Sure thing.

356
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,450
When are you coming?

357
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm going to be late, so meet up first.

358
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,390
Are you meeting your friends?
Can I go too?

359
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Bye.

360
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,580
Why don't you shower too?

361
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,320
Yes. That's good.

362
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,590
I need you to promise me something
before I shower.

363
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,390
What?

364
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,570
Promise you'll make that movie
with my husband.

365
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,670
What?

366
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,110
Darn it.

367
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I can't do that. I can't trust that loser.

368
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,120
But then again,

369
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,660
depending on what you do today,

370
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,890
I may reconsider.

371
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,260
Forget it.

372
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,600
Fine! Okay, I'll do it.

373
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,230
Where? Where should I sign?

374
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,810
You are so impatient.

375
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,380
Here.

376
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,880
Here?

377
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,480
(I, Park Si-o, hire Cho Hyeong-u to direct
the movie being filmed in 2021.)

378
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,550
(Memorandum)

379
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,390
Happy?

380
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,060
Okay, then. Shall we begin?

381
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,170
(Koo Yeong-seon)

382
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Excuse me.

383
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,360
I've heard a lot about you from him.

384
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,830
He said you were his best friend.

385
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,760
Did you meet Man-sik here
at this nursing home?

386
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,370
Yes.

387
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm Ms. Koo Yeong-seon's caretaker,

388
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,840
and Mr. Cheon took care of her
for several years.

389
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,550
And we grew close naturally over time.

390
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
No.

391
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,180
I respected

392
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,990
and liked him a lot.

393
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,790
I couldn't

394
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,300
control my emotions at the funeral,

395
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,030
so I'm sure some people
got the wrong idea.

396
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,800
But I swear,

397
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,070
we did nothing to be ashamed of.

398
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,510
I mean it.

399
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,680
I know Man-sik would never do
anything like that.

400
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,980
He was a very warm

401
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,150
and good person.

402
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,820
Let me ask you one more thing.

403
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Do you know

404
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,560
what relationship

405
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,830
Ms. Koo Yeong-seon had with Man-sik?

406
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,600
Yes.

407
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,240
You do know?

408
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,850
Yes.

409
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,980
I heard from him.

410
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,650
He said after what happened,

411
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,190
he was miserable every minute
of every day.

412
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,560
That he wanted to just die
countless times.

413
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,500
Did my wife

414
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,370
know that as well?

415
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,199
Please tell me.

416
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:29,440
I heard my wife introduced him
to this place.

417
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,310
Does that mean

418
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,110
my wife knows everything?

419
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,090
You'll feel a prick.

420
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,699
You'll feel better
once you finish the bag.

421
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,600
You must be busy.

422
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,040
You didn't have to come all the way here.

423
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,070
Exactly. If you had gone to the hospital
yesterday when Gung-cheol came,

424
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,970
she wouldn't have had to come
all the way here.

425
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,450
If you feel worse later,

426
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,280
you have to go to the hospital
and get a full check-up.

427
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,580
Okay, Father?

428
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,520
Okay, I will.

429
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,790
It'll take about two hours, so take a nap.

430
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,870
It may not taste good, but eat up.

431
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,340
I'm sure it'll taste good.

432
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,080
I wouldn't have called
if I knew you'd come.

433
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,750
I only called to ask you
to calm Gung-cheol down

434
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,050
because he was so upset when he left.

435
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,990
I know how you feel.

436
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,960
I came because I wanted to see
the two of you, so don't feel bad.

437
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,530
My gosh. How could I not feel bad?

438
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,860
It's not like you bum around at home.

439
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,900
You fix people's illnesses.
You do a great thing.

440
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,530
But you skipped work to come here.

441
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,170
I came to eat your cooking

442
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,800
and get rejuvenated
so that I can work even harder.

443
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,080
I didn't make much.
Thanks for being so sweet.

444
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,420
Gung-cheol is good to you, right?

445
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,620
Yes, he's good to me.

446
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,530
You know,

447
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,130
he hates his dad so much,

448
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,060
but they say you can't escape your genes.

449
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,370
Sometimes, I feel like
he has the same temper.

450
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,270
I know he's very lacking,

451
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,310
but please be patient and understanding.

452
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,110
I don't know about anything else,

453
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,080
but he won't cause you grief
because of other women.

454
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,050
That is

455
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,120
the only reason I'm still with him.

456
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,890
Because I can trust him in that regard.

457
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,770
I don't have to be patient about anything.

458
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,800
He's the one being patient with me.

459
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,240
He'd better be patient.

460
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,180
He's living with a pretty, smart,
and successful woman.

461
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,480
It would be his loss if he wasn't patient.

462
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,150
Am I wrong?

463
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,450
You're so right, Mother.

464
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,290
Jeong-hae.

465
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,730
Thank you very much.

466
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,170
You married into a family like this
that has nothing,

467
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,670
gave us a grandson,

468
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,570
and are living well without any problems.

469
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,710
Thank you so much.

470
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,580
Mother.

471
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,850
I get so happy whenever I see you,

472
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,090
that I get silly.

473
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,220
Eat up. Go on.

474
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,500
Chew slowly and thoroughly.

475
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,230
I will.

476
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,840
My gosh. Where's my head?
I'm making scorched rice.

477
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,480
I'll be right back. Keep eating.

478
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,650
Okay?

479
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,520
Goodness.

480
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,710
(Theory of Business Administration)

481
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,660
(Here we go.)

482
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,500
Look this way. One, two, three.

483
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,370
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

484
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,070
-See you later.
-Okay. See you later.

485
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,170
Okay.

486
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,180
My gosh. How could she not have
any family at all?

487
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,640
Is she an orphan?

488
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,080
No wonder there are no guests
on the bride's side.

489
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,220
Goodness gracious.

490
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,650
She was bragging all over town
about getting a doctor daughter-in-law.

491
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,950
Gosh. My goodness.

492
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,490
How could he marry an orphan?

493
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,560
Then again,
why would a doctor from a good family

494
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,900
marry a guy from a family
that's completely ruined?

495
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,940
I knew my brother looked depressed.

496
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,170
He must've been heartbroken
to let his perfectly good son

497
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,440
marry an orphan girl.

498
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,950
Leave. You don't deserve to be here.

499
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,120
Get out of here.

500
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,120
Come on, brother. Don't say that.

501
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,650
Why are you telling us to leave?

502
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,390
This is a place only for those
who want to celebrate their marriage.

503
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,830
All of you don't deserve to be here.

504
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,060
Get lost now!

505
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,530
-Come on.
-Come on, don't say that.

506
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,130
I was just concerned.

507
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,270
-My goodness!
-Will you let me go?

508
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,840
Please welcome the bride and groom.

509
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,210
Please give them a big hand.

510
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,320
-All right!
-Looking good!

511
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,190
Bride and groom,

512
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,460
please turn around and face the guests.

513
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,700
Everyone, just for today,

514
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,940
the groom's mother, her mother-in-law,

515
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,940
will be a mother for the bride.

516
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,010
Give them a big hand!

(I hope your business does well.)

528
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,130
-Keep ordering.
-Excuse me!

529
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,030
-Order some more food.
-What's this?

530
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,510
You're here.

531
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,650
You gave her a plant, a flower basket,

532
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,220
and even framed artwork? You're insane.

533
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,160
You're showing off with your money.

534
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,860
You two must have done some legwork.

535
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,600
I got everything with one call.

536
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,400
Man.

537
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,170
-Goodness.
-Hey, we'll take it. Leave it there.

538
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,940
Congratulations on your new business.

539
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,280
Gosh, thank you. It's so pretty.

540
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,550
Hey, you're wearing Ji-uk's clothes,

541
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,110
your golf player son.

542
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,980
It suits you well.

543
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,890
What? Your son is a golf player?

544
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Yes.

545
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,020
I understand
how you miss your college days,

546
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,060
but this is way too pathetic.

547
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,930
Were you trying to be funny
when you put this on?

548
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,700
-Is this funny?
-Yes, it is.

549
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,030
I was trying to be funny.

Thanks.

553
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,880
What? Didn't you bring anything?

554
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,510
What? Did you really come empty-handed?

555
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,680
Ahn Gung-cheol, come on.

556
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,080
I had to come in a hurry,
so I couldn't prepare anything. Sorry.

557
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,990
Don't say that.
I'm just thankful that you came.

558
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,760
Hey, where did you go and with whom?
What were you up to?

559
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,230
What's with your face?

560
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,760
What about my face?

561
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,680
-Gyeong-ja!
-You're here.

562
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,780
I am.

563
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,650
You must have cried a lot.

564
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,590
I didn't cry that much.

565
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,090
Anyway, where's Jeong-hae?

566
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,160
I don't think she's coming.
We should get going.

567
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,330
Okay.

568
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,340
Wait!

569
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,780
I'm sorry. My work finished late.

570
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,820
Don't be sorry. Let's go.

571
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,690
Anyway, thank you for coming
despite your busy schedule, Chun-bok.

572
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,930
I'm not busy.

573
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,300
And thanks for making time, you three.

574
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,600
Don't thank us.

575
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,140
Of course, we should come for Hae-suk.
Isn't that so?

576
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,200
All right.

577
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,010

Well, as you can see,

585
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,790
there are no empty seats. I'm sorry.

586

What do you mean?

587
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,960
We can join our husbands.

588
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,400
This way, please. Take a seat.

589

All right. Dr. Nam?

590

My goodness!

591

Sweetie, you're here.

592
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,280
What are you doing?
Bring some chairs over here.

593
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,850
Okay, I'll do that.

594
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,120
-Over here.
-Come here. Sit down, Eun-sil.

595

Why is this bar so shabby?

596
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,770
Have you had dinner?

597
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,680
Do you need anything else?

598
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,650
Why would I need anything
at a place like this?

599
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,850
I'm just drinking because I have to.

600
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,790
Just let me know.
I have expensive liquor too.

601
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,690
I'll charge you much less
than what you charge at your place.

True. Jeong-hae needs to vent
once in a while too.

720
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,380
She should drink,
