5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,080
-Hey.
-Just kill me instead!

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,350
Why? What will I gain by killing you?

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,260
You toyed with me enough.

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,760
Can't you let me go now?

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,830
-I'm begging you.
-I said I'll let you go.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,230
If you scam that punk just one last time,

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,170
I said I'll let you go
even if you don't want me to.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,040
Think about your siblings who rely on you.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,380
This is really the last time.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,350
Okay. Kang Ji-uk...

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,720
His mom is super rich.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,660
If you get me pictures of you and him
sleeping together tonight,

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,960
I won't make you do this anymore.

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,430
Pinky swear.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,140
(Episode 7: First Love)

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,740
That looks good.

21
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,509
It feels like only yesterday.

22
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,539
How is it 20 years ago already?

23
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,150
I can't believe it.

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,979
What do you mean?
You look the same as you did in college.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,420
You look even prettier.

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,920
You're like this cherry tomato.

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,890
You still look like you're in your 20s.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,020
How are you so solid and thin?

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,700
I haven't been able to work out lately.

30
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,300
But I have a lot of muscle
underneath, so...

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
My shoelace is untied.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,240
The same as during college?

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,270
-Sit down.
-You're impossible.

34
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,940
You look like you age backwards.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,180
Do you grind up elixirs

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,850
for breakfast or something?

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,450
How do you look even younger
than in college?

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,090
It looks like you're the one
eating elixirs.

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,650
-What?
-To be honest,

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,190
you look much younger
and handsomer than in college.

41
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,390
What? I do?

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,460
I don't even take vitamins.

43
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,660
Maybe it's in my genes.

44
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,430
Give me a break.

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,530
People thought you were
the school chancellor in college.

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,100
And you don't take vitamins,
but you take prostate pills.

47
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,540
Seriously.

48
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,310
Anyway, what happened?

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,210
Why are you here?

50
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,880
Why? Can't I be?

51
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,380
Of course, you can.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,290
I just wonder how you ended up

53
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,060
buying this bar.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,290
Hey. This is what you call fate,
you idiot.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,329
Don't you agree?

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,360
Fate? It's destiny!

57
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,770
It's a miraculous destiny
granted us from above!

58
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,530
You're exactly right.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,100
I was looking to buy a bar,

60
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,040
and I found myself drawn here.

61
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,240
Maybe I missed the four of you so much,

62
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,740
that they were touched up above.

63
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,290
-Which of the four...
-Is this what you were after?

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,320
What do you mean?

65
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,560
The reason you borrowed money from me.

66
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,130
Is that what you mean?

67
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,730
It was not. I didn't know either.

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,670
Don't play dumb.

69
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,070
Stop jumping to conclusions.

70
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,500
That's not it, punk.

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,780
So? What will you do now?

72
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,650
About what?

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,250
What if Jeong-hae finds out

74
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,890
that Hae-suk used the money you lent her
to open a bar near your home?

75
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,089
What will you do then?

76
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,190
I should tell her the truth
before she gets the wrong idea.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,600
I don't think it's that simple.

78
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,370
Serious problems

79
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,610
become simple
if you think about it simply.

80
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,980
Sure. Even simple problems

81
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,450
become serious
if you think about it seriously.

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,390
Jeong-hae.

83
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,030
(2003, California, USA)

84
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,070
Jeong-hae. Wake up.

85
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,820
Yes?

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,590
I'm hungry.

87
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,520
Do you want me to make you something?

88
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,720
You?

89
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,440
Mother, aren't the noodles really chewy?

90
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,340
Yes, you're right.

91
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,340
Is there a secret?

92
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,010
Of course, there is.

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,410
You add the seasoning to the water,
boil for about four minutes,

94
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,350
then put the noodles in
with a few drops of vinegar.

95
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,450
Then the noodles will become firmer,

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,220
which gives it a better texture
and makes it taste better.

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,990
I see.

98
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,760
How do you know that so well?

99
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,500
I learned it on the internet.

100
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:44,170
There's this guy called the Romantic Chef,

101
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,070
and he can make just about everything,

102
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,700
just like Dad.

103
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,000
Really?

104
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,380
Gosh, this is really good. Eat up.

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Okay.

106
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,090
When do you open?

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,360
In two days.

108
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,120
It's right around the corner.

109
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,990
Exactly.

110
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,760
I was worried
because I don't know many people.

111
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,070
Would you guys come
and give me some business?

112
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,570
Of course, we will.

113
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
And you don't need to call anyone else.

114
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,840
We'll come, drink all night long,

115
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,040
and give you a lot of business,
so don't worry.

116
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,780
-Really?
-Yes! On that day,

117
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,480
we should get bottles of hard liquor.
Do you have whiskey?

118
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,850
Of course, we do.

119
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,450
My gosh, this guy.
This guy is unbelievable.

120
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,920
You always made us pay
even if it was just soju and beer,

121
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,860
but you're going to get
bottles of hard liquor?

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,830
Hey, man. A man should know
when to save and when to splurge.

123
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,300
I've been waiting for a day like this
to spend all my money,

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,130
mooching off of you
despite your criticism.

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,100
Hae-suk, make sure you prepare
two to three bottles of good liquor.

126
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,500
Are you serious, Chun-bok?

127
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,770
My gosh! Thank you so much.

128
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,909
There's no need to thank me.

129
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,680
Do you need any other help?

130
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,280
I can use a lot of help.

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,380
I'll keep asking you for help
as I run my business,

132
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,590
so consider yourself warned.

133
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,750
Okay.

134
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,490
Yes, this is why
Hae-suk moved closer to us.

135
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,730
Of course.

136
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,330
Can I count on my guys who used to
drink my penalty drinks for me?

137
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,370
Yes, of course!

138
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,740
Drink up. Drink.

139
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,250
Is this for real?

140
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,020
I can't believe Hae-suk was at O.W.
It makes no sense.

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,250
Exactly. I still can't believe it.

142
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,050
We were just with Hae-suk, weren't we?

143
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Wake up, all of you.

144
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,390
Did you forget what she was like?

145
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,500
Do you think it makes any sense

146
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
that she let fate lead her here?

147
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,770
Then what? Are you saying

148
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,040
our dear Hae-suk came here to scam us?

149
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,740
That could be the case.

150
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,070
That's why you need to brace yourself
and be careful.

151
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,580
I don't need to be careful.

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,840
I have nothing she can take anyway.

153
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,880
All I've got are two of my things,
and they don't work very well either.

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,620
If you put it that way,
I'm the same as you.

155
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,650
Only people who are rich get scammed.

156
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,890
-Of course.
-We have nothing to worry about

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,690
-since we have absolutely nothing.
-That's right.

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,260
Yet you told her you'll buy bottles
and give her a lot of business?

159
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,500
Goodness.

160
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,700
Anything to add about this situation?

161
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,940
No, man.

162
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,470
Hey, you all have to play fair.

163
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,580
We're only allowed to go to her bar
on Thursdays when we get together.

164
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,280
Okay? It's cheating if you go there alone.

165
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,210
-Okay?
-Okay, I totally agree.

166
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,050
You two can go there whenever you want.
I won't stop you.

167
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,850
What are you talking about?
I mean, we're friends.

168
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,760
If we go, we go together.
If we don't, we all stay away.

169
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,360
-Tell me about it!
-Hands in. Now.

170
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,590
Come on.

171
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Man, this is so annoying.

172
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,160
Do we have to do this?

173
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,970
Do we have no faith in one another?

174
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,130
Stop whining.

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,240
Okay, all together now.
Here's to fair play.

176
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,710
Fair play!

177
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,710
How was hiking?

178
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,890
Gung-cheol.

179
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,320
Honey?

180
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
Hey, Jeong-hae.

181
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,870
Why are you so deep in thought?

182
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,170
Was I?

183
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,500
I haven't gone hiking in a while,
so I must be tired.

184
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,140
What... What did you say?

185
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,240
I asked if you had fun hiking.

186
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,750
Of course, I did. How was golf?

187
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,520
It was good.

188
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,590
I should go hiking more often now.

189
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,850
I must've gotten the mountain's energy.

190
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,060
My body feels awfully hot.

191
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,630
(Gung-cheol, I'm very happy
I saw you again.)

192
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,500
(Let's forget the past
and be comfortable around each other.)

193
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,970
Goodness, these punks.
We just said goodbye.

194
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,180
Why are they texting me this late?

195
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,740
Right.

196
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,910
It looked like the bar reopened.

197
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,750
Really?

198
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,750
Jeong-hae, I... I got really sweaty.
Let me take a shower first.

199
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,930
(Ahn Gung-cheol)

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
(It was nice to see you too.)

201
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,400
Gosh.

202
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,140
But you're saying
you aren't happy as I am.

203

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,390
Ready, get set, and go.

♫ Rise up, rise up, Phoenix ♫

209
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,130
Fly!

210
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,960
-Fly!
-Phoenix!

211
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,370
-Go!
-All right!

212
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,370
-All right!
-We can do it!

213
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,510
-Okay, settle down!
-We can do it!

214
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,980
All right, I'll take the picture.

215
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,340
-Come around.
-Find our spot.

216
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,880
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

217
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,320
We need to talk.

218

(Let's forget the past)

219
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,130
(and be comfortable around each other.)

220
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,500
I'll do it.

221
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,740
(Let's get married)

222
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,680
(once I get discharged.)

223
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,650
(Do you mean it?)

224
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,420
Yes, I mean it.

225
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,930
I'm sleepy. Let's go to sleep.

226
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,190
(It looks like you're the one
eating elixirs.)

227
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,660
You look much younger
and handsomer than in college.

228
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,960
(Handsomer...)

229
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,770
-Come here. Let me put this on for you.
-Okay.

230
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Okay.

231
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,710
-Pu-reum, come here.
-Yes, Pu-reum. Come here.

232
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,410
Lie down next to Daddy.

233
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,050
Okay. Stay down.

234
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,680
Okay.

235
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,390
What got into you?

236
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,560
I kept telling you to do face masks,
but you refused.

237
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,460
Just because.

238
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,330
True. Someone thought you were my father.

239
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,930
But do you know something?

240
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,470
You looked just like this when I first
met you at the literature institute.

241
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,540
No. You may have looked older back then.

242
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,910
Anyway, you'll only keep getting younger.

243
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,320
Hae-suk said that too.
That I look younger than in college.

244
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,680
Who? Hae-suk?

245
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,349
Do you mean your first love?

246
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,720
No. Hae-chun.

247
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,530
He's a friend from college. A guy.

248
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,300
Oh, okay.

249
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,030
He has a good eye.

250
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,300
It's Pu-reum's turn now.

251
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,470
-Eun-sil.
-Yes?

252
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,440
Should I get hair plugs?

253
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,840
What?

254
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,720
It'll cost a fortune
to fill in all the gaps.

255
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,690
Right? I'll just live as I am.

256
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,860
Honey. You really were traumatized,
weren't you?

257
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,930
Let's get them later on,
once we've paid off

258
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,330
the mortgage on the apartment.

259
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,500
The mortgage?

260
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,470
We have 20 years left.

261
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,840
You'll only be 70.

262
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,270
You'll look the same then too,

263
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,610
so it'll be the same
whether you get them now or then.

264
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,880
Okay.

265
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,550
Pu-reum.

266
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,980
Do I look pretty, Daddy?

267
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,650
Of course. You'll get even prettier.

268
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,330
What's with you?

269
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,460
I hear yoga is good for staying in shape.

270
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,740
What has gotten into you?

271
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,170
You refused to do it
when I kept nagging you to,

272
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,580
and now you suddenly want to do it.

273
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,110
What? You said
you don't want me to look old.

274
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,890
(You still look like you're in your 20s.)

275
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,360
How are you so solid and thin?

276
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,790
(Thin?)

277
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,070
(CEO Moon Hong-ryeol)

278
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,100
Hey, what's up?

279
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,400
You're not busy tomorrow, right?
Help me for just one day.

280
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,140
Just one day?

281
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,540
(The director suddenly got
intestinal inflammation)

282
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,680
and will be hospitalized until tomorrow.

283
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,180
My gosh, have times changed.

284
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,850
You lose so much money

285
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,550
if you cancel a shoot just for a day.

286
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,920
Gosh. We went to work
even if we had to wear diapers.

287
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,150
Exactly.

288
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,720
Everything is all set up.
I'm losing my mind here.

289
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,730
Fine. I do have important plans,
but I'll have to cancel.

290
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,630
You're the best, Hyeong-u.

291
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,240
I'll text you the time and location.

292
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,870
Hyeong-u, I love you.

293
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,510
Okay. Bye.

294
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,080
Send me the scenario too.

295
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,350
You said you'll never go back
into that industry.

296
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,580
It's just for one day.

297
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,320
If I don't help him out, who will?

298
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,690
My husband is so kind.

299
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,560
I need to do this. Why is it so hard?

300
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,130
(The person you have reached...)

301
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,360
Ji-uk.

302
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,770
Stop it. It isn't even midnight yet.

303
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,140
(Please leave a message...)

304

(The person you have reached
is not available.)

305
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,440
Darn it.

-What's wrong with you? Stop it!
-Sorry.

309
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,830
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,240
Take off your shoes.

311
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,910
Turn on the light.

312
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm blinded!

313
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,840
I'll put you down on your couch.

314
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm so...

315
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Don't go.

316
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,640
I really didn't want to go this far.

317
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,040
Darn it.

318
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,670
My stomach hurts.

319
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,280
Darn it.

320
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,480
Hey.

321
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,450
Hey. What are you doing?

322
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,990
Gosh, that was close.

323
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,760
Darn it.

324
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,670
I keep dressing you,
but you keep taking it off.

325
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,070
Where's the front?

326
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,680
What are you doing? Do you not like me?

327
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,580
Don't do this.

328
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,150
Someone this pretty and cool

329
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,850
shouldn't strip in front of a stupid loser
like me.

330
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Okay?

331
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,530
Let's go.

332
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,970
How pretty.

333
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,610
I'm going to take this for my mom.

334
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,850
I'll take his.

335
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,100
Sleep up here.

336
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,940
I know you're not asleep.

337
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,950
I won't try anything,

338
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,680
so sleep here.

339
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,730
That's what the guy is supposed to say.

340
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,870
What does it matter who says it?

341
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,010
Goodnight.

342
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,110
(Dr. Nam. Say hi.)

343
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,810
He's the youngest son
of Dr. Jung Seok-hui,

344
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,750
Yeongang University's
new hospital director.

345
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,290
I'm Nam Jeong-hae.

346
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,320
Hello. I'm Jung Jae-hun.
It's nice to meet you.

347
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
Hey... Jeong-hae.

348
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,470
I have something to tell you.

349
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,070
If it isn't urgent, let's talk tomorrow.
I'm tired.

350
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,550
Okay.

351
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,280
Sure.

352
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,440
What's your real reason for coming here?

353
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,540
My real reason.

354
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,780
It's probably the same as the reason

355
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,850
you live here.

356
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,820
Why did you tell me
about Man-sik's passing?

357
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,420
Tell me.

358
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,330
Weren't you asking around
for Gung-cheol's number?

359
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,830
I was.

360
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,470
I'm sure you didn't ask around

361
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,040
just so you could borrow money from him.

362
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,680
What are you getting at?
Stop beating around the bush.

363
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,780
Something happened recently
to Gung-cheol and Jeong-hae.

364
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,220
Because of that,

365
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,490
both of them are probably exhausted.

366
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,760
No, not exhausted, but...

367
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,830
They're in danger.

368
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,400
So?

369
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,730
This is a great opportunity

370
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,270
for you.

371
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,440
That means

372
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,220
it's a great opportunity for you as well.

373
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,120
Which gets me to my point.

374
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,460
How about a proposal?

375
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,960
A proposal?

376
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,110
Are you sure the name was Han Eung-sik?

377
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,810
-I am.
-And it was in 2000.

378
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,620
That right, punk.

379
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,620
There's no case like that.

380
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,350
No? Why not?

381
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,560
Well,

382
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,660
I don't know.

383
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,560
Are you confusing it with another case?

384
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,100
Of all the things to confuse!

385
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,430
How could I forget my own case?
Especially my first murder?

386
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,730
A murder?

387
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,040
It wasn't an accident?

388
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,070
It was closed as an accidental death
due to a brain injury,

389
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,080
but there were several suspicious things.

390
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,840
Look more carefully.

391
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,010
(Search by name: Han Eung-sik)

392
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,050
(Searching)

393
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,750
(No results)
That's odd. Why isn't it here?
(No results)

394
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,950
That's odd. Why isn't it here?

395
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,150
It couldn't have been removed.

396
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,950
Seriously.

397
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,390
This is insane.

398
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,660
Hey, Detective Ji.

399
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,030
Yes?

400
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,330
Find out who was the president
of the Yeongang University drama club.

401
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,170
Get me a list of members too.

402
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,430
The drama club?

403
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,170
Here you go.

404
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,940
Sir. Inquiries for stores are pouring in
ever since the new commercial

405
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,940
with Kim Jun-yeon aired.

406
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,880
That's not important.

407
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,210
Our sales last month was the worst.

408
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,950
How's the barley chicken doing?

409
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,850
We'll have to wait and see,

410
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
but word is getting out.

411
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,390
It's selling consistently.

412
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,630
(Mother)

413
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,060
-Hello, Mother.
(-Gung-cheol.)

414
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,830
Is something wrong?

415
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,000
Detectives came by and asked
all sorts of questions about you.

416
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,470
Detectives?

417
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,210
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

418
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,610
(Are you sure?)

419
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,940
I was so scared.

420
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,910
I'll call you later. I'm a bit busy.

421
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,550
Okay. Go back to work.

422
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,550
I'll let you go.

423
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,580
Okay, bye.

424
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,940
Eat up. I can't guarantee
it tastes good though.

425
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,110
Thank you.

426
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,500
Mi-ra, what do you do for a living?

427
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,200
I'm in movies where I strip.

428
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,640
Movies in which you strip?

429
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,640
Yes. Porn.

430
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,740
I'm a porn star.

431
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,580
You don't need to be so obvious
about being disappointed.

432
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,820
No. I'm not disappointed.

433
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,090
Don't your parents complain
about you doing that?

434
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,730
Leave once you're done eating.

435
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,500
Did I say something wrong?

436
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,030
Some parents

437
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,300
are disappointed with jobs like this,
but some are supportive.

438
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,370
How could they be supportive
of their daughter

439
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,510
stripping in front of a camera?
That's absurd.

440
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,350
-What's wrong with it?
-What?

441
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,550
Acting in porn is a career too.

442
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,080
Playing golf professionally
isn't the only career.

443
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,650
Eat and get lost.

444
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,220
(College of Medicine Gathering)

445
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,330
What's wrong with you?

446
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,060
Get out.

447
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,900
Sorry, doctor.

448
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,600
She wouldn't listen.

449
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,800
Please leave before we get angry.

450
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,470
Let go of me

451
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,410
before I get angry.

452
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,510
What? What was that?

453
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,210
You may go. I know her.

454
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,320
I'll see the next patients in ten minutes.

455
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,780
Okay.

456
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,090
Yes, doctor.

457
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,500
They're so obedient.

458
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,830
Why are you here?

459
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,110
Didn't Gung-cheol tell you?

460
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,980
I took over the bar by your place.

461
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,350
Hey... Jeong-hae.

462
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,620
I have something to tell you.

463
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,320
I heard.

464
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,530
Did you come to tell me that?

465
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,730
Well, that too.

466
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,270
I wanted to see where you worked.

467
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,780
Why do you want to see where I work?

468
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,910
You're hurting my feelings.

469
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,180
We used to be friends at one time.

470
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,090
Do you have nowhere else to go?

471
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,720
Do you have nothing else to do?

472
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,390
No.

473
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,660
I have nowhere to go and nothing to do.

474
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,430
That's why I came here.

475
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,470
To enjoy the rest of my life
with old friends.

476
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,570
Is that a problem?

477
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,210
Do you think

478
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,010
doing this will make my husband
look at you?

479
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,260
He looked at me

480
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,730
for quite a while yesterday.

481
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,530
After 15 years of marriage,

482
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,830
men's hearts flutter a lot

483
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,500
just by having someone like them.

484
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,310
Especially at our age.

485
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,310
When they see a woman
who's passionate and sweet like me

486
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,080
instead of a cold,
arrogant woman like you,

487
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,380
even more so.

488
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,820
Must you do this?

489
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,719
Don't you feel pathetic living like this?

490
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,730
You're the pathetic one.

491
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,760
You're so wary of and on edge around

492
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,070
your husband's first love
from over 20 years ago.

493
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,340
But then again,

494
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm sure you're anxious.

495
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,880
You're the reason
something that horrendous happened.

496
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,550
That's ten minutes.

497
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,490
I'll go. You can get back to work.

498
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,860
Oh, right.

499
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,860
I bought that bar

500
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,160
with the money Gung-cheol lent me.

501
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,740
I guess he didn't tell you that much.

502
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,210
Bye.

503
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,220
-Hello.
-Welcome...

504
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,790
Goodness. Hello, Mr. Ahn.

505
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,530
Goodness, Mr. Ahn. Hello.

506
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,490
-Have you been well?
-Yes, hello.

507
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,460
Oh. Why, hello.

508
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,500
Oh, hello.

509
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,500
I'll get going.

510
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,470
Oh, I...

511
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,140
Why is he leaving in such a hurry?

512
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,010
I didn't even sign the receipt.

513
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,710
-I see.
-Goodness.

514
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,380
-Have this and cool off.
-Thank you.

515
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,690
Anyway, I don't see the part-timer.

516
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,360
Oh, well, recently...

517
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,790
Oh, dear. Today is his day off.

518
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,130
I see. It must be tough these days.

519
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,570
No, it's not tough.
Nothing is tough at all.

520
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,200
We're just grateful we can work.

521
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,710
Goodness. Hello, Mr. Lim.

522
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,740
"Hello"? Hello, my foot.

523
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,850
Hey, you've only been here
for two months, right?

524
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,480
Right, yes.

525
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,150
Yet you're already overdue on your rent,

526
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,690
not just for a day, but two days.

527
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,590
Oh, right, yes. That's...

528
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,490
We were too busy, so we forgot to pay.

529
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,330
I'll transfer it right away. Don't worry.

530
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,030
You should go get some rest.

531
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,570
No, wait. We'll fry up a chicken for you.

532
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Give it to your grandson.

533
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,440
Hey, wait. Forget the chicken.

534
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,970
You'll have to move out
if you don't pay me today.

535
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,310
Do you think
I do my business as a charity?

536
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,050
Unbelievable.

537
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,550
You know, the older I get,

538
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,720
the more forgetful I become.

539
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,790
Go transfer the money.

540
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,700
What are you doing? Hurry up and do it.

541
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,500
Okay, I'll transfer the money.

542
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Good.

543
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,440
Hey, can you check on the rent

544
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,610
for our 1,000th store?

545
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,750
Yes, sir.

546
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,780
(And can you find out)

547
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,690
if there's trouble
with the alcohol company?

548
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,560
-The alcohol company?
(-Yes, I just ran into Mr. Seok)

549
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,160
at the 1,000th store,
and something doesn't feel right.

550
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,730
The CEO of the alcohol company is

551
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,600
old friends with our CEO.

552
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,370
Really? Just in case,

553
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,470
can you find out
where they took out their loans?

554
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,270
(Yes, I'll get to it right now.)

555
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Okay.

556
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,070
Mr. Ahn Gung-cheol?

557
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,880
Mr. Ahn, back in 2000,

558
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,020
you were the president of the drama club
at Yeongang University, right?

559
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,180
I was.

560
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,820
Then you must know about
Professor Han Eung-sik's case.

561
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,300
Mr. Ahn, don't you recognize me?

562
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,040
I was the detective in charge
of Han Eung-sik's case.

563
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,510
Isn't it too uncanny
to call this a coincidence?

564
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,920
What do you want to find out from me?

565
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,250
I wouldn't say I'm here to find anything.

566
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,390
I just came by to check.

567
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,120
Mr. Ahn, you are our key suspect

568
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,360
for the murder of Joo Gang-san
until we catch the killer.

569
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,460
On top of that,
you might hold an important key

570
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,470
to the Han Eung-sik case.

571
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,440
Is that why you visited my parents?

572
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,270
Your parents' statement
about your childhood

573
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,880
can become an important piece of evidence.

574
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,080
I'm warning you.

575
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,010
Leave my family alone.

576
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,280
It's your family now,
but back then, it was your friends.

577
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,550
The ones we couldn't touch.

578
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,390
What?

579
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,830
And that's the main reason
why I suspect you

580
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,360
as the prime suspect of this current case

581
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,560
and that old case.

582
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,970
You are much more obsessed
about protecting people

583
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,770
that you care about

584
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,140
than most people.

585
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,470
Is that wrong?

586
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,580
I wouldn't say it's wrong.

587
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,580
But protecting someone

588
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,550
can be very dangerous.

589
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,620
Jun-wu, stop.

590
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,830
Jun-wu, one second.

591
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,570
Jun-wu, stop. Jun-wu. Jun-wu!

592
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Cut.

593
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,240
Jun-wu, you can't jump on her like that.

594
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,680
It's like carrying ice cream
in the middle of summer very carefully,

595
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,950
-making sure you don't let it--
-What now?

596
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,280
Then should a man and a woman
have a conversation at a hotel?

597
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,020
You two are elementary school friends

598
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,890
who were reunited after 20 years.

599
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,360
Do you want to read the script again?

600
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,130
What nonsense is that? This is just porn.

601
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,330
We have no time.
Let's hurry up and roll. Okay?

602
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,970
We can do this!

603
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,150
Let's begin as soon as you're ready.

604
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,220
-Camera.
-Rolling.

605
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,250
Ready, action.

606
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,160
Jun-wu.

607
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,260
Jun-wu, wait. Jun-wu.

608
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,330
I can't wait.

609
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,460
Jun-wu, wait.

610
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,700
Jun-wu, wait!

611
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Cut!

612
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,540
Mr. Kang.

613
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,210
Mr. Kang!

614
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,620
To Jun-wu,

615
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,420
Yeon-a is his first love
that he met again after 20 years.

616
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,490
You know what a first love means to a man!

617
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,660
Hey, enough is enough!

618
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,670
Who cares about first loves?

619
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,840
You're just subbing today as a gig worker.

620
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,140
Then just shoot the scene and go.
Stop acting like a director!

621
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,410
What?

622
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,480
A gig worker? Acting like a director?

623
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,420
He's such a third-rate actor.
Listen to the way he talks.

624
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,050
Hey, were you talking about me? Were you?

625
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,720
Get lost.

626
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,190
It's humiliating
just to speak with someone like you.

627
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,000
Darn it, I can't believe this rubbish.

628
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,730
I'm not doing this film.

629
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,230
I can't do this!

630
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,670
Wait. Wait!

631
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:12,990
(Reunited with Yeon-a)

632
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,830
Hey, I... I'll go talk to him.
Don't worry about it.

633
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,230
Who says I was worried?

634
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,840
This is absurd.

635
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,610
I knew she was no good.

636
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,480
If you're no good once,
you'll always be no good.

637
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,010
I almost got touched.

638
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,980
Hey, let's eat first.

639
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,250
-Okay.
-All right.

640
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,930
We're all done.
You can clean up and come out.

641
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,660
Yes, doctor.

642
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,900
-I'll see you outside.
-Oh, okay.

643
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,580
It's odd. Why do I get embarrassed

644
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,850
when I take my pants off around him?

645
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,880
So? Did I get any better?

646
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,780
Have you been stretching your piriformis?

647
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,250
Of course, I do it every single night.

648
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
-What about bridge workouts?
-I've been doing that too.

649
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,160
-Why?
-What do you think?

650
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,060
I'm asking to see if you are better.

651
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,600
You're getting better, so don't worry.

652
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,730
I was scared that it got worse.

653
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,170
What's with your back?

654
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,100
I pulled a muscle while hiking.

655
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,340
It isn't improving.

656
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,670
You should've been careful.

657
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,980
It's like you want to be done
living as a man.

658
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,740
Why are you so mean?

659
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,320
Anyway, how are you going to pay
for the bottles tomorrow?

660
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,480
Can you afford it?

661
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,690
While we're on the subject, Jae-hun,

662
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,620
may I borrow your credit card?

663
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,820
I'll work hard to pay you back

664
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,190
over 36 months...
No, wait. I mean, 48 months.

665
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,300
Please send in the next patient.

666
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,430
Jae-hun, please.

667
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,570
Jae-hun.

668
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,840
-Jae-hun.
-Please come out.

669
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,240
Please.

670
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,780
You're so cheap. Fine, I'm leaving!

671
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,110
(Director Jung Jae-hun)
You're so cheap. Fine, I'm leaving!
(Director Jung Jae-hun)

672
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:18,480
Your bag.
(Director Jung Jae-hun)
Your bag.

673
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,800
Among those who were
involved in that case,

674
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,070
there must be someone
who's from an awfully affluent family.

675
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:40,370
I checked KICS and just about everywhere,

676
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,970
(KICS: an information-sharing system
for criminal justice agencies)
I checked KICS and just about everywhere,

677
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:43,400
(KICS: an information-sharing system
for criminal justice agencies)

678
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,040
but the case itself is nonexistent.
(KICS: an information-sharing system
for criminal justice agencies)

679
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,420
Will you please go see a doctor?

680
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,360
No, I don't need to do that.

681
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,460
Father.

682
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,430
You couldn't even eat for days.

683
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,660
Why are you so stubborn?

684
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,760
You need to get up
and go to the hospital with me.

685
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,370
There's no need to go to the hospital
for skipping meals for a few days.

686
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,710
Don't fret and go back to Seoul now.

687
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,440
Did you call him?

688
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,850
Have you gone senile, woman?

689
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,150
Why are you so immature?

690
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,520
Why would I call him? It wasn't me.

691
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,300
Don't let him get to you.

692
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,570
Your grandmother died during surgery
at the hospital.

693
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,310
He has been horrified of hospitals
ever since that time.

694
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,510
That happened ages ago.

695
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,250
And it'll be tough on you if he falls ill.

696
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,120
It's all right with me.

697
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,390
I just have to make porridge
and massage him all night long.

698
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,720
You haven't been here in a while.
Sorry he wasn't nicer.

699
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,500
Go out to eat with your friends.

700
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,030
Goodness, no.

701
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,500
Jeong-hae already gives us
a lot of money every month.

702
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:25,000
And call me if anything happens. Okay?

703
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,230
Gung-cheol, are you sure
everything is all right?

704
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,800
Everything is fine,
so don't worry and go inside.

705
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:55,070
All right, then. Drive safely.
Have a safe trip.

706
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,700
-Okay?
-Okay.

707
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,080
(Hae-suk)

708
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,020
-Hey, Hae-suk.
(-Hey, Gung-cheol.)

709
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,460
I have a favor to ask of you.

710
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,820
Do you have some time tonight?

711
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,960
Tonight?

712
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,930
I'm out of town right now.

713
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,400
It'll take me a while to get there.

714
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,270
Is it urgent?

715
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,800
I heard
you two studied together in the US.

716
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,310
We had no idea,

717
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,310
but we ran into each other
at the school cafeteria.

718
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,940
But nothing happened between you two?

719
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,550
People tend to hook up
out of loneliness when they're abroad.

720
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,520
I was busy studying.

721
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,490
There was a professor there
who was stingy with grades

722
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,590
just like you, Professor Na.

723
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,120
Goodness.

724
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:29,730
You can't study all the time
just because of a tough professor.

725
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,200
You should challenge yourself.

726
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,070
Well, figures. I'm a fool
to expect romance from you two.

727
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,310
I'm sorry we didn't
meet your expectation, Professor.

728
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,640
Goodness. All right, now.
There's nothing much to life.

729
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,080
Since we've been following our heads,

730
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,250
let's follow our hearts from now on.

731
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,780
-Okay? Remember that.
-You're right.

732
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,850
All right, everyone. Glasses up. Cheers!

733
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,920
Cheers!

734
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,990
-Cheers, professor.
-Cheers.

735
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,530
Cheers. Goodness.

736
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:02,590
(Mother)

737
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,430
My gosh, that's it. That's good.
(Mother)

738
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,030
(Mother)

739
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,730
-Thanks.
-Of course.

740
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,040
As people get older,
we have a tougher time digesting,

741
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,110
and our bodies begin to break down
here and there.

742
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,480
So please let Gung-cheol know

743
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,350
that your father-in-law is fine.

744
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,450
Okay?

745
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,950
All right. I'll do that, Mother.

746
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,420
Don't worry.

747
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,650
(Yes, right. And Jeong-hae.)

748
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,750
Yes?

749
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,760
No, never mind. You should get some rest.

750
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,530
Okay, bye now.

751
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,330
All right. Goodbye, Mother.

752
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,500
(Goodbye.)

753
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,840
Why didn't you tell me
you were with Jeong-hae in the US?

754
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,710
Why do I have to tell you that?

755
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,710
I'm going on a blind date this weekend.

756
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,410
Go on a blind date. Get married.

757
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,650
You don't need to tell me.

758
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,350
I guess I'm just someone you sleep with.

759
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,950
If you don't want to do it, just stop.

760
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,780
What kind of man is that petty?

761
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,920
I apologized for an hour,
but he still wouldn't accept it.

762
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,850
Why was I there
apologizing to that good-for-nothing?

763
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,050
I'm too humiliated to keep living.

764
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,260
That's why you should have
begged Mr. Park to keep you on.

765
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,790
Why did you fight him?

766
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,600
You can't always direct a film
with a ten-billion won budget.

767
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,700
Stop rubbing salt on my wound.

768
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,900
It's not like I wanted to fight him.

769
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,270
You try living with a woman
with a fiery temper. Give it a try!

770
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,240
Darn it, why did she have to join us?

771
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,510
My gosh. This is awfully frustrating.

772
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,080
Isn't it fun when it's sweet?

773
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,450
You don't even care when it's sweet.

774
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,450
-You're right.
-Sit here.

775
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,810
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

776
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,950
All right, now.

777
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,590
Hey, aren't you Hyeong-u?

778
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,390
Hey, man. It's been a while.

779
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,230
What brings you here? Grab a seat.

780
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,630
I had a table read with the actors
at an office nearby.

781
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,730
A historical film
with a 20-billion won budget.

782
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,900
But they're all still rookies,
so they're too stiff.

783
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,540
I wanted to help them relax.

784
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,240
Darn it, man. Why do you need
20 billion won to shoot a film?

785
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,750
You don't know much about commercial films
because you only make adult films.

786
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,750
These days,
the budget starts at 20 billion won.

787
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,950
Do you only need
about 100 million won to make adult films?

788
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,060
Right, we only need about 100 million won.

789
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,800
Do you want a smoke?

790
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,700
No one smokes these days.

791
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,770
I thought you might starve to death

792
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,170
rather than taking that path.

793
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,670
Right, guys. Everyone, come and say hi.

794
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,840
This is Director Cho Hyeong-u.

795
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,710
Let's see.
He's the Bong Joon-ho of adult films.

796
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,250
Adult films?

797
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,980
-Hello.
-Hello.

798
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,220
Hello.

799
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,460
Hyeong-u, I'll pay your tab.
Eat as much as you want.

800
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,930
Hey, forget it, man.

801
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,430
I'll pay for you.
You can order whatever you want.

802
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,830
Gosh, don't pretend like you're so tough.

803
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,100
Just eat as much as you want. Okay?

804
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,670
Excuse me, I'll pay for this table
and this one.

805
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
All right.

806
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,410
Ma'am!

807
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,840
I'll take the most expensive dish!

808
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,620
Gyeong-ja!

809
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:50,520
Please stop, sir.

810
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,160
Gyeong-ja...

811
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,030
Wait, sir. Let's talk outside.

812
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,630
Where are you, Gyeong-ja?

813
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:57,830
Gyeong-ja!

814
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,930
Honey, what's with you?

815
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,430
Let me go!

816
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,730
-My goodness!
-My gosh!

817
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,100
-What is this mess?
-I'm... I'm so sorry.

818
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,570
-You little...
-Oh man!

819
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,640
Hold him.

820
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,740
-What are you doing?
-Over there.

821
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
Take him over there. Be careful.

822
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,350
Hey, let me go.

823
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,680
-Hey.
-Over there.

824
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,520
Darn you! Let me go!

825
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,080
-In here.
-Hey.

826
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,950
Darn you. Who are you?

827
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,420
-Put him down.
-You little jerk.

828
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,860
-Hey, man!
-My gosh.

829
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,560
Let me go!

830
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,030
My goodness.

831
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,430
-My gosh.
-Oh, dear.

832
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,300
Hey, you! Come here!

833
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,230
-Hey!
-Where did you get so wasted?

834
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,930
Where?

835
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,310
-Darn it.
-Do you want something to drink?

836
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,180
-Have you eaten?
-Darn it.

837
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,320
Hey. Kang Gyeong-ja.

838
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,250
Stop pretending like
you're such a big shot.

839
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,490
My life is

840
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,360
such a huge mess

841
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,870
all because

842
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,470
of you.

843
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,070
Got that?

844
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,150
What do you mean?

845
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,650
If only you hadn't done that back then

846
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,750
to that jerk,

847
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,390
I could've directed that movie.

848
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,470
I even let that scumbag

849
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,940
grab me by my collar.

850
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:51,910
Life really stinks.

851
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,810
Hey.

852
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,850
Kang Gyeong-ja.

853
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,820
All of this

854
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,620
is because of you.

855
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,560
Got it?

856
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,230
It's your fault.

857
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,000
It's your fault.

858
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,240
Gosh. Thank you all for making time
in your busy schedules.

859
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,240
-Thank you.
-It was nice.

860
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,480
I'll go first.

861
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,450
-Get back safely.
-Okay.

862
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,280
-Get home safely.
-Goodnight.

863
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,280
-Get home safely, professor.
-Bye.

864
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,450
Goodnight.

865
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:41,490
Hey.

866
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,400
Another drink?

867
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,160
-Come on.
-Let's go.

868
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,330
Bye.

869
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,770
Did you call a driver?

870
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,170
Let's talk.

871
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,740
It won't take long.

872
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,690
Hey. You got here quick.

873
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,460
What's the favor?

874
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,400
What's the rush? Catch your breath first.

875
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:54,670
Okay.

876
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,400
Drink this.

877
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,180
Thanks.

878
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,710
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

879
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,230
I asked her to make it strong.
Tell me if it's too weak.

880
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,170
Thanks.

881
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,450
What did you want to tell me?

882
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,820
What was that

883
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,260
yesterday?

884
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,260
The golf outing?

885
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,100
It was unexpected for me as well.

886
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,170
Are you saying
you didn't know I'd be there?

887
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,930
Are you saying I asked her

888
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,470
to arrange it so that I can see you?

889
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,870
I can't read you.

890
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,110
Why do you want to?

891
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,980
Jae-hun.

892
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,480
You ignored my feelings
and did as you pleased.

893
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,850
But now, you can't read me?

894
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,250
I'm the one who can't read you, Jeong-hae.

895
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,800
It was over 15 years ago.

896
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,600
Do you still hate me?

897
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,240
The thing about time is,

898
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,650
whereas it dulls your feels,

899
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,120
it sharpens them as well.

900
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,290
For me, it's the latter.

901
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,690
So?

902
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,360
Do you plan to stab me?

903
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,560
Sadly, that sharp emotion

904
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,000
is pointed at me. It's extremely painful.

905
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,340
It gets worse with the passing of time.

906
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,950
Things must be hard enough for you.
Don't mind someone like me.

907
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,750
Do I look like...

908
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,950
I'm having a hard time?

909
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,760
I'm sorry there's nothing
I can do for you.

910
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,530
I'll go now.

911
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,920
So, connect this to this here.

912
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,290
That's all?

913
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,220
Wait. Watch me.

914
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,090
You see this here?

915
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,160
Stick that in and twist. See that?

916
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,100
And then...

917
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:15,970
Here. Then you connect this.

918
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,840
-Try it.
-I see.

919
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,510
Why can't I do it?

920
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,680
Like this?

921
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,740
And...

922
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,810
No. This way.

923
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,920
Lock it in place. Good.

924
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,560
So... You're married, right?

925
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:52,340
What did you say
your husband did for a living?

926
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,740
How... How old are your kids?

927
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,240
How many do you have?

928
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,260
Gung-cheol. Do you remember

929
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,860
when I visited you
while you were in the army?

930
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,600
You were really nervous back then too.

931
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,170
You pulled off a button on my blouse
while trying to undo it.

932
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,680
Thinking back, we were so naive
and clumsy back then.

933
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,150
But then again, it was the first time

934
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,150
for both you and me.

935
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,270
Oh, no.

936
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,340
Are you okay?

937
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,310
-Sorry.
-I'm okay. I'll do it.

938
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,410
Stay still. I'll do it.

939
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,250
Oh, no.

940
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:12,950
Sorry.

941
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,220
Gung-cheol.

942
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:23,960
Why

943
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,870
do you think I came here?

944
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,370
Actually, I came to take you away

945
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,740
from Jeong-hae.

946
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,690
Jeong-hae.

947
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,100
(In the Mood for Love)

948
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,210
Are you insane?
How could you lend her money?

949
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,320
She said she'd pay me back
in a few months.

950
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,250
How could I turn my back on a friend?

951
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,850
A friend?

952
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,620
Since when was Hae-suk your friend?

953
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,520
How could you say that?
She was always my friend.

954
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,360
If not, what was she?

955
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,330
Where did you get

956
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,000
that money?

957
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,240
So...

958
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,010
I borrowed it from Jae-hun.

959
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,480
He did nothing wrong.

960
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,220
He refused to lend it to me
because he didn't want you to hate him,

961
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,350
but I begged and coerced him.

962
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,360
Did Hae-suk seem that desperate?

963
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,090
Enough for you to beg and coerce him?

964
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,160
I would've done the same for anyone.

965
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,230
You know that's how I am.

966
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,300
I'll ask you just one question.
Answer me honestly.

967
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,300
Ask me anything.
I'll tell you anything honestly.

968
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:16,410
You've been seeing Hae-suk
all this time, haven't you?

969
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,740
You found that bar for her, didn't you?

970
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:21,210
What? I never even saw her
other than the day

971
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:22,810
she asked to borrow money.

972
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,980
Liar!

973
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,000
-What's this?
-Look for yourself.

974
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,730
It's you and Hae-suk!

975
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,570
Gung-cheol.

976
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,550
You've been in touch with her
all this time.

977
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,320
You found that bar for her.

978
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,620
That's not true.

979
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,120
Yes, it is!

980
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,120
I was upset because of those pictures.

981
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,420
That's why I went to drink alone.

982
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,630
That's why that horrendous thing happened.

983
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,270
Jeong-hae.

984
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,700
Who sent you these pictures?

985
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:20,770
Who cares about that right now?

986
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,870
It's important.

987
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:25,940
Who sent you these pictures?
