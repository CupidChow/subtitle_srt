our wedding plans.

7
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,670
Why?

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,370
I don't think...

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,980
I'll be happy with you.

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,720
I never promised you happiness.

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,750
If that's your reason, I can't accept it.

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm in love with someone else.

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,690
I couldn't get in touch with you
for a month,

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,560
and now you say you're in love?

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,900
Are you kidding me? You fell in love?

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,740
You?

17
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,070
Why?

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,940
Can't I fall in love with someone?

19
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,039
No.

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,850
For years, I stayed by your side.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,580
I saw only you and loved only you,
but you didn't love me.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,950
But you love someone else?

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,620
And a punk you've known for only a month?

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,060
It only takes three seconds
to fall in love.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,270
It's the same as thunder and lightning.

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,900
Forget that.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,240
We didn't have this conversation.

28
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,009
I'm going to marry him.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,050
He made me...

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,620
want to live for the first time.

31
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,390
I don't want to lose him.

32
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,170
Are you trying to drive me mad?

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,700
You may go mad,

34
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,810
but I may die.

35
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,940
Goodbye.

What are you doing here?

38
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,400
The hotel was too suffocating,
so I picked the lock.

39
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,700
Are you insane?

40
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,500
This is trespassing. Don't you know that?

41
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,240
Then call the cops on me.

42
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,840
I have a lot to say too.

43
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,710
Gosh, I'm so tired.

-You need to see this!
-What?

69
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,360
Baek Hae-suk is dating Professor Han.

70

-What?
-I knew it.

71
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,659
That's why she always looked down on us.

72
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,159
She was haughty
because she had Professor Han on her side.

-Exactly.
-Tell me about it.

74
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,270
She's so shameless.
How can she seduce a married man?

75

Isn't she totally creepy?

I knew he'd be the type of senior
who'd do that.

96
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,590
A senior? Whatever.

97
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,220
I'm embarrassed that a fraud like him
even went to our school.

98
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,630
Ji-uk is probably the only guy
who thinks of him as a senior.

99

Hey, he once set me up on a blind date,

100
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,630
and I got completely humiliated.

101
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,000
She was awfully difficult
just because she's kind of cute.

102
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,300
She's only a porn star.

103
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,370
Wait, was it Kang Mi-ra?

104

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,410
Man, he set you up with her too?

106
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,380
Man, that brat.
She's from the same orphanage as him.

107
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,990
He set me up with her once too.
I tried so hard to get somewhere with her,

108
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,690
but she never caved.

109
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,560
She thinks she's too good.

110
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,390
Let's drink.

111
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,260
Don't your parents complain
about you doing that?

112
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,630
Did I say something wrong?

113
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,640
Some parents

114
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,770
are disappointed with jobs like this,
but some are supportive.

115
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,410
I have to go.

116
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,020
Hey, Ji-uk, where are you going?

117
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,140
The reason why

118
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,040
I looked glum that day...

119
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,580
wasn't because

120
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,080
I was disappointed in you,
but because I was reminded of my mom.

121
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,020
My mom is

122
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,990
also a porn star.

123
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,160
So please don't take it the wrong way.

124
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,630
And I'm sorry I mentioned your parents
like that.

125
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,670
Of course, they could support you.

126
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,040
I didn't think that through.

127
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,110
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,280
I'll get going now.

129
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,650
Why are you so nice?

130
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,220
Pardon?

131
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,660
What am I anyway?

132
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,590
I'm not even that important.

133
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,730
You could've just ignored
whether I misunderstood or not.

134
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,270
Why did you come
all the way here to apologize?

135
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
How can I just ignore you?

136
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,640
You're the first person
I gave my heart to.

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,980
Don't cry.

138
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,920
You shouldn't cry

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,120
over someone like me.

140
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Don't leave any and finish it all.

141
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,940
That way, you'll feel better.

142
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,350
Thanks.

143
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,980
Where's Yu-bin?

144
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,620
He's at school.

145
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,290
Oh, really?

146
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,760
Try to eat some more.

147
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,360
I can't seem to eat anymore.

148
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,500
Honey, could you make
a cup of coffee for me?

151
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,090
Do you have some time
to have a chat with me?

152
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,870
Yesterday was the anniversary
of your mother's death, right?

153
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,800
How did you know?

154
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,300
Jae-hun told me.

155
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,540
He said you told him
at the gathering the night before.

156
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,810
Don't worry about it.

157
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,490
How could I not?

158
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,890
How could I, your husband, not know

159
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,860
when your mother passed away
when Jae-hun does?

160
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,230
You didn't tell me a thing
about your family.

161
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,060
You even told me not to ask anything.

162
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,970
Do you know how much
I wanted to hear those things?

163
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,830
How could you do that?

164
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,700
It's not important.

165
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,540
If it were, I would've told you already.

166
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,180
I'm running late. I have to go.

167
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,250
Jeong-hae.

168
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,720
Are you keeping anything else from me?

169
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,030
What do you want to know?

170
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,530
I just...

171
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,500
wonder what I mean to you.

172
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,730
I've been skeptical lately.

173
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,830
Skeptical?

174
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,440
Why are you skeptical about that?

175
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,040
Is it because of Hae-suk?

176
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,350
Why are you bringing her up now?

177
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,880
Why do you hate her so much?
You used to be the best of friends.

178
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,490
The best of friends?

179
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,690
If we're best friends,

180
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,660
must I still keep being friends,
knowing my husband is in love with her?

181
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,030
Who says I'm in love with her?

182
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,960
Please stop being irrational.

183
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,330
Stop lying.

184
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,470
You must've forgotten
what I do for a living.

185
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,800
I know what you're thinking

186
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,000
just from the look in your eyes
and the sound of your breath.

187
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,110
Aren't you the one lying?

188
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,340
What?

189
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,480
I...

190
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,510
went to the nursing home
in Hongcheon yesterday.

191
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,350
I met that woman

192
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,790
Do-hae there.

193
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,490
I saw

194
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,960
Professor Koo Yeong-seon there.

195
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,530
And her caretaker is Do-hae.

196
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,470
She told me

197
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,510
that Man-sik looked after Professor Koo.

198
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,810
So?

199
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,780
Why is that a problem?

200
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,180
You said he was depressed,

201
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,620
so you suggested that nursing home to him
as a sort of therapy.

202
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,590
So how is the wife

203
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,890
of Professor Han Eung-sik
who died 20 years ago

204
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,160
at that nursing home?

205
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,400
It was a coincidence.

206
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,270
A coincidence?

207
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,340
Is there a reason why
Man-sik couldn't look after Professor Koo?

208
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,710
He wanted to feel fulfilled
by caring for someone,

209
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,280
and that happened to be Professor Koo.

210
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,550
Why are you nitpicking?

211
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm going to work.

212
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,500
(Bang Geon-a)

213
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,240
-Hey. What's up?
(-I have bad news.)

214
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,010
Mr. Yang conspired with
the alcohol company

215
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,310
and took out crazy amounts of loans
in the shopowners' names.

216
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,720
Ta-da.

217
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,860
Eat up.

218
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,630
They're low fat,
so you may not like it though.

219
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,100
Leave while I'm being nice.

220
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,860
I won't leave even if you're mean.

221
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,970
What's wrong with you?
Why should you stay here?

222
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,140
Why can't I stay here?

223
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
You and I are divorced.

224
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,140
We're strangers now.

225
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,970
Neither of our parents know that.

226
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,140
Why you...

227
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,210
-I'm uncomfortable.
-I'm comfortable.

228
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

229
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,020
I won't stay long.

230
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,450
Just until I find a place that I like.

231
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,520
Okay?

232
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,860
Come on. Okay?

233
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,800
Use the guest room and stay out of mine.

234
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,730
Okay. Anything else?

235
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,330
Be quiet. Like you're not here.

236
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,440
Deal. I'll be like a corpse,
so don't you fret.

237
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,450
(I hear your son
is a professional golfer.)

238
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,720
Then you must be pretty good too.

239
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,890
Hey. Let's go golfing sometime.

240
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,490
(I'm not that bad.)

241
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,560
Darn it. I should've learned sooner.

242
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,430
He left early to practice.

243
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
He did?

244
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,110
That's more like it. Now, that's my son.

245
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,410
What? Does your first love
want to go golfing?

246
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,750
What do you mean?
My shoulder has been stiff lately.

247
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,320
I don't know what's wrong.

248
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,890
And she isn't my first love.

249
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,860
She doesn't look like a killer.

250
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,560
A killer? Who?

251
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,030
Your first love.

252
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,230
Didn't she kill a professor and disappear?

253
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,700
That's just a rumor.

254
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,870
Anyway, I'm warning you.

255
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,940
That bar is banned.

256
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,810
I don't want to go either.

257
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,310
I had no choice because the guys begged.

258
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,380
I won't be going anymore.
Not unless we gather there.

259
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,560
Did you have fun with the ladies?

260
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,160
It was crazy fun.

261
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,830
You should've just hung out alone then.

262
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,260
Why did you have to show up there
and kill the mood?

263
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,340
Sweetie, where's the hammer?
I think this is bent.

264
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,140
I have a call.

265
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,470
(Jang-hwan)

266
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,440
Hey, what's up?

267
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,040
Hyeong-u, I've got big news.

268
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,610
I just met with Mr. Park.

269
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,480
He wants to work with you again.

270
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,920
What? What do you mean?

271
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,520
That rat? Really?

272
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,060
I'll drop Pu-reum off at kindergarten.

273
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,600
Really? Are you sure?

274
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,970
What if someone calls you
her grandfather again?

275
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,770
I think I look pretty good.

276
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
Okay, hurry up.

277
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,240
Pu-reum, Daddy says
he'll take you to kindergarten today.

278
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,210
-Okay.
-Okay.

279
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,690
Pu-reum, let's go with Daddy today.

280
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,750
Okay.

281
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,020
Have a nice day!

282
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,860
Pu-reum! Be good
and listen to your teachers!

283
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,730
Make sure to eat all your food!

284
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,280
Honey! Stop! Oh my gosh!

285
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,610
Oh my gosh. Honey!

286
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,820
Is it fun?

287
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,460
Honey!

288
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,320
Stop!

289
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,330
Darn it.

290
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,960
Oh, no.

291
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,830
Oh, no.

292
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,030
Hi.

293
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
Hi.

294
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,540
Play well with your friends.

295
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,180
Eat all your food.

296
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,580
-Okay.
-Okay.

297
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,080
Hi.

298
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,920
-Oh my gosh.
-Hello.

299
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,120
Oh my gosh!

300
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,750
Oh my gosh.

301
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,090
Daddy...

302
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,530
-Daddy...
-Oh my gosh.

303
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,860
Daddy...

304
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Daddy...

305
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,100
Oh my gosh.

306
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,140
Honey!

307
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,870
Honey! Your pants! Honey!

308
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,310
Hey.

309
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,110
Hello.

310
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,280
Daddy...

311
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,890
Hello. Get on the bus.

312
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,250
-Hey!
-Go on.

313
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,020
-Pu-reum.
-What?

314
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,590
Oh my gosh.

315
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,730
Pu-reum. It's okay.

316
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,760
-Seriously.
-Mommy.

317
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,530
It's okay, Pu-reum.

318
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,440
-No, it's okay.
-Daddy's going to work now.

319
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,140
-Pu-reum, look at Daddy.
-Seriously.

320
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,110
Let's go. It's over.

321
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,810
Let's go.

322
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,040
(High-Five Chicken)
Let's go.
(High-Five Chicken)

323
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,180
Mr. Ahn, cut me some slack.
(High-Five Chicken)

324
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,750
Mr. Ahn, cut me some slack.

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,880
(Liquor Vendor Support Loan)
Mr. Ahn, cut me some slack.
(Liquor Vendor Support Loan)

326
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,650
A liquor vendor loan?
(Liquor Vendor Support Loan)

327
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,050
(Liquor Vendor Support Loan)
How could you do this?
(Liquor Vendor Support Loan)

328
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,480
How could you do this?

329
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,450
This is a serious crime.

330
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,690
What if word of this gets out?

331
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,990
High-Five Chicken

332
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,860
will be kicked out of the industry
immediately.

333
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,330
I'm borrowing money from here and there.

334
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
I'll pay it all back in a week.

335
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,560
I'll tell the chairman.

336
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,230
-Wait.
-What's wrong with you?

337
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,840
Are you trying to kill me?

338
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,470
Our shopowners were either
forced to retire or left their jobs,

339
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,540
and put in their life savings

340
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,580
to start their stores
to start a new life for themselves.

341
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
But you defrauded them!

342
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,380
This is fraud!

343
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,580
I said I'll pay them back.

344
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,120
I will. I promise!

345
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,390
I've turned a blind eye to many things,
but not this.

346
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,590
-Hey. Mr. Ahn!
-Sir.

347
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,890
Hey!

348
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,170
What should we do?

349
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,040
Maybe you should tell the chairman first--

350
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,570
Why you...

351
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,190
Sir. What did Mr. Yang say?

352
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,100
He says he'll take care of them
right away, so let's give him a few days.

353
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,930
It looks like it didn't affect
the credit ratings

354
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,400
of the shopowners.

355
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,970
Seriously. He's got guts.

356
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,470
How could he even think of doing that?

357
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,980
Don't talk about it to anyone.
We don't want people finding out.

358
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,310
Of course.

359
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,020
I look great.

360
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,890
Wait. What if he gets upset
because I look too good?

361
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,560
Should I just wear jeans?

362
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,860
No.

363
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,100
It's a business meeting.
I should wear a suit.

364
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,540
Hyeong-u.

365
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,710
Say what you want,
and request what you want, okay?

366
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,210
Not a chance.

367
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,010
I'm going to crawl and beg if he wants.

368
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,010
I'll swallow my pride whole,

369
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,720
and make this happen
even if I'm struck by lightning.

370
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,780
Are you that happy?

371
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,020
Of course, I am.

372
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,760
The scenario for this movie is awesome.

373
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,790
Gyeong-ja. You can rely on your husband.

374
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,200
I'll let you live in luxury
for the remaining 50 years of your life.

375
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,900
Oh, no. I'm late. Bye.

376
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,430
(Let go of me! What are you doing?)

377
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,730
Hey.

378
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,700
How many times did I tell you to behave?

379
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,970
I told you. It'll be a piece of cake
to kill you with no one knowing.

380
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,000
I'll be the one to end it if I want.

381
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,170
How dare you say you want to end it?

382
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,080
Get off of me! Get off, you dirty pervert!

383
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,910
Why you...

384
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,860
Get over here.

385
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,920
What is it?

386
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,270
It's 50 million won.

387
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,510
The money you lent my husband.

388
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,540
He got caught already?

389
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,780
What...

390
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,920
were you thinking
when you lent that to him?

391
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,120
Who knows?

392
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,390
What do you think I was thinking?

393
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,760
How would I know what you're thinking?

394
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,430
Your eyes say you know,
but your lips say you don't.

395
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,130
It feels silly being honest.

396
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,200
I'll assume it was
because of your friendship with him.

397
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,240
It wasn't friendship.

398
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,110
Do you think I'd lend out money
because of friendship?

399
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,850
Especially to your husband, Gung-cheol,
of all people.

400
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,000
What are you trying to say?

401
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,400
I knew you'd figure it out.

402
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,500
So why did I lend that money to him?

403
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,640
Did you dump me to marry a guy
who doesn't even have 50 million won?

404
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,510
Especially for a loser
who begs and pleads to his friend

405
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,680
to borrow money

406
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,020
for his first love behind his wife's back?

407
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,990
That's what I wanted to say.

408
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,960
No matter how much of a loser
my husband may be,

409
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,270
it's better than someone
as cold-blooded as you.

410
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,730
Cold-blooded.

411
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,170
I never expected to hear that from you.

412
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,080
What about you?

413
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,910
You ruthlessly dumped the man
you had promised to marry.

414
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,080
Yet, you're doing just fine

415
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,320
and don't look even slightly phased by it.
Do you think you're warm?

416
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,490
You do everything you want.

417
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,160
Don't talk like you've lived your life
missing me.

418
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,860
Then what?

419
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,700
Did you want me to be devoted to you
for the rest of my life? Is that it?

420
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,070
Freak.

421
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,070
You don't realize it was your delusions

422
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
that made me sick of you, do you?

423
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,140
Is my loving you a delusion?

424
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,310
Love?

425
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,720
That isn't love, it's an obsession.

426
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,190
I'm begging you. Please snap out of it.

427
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,020
The moment I snap out of it,

428
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,130
your life may become miserable, Jeong-hae.

429
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,670
Did you say your sharpened emotions

430
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,230
are pointed at you?

431
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,840
How can you love anyone
if you can't control your own feelings?

432
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,970
You never intended to love me.

433
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,680
You simply needed
a target for your resentment and rage,

434
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,010
and I was chosen, that's all.

435
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,320
Are you done?

436
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,750
You're sorry you can't help?

437
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,090
Don't you dare

438
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,960
do anything stupid
to me or my husband again.

439
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,430
Got that?

440
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,050
Seriously...

441
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,580
(Vegetables and Fruit,
Employee in charge: Ahn Gung-cheol)

442
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,520
I know it's expensive,
(Vegetables and Fruit,
Employee in charge: Ahn Gung-cheol)

443
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,390
but all of your ingredients
must be from Korea.

444
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,220
And you must personally confirm
the source,

445
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,630
especially for chili powder and garlic.

446
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,300
Of course. It's not like I have a choice.

447
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,800
You come and check thoroughly every week.

448
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,670
I can't just wing it.

449
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,210
You do a good job even if I don't come.

450
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,910
When I tell myself that my kids
and grandkids are eating it,

451
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,150
I can't be reckless with it.

452
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,310
I wish everyone in the food industry

453
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,750
was like you, sir.

454
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,290
I'll get going now.

455
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,450
(High-Five Chicken)
I'll get going now.
(High-Five Chicken)

456
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,920
Mr. Ahn.
(High-Five Chicken)

457
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,620
(High-Five Chicken)

458
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,430
It's good to work and all,
but take care of your health too.

459
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,090
I take very good care of my health.

460
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,670
Come on. Your face says you don't.
That's why I'm saying this.

461
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,000
I see.

462
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,310
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

463
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,470
You too.

464
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,660
(Gather at Hae-suk's tonight at 7 p.m.
My treat.)

465
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,000
-Hello, sir.
-Hi, Director Cho.

466
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,000
Sit down.

467
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,310
Sir. I'm really sorry about last time.

468
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,980
My wife has a hot temper
and loses all control.

469
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,910
That's why you're here.
Because she loses all control.

470
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,020
Pardon?

471
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,290
Well, I'm not blameless either,

472
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,190
so let's not bring up that night.

473
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,590
Thank you.

474
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,790
Did you get the scenario?

475
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,160
Yes. Jang-hwan emailed it to me,
so I read it right away.

476
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,500
Sir. I enjoyed it tremendously.
It was insanely fun.

477
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,230
You have a great eye.

478
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,400
Let's sign the contract next week

479
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,240
and get started right away.

480
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,570
Thank you, sir!

481
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,010
I'll really do my best!

482
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,679
I'll put my life on the line! Thank you!

483
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,310
It's not even the holiday season.
You don't have to bow to me.

484
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,580
-Get up, will you?
-Thank you, sir!

485
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,940
Man-sik.

486
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,139
Have you been well?

487
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:40,840
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

488
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,179
Man-sik, you know what?
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

489
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,780
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

490
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,010
Hae-suk showed up.

491
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,880
She took

492
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,449
O.W. over.

493
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,560
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

494
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,400
(Man-sik.)

495
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,810
Let me use your pen.

496
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,840
My pen? Okay.

497
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,380
Did something good happen today?

498
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,820
No.

499
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,360
No, something is definitely up.

500
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,760
What is it?

501
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,730
-Never mind.
-Come on!

502
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,270
What is it? What?

503
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,340
-Actually, Gung-cheol.
-Yes?

504
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,600
I am

505
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,270
in love with a woman.

506
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,980
What?

507
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,150
There's a dead person here.

508
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,010
It's the humanities building
of Yeongang University.

509
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,350
Professor Han Eung-sik's office. Yes.

510
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,620
Please come in a hurry.

511
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,720
Yes.

512
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,960
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

513
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,650
You really cherished that pen.

514
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,780
I finally got to give it back.

515
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,650
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

516
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
What would've happened...

517
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,420
if...

518
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,930
I had turned myself in back then?

519
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,240
Then I wouldn't be this tormented now.

520
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,010
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

521
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,050
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,120
I'm sorry.

523
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,990
Man-sik.

524
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,770
I mean...

525
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Ae-ra, come on.

526
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,010
This isn't an art film
or a commercial film.

527
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,610
(The Witness of Reunion)
This isn't an art film
or a commercial film.

528
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,980
It's just a film where people get naked.

529
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,610
If it's just a film of naked people,
do you disregard the emotions

530
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,080
and film it however you want?

531
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,280
If you continue to be like this,

532
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,950
Director Yoon wants to
take his hands off of this film too.

533
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,190
I'm glad.

534
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,890
How can he direct a film
if he hasn't even read the script?

535
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,560
You might as well bring back
Director Cho then.

536
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,730
"Director Cho"?

537
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,030
Wait, you mean Cho Hyeong-u?

538
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,200
He's really annoying,
but he'd be better than this.

539
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,370
Anyway, please tell him
that I'm not starring in this film

540
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
unless the script is revised.

541
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,240
Please excuse me, then.

542
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,440
Wait, Ae-ra. Ae-ra? Na Ae-ra.

543
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,550
That... That rude brat.

544
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,720
Mi-ra, over here.

545
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,690
You're here.

546
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,830
(She seriously thinks
she's a huge celebrity.)

547
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,970
She can be a bit rude,

548
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,070
but you won't find
another actress like her in this field.

549
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,610
Did you two plan this?

550
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,440
Plan what?

551
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,180
Ae-ra also said you're the best director.

552
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,480
You're both complimenting each other.

553
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,520
Gosh, having been through thick and thin
with someone really is scary.

554
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,150
My goodness.

555
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,390
That rude brat really said that?

556
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,490
Man, she is a good judge of character.

557
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
My gosh.

558
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,700
Did you eat something weird?

559
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,830
Why are you grinning like an idiot?

560
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,830
You know, the whole world looks
absolutely beautiful to me right now.

561
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,370
You look even hotter than
Won Bin right now.

562
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,940
What's with you? Did I do something?

563
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,810
I'm directing a film.

564
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,650
You know the one that fell through
with 10-billion won budget.

565
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,380
What? Really? Are you serious?

566
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,520
-You're filming that again?
-Yes.

567
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,720
How? You said you'll never see him again.

568
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,120
I was going to do that,

569
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,090
but he said it had to be me,

570
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,560
so I accepted reluctantly.

571
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,760
It's better to go with the flow.

572
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,600
All right!

573
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,800
You made a great decision.
Congratulations, Hyeong-u!

574
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,070
Hey, you seem very happy.

575
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,470
Of course, I'm happy!

576
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,870
So while we're on the topic,

577
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,170
do you remember the part that I shot?

578
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,640
Can you pay me the front money...
I mean, the money for my part-time gig?

579
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,680
What? Oh, yes, of course, I will.

580
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,120
One second. Okay, wait one second.

581
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,790
This is all I have.

582
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,660
It's not much. I'm sorry.

583
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,100
Don't be sorry. I'm grateful.

584
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,830
I'll buy drinks
when I get paid for the film.

585
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Okay!

586
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,570
Why are you filming this? It's so tacky.

587
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,400
(My Lover's Women)
Why are you filming this? It's so tacky.

588
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,410
Bye.

589
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,410
Wait, that rude jerk.

590
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,040
It's a good story.

591
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,820
What is this? I slaved away for hours.

592
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,560
Darn it, why did I drop this?

593
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,470
What's going on here?

594
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,510
-Dad.
-Yes?

595
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,740
Isn't my girlfriend pretty?

596
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,010
Mi-ra, isn't my dad cool?

597
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,880
Oh, yes.

598
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,820
Goodness, kid.

599
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,490
(Coach)

600
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,190
It's my coach.

601
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,890
I need to take this. I'll be back.

602
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,340
Don't worry. I won't date him for long.

603
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,740
I'll date him a few times and dump him.

604
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,910
You don't have to disapprove of me.

605
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm not going to do that.

606
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,680
-What?
-I'm not going to disapprove.

607
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,920
That'll only make him more passionate.

608
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,020
Keep dating, break up, or whatever.
You two can deal with it.

609
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,360
What kind of dad are you?

610
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,660
-What?
-Of course, you should disapprove

611
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,730
if your son is dating a rude brat like me.

612
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,830
So what if you're rude?

613
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,570
You just have to be nice to Ji-uk.

614
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,310
To be honest, I can't give you my support.

615
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,010
But I won't disapprove.

616
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,810
Don't break up in a hurry.
You two can relax and date.

617
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,290
And I'm not saying this
just because I'm his dad.

618
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,220
Ji-uk is a real masterpiece.

619
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,700
Ji-uk, something came up.
I should get going.

620
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,440
Take this and go eat something delicious.

621
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,170
No, it's okay, Dad. I have enough money.

622
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,910
Okay. In that case,
I'll buy something for you two later.

623
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,480
-Okay.
-All right.

624
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,220
It was nice to meet you.

625
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,890
Bye. Stay seated.

626
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,920
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

627
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,030
What do you think?
Isn't he easygoing and nice?

628
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,900
Yes, you must have taken after him.

629
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,800
I get that a lot.

630
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,610
I'm Ae-ra.

631
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,280
I'm not Mi-ra. I'm Na Ae-ra.

632
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,970
Myeong-suk.

633
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,320
Myeong-suk, what happened?

634
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,720
I didn't go to Canada.

635
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,190
No.

636
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,690
I couldn't.

637
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,730
I didn't get through the screening,

638
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,170
but I was too ashamed to tell anyone.

639
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,640
What about Soo-a?

640
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,970
She had a tough time adapting for a while,

641
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,540
but she's doing well now.

642
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,010
I run a tiny snack bar
near my parents' house.

643
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,720
I'm making a living, so don't worry.

644
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,190
It's a weekday, so I didn't think
anyone would be here.

645
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,500
What brings you here, Gung-cheol?

646
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,630
Oh, our factory is nearby.

647
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,500
I thought I'd stop by and visit Man-sik.

648
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,270
Do you come and visit

649
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,810
from time to time?

650
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,150
No matter how much I hate or resent him,

651
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,680
he's the only one I can depend on.

652
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,190
You know what's weird?

653
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,130
As time passes by,

654
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,730
all I can think of is
everything I couldn't do for him.

655
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,040
I may not have been a wonderful wife,

656
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,470
but I thought I was good enough.

657
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,410
I guess I wasn't.

658
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,380
When I close my eyes to sleep,

659
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,480
I can only think of the mean things

660
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,150
and harsh words I said to him.

661
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,520
That's what troubles me the most.

662
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:33,830
Myeong-suk.

663
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,000
As time goes by,
I'm sure there will come a day

664
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,600
when I feel less guilty and lighter.

665
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,670
I have

666
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,870
something to tell you.

667
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,410
(You said he was depressed,)

668
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,550
(so you suggested that nursing home to him
as a sort of therapy.)

669
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,490
So how is the wife

670
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,990
of Professor Han Eung-sik
who died 20 years ago

671
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,060
at that nursing home?

672
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,110
(Professor Han Eung-sik)

673
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,190
Dr. Nam, your patient is here.

674
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,130
I see. Let them in.

675
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,830
Please come in.

676
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,670
Mr. Seo Ju-won. It has been a while.

677
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,080
Please grab a seat.

678
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,430
Are you

679
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,800
serious?

680
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,630
I just found out yesterday.

681
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,710
Man-sik told

682
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,910
everything in his heart
only to that woman.

683
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,080
That's why she was a comfort to him.

684
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,820
Man-sik

685
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,330
probably did that to live on.

686
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,930
To live on as he protects you and Soo-a.

687
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,970
So, Myeong-suk,

688
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,140
please try to

689
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,170
understand him.

690
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,920
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

691
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,530
Is that why you sighed every single night?
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

692
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,670
Is that why you looked out the window
and spaced out?

693
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,170
Couldn't you

694
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,210
tell me those things?

695
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,880
What am I to you?

696
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,490
Cheon Man-sik.

697
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,260
Why do you make me so miserable?

698
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,400
Why do you make me so miserable? Why?

699
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,950
What is this mess?

700
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,980
(Someone I love died.)

701
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,560
Who is this person

702
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,260
that you love?

703
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,300
Your family?

704
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,500
Your lover?

705
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,270
My lover.

706
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,840
Did this person die of an illness
or an accident?

707
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,350
It must be painful and difficult,

708
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,120
but you need to tell me honestly

709
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,790
to move forward with the counseling.

710
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,300
Ju-won.

711
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,400
Didn't I tell you that it's dangerous
to keep things piled up inside

712
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,140
just because it's difficult to talk about?

713
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,780
If your insomnia gets worse
in this condition,

714
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,580
it can cause damage
in the blood vessels of your brain.

715
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,320
Someone

716
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,090
killed that person.

717
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,560
What happened

718
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,700
to your friend?

719
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,780
Let's call it a day.

720
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,900
-Seo Ju-won?
-Yes.

721
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,330
He works as a manager
at a host bar in Cheongdam-dong.

722
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,730
Four years ago,
he lived with Joo Gang-san for a year.

723
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,910
What's this? Why is this guy so pretty?

724
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,010
Find out where he is
and escort him in as a testifier.

725
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,780
Well, he quit the host bar without a word,

726
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:32,720
then he moved without changing
his address, so he can't be reached.

727
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,820
He can't be reached? Since when?

728
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,060
According to investigations,
just a few days after the victim's death.

729
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,790
Something is up.

730
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,700
We need to do whatever we can to find him.
Do you understand?

731
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,300
Sir.

732
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:54,970
The tenant of Apartment 1016
just returned from a business trip.

733
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,550
(In the Mood for Love)

734
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,910
-All right.
-Congratulations, Hyeong-u!
(In the Mood for Love)

735
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,920
Thank you!

736
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,660
Hyeong-u, congratulations.
I knew you could do it.

737
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,830
Think of this as your last chance
and do your best!

738
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,230
Okay.

739
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,830
Hey, thanks, everyone.

740
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,500
It's on me tonight,
so eat as much as you want.

741
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,200
You got Gyeong-ja's credit card, right?

742
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,970
If you already know, why do you ask?

743
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,740
Man, that jerk. He doesn't have the wits
to turn a blind eye to some things.

744
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,210
If I had any wits,
would I be living like this?

745
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,940
What has gotten into you?
You finally know what your life is like.

746
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,580
It's about time he found out.

747
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,420
He's only looking forward to his life
getting shabbier and shabbier.

748
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,220
On top of that,
he must feel awfully frustrated

749
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,320
when he sees me married to a wife

750
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,760
who's pretty, fit, rich, and competent
without getting divorced.

751
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,230
I may feel frustrated to see a mayfly,

752
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,500
but why would I feel that when I see you?

753
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,200
I'd only become more confident.

754
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,600
All right, fine. Say whatever you want.
Go on, give me more.

755
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,040
Come on. I don't care
what you say to me tonight.

756
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,780
I won't get offended at all.

757
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,280
He finally grew up,
now that he signed to direct a movie.

758
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,620
It's not because of the movie.

759
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,290
I may

760
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,930
get a daughter-in-law soon,
so I'm trying to behave.

761
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,290
A daughter-in-law?

762
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,200
That's right, kids.

763
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,970
I finally met Ji-uk's girlfriend today.

764
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,470
-Really?
-Is she pretty?

765
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,780
Well... She isn't my type,

766
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,710
but Ji-uk must think so.

767
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,850
You can see the hearts
dancing in his eyes.

768
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:46,750
Let him be.
That only happens when you're young.

769
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,550
All we get in our eyes at our age
are cataracts.

770
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,160
Let me see you have cataracts.

771
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,460
Director Cho Hyeong-u.

772
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,730
Pre-congratulations
on your box office hit.

773
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,560
What? A box office hit?

774
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,430
Of course. You're making it.

775
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,240
You'll get 15 million ticket sales easily.

776
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,170
Thanks, Hae-suk.

777
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,770
I won't take any other customers today,

778
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,740
so let's have fun.

779
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,080
-Okay.
-Let's drink.

780
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,750
Yes. Fishcake soup.

781
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,080
It's Man-sik's favorite.

782
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,180
What's taking him so long, anyway?

783
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,150
I have two jobs,
but he's busier than I am.

784
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,500
What? Did I say something wrong?

785
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,870
I was just kidding.

786
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,710
I need to use the bathroom.

787
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,740
Don't say that again, even as a joke.

788
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,140
What?

789
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,580
Everyone's trying so hard
not to think about Man-sik.

790
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,380
You're so cruel.

791
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,580
But...

792
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,950
Sorry about that.

793
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,730
Is something wrong?

794
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,700
No, everything's fine.

795
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,300
Did you talk to Jeong-hae?

796
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,110
Let's not talk about anything else today,

797
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,080
and just congratulate Hyeong-u.

798
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,380
While we're on the topic...

799
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,960
I saw Gyeong-ja at Grand Imperial Hotel.

800
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,890
You did?

801
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,730
She went up to a room with a man.

802
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,530
Are you serious?

803
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,030
I was going to call Hyeong-u right away,
but I stopped myself.

804
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,230
It was obvious

805
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,670
he'd try to jump into the Han River
if he heard.

806
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,670
Shouldn't you have told him though?

807
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,140
What if Gyeong-ja is being blackmailed

808
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,080
by some freak like Jeong-hae was?

809
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,150
Come on. Jeong-hae and Gyeong-ja
are different.

810
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,950
Gyeong-ja may blackmail someone,
but she'd never be blackmailed.

811
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,690
What do you mean by that?

812
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,360
Who is my wife blackmailing?

813
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,370
Do you remember
exactly what time that was?

814
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,900
Yes, it was around 7:30.

815
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,740
I checked the time
because I had to catch my flight.

816
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,980
Do you remember
what the person looked like?

817
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,380
Well, I did glance that way briefly,

818
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,420
but I don't remember.

819
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,560
-Detective Ji.
-Yes, sir.

820
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,360
Would you look through to see
if anyone looks like that person?

821
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,460
Okay.

822
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,440
Hey. Are you done?

823
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,470
If Jeong-hae goes to a hotel with a man,

824
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,480
she's being blackmailed
and going against her will,

825
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,910
but if Gyeong-ja goes to a hotel
with a man,

826
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,380
she's going happily and willingly.
Is that it?

827
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,980
That's a bit harsh.

828
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,720
Harsh? How is that harsh?
That's what you're saying.

829
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,390
Enough with your inferiority complex.

830
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,990
I said that out of concern as a friend.
Why are you twisting my words?

831
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,530
What? Out of concern?

832
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,970
You punk.

833
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,270
You've got to be kidding me.

834
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,010
You jerk.

835
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,810
Hey. How could you badmouth her like that
if you were concerned about me?

836
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,210
Let go. Let go before I get angry.

837
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,980
-Why you--
-Cut it out.

838
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,980
Sit down and talk it out.

839
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,890
Hyeong-u, let go.
That's not what Jae-hun meant.

840
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,860
Yes, he did!

841
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,690
I heard him with my own ears.

842
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,130
He always looks down on me.

843
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,700
I don't look down on just anyone.

844
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,070
Think about what you did.

845
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,600
-Hey!
-Stop.

846
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,910
-Hey, Hyeong-u.
-Hyeong-u. Stop it.

847
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,240
What did I do? What did I do wrong?

848
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,240
-Hey.
-What makes you so great?

849
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,510
-Stop it!
-Get over here.

850
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,980
-Hey. What makes you so great?
-Stop it.

851
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,380
It's this person.

852
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:54,890
You did the right thing.

853
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,600
I knew he'd cause
something like this someday.

854
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,270
But Hyeong-u... You did the right thing,

855
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:04,300
but let's make up, okay?

856
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,640
There's no need for friends
to become enemies.

857
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,410
Will you never speak to him again?
We live in the same neighborhood.

858
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,110
Jae-hun talks like a total jerk,

859
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,350
but you know he's soft on the inside.
I'm sure that wasn't what he meant.

860
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,050
Hey, Hyeong-u! Where are you going?

861
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,620
-Hey!
-Go home.

862
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,120
I need to go somewhere.

863
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,100
Which building

864
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,770
do we live in again?

865
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,060
You always say things you don't mean
and get hated for it.

866
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,430
How do you know I don't mean it?

867
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,660
I do. I've known you for so long.

868
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,930
Jae-hun,

869
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,400
we'll be 50 soon.

870
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:47,510
Shouldn't you say the things
you actually feel at times?

871
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,880
You live that way.

872
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,780
I'll compensate you for the damages.

873
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,450
I'm going home.

874
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,890
Look at him acting tough.

875
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,990
Sorry.

876
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,000
Why are you sorry? It was the other guys.

877
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,330
It's late. You should go too.

878
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,740
Let's talk.

879
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,310
Talk?

880
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,840
(My man)

881
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,480
(The person you have reached
is not available.)

882
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,050
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

883
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,920
Let me know if you need anything.

884
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,260
Will do.

885
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,070
When did you come?

886
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,300
I thought you were celebrating
with your friends.

887
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,740
Tell me the truth.

888
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,840
The truth? About what?

889
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,110
Did you go to a hotel with a man
last night?

890
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,250
Was that man

891
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,790
Mr. Park Si-o?

892
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,890
Yes.

893
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,420
That's right.

894
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,960
Let's go to a room.
I'll explain everything.

895
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,430
Let go. Don't touch me.

896
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,830
Hyeong-u.

897
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,370
I hoped

898
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,600
I was wrong.

899
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,240
I thought you'd deny it.

900
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,680
Gyeong-ja,

901
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,880
you're a terrible person.

902
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,010
Did you

903
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,110
mean it?

904
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,150
What?

905
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:47,550
When you told Jeong-hae that you came here
to take me away from her.

906
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,860
If I did mean it,

907
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,930
may I?

908
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,770
Hae-suk.

909
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,410
How did you know...

910
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,510
about Man-sik's funeral?

911
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,450
No, before that.

912
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,450
How did you know about our wedding,
that you came?

913
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,350
-Gung-cheol.
-You're the one

914
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,190
who left the invitation
in front of our door,

915
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,390
wasn't it?

916
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,080
Let's talk.

917
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,190
Are you that afraid of Hae-suk?

918
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,190
Watch your mouth.

919
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,930
What do you know?

920
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,660
If you're not afraid of Hae-suk,
do you not trust Gung-cheol?

921
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,270
I see. So that's what it is.

922
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,700
You can't trust Gung-cheol.

923
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,440
Are you happy?

924
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,180
Are you?

925
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:19,740
Of course, I am.

926
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,750
Someone who broke another person's heart
finally had her heart broken.

927
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,550
How could I not be happy?

928
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,690
This is what you were really after,
isn't it?

929
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,690
The real reason you lent money
to my husband without complaint.

930
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,360
Because it was obvious I'd be miserable
if Hae-suk showed up.

931
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,630
To enjoy watching that.

932
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,400
You're the one who chose Gung-cheol,
knowing you'd be miserable.

933
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,270
Did you forget?

934
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,870
You said he was the first person
that made you want to live.

935
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,540
Then you should live happily.

936
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,850
Why are you struggling so much?

937
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,180
Because I broke your heart.

938
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,750
I guess I'm being punished for that.

939
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,460
Bye.

940
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,460
Don't go.

941
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,770
Jeong-hae.
