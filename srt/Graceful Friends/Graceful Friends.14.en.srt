5
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,370
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,580
I told you

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,150
not to lay a finger on her.

8
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,150
Seriously!

9
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,250
You saw, didn't you?

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,690
She came here at night, begging
to be touched, and made me lose it!

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,890
Why didn't you answer my calls?

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,030
Well.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,160
As you can see,

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,670
I've been a bit busy.

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,440
That doesn't mean you should
break into my home

16
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,480
without my consent.

17
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,950
You're educated enough.

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
Did you say

19
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,450
you wanted a billion won?

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,520
I'll send it to you tomorrow,
so walk away.

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,060
No, you can't take that.

22
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,100
I'll give this to you once you pay me.

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,270
You're the one who broke your promise.
Hand it over.

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,310
I can't do that. I have to live too.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,710
This is my last ace in the hole.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,380
I can't just hand it over.

27
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,490
Do you want to die?

28
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,220
Are you threatening me?

29
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,160
One call to the cops,

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,330
and your life is over too.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,300
That's right.

32
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,900
Not just your life,

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,370
but her life will be over too.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,910
That would be a great sight.

35
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,150
One call to the cops,

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,720
and my life is over.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
-And her life is ruined too.
-Yes.

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,030
(Episode 14: Man on His Knees)

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
I told you

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,440
not to get cheeky.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
Just live with me.

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,350
You still look okay now,
but you'll be hideous

43
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,450
as you get older.

44
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,950
Why do you care
if I become hideous or not?

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,920
Just get lost!

46
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,230
(The fact that you hired that scum)

47
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,430
(to harass my Jeong-hae...)

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,300
The fact that you chose such a dirty,
despicable method...

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,640
is really

50
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
unforgivable.

51
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,050
Sure.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
I can't forgive myself either.

53
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,670
Don't give me any excuses.

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
Get the case file together
and send it to Metro.

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,710
Give us a few more days.

56
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,340
I gave you months already.

57
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,780
Do you think you'll solve the case
if I give you a few days?

58
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,720
Hand it over

59
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,120
and prepare to retire quietly.

60
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,030
Son,

61
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,630
-you like curry, right?
-Yes.

62
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,370
-Should we make curry today?
-Yes!

63
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,370
Then we need potatoes, meat, and onions.

64
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,540
What else do we need?

65
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,240
You forgot the most important ingredient.
Curry.

66
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,680
That's right.

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,350
If the potato has a green tint

68
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,450
or looks blackish, it doesn't taste good.

69
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,390
Look at this. See how smooth the skin is?

70
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,090
This is good for side dishes.

71
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,360
Feel this.

72
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,160
-It's rough, right?
-Yes.

73
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,160
This is for boiling.

74
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,060
-It tastes good boiled.
-For boiling.

75
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,330
Okay.

76
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,600
(Rough: for boiling)
Okay.

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,170
Isn't it heavy? Want me to carry it?

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,370
This is nothing. It's a piece of cake.

79
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,380
Dad. Should we just cross now?

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,250
There are no cars.

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,490
Ahn Yu-bin. Attention.

82
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,760
A signal is a promise.
A man doesn't break his promise

83
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,690
just because there are no cars.

84
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,860
Even if no one is looking,

85
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,530
you must keep your promise.
That's a real man.

86
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,930
Understood?

87
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,970
Okay. Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

88
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,610
See? It changed because we waited.

89
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,710
-Let's go.
-You're the best.

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,110
One, two. Good.

91
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,850
One, two, three, go. One, two...

92
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,250
For potatoes and carrots,

93
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,790
cut them into 1cm cubes.

94
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,860
That provides the best texture
when you chew.

95
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,360
Okay.

96
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,970
I don't like carrots though.

97
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,030
Dad. Can't we take out the carrots?

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Yu-bin.

99
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,370
If it were for just you and me,
naturally, we'd take out the carrots.

100
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,140
But Mom likes carrots.

101
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,880
That's right.

102
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,050
-Dad.
-Yes?

103
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,220
Don't worry about Mom.

104
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,590
What do you mean?

105
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,060
I'll learn how to cook

106
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,920
and cook for her.

107
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,159
That's why you're teaching me how to cook.

108
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,200
Yu-bin, that's not the reason.

109
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,580
(Mr. Kang of the 1,000th store)

110
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,020
Yu-bin, then I'll make

111
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,420
carrot juice for you today.

112
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,650
No way.

113
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,790
(Curry recipe:
Cut potatoes and carrots in 1cm cubes)

114
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,930
Dancing is all about confidence.

115
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,900
Don't get nervous and stretch out
your chests and shoulders.

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,700
Great.

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,610
As soon as you stepped into
our dance studio,

118
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,809
you already became the best dancer.

119
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,980
I won't make a speech.

120
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,580
You can watch us dance first

121
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,050
and try to awaken the instincts
which lie deep inside of your hearts.

122
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,260
Louis 60, please come out.

123
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,700
-Right here.
-Thank you.

124
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,130
Here's your dish.

125
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,100
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

126
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,610
Here you go. Bon appetit.

127
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,050
-Thank you.
-Sure.

128
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,280
You can take this too.

129
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,620
-There it is.
-Here's your dish.

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,160
You must be a new waitress.

131
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,190
You're just my type.

132
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,560
-Hey, young lady.
-Yes?

133
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,300
What's your name?

134
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
Enjoy.

135
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,870
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

136
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
My goodness!

137
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,280
Hon... Honey.

138
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,980
Chun-bok.

139
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,820
You call that an excuse?

140
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,890
I said to just focus on raising Pu-reum.

141
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,230
How can you work there
no matter how much you love money?

142
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,200
What's so bad about that place?

143
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,200
I just promised to cook in the kitchen.

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,230
That bar is right in front of our home,

145
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,670
and how can you want to work
at Hae-suk's place of all places?

146
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,040
Are you embarrassed because of Hae-suk?

147
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,140
What?

148
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,750
That's the reason.

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,880
I thought you got mad
because you were worried about me.

150
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,050
You're mad because you were
humiliated in front of your first love.

151
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,020
Yes, I was humiliated in front of Hae-suk.
Are you satisfied?

152
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,700
What are you so humiliated about?

153
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,160
It's not like I did something bad.

154
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,070
I was helping out during her peak hours
to make some pocket money.

155
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,270
"Make some pocket money"?

156
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,310
If you love money that much,
why did you marry me

157
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,470
instead of a rich guy? Why?

158
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Why did you marry a guy like me?

159
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,180
Man! Darn it!

160
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,010
Is that the expensive bag?

161
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,480
Yes. Honey, look at it.

162
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,150
Look at the quality, the color,
and the design. Isn't it amazing?

163
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,050
I get to use expensive skincare products
like this thanks to her.

164
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Goodness.

165
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,560
Hey, Mr. Ahn!

166
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,340
Why didn't you come in?
Don't leave like that.

167
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,550
I have

168
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,820
cancer.

169
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,690
What?

170
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,230
I must be the one being punished

171
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,100
for all the bad things I did.

172
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,490
Mother.

173
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,920
Hey, Yu-bin. What is it?

174
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,030
I made curry with Dad

175
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,360
after school today.

176
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,730
Do you want some?

177
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,800
No, I don't have an appetite.
I'll eat it tomorrow.

178
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,370
It's good. I put in a lot of carrots too.

179
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,740
It's too late. You should go to sleep.

180
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,010
Okay.

181
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,150
But Mother...

182
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,730
Goodnight.

183
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,480
I've been teaching my son to cook.

184
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,050
I was too busy with work
and didn't spend any time with him before.

185
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,590
You're doing very well.

186
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,420
It's way more profitable

187
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,790
to spend time with your child
than to go out and make money.

188
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,660
Such times turn into
priceless memories later on.

189
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,430
-Thank you.
-Yes.

190
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,470
I think you're right.

191
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,870
Why didn't I help him make
those priceless memories before?

192
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,350
Goodness, Mr. Ahn.

193
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,810
Are you sure you're all right?

194
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,720
Of course. I'm fine, Mr. Kang.

195
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,590
I used to think

196
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,930
it's always better to pretend like
you're tough and strong.

197
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,130
But that isn't the case.

198
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,670
If you act too tough,
you won't have anyone around you.

199
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,840
They leave you thinking
that you don't need them.

200
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,610
So Mr. Ahn,

201
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,710
when times are tough, just say so.

202
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,410
You can depend on someone
and be comforted too.

203
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,720
That's what life is all about.

204
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,230
Cheers.

205
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,010
You're still up.

206
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,090
Yu-bin

207
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,690
seems to know everything.

208
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,290
Yes, it seemed that way.

209
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,830
Why don't we tell him the truth
so he doesn't get nervous?

210
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,100
Sure. Let's do that.

211
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,770
I signed a lease for a place.

212
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,970
I found a nice place.

213
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,310
When do you move in?

214
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,040
It's vacant,
so I'm moving in the day after tomorrow.

215
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,850
Let's tell Yu-bin tomorrow night.

216
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,050
Okay.

217
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,290
Tell me if you need anything.

218
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Okay.

219
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,160
Jeong-hae.

220
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,230
Let's not tell my parents
for the time being.

221
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Okay.

222
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,290
I found a place.

223
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,130
I move in two days from now.

224
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,800
That's good. Congratulations.

225
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,100
You should cook for yourself.

226
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
Don't eat cup noodles all the time.

227
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,270
Do you need anything?

228
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,410
Why? Will you buy it for me?

229
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,840
What do you need?

230
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,680
Jung Jae-hun.

231
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,180
I need you.

232
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,990
Forget it.

233
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,420
You'll feel empty without me.

234
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,760
Will you be okay?

235
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,870
I'm the most comfortable
when I'm alone. Bye.

236
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,210
(My Love Ae-ra)

237
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,350
(The person you have reached...)

238
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,090
Why won't she pick up?

239
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,240
-Mom.
(-The person you have reached...)

240
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,740
I... I'll go by myself today.

241
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,970
Come out.

242
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,920
Honey. Just let Ji-uk go by himself.

243
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,430
(Moon Hong-ryeol)

244
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,600
Hey.

245
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,340
(You're not doing anything today, right?)

246
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,110
What do you mean, I'm not doing anything?
I have so much to do.

247
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
Jang-hwan told me everything, punk.

248
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,110
The 10-billion-won-movie
went down the drain.

249
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,050
(Shut it and come out.
You need to make money.)

250
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,780
Where should I go?
What time do I have to be there?

251
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,260
(My Love Ji-uk)

252
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,600
(17 missed calls: My Love Ji-uk)

253
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,840
Mom.

254
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,380
Ji-uk.

255
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,280
A person needs to meet someone
suitable for them in order to be happy.

256
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,390
Ae-ra isn't suitable for you.

257
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,390
So stop it here, okay?

258
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,460
Before I get angry.

259
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,030
If you keep seeing her regardless,

260
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,630
I will kill her.

261
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,620
I really can't do this movie.

262
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,060
I just won't do it.

263
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,390
(Please help me out.)

264
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,930
(Director Yoon refuses
to work with Ae-ra.)

265
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,970
You help me out.

266
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,330
I absolutely cannot work with her.

267
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,640
What do you mean?

268
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,470
You said she was the best.

269
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,670
Please friend, I'm begging you.

270
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,240
If we stop now,

271
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,840
we lose the 100-million-won
production cost.

272
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,280
Please help me out.

273
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,920
(-Please, Hyeong-u.)
-Bye!

274
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,230
-Hey.
-Yes?

275
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,040
Get an electric blanket
for the next scene on.

276
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,000
Okay.

277
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,540
Sure.

278
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,440
Let's start.

279
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,280
We're ready.

280
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,210
Camera.

281
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,520
Roll.

282
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,350
Ready, action.

283
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,460
I love you. You trust me, right?

284
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,960
Wait.

285
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,160
Trust me.

286
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,580
Cut! Okay!

287
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,880
What are you doing?
There's much more to go.

288
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,790
We got all we need.
Set up for the next scene.

289
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,220
Hey, come here.

290
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,620
Okay.

291
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,930
Please be professional, Director Cho.

292
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,100
Aren't you a pro?

293
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,900
I thought you were.

294
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,970
I heard you met my wife a few days ago.

295
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,680
Yes. She's no joke.

296
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,080
My wife can't think straight
when she's angry.

297
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,120
Still, she isn't completely irrational.

298
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,220
She cares more for others than most.

299
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,960
I'll do whatever I can to persuade her,

300
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,430
so trust me, and keep seeing Ji-uk.

301
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,700
No. I won't see him anymore.

302
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,970
I'm sick of him already.

303
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,470
I'll head back in.

304
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,450
(Son)

305
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,550
(Ji-uk)

306
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,650
(The Late Cheon Man-sik)

307
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,140
Do you know

308
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,250
whom I wanted to see the most
after finding out I was terminal?

309
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,920
It was you, Jeong-hae.

310
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,290
But

311
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,830
when I saw you living happily
with Gung-cheol,

312
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,170
I started getting angry again.

313
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,870
That's why

314
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,210
I did terrible things again.

315
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,380
If I hadn't gotten a terminal illness,

316
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,220
I may have

317
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,890
taken it too far

318
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,760
like Jae-hun.

319
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
The weaker a person gets,

320
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,030
as they become a bigger loser,

321
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,670
they tend to blame others.

322
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,780
It's all my fault...

323
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,680
that this happened to me.

324
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,560
But I didn't want to admit that,

325
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,290
so I kept making excuses.

326
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,060
For me,

327
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,000
that was you.

328
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,110
Being with you like this

329
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,510
brings back old memories.

330
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,980
It was

331
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,780
so nice with you.

332
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,520
Do you plan

333
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,590
not to tell Gung-cheol?

334
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,560
If I do?

335
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,200
Like he'd sit still? You know him.

336
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,300
He'd leave you and come to me.

337
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,070
Can you handle that?

338
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,740
We're getting a divorce.

339
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,950
-Jeong-hae.
-So

340
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,050
you can tell him.

341
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,850
If it's too hard for you, I will.

342
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
No.

343
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,090
I don't want

344
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,070
to have Gung-cheol pity me
even in my final days.

345
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,370
Pity?

346
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,670
Gung-cheol never once

347
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,680
loved me.

348
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,320
He always pitied me.

349
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,520
You're mistaken.

350
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,590
Gung-cheol

351
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,460
loves you.

352
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,900
Do you remember?

353
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,500
The day I told you

354
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,270
and he and I decided to go out.

355
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,080
The truth is, I was rejected.

356
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,050
He said he was in love with someone else,

357
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,750
and turned me down flat.

358
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,020
What?

359
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,920
Gung-cheol

360
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,930
loved only her...

361
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,430
ever since back then.

362
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,940
Cut. Okay. Good work everyone.

363
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,910
Good job.

364
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,380
Good job.

365
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,720
-Hey, man.
-Yes?

366
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,350
Pack this up separately.

367
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,120
Thank you.

368
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,590
Good job.

369
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,960
Good job.

370
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,630
Let's

371
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,030
talk, Ae-ra.

372
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,180
My parents are getting a divorce.

373
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,580
Really?

374
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,320
I think it's because I wouldn't study

375
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,220
and asked my dad to teach me how to cook.

376
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,890
I think that made them fight.

377
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,100
Gosh. See? You should've studied.

378
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,800
Anyway, why is that a big deal?

379
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,510
One out of three families is divorced.

380
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,040
Hang in there.

381
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,710
Hey. It's a greater tragedy
to live together and fight all the time.

382
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,150
Both of your parents are successful.

383
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,380
My dad isn't. He doesn't have a job.

384
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,390
I need to make money quickly.

385
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,960
I didn't know I was this poor.

386
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,590
Ahn Yu-bin. Attention.

387
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,420
A signal is a promise.

388
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,360
A man doesn't break his promise
just because there are no cars.

389
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,130
Even if no one is looking, you must
keep your promise. That's a real man.

390
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,230
Understood?

391
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,180
Hey, kid.

392
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,710
Yu-bin!

393
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,250
No.

394
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,170
-Emergency.
-There was a car accident.

395
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,909
-It's critical.
-Where are you?

396
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,179
The intersection
in front of New Space Apartments.

397
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,150
Do you know how to administer CPR?
It'll take time--

398
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,449
I'm a doctor. I'm doing it now,

399
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,150
so please bring a defibrillator
and an intubation kit.

400
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,870
His heart stopped three minutes ago,
so I gave him CPR for two minutes.

401
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,270
Thankfully, his heart is beating, but he's
unconscious and his breathing is weak.

402
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,570
-Please prepare the intubation kit.
-Okay, right away.

403
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,680
-Give me the blade.
-Okay.

404
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
-Give me the tube.
-Okay.

405
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,280
Please hold this.

406
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,350
(My loving Dad)

407
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,860
Hi, Yu-bin.

408
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,190
It's me.

409
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,990
What's going on?

410
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
Yu-bin was hit by a car.

411
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,730
Come to the hospital.

412
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,920
We have to stop the bleeding

413
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,150
or it may be dangerous.

414
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,460
Wait, our Yu-bin.

415
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,030
Where's our Yu-bin?

416
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,360
Where is he?

417
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,560
You need to sign
the surgery consent first.

418
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,600
He bled a lot,

419
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,300
so his brain pressure rose quite a lot.

420
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,070
He needs surgery right now,
so please sign the consent form.

421
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,600
(Surgery Consent Form)

422

(Outpatient Operating Room)

424
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,750
What's his condition?

425
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,520
He has an SDH.
(SDH: Subdural Hematoma, blood collected
on the surface of the brain)
He has an SDH.

426

(SDH: Subdural Hematoma, blood collected
on the surface of the brain)

427
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,860
There was a lot of hemorrhaging.
He needs emergency surgery.

430
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,390
(Outpatient Operating Room)

431
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,340
When are you coming home?
Come home already.

432
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,810
Your mom is sick in bed.

433
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,110
Dad, I'm not going home
until she gives me her approval.

434
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,210
That's all.

435
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,250
You should go now.

436
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,650
Ae-ra.

437
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,560
I'm not breaking up with you.

438
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,690
So don't try to avoid me.

439
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,500
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth.

440
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,700
Ji-uk, you're drunk. Let's go.

441
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,770
Do you remember

442
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,270
the day that we first met?

443
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,040
Back then,

444
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,480
I didn't look at you on purpose.

445
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,120
I knew I'd be smitten if I did.

446
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,990
But

447
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,690
come to think of it now,

448
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,990
I think you stole my heart

449
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,330
even before I looked at you.

450
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,100
Stop talking nonsense, and let's go.

451
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,140
Ae-ra, you know what?

452
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,010
Whenever I see you,

453
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,120
my heart aches for some reason.

454
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,450
My heart aches,

455
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,890
and I keep wanting to see you.

456
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,630
So Ae-ra, please stop being so stupid!

457
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,100
The more

458
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,270
you push me away, the closer I'll get.

459
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,410
So stop pushing me away,

460
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,580
no matter who's making you do that.

461
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,680
Okay?

462
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,450
What are you talking about?

463
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,290
Who's making me do what?

464
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,540
-Stay for a while.
-Ji-uk, slowly. Go slowly.

465
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,340
-It's dangerous.
-Taking my shoes off.

466
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,470
Yes, one after the other... Goodness.

467
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,910
Are you all right? Get up.

468
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,040
I'm fine. Come.

469
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,880
Where are you going? Where are you going?

470
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,180
You're completely wasted.

471
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,620
We're going to sleep already?

472
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,050
-Gosh.
-Lie down, will you?

473
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,210
(Hello?)

474
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,150
You're with Ji-uk, aren't you?

475
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,950
Yes.

476
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,260
Do you have time tomorrow?

so we kept his cranium opened
to drop the pressure.

489
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,390
We'll watch him for a few hours.

490
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,490

00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,400
It could've been terrible
if he came even five minutes later.

496
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,600
The surgery went well,

497
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,370
so let's stay hopeful and wait.

498
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,210
(Restricted Area)

499
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,720
(Outpatient Operating Room)

500
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,980
He'll be fine.

501
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,560
You know how strong Yu-bin is.

502
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,660
Of course, I do.

503
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,800
I can't remember anything

504
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,270
that recently happened to us.

505
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,870
You're right.

506
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,070
I can't remember anything else

507
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,240
other than the fact

508
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,210
that Yu-bin is lying here before my eyes.

509
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,020
Let's keep our focus on him for a while.

510
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,860
Okay. We should do that.

511
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,490
I'll do that.

512
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,100
I'll only think about him.

513
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,370
Yu-bin.

514
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,210
Goodness, Yu-bin.

515
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,480
Yu-bin.

516
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,120
Yu-bin.

517
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,290
Yu-bin.

518
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,490
Yu-bin, it's me, Mr. Cho. Yu-bin!

519
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,860
My goodness.

520
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,500
Yu-bin, it's me. Mr. Cho.

521
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,770
Yu-bin...

522
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,140
You should drink this.

523
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,120
Thank you.

524
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,190
Yu-bin...

525
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,490
You're acting like he's your son.

526
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,790
He ate so well

527
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,860
when he was over at our place.

528
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,930
He said he'll wait for Pu-reum

529
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,770
until she finishes kindergarten.

530
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,310
My goodness.

531
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,940
He'll be all right.

532
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,780
Be strong, Jeong-hae.

533
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,480
You're a tough woman.

534
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,350
Yes.

535
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,450
Yu-bin's surgery

536
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,120
went well,

537
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,420
so he'll get over this.

538
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,430
Of course.

539
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:34,890
Yu-bin assured us

540
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,630
that he won't come in last in his class

541
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,700
on his next test.

542
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,470
He's faking his illness
because he isn't confident.

543
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,240
We have all done that
when we were his age.

544
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,680
Yu-bin, we were all there together

545
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,350
when you were born.

546
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,950
You were really energetic and healthy

547
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,190
even while you were in the incubator.

548
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,260
Yes, of course.
You hung on like a tough little guy,

549
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,160
so we were very proud of you.

550
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,830
Yu-bin.

551
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,730
They came to show their support
like they did back then.

552
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,340
So, my son, you need to get up soon.

553
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,370
You can do it. You can do it, Yu-bin!

554
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,140
Hello.

555
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,480
I'm from the Traffic Team
of Seobu Police Station.

556
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,320
Mr. Ahn, please come with us.

557
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,340
As you can see, this car was speeding,
and the driver hit him and ran away.

558
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,710
We believe the driver
may have taken a sleep inducer,

559
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,850
doesn't have a license,
or was driving drunk.

560
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,050
We'll know for sure
once we catch the driver.

561
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,950
You should go back to the hospital.

562
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,160
We'll contact you right away
as soon as we find the car.

563
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,210
(Where do you think you're going?)

564
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,510
(I'll give you what you want. Stay still.)

565
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,210
(-You crazy jerk!
-You wanted this too.)

566
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,210
(Stay still!)

567
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,680
(You crazy jerk!)

568
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,620
Detective Cho, your soup is turning cold.

569
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,120
Tae-uk.

570
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,530
Why are you studying that?
We have to hand that over to Metro anyway.

571
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,060
Just come and eat.

572
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,500
(Stop right there!)

573
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,930
What are you doing, you lunatic?
Move aside!

574
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,430
Darn it.

575
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,630
What's wrong with him?

576
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,750
Yu-bin.

577
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,950
May I make a confession?

578
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,920
You know,

579
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,960
when I found out I was pregnant with you,

580
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,130
I was really thrilled.

581
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,370
But I was also worried.

582
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,040
I wasn't sure

583
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,310
if I could be a good mom.

584
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,490
I guess you knew.

585
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,890
Because that's when

586
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,430
you stopped eating.

587
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,570
Goodness.

588
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,080
Baby, will you please save Mommy?

589
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,820
My baby.

590
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,150
Mommy is starving.

591
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,020
You must be starving too.

592
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,390
Goodness, baby.
Please help her out. I ask of you.

593
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,400
Okay? Please help her out. Please?

594
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,770
The day after you heard that,

595
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,600
you came out into the world

596
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,070
to help out your mom.

597
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,080
You came out way before your time.

598
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,680
Come to think of it,

599
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,450
you've always been

600
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,190
such a great son from the beginning.

601
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,660
But

602
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,100
I don't think

603
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:52,300
I ever thanked you.

604
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,310
Yu-bin.

605
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,480
Thank you

606
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,990
so much.

607
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,500
I want to thank you too.

608
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,000
You're here.

609
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,300
What happened?

610
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,780
They'll find the driver soon.

611
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,480
Okay.

612
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,080
That must be why

613
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,290
he eats so well.

614
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,390
He couldn't eat while he was in the womb.

615
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,890
He must have regretted that.

616
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,500
I guess so.

617
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,170
Jeong-hae, you should eat something too.

618
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,170
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

619
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,970
I have no appetite.
You should eat something.

620
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,010
I already ate.

621
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,310
Should I get you some porridge?

622
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,720
Ga-yeon.

623
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,120
Hello.

624
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,420
Hey. I'm glad you came.

625
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,630
How did you get here?
What about your academy?

626
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,830
Have you eaten? Have you had dinner?

627
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,160
I don't want to eat dinner,

628
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,470
and I'm ditching the academy today.

629
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,540
You can't do that.

630
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,070
You should still eat
even if you ditch your academy.

631
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,510
Should I get you something to eat?

632
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,140
Last night,

633
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,320
he opened up to me
about something troubling him.

634
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,090
He talked about his troubles?

635
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,420
Yu-bin did that?

636
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,490
Yu-bin will be all right, won't he?

637
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,930
Of course, he'll be fine.

638
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,330
Gung-cheol can't
suffer any more misfortune.

639
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,300
This world isn't that cruel.

640
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,640
People's lives can
crumble down in an instant.

641
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,340
I mean, what did Gung-cheol ever do?

642
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,480
Goodness, fate can be so cruel.

643
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,650
You're right.

644
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,080
Anyway, didn't you say
something big happened with your family?

645
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,550
It's nothing.

646
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,660
It's nothing compared
to what happened to Yu-bin.

647
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,890
Don't mind me.

648
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:31,800
Right. There's no bigger trouble
than seeing your child get hurt.

649
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,230
Anyway,

650
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,040
shouldn't we tell Jae-hun?

651
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,140
Would Gung-cheol want to see him?

652
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,980
But still, he should know. One second.

653
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,610
(Cyborg)

654
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,820
(Ero Hyeong-u)

655
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,390
-What is it?
-Hey, Jae-hun.

656
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,030
Yu-bin got into an accident.

657
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,630
He got into a car accident
and is unconscious.

658
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:07,100
-So?
-Did you just say, "So"?

659
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,400
How could you be so cold?

660
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,070
I'm busy. Bye.

661
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,740
Why? What did he say?

662
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,210
He hung up saying he's busy.

663
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,180
What? He hung up after he heard that?

664
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,120
Yes. Man, this punk is the worst.
We can't even call him a friend.

665
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,920
I didn't think he was that low.
I can't believe this guy.

666
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,130
That jerk. Darn it.

667
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,930
I'm late. I have to get to work. Bye.

668
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,900
I'm taking the day off.
I don't think I can work today.

669
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,670
-Chun-bok, are you okay?
-What?

670
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,410
Have you not told your wife yet?

671
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,210
I have to,

672
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,080
but I can't bring it up.

673
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,480
What if it gets worse?

674
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,850
Tell her before it blows up.

675
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,790
That's why I'm taking dance lessons.

676
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,520
What? Dance lessons?

677
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,120
No. No, be quiet.

678
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,530
Let me go. Dance lessons?

679
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,230
Be quiet.

680
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,730
Why are you taking dance...

681
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,160
-Why are...
-Stop it.

682
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,030
Are you going somewhere?

683
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,940
I'm going to stop by at home.

684
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,210
Can you drive? Want me to drive you?

685
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,710
I can drive.

686
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,640
Bye.

687
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,650
Jeong-hae.

688
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,260
Hang in there.

689
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,660
Of course, I will.

690
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,370
I'm using my energy for hating you
to hang in there too.

691
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,570
Good. I'm glad.

692
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,210
Gung-cheol is talking to Yu-bin.

693
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,480
I get what you mean. I won't intrude.

694
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,530
He said it was his fault

695
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,530
that the two of you were getting divorced.

696
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,400
That it was because he was learning
how to cook instead of studying.

697
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,970
He said he needed to make money

698
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,210
because you were unemployed.

699
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:05,240
Hey, Yu-bin. What are you doing here?

700
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,480
You said you'd get tons of followers
and make lots of money.

701
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,050
So what is this?

702
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,930
(Today, we have the future chef,
Ahn Yu-bin.)

703
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,470
(Hello, everyone.)

704
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,680
(I'm Ahn Yu-bin, 38th generation
of the Sunheung Ahns.)

705
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,940
(Why do I want to become a chef?)

706
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,510
(It is because my dad,
whom I like and respect)

707
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,820
(more than anyone in the world
is a great cook.)

708
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,320
(My grandfather said)

709
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,750
(a man doesn't belong in the kitchen,)

710
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,050
(but my dad)

711
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,790
(cooks and even does the dishes.)

712
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,030
(I thought he looked really cool.)

713
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,930
(However, you have the lowest grades
in your class.)

714
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,500
(Yes, that's correct.)

715
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,200
(I am bad at school and at sports,)

716
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,270
(but I'm confident in my eating skills.)

717
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,610
(My dad always said you must eat well
for fortune to come to you.)

718
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,810
(That is why I want to become
a great cook like my dad)

719
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,110
(and share fortune with other people.)

720
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,050
(You want to share fortune, you say.)

721
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,850
(That sounds kind of old-mannish.)

722
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,350
(What do you mean?)

723
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,900
Dad. Should we just cross now?

724
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,710
A signal is a promise.
A man doesn't break his promise

725
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,710
just because there are no cars.

726
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,780
Even if no one is looking,

727
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,450
you must keep your promise.
That's a real man.

728
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:22,880
Understood?

729
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,920
Okay. Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

730
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,150
Yu-bin.

731
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,260
I was

732
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,460
so wrong.

733
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,560
Promises aren't important at all.

734
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,070
I was stupid and taught you

735
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,970
something useless.

736
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:49,910
I'm sorry, Yu-bin.

737
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,380
If there are no cars,

738
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,850
you can ignore the signal and cross.

739
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,990
Who... Who cares about any of that?

740
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,190
I'm sorry, Yu-bin. I was wrong.

741
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,100
And

742
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,900
Mom and Dad...

743
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,070
getting a divorce

744
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:25,410
is not because of you, Yu-bin.

745
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,950
It isn't because you get bad grades.

746
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,420
It isn't because you asked me
to teach you how to cook.

747
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,790
Both Mom and Dad

748
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,430
were just too tired.
We were exhausted, that was why.

749
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,940
It was definitely not because of you.

750
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,270
We love you so much, Yu-bin.

751
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,410
We think so much about you,

752
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,950
Yu-bin.

753
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,160
So Yu-bin, I'm begging you.

754
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,560
Please, wake up. Please?

755
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,500
I'm begging you. I beg you, my son.

756
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,970
Please wake up. My son. Please wake up.

757
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,470
Please wake up, my son.

758
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,740
Please wake up.

759
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:32,880
Yu-bin. Please wake up, my son.

760
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,280
Please, Yu-bin.

761
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:41,320
Yu-bin... Please wake up.

762
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,060
Yu-bin. Please wake up.

763
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,460
My Yu-bin told his friend

764
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,730
that his mom and dad were getting divorced

765
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,000
and that he was worried.

766
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:04,210
He thought we were getting divorced
because of him.

767
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:09,710
He got hit by a car on his way home
after he told her that.

768
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,420
If I hadn't said that,
Yu-bin wouldn't have been hit by that car.

769
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,230
If I didn't tell Jeong-hae
that I wanted a divorce,

770
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,260
Yu-bin wouldn't have been hit by that car.

771
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,130
No.

772
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:30,000
If I... If I hadn't told him
to abide by the signal,

773
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,670
Yu-bin wouldn't have been hit by that car.

774
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,840
Yes. That's right.

775
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,780
Yu-bin said let's just cross the street,

776
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,480
but I said to abide by the signal.

777
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,580
That... That it's what a real man does.
A real man...

778
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,750
If I hadn't said that gibberish, Yu-bin...

779
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,320
wouldn't have been hit by that car.

780
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,400
I'm the crazy fool!

781
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,970
I'm the one who deserves to die!

782
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,640
Hey.

783
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:11,140
Who cares about promises?
Promises aren't important.

784
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,010
Everyone does well
even if they live as they want.

785
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,350
Who cares about promises?

786
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,680
Who cares about being a man?

787
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:23,820
Who cares about any of that? Who cares?

788
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,160
Calm down.

789
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,690
Jae-hun.

790
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,930
Please save Yu-bin. Please save him.

791
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,700
If you save him,
I'll do anything you want.

792
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,540
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

793
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,400
So please save him.

794
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,240
I'm begging you.

795
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,510
I'm begging you.

796
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,410
Please, Jae-hun. Save my boy Yu-bin.

797
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,180
Please save my boy Yu-bin.

798
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,820
Please save my boy Yu-bin.

799
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,090
What did I do that was so wrong?

800
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:01,090
What did I do that was so wrong?

801
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:10,570
Why are they taking it out on Yu-bin?

802
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,300
Why?

803
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,810
Yu-bin...

804
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,580
(All of my convictions
that I had believed were right)

805
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,620
(crumbled in an instant.)

806
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,790
(The road sign of my life
in which I raced only looking forward)

807
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,760
(disappeared.)

808
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,130
(Age 45.)

809
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,600
(Halfway through my life,
when I'm neither young nor old.)

810
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,930
(I lost my way.)

811
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,740
(To where must I look now,)

812
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,240
(and to where must I walk?)

813
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:54,110
(Exactly how must I live?)

814
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:14,730
(Witness Statement)

815
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,700
I...

816
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,780
killed Joo Gang-san.
