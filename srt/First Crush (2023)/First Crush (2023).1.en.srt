"First Crush"

51
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,928
We used to give the best show.

52
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,973
You satisfied with how you did?

53
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,583
Performing is to accept that some
will like it, and some won't.

54
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,311
No one has heard your song,
so they won't resonate.

55
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,145
This is very relevant to the club ranking.

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,802
Self-composed songs have advantages.

57
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,329
We can improve our performance.

58
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,450
Would it be better
if you play difficult solos,

59
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,473
and blow it up on stage?

60
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,114
But the audience have
no interaction, no reaction.

61
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,536
Who's gonna rock with you
with your own song?

62
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,216
Lin Yu-jia, why did you quit the club?

63
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,841
The president won't let me perform my song.

64
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,614
So I don't want to be there anymore.

65
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,145
But... you can't do that.

66
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,575
You almost complete your song.

67
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,141
There must be another way.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
This isn't the only club, right?

69
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,400
Or I can perform your song.

70
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,552
Okay, I'll just...

71
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,175
I'll practice more and get it right.

72
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,848
Just pretend it's my song first.

73
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,739
You know, even if I do finish writing it,

74
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,598
I probably won't go to see your show.

75
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:44,047
Why?

76
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,787
Are you serious or just trolling?

77
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,583
I'm serious.

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,067
I don't want to see the president.

79
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,028
Plus...

80
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,775
I can't bear to see you play so badly.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,817
No way! I've been practicing hard, okay?

82
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:05,380
Really?

83
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,622
- Come on, then.
- Why not?

84
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,602
Ready?

85
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:19,061
A minor.

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,108
Start it over for me.

87
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,921
- You wrote all this?
- Yes.

88
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,089
Impressive.

89
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,619
I... I think you have
some chords written...

90
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,523
a bit strange.

91
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,956
Your guitar arrangement
and the vocal part...

92
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,316
They are incompatible.

93
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:04,817
It's okay. Let's try it out.

94
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,741
Okay.

95
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,421
Hey!

96
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,450
Don't lose my pick again!

97
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,255
I won't.

98
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,910
I'll take good care of it.

99
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,204
Okay, stop writing.

100
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,723
- What's up?
- Let's go!

101
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,377
Are you dumb? What if we get caught?

102
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,545
Don't worry.

103
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,572
I've sneaked in many times before.

104
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,674
So pretty.

105
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,184
Right?

106
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,445
What are you doing?

107
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,169
I nearly got choked!

108
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,050
Take it easy.

109
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,243
Why did you push me?

110
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,380
When I was feeling down,

111
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,786
I would always come here alone.

112
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,929
Come here for what?

113
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,653
I don't know.

114
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,892
I just felt...

115
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,061
It's so relaxing.

116
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,372
To float on the water like this.

117
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,544
It's like...

118
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,255

I still remember that one time,

148
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,997
a senior came to give a music lesson.

149
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,752
He played a song that he wrote himself.

150
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,453
I don't know why,

151
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,692
he only played four chords,

152
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,588
but I felt so greatly moved.

153
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,505
From that time on, I knew.

154
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,926

I think your song are written badly.

170
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,524
No audience will like it.

171
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,431
It's not that bad.

172
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,291
But perhaps a different expression?

173
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,609
Like adding some funk?

174
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,415
For a tacky piece,

175
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,839
it's still tacky
however you change the arrangement.

176
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,407
I think it's not bad.

177
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,391
He just have a bad taste.

178
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,121
So you know about good taste in music?

179
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,890
Write it yourself if you're so good!

180
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,952
Anything I write will sound
better than yours.

181
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:14,485
I'm right.

182
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:15,344
G is to be followed by Bm7.

183
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,938
- But the whole thing is off key!
- Enough!

184
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:21,724
Jian-kai.

185
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,722
Can we save your song for next time?

186
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,313
Even you are like this!

187
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:44,477
Hey!

188
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,492
Quit secretly recording me!

189
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,825
(How's the rehearsal?)

190
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:57,824
(Sorry Yu-jia,)

191
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:01,966
(we've decided not to play
self-composed song...)

192
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,990
(Hahahahahaha...)

193
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:17,200
(It went well.)

194
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,896
(National Student Songwriting Contest)

195
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
It's almost time. You may want to go in?

196
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,264
Sure.

197
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,123
Bye!

198
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,961
Lin Yu-jia.

199
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,631
Welcome to the freshmen show.

200
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,052
Still welcome after I quit?

201
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,025
Of course.

202
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,488
Don't miss my grand finale.

203
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,462
I'm gonna lit the stage.

204
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,289
Are you in tune?

205
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,315
Not yet.

206
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,501
Let's talk outside.

207
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,546
Have you seen the program list?

208
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,759
Yes.

209
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,351
Is that a misprint?

210
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:39,722
No, it's not.

211
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,400
Then why my song is not on the list?

212
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,673
The band members decided

213
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,431
not to play the self-composed song.

214
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,540
They decided to just do cover songs.

215
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,829
So when you told me before,

216
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,759
that you've been practicing well,

217
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:02,770
that you're almost ready.

218
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,854
That's all a lie?

219
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,439
No, that's not true.

220
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,189
You think I'm bad at writing songs?

221
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,337
No, I think those songs are great.

222
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,179
- I love the songs.
- Do you?

223
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,095
- I really do!
- You don't!

224
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,808
Yu-jia...

225
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,701
You're just like them,

226
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,645
thinking that my songs are shitty!

227
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,087
No, I don't.

228
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:35,514
Let me ask you...

229
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,735
Why did you ask me to write a song?

230
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,007
You made me think that

231
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,342
someone would really like my songs!

232
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,016
Because I like you!

233
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,438
Because I didn't want you to leave.

234
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,442
I like the way you sing and play guitar.

235
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,734
The way you write.

236
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,611
I just really like you!

237
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,500

270
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,077
Why isn't he here?

271
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,145
He quit the club a while ago.

272
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,421
