1
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,685
Vehicle One, Joo Gyeong-nam,
advances to the final round.

2
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:19,853
BLACK KNIGHT

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,564
Participant Eight, Refugee 034,
is currently in second.

4
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,315
Don't think.

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,402
Think.

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,283
Let's go!

7
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,085
That dumbass.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,639
Get in! Quick!

9
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,853
Thanks.

10
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,869
We now have two people tied
for second place?

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,747
Well, I guess so.

12
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,167
FINISH LINE

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,712
Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su and Refugee 034,
have crossed the finish line.

14
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,922
GAME OVER

15
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,728
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,314
Good work.

17
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,027
Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su, you're in second.
You'll advance to the final.

18
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,821
What? What about me?

19
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,447
I came in with her.

20
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,407
Vehicle Eight, you were disqualified.

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,244
That's bullshit.
We came in together! I've got this!

22
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,704
You lost your car,
and your package was damaged.

23
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,082
-Both are grounds for disqualification.
-What?

24
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,504
Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su, came in second
and will advance to the final.

25
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,755
ELIMINATED
VEHICLE EIGHT

26
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,300
Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su, came in second
and will advance to the final.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,080
We have a problem with the final round.

28
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,333
Participant Number Three hurt her arm
and pulled out.

29
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,299
-Did you look into it?
-Yes. You guessed correctly.

30
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,134
She broke her arm.

31
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,889
So, who will advance to the final round?

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,685
The refugee who was eliminated?
Or the one who came in fourth?

33
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,812
Let's set the scene.

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,482
The deliverymen among the observers agree

35
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,693
that the refugee boy should go
to the final.

36
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,777
Is that so?

37
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,156
Because he saved an associate's life?

38
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,828
REFUGEE 034
MUSCLE MASS: MAX, BMI: MAX

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,252
"The refugee who saved his associate
and finished together."

40
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,464
It will give hope to the refugees,

41
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,675
and it'll be more beneficial for our plan.

42
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,319
The weather's miserable, just like me.

43
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,702
Huh?

44
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,876
What is that?

45
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,967
Hey, losers!

46
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,556
Am I also included in those "losers"?

47
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,308
I'm in the final.

48
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,977
REFUGEE O34

49
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,482
-Really?
-For real?

50
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,566
Yeah, for real! Duh!

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,986
Hey, what happened?
Did one of them give up?

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,487
Huh? How did you know that?

53
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,155
-Seriously?
-For real?

54
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,157
Oh, what does it matter?

55
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,743
-Yay!
-He's in the final!

56
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,540
Here are each district's population,
gender distribution,

57
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,001
age groups,
and average oxygen consumption levels.

58
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,336
I'll start with the General District--

59
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,133
We have plenty of data like this
at Cheonmyeong Group too.

60
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,304
Mr. Ryu didn't come all the way here
for something so obvious.

61
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
What exactly do you want to know?

62
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,353
Didn't we brief you on that already?

63
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,521
Mr. Oh.

64
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,151
Gender, age,
and average oxygen consumption.

65
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,237
We can't reassign residents
based on just these three.

66
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,280
What I want is

67
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,450
the personal data of all residents.

68
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,077
All medical and bio data,

69
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,956
including intelligence level, fitness,
occupation, criminal record, and DNA.

70
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,044
Is that precise enough for you?

71
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,797
Personal data is top secret
and can lead to human rights issues.

72
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,800
I can't hand it over
without authorization.

73
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,054
I thought the minister of defense
approved of it.

74
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,556
Top-secret data requires
official approval.

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,189
Major, do you not agree
with Cheonmyeong's relocation plan?

76
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,525
I'm a soldier.

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,445
I do not have a personal opinion.

78
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,880
Special District working hours
are now over.

79
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,508
Oxygen level restriction will begin.

80
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,016
I didn't order anything.

81
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,689
It's a special delivery.

82
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,611
Yes. I'll get it done
as quickly as possible, sir.

83
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,870
You said the relocation would be fair.
Is that correct?

84
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,834
We will again select people
who are suited to the new environment.

85
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,293
To me, "select" sounds like

86
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,004
you will control the residents
using relocation rights.

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,464
Control…

88
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,260
That's a fitting word.

89
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,805
Shouldn't people pay a price
to have a better life?

90
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,559
If they took Cheonmyeong's achievements
for granted, that'd be a bigger problem.

91
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,479
Am I wrong?

92
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,816
A selection cannot possibly be fair,

93
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,818
no matter which standard is applied.

94
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,195
That's why we're saying we need your help.

95
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,450
So we can be as fair as possible, Major.

96
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,957
Let's have the next briefing
at Cheonmyeong.

97
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,183
Ryu Seok was
at the Defense Intelligence Command.

98
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,397
So, Cheonmyeong ended up taking control
of the relocation plan?

99
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,233
Chairman Ryu voted
for the government's relocation plan,

100
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,610
which includes the refugees.

101
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,863
It's a fight between father and son,
so to speak.

102
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,743
I don't trust Chairman Ryu either.

103
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,662
He ordered the Refugee Massacre
nine years ago.

104
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,958
His sense of guilt
won't bring back the dead.

105
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,793
I'm not saying you should forgive him.

106
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,672
I'm saying that our biggest enemy
right now is his son, Ryu Seok,

107
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,341
who has the reigns.

108
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,596
Chairman Ryu supports the president,

109
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,015
and Ryu Seok supports the minister.

110
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,186
In the end, they'll choose
what's best for them.

111
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,442
Did you look into the thing
I asked you about?

112
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,113
The Special District only has hospitals.
No human experiment labs or test centers.

113
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,408
If there were any,
that cleaning vehicle would've been there.

114
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,089
Why are they demanding people's
personal information and bio data?

115
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,219
They want to rebuild Cheonmyeong's world
with people who have superior genes.

116
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,809
And I'm stuck between the government
and Cheonmyeong.

117
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,310
Well, if that's the case,

118
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,730
I think you'd better stay
exactly in the middle.

119
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,123
Everyone's in position.

120
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,336
Wait for my signal.

121
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,005
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,391
Begin.

123
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,152
There. Looks good, huh?

124
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,154
Confirmed.

125
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,073
Keep an eye on him from your positions.

126
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,458
-Come back again.
-See you next time!

127
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,380
He's heading your way.

128
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,220
Lee, take the other side.
Everyone else, back him up.

129
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,305
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,500
He's onto us. The west alley!

131
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,133
Lee, what's your current location?

132
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,718
Heading to the end of the alley!

133
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,637
He went into a building.

134
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,097
Check them, one by one.

135
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,354
Drop your gun.

136
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,333
A soldier?

137
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,918
To be precise,

138
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,628
soldiers.

139
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,546
Hands up.

140
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,674
Drop your gun.

141
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Drop it and get down.

142
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,159
He died in front of me.

143
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,704
A tiny bomb went off in his head.

144
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,589
Can you fix this?

145
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,596
Why do you want to be a deliveryman?

146
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,264
Well,

147
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,932
you know,

148
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,395
I can't just stay here
wasting food and air.

149
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,899
Well, I have no trouble feeding you.

150
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,610
Is it because of your friend,

151
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,612
the one in the necklace?

152
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,830
Yeah.

153
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,003
If you're determined to do this,
I'll be rooting for you.

154
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,715
You've made it this far, so just win!

155
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,324
Yoon Sa-wol the dumbass is in the final?

156
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,368
I guess I underestimated you.

157
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,416
Did you catch those bastards?

158
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,251
Not yet.

159
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,753
Your memories?

160
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,755
Not yet.

161
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,758
We are now at the Special District,
first floor.

162
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,011
Whether you win or lose,
remember to stay safe.

163
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,596
Is this you rooting for me?

164
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,097
Of course.

165
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,490
Current atmosphere information
for the Special District.

166
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,618
Oxygen level, good.

167
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,078
Fine dust level, average.

168
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,664
Humidity, 52%.

169
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,958
Temperature, 21 degrees Celsius.

170
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,168
This place is awesome.

171
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,214
You will stay in temporary lodgings
until the final round.

172
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,384
There is one rule.

173
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,305
Don't leave your lodging without being
accompanied by your mentor.

174
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,681
Mentor?

175
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,475
What's a mentor?

176
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,520
The one behind you is your mentor.

177
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,151
So, your name's Mentor?

178
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,030
Yes. My name's Mentor.

179
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,996
JOO GYEONG-NAM VS REFUGEE 034

180
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,712
JOO GYEONG-NAM

181
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,799
REFUGEE 034

182
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,811
JOO GYEONG-NAM
SECOND ROUND WINNER

183
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,817
REFUGEE 034
FINALIST BY DEFAULT

184
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,155
The public eye's focused
on the refugee boy, as you anticipated.

185
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,449
Of course it is.
We sent him to the final round.

186
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,035
What happens from now on
is more important.

187
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,078
Yes, sir.

188
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,041
This Deliveryman Recruitment Tournament
was a true stroke of genius.

189
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,668
From now on,

190
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,213
I'd like for you to come up
with these ideas.

191
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,424
Sure. I'll try my best, sir.

192
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,063
A generating unit
is being sent to District A.

193
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,446
We'll move once 6-3 gives us the signal.

194
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,005
What's that?

195
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,016
Crazy refugee bastard.
I ought to run him over.

196
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,902
Where are we moving it to?

197
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,112
We're not. We're destroying it.

198
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,500
WAITING FOR SIGNAL

199
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,356
Um, sir.

200
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,611
There is a setback
with the operational test.

201
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,862
What?

202
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,698
The generating unit
has been found blown up.

203
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,869
Blown up?

204
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,704
I'm sorry, sir.

205
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,039
They're looking into it.

206
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,377
Mr. Oh.

207
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,880
Mr. Oh!

208
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,871
How do you feel?

209
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,455
Who decided this?

210
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,545
People here live in a nice place
and eat good food every day.

211
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,548
Who made the call?

212
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,967
It wasn't me.

213
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,510
Are people here special?

214
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,678
They were born here.

215
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,723
That makes no sense.

216
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,852
Why do you want to be a deliveryman?

217
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,396
Because--

218
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,857
If you win, you won't have to hide anymore

219
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,610
or worry about
how to get food and air, right?

220
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,905
-Right.
-Then what about your friends?

221
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,406
My friends?

222
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:00,908
-Hey!
-Let's go!

223
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,243
-You won again today!
-Yoon Sa-wol!

224
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,204
-Look at the oxygen and the masks!
-Good job.

225
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,789
They'll ask you the same questions.

226
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,168
"Who made the call? Why are they special?"

227
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,433
Don't think about anything
other than the final.

228
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,436
Where are you going?

229
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,939
What's my job?

230
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,232
A deliveryman.

231
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,317
That's right. I have work to do.

232
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,364
I heard you requested people's
personal bio data from the DIC.

233
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,407
I did.

234
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,867
Do you plan to abandon the inferior ones?

235
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,287
We can't accommodate everyone
in the relocation.

236
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,206
We need to make the choice
you made in the past again, sir.

237
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,583
That so-called choice.

238
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,087
Do you understand
how big a decision it is?

239
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,631
Only 1% of the population came down here.

240
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,342
I abandoned the other 99%.

241
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:43,969
I'm aware.

242
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,514
But Cheonmyeong must lead
the relocation plan.

243
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,268
This time, I'll be the one to make
the decision that once pained you.

244
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,021
The government will lead
the relocation plan.

245
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:59,109
Everyone who lives and breathes
will be included, even the refugees.

246
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,778
It's too risky to include
the refugees in our plan.

247
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,780
We can't produce enough oxygen!

248
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,199
It'll work if everyone wears
an oxygen mask.

249
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,492
Father!

250
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,057
DANGER, OVERSUPPLY OF OXYGEN

251
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,568
Useless vermin.

252
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,366
You take after me too much.

253
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,035
Of course I do. I'm your son.

254
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,620
And that bothers me.

255
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,456
I don't like that you're like me.

256
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,335
If you don't like that I take after you,

257
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,922
then I'll show you a different side.

258
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,431
Your opponent tomorrow.

259
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,725
Joo Gyeong-nam is
the strongest candidate thus far.

260
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,230
His physique is good.
Speed, strength, and technique also.

261
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,149
He's good all round.

262
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,235
Is he stronger than 5-8?

263
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,736
No one's stronger than him.

264
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,822
Why else would he be a legend?

265
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,408
Then, I've got a chance.

266
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,121
Know what your strength is?

267
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,415
What is it?

268
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,292
Baseless confidence.

269
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,462
Is that a compliment?

270
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,215
Why do I even bother?

271
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,302
Keep watching.

272
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,613
They're sending broadcast trucks
to parts of the Refugee District.

273
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,116
Cheonmyeong's guys are everywhere,
causing unrest in the District.

274
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,868
They're airing the final round live?

275
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,121
JOO GYEONG-NAM VS REFUGEE 034

276
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,043
Maybe they're doing it
because Yoon Sa-wol's a refugee.

277
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,878
Did they air us live when we won?

278
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,047
-No.
-They didn't.

279
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,883
This tournament started with 5-7's death.

280
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,012
Let's visit each district in teams of two
after we finish work.

281
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,263
-Okay.
-Yes.

282
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,437
Are you going to the match?

283
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,980
After I finish my deliveries.

284
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,161
Okay, turn it a little to the left.

285
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,414
Hey, is this left?

286
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,417
No, you idiot, it's the other side!

287
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,547
No, I'm asking
if it's our left or his left.

288
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,464
Right.

289
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,757
We can just ask.

290
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,300
Oh, right.

291
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,263
Grandpa,

292
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,223
do you mean our left?

293
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,767
Grandpa, it's your left, right?

294
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:07,274
Just turn it to whichever side slowly
until I tell you to stop.

295
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,400
-Okay?
-Yeah.

296
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,444
All right, this way.

297
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,739
Hey, is this right?

298
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,451
Oh, you did it. We have a signal.

299
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,578
Stop! I said stop!

300
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,496
Grandpa!

301
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,418
They're going wild out there.

302
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,255
There will be
a special live broadcast of the final

303
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,591
as a refugee participant
has made it to the round.

304
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,552
We can all watch it. Should we go?

305
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,262
They're giving out gifts too.

306
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,430
-Huh? Gifts?
-Gifts?

307
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,559
Wow, Cheonmyeong's looking after
the refugees too?

308
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,893
I want a gift too!

309
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,271
PROCESSED FOOD
COMPRESSED OXYGEN

310
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,898
We'll be giving out
compressed oxygen and food supplies

311
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,109
to those who watch the final round today.

312
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,029
There will be
a special live broadcast of the final

313
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,573
as a refugee participant
has made it to the round.

314
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,161
Going to a crowded place never ends well.

315
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,164
Let's watch it here, okay?

316
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,344
We have arrived at the Core District,
5 km below the surface.

317
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,113
What is this place?

318
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,698
The Air Road.

319
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,660
It's filled entirely with circulating air,

320
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,287
so you don't need to wear masks
in the Core District.

321
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,720
What's this?

322
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,604
The air's completely different here.

323
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,777
Don't let your guard down.

324
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,861
This isn't a picnic.

325
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,929
She's here.

326
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,061
Hello, ma'am.

327
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,195
I see the chairman isn't here.

328
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,032
No, ma'am. Is something the matter?

329
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,869
We finished writing up
our Resident Relocation Plan.

330
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,372
Cheonmyeong will lead the relocation plan.

331
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,208
I thought we already settled that.

332
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,088
Ma'am, you can't just do this.

333
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:21,217
I'm the head of the government.
There's nothing I can't do.

334
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,895
Did you cross Hannam Bridge?

335
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,522
No, I'm crossing it now.
Heading to the delivery station.

336
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,066
I just passed two black SUVs.
Something's fishy.

337
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,277
-Why?
-They didn't have license plates.

338
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,530
They're heading toward
the Kyobo Tower intersection.

339
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,366
No plates?
They could be those tattooed guys.

340
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,285
Are they trying to kidnap more kids?

341
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,453
I'll go check it out.

342
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,001
Is it you guys?

343
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,650
Who the hell are you?

344
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,567
Me?

345
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,820
A deliveryman.

346
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,321
Who are you?

347
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,945
I won't be fooled again.

348
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,285
The final round
of the Deliveryman Recruitment Tournament

349
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,620
will now begin!

350
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,544
A former soldier,

351
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,921
Joo Gyeong-nam!

352
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,842
From the Refugee District,

353
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,386
Refugee 034!

354
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,023
Each round is five minutes,

355
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,610
with the match ending
only when we have our final winner.

356
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,203
Each round is five minutes,

357
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,538
and the match will only end
with a knockout.

358
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,791
Touch gloves.

359
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,639
Fight!

360
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,644
FINAL ROUND
JOO GYEONG-NAM, REFUGEE 034

361
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,846
Get it together, Yoon Sa-wol!

362
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,847
Get out of there!

363
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,474
Get up!

364
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,199
Stop!

365
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,451
The first round is over.

366
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,125
This is a bit of a letdown,

367
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,712
considering all your efforts
and preparations, Mr. Ryu.

368
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,007
The second round will begin
after a three-minute break.

369
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,553
It's only the first round.
Give it more time.

370
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,350
You can't let him
get to your chin so easily.

371
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,644
I wanted to see how strong he is.

372
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,313
He's weaker than 5-8.

373
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,610
I can do this.

374
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,664
Is what you're doing so important
you'd kill yourselves?

375
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,556
REPORT YOUR LOCATION

376
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,146
Yes, sir?

377
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,940
No problems with the plan?

378
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,650
It's going without a hitch, sir.

379
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,011
Fight!

380
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,683
Hey, wasn't the first round a total bust?

381
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,519
It's okay.

382
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,146
He just needs to knock him out.

383
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,191
I'll let you punch me more, come on.

384
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,817
What the hell are you on about?

385
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,092
REFUGEE PLAN

386
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,677

393
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949

Those crazy bastards.

397
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,217
It looks like this round will be it.

398
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,097
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes, sir.

399
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,403
You should look at this now.

400
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,408
REFUGEE KIDNAPPING PLAN

401
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,173
The bleeding will get worse.
Are you going to be okay?

402
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,133
I'm going to finish it in this round.

403
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,594
I can see his pattern.

404
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,764
Good.

405
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,640
Finish it.

406
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,901
It's an emergency. Head over
to a nearby Refugee District now.

407
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,402
Got it.

408
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,916
The third round will begin soon.

409
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,293
There are no limits
to the number of rounds,

410
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,254
and the fight will only end
when a fighter is knocked out.

411
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,810
-Is this about becoming a deliveryman?
-Seol-ah, I think he's got a chance.

412
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,894
Help me win this.

413
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,729
Prove yourself.

414
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,359
Fight!

415
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,191
