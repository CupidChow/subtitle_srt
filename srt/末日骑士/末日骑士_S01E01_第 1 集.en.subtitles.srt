00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,703
Forty years ago,
a comet collided with Earth.

3
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,127
Since then, most continents
have been submerged,

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,548
and the Korean Peninsula
has turned into a desert.

5
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,973
Only 1% of the population survived.

6
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,479
The survivors needed
new inventions and a new order.

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,196
The polluted air led to the invention
of the gigantic Air Core,

8
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,114
which converts oxyanium into oxygen.

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,411
And the scarce resources

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,289
led to a division of the population

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,377
into General, Special, and Core,
separated by QR codes.

12
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,422
GENERAL DISTRICT
SPECIAL DISTRICT, CORE DISTRICT

13
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,511
However, those who were not chosen
live miserable lives

14
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,221
labeled as refugees.

RELIEF SUPPLIES TRANSPORT VEHICLE

16
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,437
Some refugees, tired of discrimination,
starvation, and lack of oxygen,

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,607
become hunters
and start plundering and robbing.

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,945
Deliverymen.

19
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,742
We deliver oxygen and necessities
that keep people alive.

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,499
We must fight through the sandy desert
and its polluted air,

21
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,417
fend off attacks by brutal hunters,

22
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,879
and arrive at the designated time,
on the dot.

23
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,888
Deliverymen must be tough.

24
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,683
Because they must risk their lives

25
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,394
to protect their trucks
from the attacks of the hunters.

26
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,782
That's why people

27
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,577
dream of becoming deliverymen.

28
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,501
For the refugees with no QR codes
in particular, becoming a deliveryman…

29
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,753
is their only hope.

32
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,378
It might be tough.

33
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,466
Man, those bastards are
a bunch of cowards!

34
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,802
Dummy, Dumb-dumb.

35
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,471
-What?
-Yeah?

36
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,308
We're here just watching the fight,
so aren't we the real cowards?

37
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,270
-Yeah.
-You're right.

38
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,280
I haven't got all day, you punks!

39
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,950
He won.

40
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,411
-Hey!
-Let's go!

41
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,789

You won again today!

You cut it close again, sir.

59
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,254
You should order
before the oxygen level falls below 20%.

60
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,884
I guess my time's almost up.
I keep forgetting.

61
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,141
Mr. Lee Yeong-su, recipient confirmed.

62
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,477
It's been a while
since you last ordered food.

63
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,729
Are you eating your meals?

64
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,066
I'm low on coins,
so I only eat one meal a day.

65
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,151
-Sir.
-Stop nagging.

66
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:47,323
I'm still better off
than the refugees out there.

67
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,034
Sure.

68
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,412

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,972
Load it quickly before backup arrives
and makes life hard for us.

70
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,808
Okay, all loaded! Let's go, sir!

71
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,191
Wait. Let's take that.

72
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,157
We won't have to worry about starving
until the hand rots.

73
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,931
The gun.

74
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,106
I told you not to touch
anything that breathes.

75
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,777
Aren't you off today?

76
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,156
You waited for my day off to target
a newbie and went for his hand?

77
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,824
We have to make a living too.

78
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,993
Then tough it out as refugees.

79
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,287
Instead of dying as hunters.

80
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,915
Fuck you and your lectures, motherfucker.

81
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,376
You gonna shoot me?

82
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,294
Yes.

83
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,672
-I will shoot!
-Here I come.

84
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,461
Please don't kill me. Please!

85
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,510
Bummer.

86
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,513

Mr. Yoon Sa-wol.

94
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,898
Can't you at least eat before you run off?

95
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,744
Ms. Park Myeong-hui, you're under arrest

96
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,288
for harboring a refugee
and violating the General District laws.

97
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,666
No, I just felt bad for him.

98
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,376
-Ma'am!
-Let the kid go!

99
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,462
Just take me, not the kid!

100
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,672
Ma'am.

101
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,173
Ma'am!

102
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,357
Okay.

103
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,738
Hands up.

104
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,889
I don't see any progress.

105
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,932
I'm trying!

106
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,648
The two of you wreck the place,
and I'm the one cleaning it up.

107
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,901
Ow, my back.

108
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,744
I warned you
they were cracking down on refugees,

109
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,663
yet you not only wandered outside
but gambled with supplies?

110
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,582
Ow. Ouch!

111
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,127
I mean,

112
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,756
I win, and win again,
and then win yet again.

113
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,383
And now, I can't find
anyone to challenge me.

114
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,303
This is all part of my training--

115
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,556
Challenge? Training?
Is this about becoming a deliveryman?

116
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,602
Seol-ah, I think he's got a chance.

117
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,979
I've seen him fight a few times,

118
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,231
and he's definitely
much stronger than before--

119
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,693
Do you also go
outside the General District?

120
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,196
You were supposed to stop him,
yet you take his side?

121
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,198
Assume the position.

122
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,201
Me?

123
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,702
No, Seol-ah.

124
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,580
Seul-ah didn't do anything. It's my fault.

125
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,081
Rough me up. Just me. Yeah.

126
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:11,999
Here.

127
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,629
You think anyone can become a deliveryman?

128
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,299
Going around fighting people
won't make you a general citizen.

129
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,802
I told you I'd find a way.

130
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,719
A way?

131
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,680
-What way?
-What?

132
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,225
How on earth are you
going to implant a code here?

133
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,980
A DIC major like you must be terrified
for harboring a refugee alone. Now what?

134
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,400
-Will you buy me someone's hand illegally?
-Sa-wol!

135
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,194
It's been nearly ten years.

136
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,448
I know you're frustrated
because there is no way.

137
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,492
So just stop trying.

138
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,371
I don't want to put you two in danger.

139
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,707
Yeah, I don't want to be in danger either,
so don't fool around.

140
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,875
That's the safest.

141
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,752
Me getting lost would be the safest.

142
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,795
Yoon Sa-wol!

143
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,756
I told you not to talk shit about leaving!

144
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,347
Your future doesn't look bright.

145
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,226
I'm disappointed.

146
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,228
What?

147
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,693
You could end this entire family

148
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,820
before you become a deliveryman.

149
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,197
So, Yoon Sa-wol.

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,158
-You're grounded for a week.
-What?

151
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,536
Come on! A week?

152
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,956
Look here, Major Jung Seol-ah,
aren't you being too harsh?

153
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
Am I?

154
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,293
-Then 15 days.
-Fifteen days.

155
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,005
Fine, 15 days, starting tomorrow.
I'll lock him up and watch him closely.

156
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,381
Oh, come on!

157
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,758
Make it a week.

158
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,926
It could be a month.

159
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,516
Okay. Fine.

160
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,561
Fifteen days it is.

161
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,066

The population is overflowing,
and you can't see the sky or the forests,

181
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,626
so people develop depression
and panic disorders…

182
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,671
It's inevitable.

183
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,842
That's why this relocation plan
is so important to the citizens.

184
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,018
Lots of issues are cropping up everywhere.

185
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,522
I must have botched things
when I was designing the place.

186
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,026
It's been 40 years
since you made this place, Mr. Ryu.

187
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,946
You dug five kilometers below the surface

188
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,281
and built this world
in such a short period.

189
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,159
Once the construction of District A
is complete,

190
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,914
you'll have created
a new environment for us yet again.

191
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,791
Thank you for saying that.

192
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,418
My time must be approaching.
My confidence is gone,

193
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,212
and I'm only awash with regret.

194
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,549
Don't say that.
You're still healthy and strong.

195
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,219
Don't let it bother you.
Just focus on the relocation plan.

196
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,098
It sounds like you're telling me

197
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,642
to die once I finish the plan.

198
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,439
I didn't expect to see you,
Madam President.

199
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,983
Shall I leave you two alone?

200
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,609
No, we've been waiting for you.

201
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,326
I heard the Air Road is complete.

202
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,329
When is the operational test?

203
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,623
I can't give you an exact date yet.

204
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,959
Have you been
to the District A construction site?

205
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,253
Is the schedule being delayed?

206
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,090
I heard the reports to the government
are not being delivered on time.

207
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,134
My priority is to report to you.

208
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:41,638
The construction is almost complete.
Sharing information promptly is a must.

209
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,598
I apologize.

210
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,192
When can I expect to see it?

211
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,824
I'll visit soon and let you know.

212
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,993
All right.

213
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,872
"Soon."

214
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,601
Why do you antagonize the government?

215
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,103
Father.

216
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,942
This whole world
is Cheonmyeong's creation.

217
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,362
But they wasted a year
meddling in our affairs.

218
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,156
Telling us what to do
doesn't help anything.

219
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
You think Cheonmyeong is yours?

220
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,787
No. You are Cheonmyeong itself, Father.

221
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,289
Yes, never forget that, no matter what.

222
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,041
Never.

223
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
Yoon Sa-wol.

224
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,384
FIFTEEN DAYS FROM TOMORROW!

225
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,760
He's a lost cause.

226
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,180
You might imprison me

227
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,017
There might be fine dust everywhere
Before my eyes

228
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,104
But I will forge my own path

229
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,440
I will forge my own path

230
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,821
Grandpa!

231
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,573
Useless!

232
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,076
Dummy and Dumb-dumb!

233
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:27,995
Where are you?

234
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,539
Grandpa!

235
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,250
Jeez, you're so loud!

236
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,877
Hey! You're still alive.

237
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,004
You punk,

238
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,089
I don't plan on dying

239
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:43,176
until I fix that rude mouth of yours.
Got it?

240
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,594
That hurts!

241
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,597
You know I can't help it
because I'm uneducated!

242
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,267
Sa-wol, you ignoramus,
will you let us study in peace?

243
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,185
Grandpa says studying makes us decent.

244
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,647
Forget it. It's freaking hard
to become a decent person,

245
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,732
so let's go out.

246
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
-Go out?
-Where?

247
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,111
I'll be grounded from tomorrow.
Let's make some trouble today.

248
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,126
SLOW
30 KM/H

249
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,425
Air pollution level rising.

250
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,138
Let's go.

251
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,565
30 km/h speed limit zone.
Automatically decelerating.

252
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,941
WARNING
SPEED LIMIT 30 KM/H

253
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,621
Useless! Run faster, hurry!

254
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
You go up first.

255
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,158
The kids are going mad
now the world is destroyed.

256
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,621
We're going to crash! Get down!

257
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,246
Farewell.

258
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,164
ELECTRICITY

259
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,765
Your friends all got off.

260
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,684
Are you…

261
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,271
Are you the legendary deliveryman 5-8?

262
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,564
You're rude, aren't you?

263
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,483
You want to know who I am?

264
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,818
My name is Sa-wol. Yoon Sa-wol.

265
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,153
I don't want to know,

266
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,571
and I didn't ask.

267
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,947
Shut up and fight me.

268
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,715
What the heck?

269
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,509
He's freaking strong.

270
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,849
He's got no manners and no fear.

271
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,129
It's coming.

272
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,423
A big one's coming.

273
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,467
DISTRICT A

274
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,470
It looks even more hideous than before.

275
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,767
UNKNOWN SENDER
GATE 8, 1700

276
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,979
Did the mission fail?

277
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,791
Air Core.

278
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,502
It's sooner than I expected.

279
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,150
Has the armed protest been
completely suppressed?

280
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,070
Yes, the guard force
quelled it completely.

281
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,364
I should have called you earlier…

282
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,034
Anyway, thank you
for coming all the way here.

283
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,829
Since I'm here, I'd like to see
the head of the guard force.

284
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,500
Even you can't go in there
without prior authorization, Major.

285
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,128
I understand
it's important to maintain secrecy,

286
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,755
but you can't restrict access
to a major of the DIC.

287
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,590
I've told you time and time again.

288
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,927
Cheonmyeong's in charge
of District A construction.

289
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,972
Please don't take it the wrong way.
I ask for your understanding.

290
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,565
Where are they going?

291
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,150
They are Cheonmyeong's assets,

292
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,362
which means they are not
under your purview either, Major.

293
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,960
It's strange they'd go this far
to stop people from seeing District A.

294
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,838
That's what I wonder the most about too.

295
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,384
That jackass head guard hightails it
whenever I show up,

296
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,846
and that sly Director Oh keeps using
Cheonmyeong as an excuse.

297
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,934
The head guard is over 50 years old.
Calling him a jackass is too…

298
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,522
good, I think.

299
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,820
Damn it!

300
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,324
Idiot, don't you know how to drive?

301
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,742
Sir…

302
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,410
It wasn't my…

303
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,878
All-round defense!

304
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,766
Open the door.

305
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,064
Stop, hands up!

306
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,151
What's going on?

307
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,321
I hate people pointing guns at me.

308
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,241
I'm Major Jung Seol-ah of the DIC.
Is this your vehicle?

309
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,701
Cheonmyeong Group is the owner.

310
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,702
I know that.

311
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,913
Please answer the question.

312
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,252
Yes, I drive this vehicle. Major.

313
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,587
The area near District A is off-limits.

314
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,423
Why is your delivery vehicle off-route?

315
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,593
I got lost because of the tornado
and saw another path.

316
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,721
-Where did you go when you left the truck?
-Does that matter?

317
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,348
I asked you where you went.

318
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,447
I

319
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,074
was

320
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,701
relieving

321
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,411
myself.

322
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,329
Let me check your ID.

323
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,591
IDENTITY CONFIRMED

324
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,095
Please leave immediately.

325
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,445
Get in the car.

326
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:02,962
She's snippy.

327
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,651
I'm home.

328
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,425
Did you have fun today?

329
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,095
Huh?

330
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,555
Yeah.

331
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,265
Go to your room.

332
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,642
My room?

333
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,190
What could these be?

334
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,110
That should be enough.

335
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,903
Hey!

336
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,862
LOCKED

337
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,490
-Commencing QR code lockdown.
-What are you doing?

338
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,659
Sa-wol, put yourself in my shoes.

339
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,954
You couldn't even stay put for a day.
What else could I do?

340
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,871
Come on.

341
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,082
Something huge happened today.

342
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,251
Just open the door.
I'll tell you everything.

343
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,752
Okay, talk.

344
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,796
I'll listen to everything from here.

345
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,340
Dinner, yeah.
Let's talk about this over dinner.

346
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,970
The delivery box has enough food
to last you for 15 days.

347
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,267
I promise that I won't set foot outside
from tomorrow.

348
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,103
-I swear, seriously.
-You swear?

349
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,689
I've been thinking all day.

350
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,360
Do you know how many times you've kept
a promise over the past ten years?

351
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,612
How many times?

352
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,114
Zero.

353
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,699
Not even once.

354
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,616
Hey!

355
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,202
Still, locking me up is too much.

356
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,954
Listen to Seol-ah and me this once.

357
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,582
Seul-ah! Jung Seul-ah!

358
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,959
You must scan your QR code.

359
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,551
REFUGEE DISTRICT - LABOR MARKET

360
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,280
Are you on your own?

361
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,491
No.

362
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,412
Dad went to get oxygen.

363
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,211
I GAVE MY ALL TO BECOME A DELIVERYMAN

364
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,254
What's that book?

365
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,469
I'm going to become a deliveryman.

366
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,722
Oh, really?

367
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,684
Yes, it's what I really want.

368
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,562
I'll help the refugees,

369
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,273
like 5-8,

370
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,192
and give them oxygen and food.

371
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,113
Anyway, I'll become
a beacon of hope for refugees,

372
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,032
like 5-8.

373
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,917
Hey, mister.

374
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,799
They suppressed
the armed protest at District A,

375
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
so we failed to delay the construction.

376
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,012
We can't reach our informant either.

377
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,223
That idiot. Must be dead.

378
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,394
The Air Core's in District A now.

379
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,439
You'll need to go this time.

380
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,900
Okay.

381
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,443
Yeah.

382
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
PROCESSED FOOD

383
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,458
It'll be a bit short this time.

384
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,751
We'll be back soon.

385
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,422
Thank you, as always, for showing up
just when we are about to die.

386
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,218
I say this every time,
but split it fairly.

387
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,719
-Okay.
-Here.

388
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,608
Heart rate and blood pressure
are all normal.

389
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,236
I'll come by again before the delivery.

390
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,320
Thank you.

391
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,656
Here.

392
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,453
Thank you.

393
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,461
Challenger knocked out
in 3 minutes 23 seconds.

394
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,463
God, so dang strong.

395
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,968
Are you losing on a full stomach?

396
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,514
If I eat, I have to poop. Would you eat?

397
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,602
-What's with the gross remark?
-It's from a rebellious youth.

398
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,355
Youth, my ass.
A crazy seven-year-old is more like it.

399
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,900
Deliveryman, identity confirmed.

400
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,026
We got a package!

401
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,445
Disinfection complete.

402
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,326
You're not Deliveryman 5-7.

403
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,621
He couldn't be here, so I came instead.

404
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,922
-Ms. Jung Seul-ah, recipient confirmed.
-5-8?

405
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,382
Ah, yes.

406
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,716
Are you the 5-8?

407
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,802
-Yes.
-No way!

408
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,136
Wow.

409
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,389
Wow, could you…

410
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,682
Could you please take a picture with me?

411
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,600
What's going on?

412
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,520
Just one more, please.

413
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,437
5-8?

414
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,568
-Why am I hiding?
-Thank you!

415
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,569
I'll be off, then.

416
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,904
I did nothing wrong.

417
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,282
-Take care.
-Bye.

418
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,200
Bye.

419
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,787
Oh my God!

420
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,477
You looked so thrilled.

421
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,729
"Just one more, please."

422
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,940
"Thank you!"

423
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,609
"Take care."

424
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,162
He's better looking in person.

425
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,746
You're doomed.

426
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,458
You lose in both fighting and looks.

427
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,375
No.

428
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,836
I'm way better looking.

429
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,130
Sure.

430
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,222
Deliveryman, identity confirmed.

431
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,018
What is it?

432
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,603
FRONT GATE OPEN

433
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,623
Who the hell are you? What are you doing?

434
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,957
Inject her quickly!

435
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,426
You must scan your QR code.

436
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,767
Is someone else here?

437
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,851
Go and check.

438
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,826
Seul-ah. Are you okay?

439
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,287
Jung Seul-ah.

440
