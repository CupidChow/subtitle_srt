1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,104
BLACK KNIGHT

2
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,271
Yes, sir?

3
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,982
No problems with the plan?

4
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,235
No. It's going without a hitch, sir.

5
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,133
There were similar explosions
at the other refugee squares too.

6
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,511
Broadcasting the final round was bait.

7
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,849
I think you should see him.

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,434
Yeah.

9
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,731
Tell me who told you to do this,
you bastard.

10
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,743
What's next?

11
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,371
What are you gonna do next?

12
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,509
How many psychos like you are out there?

13
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,055
Who knows?

14
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,725
You goddamned scumbag.

15
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,733
It'd be easier to just die, huh?

16
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,034
I'll kill you.

17
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,371
DELIVERYMAN RECRUITMENT TOURNAMENT
WINNER

18
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,759
How do you feel?

19
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,263
Did you know from the beginning?
That I'm a mutant?

20
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,977
Time to go.

21
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,398
Talk about this later.

22
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,108
With 5-8, not me.

23
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,968
5-7, status registration complete.

24
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,013
Was it all for this?

25
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,766
They were trying to wipe out the refugees.

26
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,393
It's all clear now.

27
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,354
Their plan doesn't include refugees.

28
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,735
Shouldn't we tell the refugees
and join forces with them?

29
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,486
We can't let them do this again.

30
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,989
What happened nine years ago will repeat.

31
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,075
Collective action
will only give them an excuse.

32
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,372
We'll move first this time.

33
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,754
Infiltrate the Core District?

34
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,298
No.

35
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,886
We'll capture Ryu Seok.

36
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,059
I've never seen
such a healthy mutant before.

37
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,103
Shouldn't we send him
to the lab right away?

38
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,105
No.

39
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,484
There are too many eyes and ears on us.

40
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,653
We'll take it slow.

41
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,282
Let's leave him
until we get his test results back.

42
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,453
We may be able to make up
for the human experiment failures so far.

43
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,040
You look more excited than me.

44
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,335
All I ever do is worry about you, sir.

45
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,298
Anyway, the refugee removal plan
and the tournament were huge successes.

46
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,258
Congratulations, sir.

47
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,765
How bad was it?

48
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,393
What?

49
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,479
I don't know.

50
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,067
They just turned to ashes before my eyes.

51
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,161
Take time to mourn those who passed.

52
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,539
Go around to each district

53
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,333
and tell everyone
to be careful for a while.

54
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,794
Do you understand?

55
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,795
Yes.

56
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,422
All right.

57
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,757
Sa-wol won,

58
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,260
but we can't be happy!

59
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,764
If it weren't for Grandpa…

60
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,601
we could've died too.

61
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,519
You're right.

62
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
But what's with that wound
on Sa-wol's forehead?

63
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,569
You saw it shine, right?

64
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,114
Is Sa-wol a mutant or something?

65
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,409
I don't know.

66
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,995
Let's ask him when we see him.

67
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,796
I guess you knew I'd come.

68
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,214
You're late.

69
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,143
It looks like a surgical scar.

70
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,478
What is it?

71
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,938
It's the amygdala.

72
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,942
Simply put, he had brain surgery.

73
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,279
He has no emotions, so he can easily kill
and commit suicide too.

74
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,408
The man we caught
blew himself up right before our eyes.

75
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,869
What happened today was a massacre.

76
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,995
That's why I came.

77
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,747
I needed to be sure.

78
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,962
This might help convince you.

79
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,300
DELIVERYMEN, DISTRICT A
KIDNAPPING STATUS

80
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,678
Those we obtained weren't very useful.
Their circuits were burnt.

81
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,931
There are a lot of encrypted files.

82
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,099
Can you decrypt them?

83
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,770
-What I want to know is--
-Their next plan?

84
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,273
And the GPS data.

85
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,198
You want to find their leader?

86
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,700
I like to give back as good as I got.

87
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,660
A question, then.

88
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,081
What is it that you and the ten
refugee-turned-deliverymen want?

89
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,291
A world without Cheonmyeong.

90
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,213
I don't know
if I can help you get that far.

91
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,050
Take a look at that and decide
how far you'll help us get.

92
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,060
I can't move without concrete evidence.

93
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,771
Of course. You're a soldier.

94
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,316
Air purification in progress.

95
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,111
Pollution level three, average.

96
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,700
Air purification in progress.

97
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,578
Pollution level three, average.

98
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,210
RESIDENT ID VERIFICATION

99
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,046
READING QR CODE

100
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,174
5-7, resident identity confirmed.

101
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,776
I have my own place now.

102
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,501
DELIVERYMAN 5-7

103
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,636
CHEONMYEONG GROUP DELIVERYMAN MANUAL

HOW TO HANDLE PACKAGES AND QR CODE

105
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,265
Looks good on you, Mr. Deliveryman.

106
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,788
Seul-ah must be so happy.

107
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,873
Yeah.

108
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,548
Why aren't you asking?

109
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,259
About what?

110
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,594
About how I'm a mutant.

111
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,434
Can you shoot flames or fly?

112
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,062
I don't know about that.

113
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,319
Now that everyone knows you're a mutant,

114
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,655
there's going to be
a lot of attention on you.

115
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,158
Never let your guard down.

116
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,204
Okay.

117
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,561
-What is it?
-The chairman wants you.

118
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,775
Are things progressing well?

119
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,612
Yes. We've extracted mutant stem cells
from Yoon Sa-wol's blood.

120
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,948
We're preparing a test on a patient
with the same symptoms as yours.

121
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,168
I'm looking forward to it.

122
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,697
5-7, first day of work.

123
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,036
So, Major Jung has the device now?

124
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,913
She does.

125
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,790
Now she knows who we all are.

126
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,000
Can we trust her?

127
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,506
We may be on different paths,
but our destination is the same.

128
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,387
I hope there's concrete evidence
to arrest Ryu Seok.

129
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,640
It's Major Jung who needs evidence.

130
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,350
What?

131
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,646
You've got other plans.

132
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,815
Right?

133
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,827
Where on earth is this guy?

134
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,790
5-8!

135
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,302
-We have a lot to talk about.
-We do. Let's talk after work.

136
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:47,970
Where?

137
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,307
Where do you think?

138
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,752
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

139
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,054
First delivery on my first day of work…

140
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,870
Hundreds of innocent refugees died
right before the relocation.

141
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,124
Tell me why I shouldn't suspect you.

142
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,923
You told me here
that you didn't trust anybody.

143
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,801
I don't think
it'll matter what I tell you.

144
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,555
I'll talk to the president and move up
the relocation plan announcement.

145
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,892
With those mysterious terrorists about,

146
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,646
the refugees will need
a safe place to live as soon as possible.

147
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,356
Sir--

148
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,193
Go over the government's plan
and fix any imperfections,

149
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,113
and set up a meeting as soon as possible.

150
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,419
I've already finished revising any cracks
in the government's plan.

151
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,753
DISTRICT A RELOCATION PLAN

152
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,007
I thought there was nothing I could do
if I failed to convince you.

153
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,885
I'll talk to the president
and take a census of the refugees.

154
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,931
I cannot for the life of me tell
what you are thinking.

155
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,609
I wonder what the guys are doing.

156
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,614
30 km/h speed limit zone.
Automatically decelerating.

157
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,367
So predictable.

158
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,631
-Wow! Yoon Sa-wol!
-Sa-wol!

159
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,468
Sa-wol!

160
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,429
Did you miss me that much?

161
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,473
-Of course!
-Duh!

162
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,308
Hey, by the way,

163
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,810
are you really, like, a mutant?

164
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,145
I don't know either.

165
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,900
But

166
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm a deliveryman now!

167
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,154
-Yoon Sa-wol is the best!
-The best!

168
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,739
5-7 is the best!

169
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,451
Hey, we've been waiting for you.
Give us a ride.

170
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,994
All right, get in.

171
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,871
-Whoa, I'm so excited!
-Let's go.

172
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,122
-For real?
-I'm nervous!

173
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,103
This is awesome.

174
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,241
Don't be too sad.

175
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,160
I'll give you a ride
to the General District next time.

176
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,829
-You mean it?
-I promise.

177
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,456
Go.

178
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,624
-Bye!
-Bye!

179
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,923
Yoon Sa-wol the mutant. Be careful.

180
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,768

00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:07,896
Man.

182
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,066
I used to crawl through holes.
Look at me now.

183
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,538
District Five, Apartment 794.

184
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,920
Deliveryman, identity confirmed.

185
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,469
Disinfection complete.

186
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,271
Oh, wait.
You have to confirm the recipient's ID.

187
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,370
You press this button and then…

188
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,207
-Ms. Park In-hwa, recipient confirmed.
-That's how it's done.

189
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,847
So embarrassing.

190
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,849
I really enjoyed the final round.

191
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,601
How's your forehead?

192
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,518
My forehead?

193
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,730
Well, it's fine, dude.

194
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,274
That's not how you speak to your elder.

195
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,525
Huh?

196
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,072
"Use honorifics to recipients,
regardless of age."

197
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,950
That'll be the toughest.

198
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,494
-The mutant is here!
-Mutant!

199
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,037
It's the mutant!

200
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,414
-Let's fight! Come on!
-Come on!

201
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,042
What are you doing, sirs?
You can't do this!

202
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,877
Sirs!

203
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,003
God, sirs!

204
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,640
Nothing's ever easy.

205
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,816
What a jerk.
Why would you order so much all at once?

206
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,443
I'm going to fall!

207
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,461
I had some tough fun in here.

208
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,592
Come in.

209
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,811
What's this?

210
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,859
What are you doing?

211
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,178
Who is that? And what is this place?

212
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,014
He's part of the group
that murdered your little sister,

213
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,310
and this is a special place
only a select few can enter.

214
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,479
The ones who killed Seul-ah?

215
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,815
While you were busting your ass fighting,
hundreds of refugees died.

216
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,778
Bombs went off

217
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,447
and turned all those people into ash.

218
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,541
Those bastards did that too.

219
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,751
Hundreds?

220
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,004
They lured the refugees
with the final round to massacre them.

221
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,132
Who on earth would do such a thing?

222
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,427
-Cheonmyeong.
-Cheonmyeong?

223
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,596
But why?

224
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,016
Refugees aren't needed
in the world Cheonmyeong's built.

225
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,477
That's how it's been so far,

226
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,145
and how it will continue to be.

227
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,857
That's the reality
of the world you live in.

228
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,405
That's what we're trying to change.

229
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,954
The personal data on the residents
that you asked for.

230
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,331
Thank you.

231
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,042
I was told that you decided
to accommodate the refugees

232
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,419
in the General District.

233
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:45,215
I made revisions to the government plan.
The president and the chairman agreed.

234
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,094
Do you require further assistance
from the DIC with the refugee census?

235
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,303
Of course.

236
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,683
I'd like to run a physical examination
along with the census.

237
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,270
We don't know
what diseases or viruses they have,

238
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,105
so we must consider vaccinating them.

239
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,111
The reality is that more refugees die
from the common cold than from starvation.

240
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,782
I think that is a necessary step
for relocation to the General District.

241
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,494
Why don't you confer with Director Oh
about the logistics?

242
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,163
All right.

243
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,748
Yoon Sa-wol.

244
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,712
No, 5-7.

245
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,213
Yeah.

246
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,132
I've told you everything now.

247
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,635
Any more questions?

248
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,721
No.

249
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,773
You decide if you'll come with us.

250
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,256
Oh gosh.

251
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,134
Package delivery.

252
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,761
For me?

253
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,556
TOURNAMENT WINNER

254
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,350
Goodness…

255
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,852
What's this?

256
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,188
What did you bring me this for?

257
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,566
You fought for this and won it,
so it's yours.

258
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,026
Take it back

259
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,404
and cherish it, you rascal.

260
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,952
-Grandpa.
-What?

261
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,537
I had my dream come true,

262
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
but the world I knew wasn't everything.

263
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,168
Of course, you young pup.
It's only the beginning.

264
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,463
There's a lot more to learn from now.

265
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,966
That's how you become a grown-up,
bit by bit.

266
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,509
Got it?

267
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,598
And that's it for today's lesson.

268
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,519
Don't die before I see you again.

269
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,345
There's ironclad evidence
about the kidnappings and the explosions,

270
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,807
but no traces of Ryu Seok
or Cheonmyeong's involvement.

271
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,437
The encrypted files didn't have anything
about their next plan of action either.

272
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,563
The GPS data?

273
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,233
They move about here and there,
but no repeated coordinates.

274
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,610
Like a splinter group,

275
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,529
they gather when given an order
then scatter again.

276
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,781
Nothing very helpful.

277
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,284
If the DIC takes action
based on so little,

278
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,203
the body will go free,
and we'll be left only with the tail.

279
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,374
Are you sure about Ryu Seok?

280
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,211
Didn't we reach the same conclusion?

281
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,547
They're going with the government's plan.

282
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,176
They'll conduct
physical examinations and a census

283
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,303
to assign refugees
to the General District.

284
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,181
Ryu Seok took a step back.

285
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,642
Do you think he gave up just like that?

286
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,270
That would never happen.

287
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,528
The relocation plan led by the government
will include you, the refugees.

288
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,282
You'll be given relocation rights
to live in the General District.

289
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,825
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND VACCINATION

290
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,161
All refugees must register
their personal information,

291
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,288
go through a simple physical examination,

292
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,375
and get vaccinated
to be reassigned to the General District.

293
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,382
The relocation plan led by the government
will include you, the refugees.

294
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,511
You will be given relocation rights
to live in the General District.

295
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,139
All refugees must register
their personal information,

296
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,141
go through a simple physical examination,

297
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,977
and get vaccinated
to be reassigned to the General District.

298
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,217
Can you move?

299
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,154
Move him to the car, hurry!

300
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,664
Don't let them escape! Get them!

301
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,177
EMERGENCY, MEETING REQUESTED

302
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,906
What's with your face?

303
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,783
What happened?

304
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,537
It's those damn deliverymen.

305
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,621
Deliverymen?

306
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,124
I was ambushed and captured by 5-8.

307
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,835
-5-8?
-Yes.

308
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,211
Him and others.

309
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,046
So, how did you escape?

310
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,006
The rescue team came…

311
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,383
But I didn't send one.

312
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,351
You shouldn't have called me over here,
you moron.

313
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,110
5-8?

314
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,575
Are you asleep?

315
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,002
-Do you think it'll work?
-Of course.

316
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,600
I hate people pointing guns at me.

317
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,310
What are you?

318
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,853
A deliveryman.

319
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,188
What the hell are you planning?

320
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,235
That's what I was going to ask you.

321
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,654
Drop the gun and take a seat.

322
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,667
Are you two on the same side?
Do you think you'll get away with this?

323
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,879
General District kidnappings,
Refugee District explosions,

324
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,047
and murder.

325
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,466
We have a witness,
so I'm placing you under arrest.

326
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,803
What are you playing at?

327
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,725
Will you be okay
if your arrest becomes public?

328
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,019
Your head might blow up.

329
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,980
ACTIVATE

330
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,815
Please forgive me…

331
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,567
Sir, I'm sorry!

332
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,195
I'll never make another mistake again.

333
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,157
STOP

334
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,160
Mr. Oh.

335
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,413
I hope you never forget
how you feel right now.

336
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,377
What do you want?

337
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,337
Will there be more refugee massacres?

338
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,672
Well, there's no need.

339
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,968
-We're going with the government's plan.
-Where are the kidnapped children?

340
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,596
Beats me, but

341
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,307
I doubt they're still alive.

342
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,850
Let's stop wasting time.

343
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,006
How do you like the pain
of being suffocated?

344
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,257
Don't kill me.

345
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,050
Please don't…

346
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,278
What we want is simple.

347
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,532
Information on Ryu Seok
and his whereabouts so we can catch him.

348
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,493
Information and whereabouts?

349
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,913
Would you take the fall for everything
or turn the tables around?

350
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:08,755
All refugees visiting
the examination center for the relocation,

351
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,674
stand in line to register
your personal information.

352
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,803
-Am I done?
-Yes.

353
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,474
You can move into the General District,
barring any health problems.

354
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,892
Okay, thank you.

355
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:25,021
Oh, and tell the others
that they have to get vaccinated soon too.

356
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,606
I will.

357
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,533
These guys are sprightly.

358
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,451
Yeah,

359
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,120
though they do droop at times.

360
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,414
The soil's from far south.

361
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,584
-Far south?
-Yes.

362
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,544
How's the air in the General District?

363
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,174
You still can't last ten minutes
without a mask.

364
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:59,097
I guess the refugees won't get fresh air
even if they manage to go there.

365
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,323
Let's begin.

366
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,059
Mr. Oh.

367
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,437
Is he getting rosier?

368
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,650
Yes, his color has definitely returned.

369
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,924
5-8: 5-7, REPORT CURRENT LOCATION

370
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,675
Where would I be at this hour?

371
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,346
5-7: DOING DELIVERIES
5-8: FIRST MISSION

372
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,565
Air purification in progress.

373
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,450
Air purification in progress.

374
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,913
Air purification in progress.

375
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,056
Pollution level five, dangerous.

376
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,935
Air purification in progress.

377
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,603
AIR POLLUTION LEVEL

378
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,192
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE EMITTED

379
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,923
Those maniacs.
I didn't think they'd go this far.

380
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,426
Cheonmyeong's power comes from oxygen.

381
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,847
If the air gets cleaner,
they'll lose everything.

382
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,645
Seol-ah.

383
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,651
Are you certain they're polluting the air?

384
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,320
We checked it ourselves.

385
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,827
CEO RYU SEOK OFF-SITE SCHEDULE

386
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,162
What will you do now?

387
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,797
We have a rough road ahead of us,

388
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,884
so let's do as we each see fit now.

389
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,891
Are the physical examinations going well?

390
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,517
Yes, despite the explosions,

391
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,061
more people are coming

392
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,481
after word spread about how the refugees
who got the exam are fine.

393
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,655
Refugees who finished registering
their personal information

394
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,242
will receive a basic physical examination
of their height, weight, etc.,

395
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,203
and get a comprehensive vaccine shot.

396
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,040
The comprehensive vaccine was created
by Cheonmyeong Pharmaceuticals…

397
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,668
…and weakened immune systems,

398
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,380
and has gone through
a range of clinical trials and tests

399
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,881
to prove its safety.

400
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,970
There are more refugees than I thought.

401
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,765
I think it must be
because we announced that you'd come.

402
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,687
Once all refugees have completed
their examinations,

403
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,358
the government and Cheonmyeong Group
will announce the relocation plan.

404
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,763
Let's go.

405
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,138
SENDING FILES…

406
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,724
System hacked.

407
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,353
Explosives installed.

408
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,400
Major Jung Seol-ah?

409
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,194
Yes, sir.

410
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,416
AIR PURIFICATION IN PROGRESS

411
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,308
Gotcha.

412
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:37,841
