BLACK KNIGHT

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,172
The target's dead.

4
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,940
We have an incident in District 5-7.
District 5-7…

5
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,609
Fuck.

6
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,258
Are you the legendary deliveryman 5-8?

7
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,510
My name is Sa-wol. Yoon Sa-wol.

8
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,432
-4-1.
-Go on.

9
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,893
-We have a situation here. Hurry.
-Copy that.

10
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,203
Sergeant Lee.

11
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,248
Let's get started.

12
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,167
Come in.

13
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,096
LIVING ROOM LIGHTS

14
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,582
It seems related to the recent
General District kidnappings.

15
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,584
Investigate all possibilities.

16
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,461
Just give me the final report.

17
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,880
I'll make sure
the investigation is thorough.

18
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,968
But about that room…

19
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,928
I'm willing to take the heat.

20
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:06,889
Don't say that.

21
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,267
We're all on your side, ma'am.

22
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,828
Seol-ah!

23
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,290
He opened his eyes.

24
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,838
Seol-ah, the refugee boy is awake!

25
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,304
What's your name?

26
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,848
Sa-wol.

27
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,060
Yoon Sa-wol.

28
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,326
Are you okay? How's your head?

29
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,829
Yoon Sa-wol!

30
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,633
Where am I?

31
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,011
Seul-ah. Where's Seul-ah?

32
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,473
You shouldn't move yet.

33
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,016
Why are you here?

34
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,896
Let me go. I have to go to Seul-ah.

35
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,523
Let go!

36
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,566
The girl's dead.

37
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,943
Dead?

38
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,070
There's nothing you can do.

39
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,988
Bullshit.

40
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,740
I'm going to see for myself.

41
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,701
Let go.

42
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,662
Let go of me!

43
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,474
His skull must have stopped the bullet.

44
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,978
-If it's what I think it is--
-That's enough for today.

45
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,606
-Let's keep this between us for now.
-Okay.

46
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,984
Should I take a look?

47
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,652
I'm fine.

48
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,850
So it wasn't just a rumor.

49
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:59,789
MS. JUNG SEUL-AH'S CREMATION IS COMPLETE

50
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,631
Damn it!

51
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,343
I told you this would break
if you pushed too hard.

52
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,722
I make it sturdy enough to last a year,
but you always ask me to fix it.

53
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,559
-What am I supposed to do?
-Come on, Grandpa.

54
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,187
I'm not the only one
who uses this groundwater pump.

55
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,107
People use it
with different strengths and pressure.

56
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,526
That's why it keeps getting broken.
Am I wrong?

57
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,737
You have a point.

58
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,489
So?

59
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,534
How's the water? Is the stream strong?

60
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,204
It's not so great these days.
The water dribbles out.

61
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,833
We'd better start looking
for another spot.

62
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,711
They're good at finding groundwater,

63
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,838
so take them and look together.

64
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,404
You must've had a hard time
because of Sa-wol.

65
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,200
He had you and his friends here,

66
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,329
so I felt somewhat relieved.

67
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,042
So, what's wrong?
Has something happened to him?

68
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,671
SPECIAL DISTRICT

69
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,679
We've arrived at the Government Complex,
Special District.

70
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,061
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE

71
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,897
All Special District workers
must follow strict working hours…

72
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,649
DIC MAJOR JUNG SEOL-AH'S WITNESS

73
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,566
WITNESS, APPROVED

74
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,984
…to prevent using too much oxygen.

75
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,199
Pleasure seeing you so often.

76
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,992
There's nothing pleasant about this.

77
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,452
Come with me.

78
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,333
Can the family of the victim
conduct the investigation?

79
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,001
How did you know?

80
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,586
The family photos.

81
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,298
The person next to the victim

82
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,009
is sitting in front of me.

83
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,388
We're here for a witness statement
about the District 5-7 case

84
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,307
from you, Deliveryman 5-8,
who called it in.

85
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,644
So we brought you to the meeting room,
not the interrogation room.

86
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,229
Let's begin.

87
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,653
You have heard about the kidnappings
in the General District?

88
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,570
Yes.

89
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,531
The common thread to these kidnappings

90
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,908
is that the security cameras
in the area froze up,

91
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,954
and the memory cards that record
entries and exits have disappeared.

92
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,041
However, the District 5-7 case
is different in that--

93
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,000
It's a murder.

94
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,093
That's right.

95
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,554
It's the only murder,

96
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,640
and it had a witness who also reported it.

97
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,770
If all the victims opened their doors
without suspicion,

98
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,188
we could narrow down

99
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,065
the culprits

100
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,736
to family, soldiers, and deliverymen.

101
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,115
You said I was a witness,
but it feels like I'm a suspect now.

102
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,243
A deliveryman's work log
is recorded down to the minute,

103
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,163
so I know you have an airtight alibi.

104
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,207
I'm just leaving the possibility open.

105
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,544
I have a reasonable suspicion

106
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,046
you may have played a role
in the kidnappings,

107
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,966
like opening the door for the culprits.

108
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,135
Helping the culprits
before reporting them

109
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,720
doesn't seem reasonable.

110
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:47,224
Then tell me what you saw and heard
as the first reporter.

111
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,351
I heard a gunshot…

112
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,775
but when I got to the scene, it was over.

113
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,283
FIVE DECEASED

114
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,951
How many culprits were there?

115
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,995
Did the bodies disappear or something?

116
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,748
The victim was the only body at the scene.

117
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,377
Do you remember their faces
or any of their characteristics?

118
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,258
I'm not sure.
The scene was just so gruesome.

119
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,803
Why did you leave the scene
before we arrived?

120
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,805
You know why better than I do.

121
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,558
A deliveryman must be on time.

122
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,274
Do you think I'm stupid?

123
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,276
You're the one who thinks I'm stupid.

124
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,030
The simulation must have shown you
how many there were and how they acted.

125
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,242
That's not what you're curious about.

126
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,329
The urgent delivery that gave me
no choice but to leave the scene.

127
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,208
If I were you, I'd be curious
about where that delivery went.

128
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,549
Let's wrap things up here for today.
I'm behind on my work.

129
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:24,071
FIVE DECEASED

130
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,656
The primary suppression is over.

131
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,992
Enter the building
and kill all remaining refugee rioters.

132
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,493
REFUGEE DISTRICT, NINE YEARS AGO

133
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,246
CHEONMYEONG MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN

134
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,352
Jung Seol-ah, get it together.

135
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:56,896
I'm sorry, sir.

136
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,113
Please help me.

137
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,744
Yoon Sa-wol.

138
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,464
You don't remember anything?

139
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,343
There are flashes of memories,

140
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,555
but my head hurts too much.

141
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,766
When the pain goes,
I can't remember a thing.

142
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,310
I'm sorry.

143
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,731
I survived alone.

144
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,610
I should have protected her.

145
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,742
No.

146
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm thankful that you survived.

147
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,747
I mean it.

148
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,218
Seul-ah was the reason you couldn't leave.

149
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,889
You were going stir-crazy
stuck in this house.

150
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,184
Go to your friends.

151
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,688
I lived here thinking you were my family.

152
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,276
And it wasn't that I felt stir-crazy here.

153
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,362
I just felt bad for you and Seul-ah.

154
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,438
This is…

155
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,692
Just stay alive.

156
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,822
I'll come by from time to time.

157
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,084
Thanks for everything.

158
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,879
Thank you for saving me,

159
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,798
raising me…

160
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,051
and scolding me.

161
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,637
Thank you for everything.

162
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,532
Air purification in progress.
Pollution level three.

163
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,009
Should I do a search,

164
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,179
or should I wait?

165
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,145
God, I'm exhausted.

166
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,522
Me too.

167
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,571
You couldn't find him?

168
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,364
We've looked everywhere but no luck.

169
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,867
He has to be alive, right?

170
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,579
Hey, why would his sister have come here
if he were dead?

171
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,789
You know what? When this idiot shows up,

172
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,250
I'll beat him within an inch of his life.

173
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,211
You think you can beat Sa-wol? Really?

174
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,714
Why? What? You don't think we can?

175
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,969
Grandpa.

176
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,306
Sa-wol must feel so guilty
that he must want to die, right?

177
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,308
That's how he must feel.

178
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,160
What are you playing at?

179
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,163
Beat me up.

180
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,331
What?

181
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,166
Or just kill me.

182
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,211
This bastard must be nuts!

183
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,680
Get him!

184
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,774
What did I tell you?

185
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,985
He must've wanted to be beaten to death.

186
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,903
Those dirty bastards.

187
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,530
They're going to kill him!

188
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,156
Grab something, okay?

189
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,783
Hey!

190
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,663
You'll end up suffocating anyway.
Had enough?

191
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,040
-Stop it, you jerks!
-Stop it, you jerks!

192
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,297
You've all gone crazy.

193
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,007
Damn it.

194
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,802
Fine, I'll kill all of you tonight!

195
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,554
Stay away!

196
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,806
Just stay there!

197
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,436
-Sa-wol!
-Sa-wol!

198
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,257
We are recruiting construction workers.

199
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,094
Upon completing the contract, you'll get
a year's worth of oxygen and food.

200
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,057
We are recruiting construction workers.

201
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,227
Upon completing the contract, you'll get
a year's worth of oxygen and food.

202
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,317
Hundreds of refugees
have gone into District A recently.

203
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,527
They're desperate
to finish the construction.

204
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,405
Who do you think will handle
the relocation plan?

205
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,033
The government? Or Cheonmyeong?

206
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,286
At this rate,
it's gonna be Cheonmyeong, right?

207
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,456
The refugees' hopes of living
in the General District will be gone.

208
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,127
When you enter District A,
delay the work as much as possible.

209
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,131
You have a knack for ordering
difficult things like it's nothing.

210
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,768
Hasn't the sun gotten a bit brighter?

211
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,025
And my future's gotten darker,
because I have to get on that bus.

212
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,913
No, it's getting brighter.

213
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,380
I was going to beat him up.

214
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,090
What an idiot.

215
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,592
It's been two whole days.

216
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,722
What do you call it? Coma?

217
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,474
Is that what this is?

218
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,852
I… I think it is.

219
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,728
By the way,

220
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,691
would I be a jerk
if I said I was hungry right now?

221
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,528
You guys are jerks anyway,
so go ahead and eat already.

222
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,907
He's right. We have to eat.

223
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,461
You got me into a fight
for the first time ever,

224
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,422
and my record is zero to one.

225
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,793
Is he still out?

226
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:11,134
Sleeping like that might be better
than being awake and beating himself up.

227
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:17,557
Sleep restores your body,
your heart, and even your mind.

228
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,030
You idiot! I was going to help you
live like a human being.

229
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,074
Get it together.

230
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,418
This is Mr. Ryu Seok,
the CEO of the Cheonmyeong Group.

231
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,719
You still call yourself my cousin
when I can't reach you for days?

232
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,763
How does that make me look to Mr. Ryu?

233
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,182
The kidnapped people.

234
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,311
Where are they being sent?

235
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,607
There were talks
of human experiments and stuff.

236
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,069
You moron. Stop spewing nonsense!

237
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,904
I can't do it.

238
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,614
Being a deliveryman

239
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,158
and being the key.

240
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,329
They're both so agonizing.

241
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,290
Mr. 5-7,

242
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,208
what's the problem?

243
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,962
Is it so hard to be the key
to the General District?

244
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,840
Do you think we're taking them away
and hurting them?

245
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,467
I heard it clearly.

246
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,177
The human experiments

247
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,847
and killings.

248
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,516
You just don't understand
what I'm doing here.

249
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,770
I'm not trying to kill people.
I'm trying to save them.

250
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,357
That's why I chose a trustworthy man
such as yourself.

251
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,026
Do you understand?

252
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,243
Fine.

253
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,789
Be our key

254
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,208
for one last time,

255
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,295
and I'll let you live here
in the Core District.

256
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,963
-For the rest of your life.
-Sorry?

257
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,965
He's offering you his kindness.

258
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,842
Say, "thank you."

259
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,095
I'll take care of you
for the rest of your life.

260
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,765
In return…

261
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,520
put your life on the line.

262
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,072
I'm saying, don't forget
what's in the back of your head.

263
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,246
It's worrying how many refugee children
are disappearing.

264
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,873
I got another call yesterday.

265
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,917
The location?

266
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,877
Songpa Refugee District. Male, late teens.

267
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,295
Witnesses?

268
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,673
Many saw him heading
to Gangnam Refugee District.

269
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,300
Two in Seocho and one in Yeouido.

270
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,595
The scope is getting narrower.

271
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,098
A vehicle without plates.
Same as last time.

272
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,309
A vehicle without plates,
heading to Gangnam…

273
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,232
We just need to get one of them.

274
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,987
It's a GPS tracker.

275
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,698
We'll owe you one.

276
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,033
We promise to save you.

277
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,343
Did they fall for it?

278
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,679
We've confirmed the location.

279
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,264
We make our move tonight.

280
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,812
Exit secured.

281
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,356
Exterior stairway taken care of.

282
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,360
Central stairway is open too.

283
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,072
Entering the hallway.

284
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,200
What about 5-7?

285
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,952
He started coming to work again.

286
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,350
What's this?

287
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,227
What are they doing here?

288
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,481
Crazy bastards.

289
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,150
How could they do this to children?

290
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,551
Man.

291
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,311
Sa-wol.

292
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,815
Well… when people die--

293
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,358
They become stars in the sky?

294
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,861
Don't give me that bullshit.

295
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,072
-Okay.
-Actually…

296
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,912
I'd rather they became stars.

297
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,671
Sa-wol!

298
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,880
Sa-wol!

299
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,590
You're up, man!

300
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,469
-Give me your hand!
-Hey!

301
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,848
Hold on tight!

302
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,559
Are you kidding me?

303
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,353
Oh, my boxers, I mean my pants. My pants!

304
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,813
Why did you push me, idiot?

305
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,730
No!

306
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,816
-Useless!
-Useless!

307
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,611
Why did you let go, you idiot?

308
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,029
I'm sorry!

309
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,615
That looks like fun,
as long as he doesn't die.

310
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,619
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

311
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,580
What are you thinking about so intently?

312
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,333
The president's been by.

313
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,421
A disturbance in District A
and a murder in the General District.

314
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,424
What's going on up there?

315
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:29,679
She talks more than she takes action.
She's gone too far with her concerns.

316
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,681
It's not you who has gone too far?

317
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,184
That's why I'm here to brief you.

318
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,271
Forget it.
I've heard all the important stuff.

319
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,815
Do you trust the president more than me?

320
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,445
Son.

321
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,529
Yes, Father.

322
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,742
I don't trust anyone,
not since I came down here.

323
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,370
-Especially you, of all people.
-Why wouldn't you trust your son?

324
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,499
I built this place and developed
the Air Core so I can save more people,

325
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,585
so I can save at least one more.

326
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,504
But I missed out on too many things

327
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,174
because I was busy working for decades.

328
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,635
You peered accurately into the future,

329
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,764
and you've risked everything to build this
with nothing but your cool head.

330
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,023
When you look at that,

331
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,734
what does it remind you of?

332
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,153
I see stupid people

333
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,407
who live in a world you created
yet take everything for granted.

334
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,160
You said Cheonmyeong isn't mine yet.

335
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,244
You're right. But…

336
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,665
you'll give me the credit
I deserve one day.

337
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,926
I can't even fathom

338
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,805
how immense the sorrow in your heart is…

339
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,560
but it will get a bit smaller
when the day passes.

340
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,478
A tiny bit.

341
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,149
And then it will get a little bit smaller

342
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,527
after another day.

343
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,029
And like that, day by day,

344
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:15,118
as you keep on living with the sorrow
that grows smaller and smaller,

345
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,455
it will turn into a longing,
like mine did.

346
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,169
We all live like that,

347
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:31,884
turning our sorrow into a longing.

348
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,971
I get sad, then angry…

349
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,685
but then I start to miss her.

350
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,604
I'm scared.

351
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,777
That I'll forget all these feelings.

352
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,948
Sa-wol, you crazy fool!

353
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,577
You're growing up. You really are.

354
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,680
Son.

355
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,101
I don't trust anyone,
not since I came down here.

356
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:26,314
The Earth was destroyed decades ago,
and people here are going crazy too.

357
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,858
Especially you, of all people.

358
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,323
You don't even know your son's dying.
No wonder I'm going crazy.

359
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,132
EXIT FIVE
APGUJEONG

360
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,948
Everything seems okay up to this point.

361
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,161
Shall I go over to this side?

362
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,876
They keep getting better and then worse.

363
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,757
Maybe it still needs more time.

364
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,425
Could you take a look at this too?

365
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,018
It's from District A.

366
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,562
GENERAL DISTRICT 1-1

367
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,526
What? Do you have something to say?

368
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,071
You have Yoon Sa-wol, don't you?

369
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,448
Sa-wol?

370
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,000
He took a bullet to the back of the head
and survived.

371
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,419
A bullet bounced off him?

372
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,506
He recovers rapidly too.

373
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,260
Did you know

374
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,179
he was a mutant?

375
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,602
His father did work in an oxyanium mine.

376
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,106
He was surrounded by radioactive material.

377
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,733
The children of the mines.

378
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,741
Nearly a hundred refugee children
have disappeared so far.

379
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,536
And there are kidnappings
in the General District too.

380
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,455
They're all young kids

381
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,373
around Sa-wol's age.

382
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,753
Is it important to you that he's a mutant?

383
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,519
He's a mess in body, heart, and mind.

384
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,564
Can't you leave him with me for a while?

385
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,671
DISTRICT 5-7 MURDER CASE

386
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,259
You said I was a witness,
but it feels like I'm a suspect now.

387
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,344
Helping the culprits
before reporting them

388
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,762
doesn't seem reasonable.

389
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,518
ACCESS DENIED

390
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,435
Sergeant Lee.

391
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,065
The minister's office ordered
that the cases in the General District

392
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,733
no longer be under our purview.

393
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,152
-Because of me?
-Yes.

394
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,532
Your relationship with the victim
was mentioned in the official statement.

395
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,038
But don't worry.
We've bought ourselves plenty of time.

396
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,207
Meaning?

397
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,877
Sergeant Lee ordered us to back up
all the data we could access.

398
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,380
I've got the data on the murder.

399
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,048
I've got the ten kidnapping cases.

400
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,093
And I backed up the information
on deliverymen routes.

401
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,181
Thank you, everyone.

402
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,185
Just give us a long holiday
when this case is over.

403
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,443
-A holiday?
-Yes. A holiday.

404
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,249
5-7
DELIVERYMAN, CHEONMYEONG

405
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,460
5-7.

406
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,672
DELIVERY STATION

407
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,715
He didn't show up at the meeting place?

408
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,259
No, sir.

409
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,222
CONTROLLER
5-7

410
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,392
I have no choice.

411
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,020
Sir, I'll knock some sense into him
in any way I can.

412
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,730
Just give him another chance.

413
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,856
Mr. Oh.

414
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,776
Do you know why I do this myself?

415
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,986
Because it's important.

416
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,071
Yes.

417
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,449
But when I make someone else do this work,
they get the wrong idea.

418
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,202
That this won't happen to them.

419
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,913
You're right.

420
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,458
The kidnappings.

421
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,086
-You're the key, aren't you?
-Yes.

422
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,464
Who are those tattooed men?
Are they with Cheonmyeong?

423
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,509
I don't know.

424
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,718
I'm sorry.

425
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,555
They got taken away and killed
because of me and--

426
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,851
Taken away? Where to?

427
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,644
No. Never mind.

428
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,562
I don't know.

429
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,022
Everything will be fine if I die.
I need to die.

430
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,109
Tell me everything you know.
Where have they been taken?

431
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,779
For human experiments…

432
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,824
What was that?

433
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,550
DECEASED

434
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,968
It's too bad.

435
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:12,845
No, sir.

436
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,640
He's always had a screw loose.
He's been a burden on the family.

437
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,558
Oh.

438
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,145
I heard the dead target
was the sister of a DIC major.

439
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,146
Yes, sir.

440
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,941
Their father was a manager
of an oxyanium mine.

441
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,944
Is the major our target too?

442
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,237
No, sir.

443
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,282
She was born before her father
got stationed at the mine.

444
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,951
I was going to tell you about it…

445
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:36,911
OH JI-HWAN

446
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,249
Mr. Oh.

447
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,085
You've gotten very sloppy lately.

448
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,214
ACTIVATED

449
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,175
Sir, I'm sorry!
I'll never make another mistake again.

450
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,719
Sir…

451
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,185
Please forgive me…

452
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,645
STOP

453
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,191
Mr. Oh.

454
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,442
Yes, sir?

455
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,445
I hope you never forget
how you feel right now.

456
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,573
I won't, sir.

457
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,451
And one more thing.

458
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,578
We need a new deliveryman to be the key.

459
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,872
Shall we select one right away?

460
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,127
No.

461
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,630
Mistakes must not be repeated.

462
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,385
I think we need an event
that will distract everyone

463
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,720
for the sake of our bigger plan.

464
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,055
An event?

465
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,435
It's been a while since we put on a show.

466
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,040
-What's his ranking?
-Thirteenth.

467
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,459
He's taking the blows well.

468
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,507
Did you see the announcement about 5-7?

469
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,218
What does it say?

470
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,887
They say he died from overwork.

471
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,850
We've had people killed by hunters,
but working to death is bullshit.

472
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,146
When are they replacing him?

473
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,856
It might take a while.

474
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,817
They're going to do it right
this time, apparently.

475
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,527
"Do it right"?

476
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,453
Nice one!

477
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,009
4-1 does have an awesome kick.

478
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,512
5-8!

479
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,139
5-8, get in here!

480
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,477
-Me?
-Yeah.

481
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,925
What's this?

482
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,519
Here.

483
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,903
Finally, the opportunity
to make your dream come true.

484
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,405
DELIVERYMAN RECRUITMENT TOURNAMENT

485
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,427
4-1.

486
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,553
Yes. Go on.

487
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,473
-Meeting tonight.
-Okay.

488
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,349
Put out the cigarette.

489
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,107
What have we here?

490
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,959
Fresh way to make an appearance.

491
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:27,798
