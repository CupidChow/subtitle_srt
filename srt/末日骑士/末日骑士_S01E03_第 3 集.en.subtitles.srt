1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,601
REFUGEE DISTRICT, NINE YEARS AGO

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,283
The refugee mob
is putting up a tough fight.

3
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,326
Kill them all and don't lose ground!

4
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,176
Hide until it's dark,
even if the gunfire stops.

5
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,288
Run!

6
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,979
CHEONMYEONG MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN

7
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,831
I got the order to burn them all.

8
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,271
Hide until it's dark,
even if the gunfire stops.

9
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,245
BLACK KNIGHT

10
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,595
Fresh way to make an appearance.

11
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,034
Whoa.

12
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,827
That was close.

13
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,134
Do you have a death wish?

14
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,093
I did.

15
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,471
But that changed today.

16
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,353
DELIVERYMAN RECRUITMENT TOURNAMENT

17
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,437
I'm doing this.

18
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,814
I have a reason to do it.

19
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,941
Tell me how I can win.

20
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,862
I don't care about your reason,
and I have no secrets to share with you.

21
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,662
I can't stand rude people.

22
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,043
You got me out of there.

23
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,629
You saved me!

24
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,180
Now you remember?

25
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,434
Help me win this.

26
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,812
-Why me?
-Because you're the strongest.

27
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,313
Please.

28
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,916
Prove yourself.

29
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,634
10:00, NOVEMBER 21

30
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,186
Seol-ah, I think he's got a chance
of becoming a deliveryman.

31
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,980
I've seen him fight a few times,

32
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,399
and he's definitely
much stronger than before--

33
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,718
How many do you think have died?

34
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,636
Thousands.

35
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,764
We thought it was a struggle,

36
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,727
but Cheonmyeong considered it a riot.

37
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,896
Should we keep living like this?

38
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,148
What option do we have?

39
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,235
It may take time…

40
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,823
but I'll find a way.

41
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,798
So, you want to become a deliveryman?

42
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,094
YOU, TOO, CAN BECOME A LEGEND LIKE 5-8

43
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,556
So,

44
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,769
the legendary 5-8 is going to let you
become a deliveryman?

45
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,606
No, that's not it.
He simply said, "Prove yourself."

46
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,024
That's the same thing.

47
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,401
-Why are you so pessimistic?
-You little…

48
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,947
-Do you feel confident?
-Well…

49
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,407
I'll give it a try.

50
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,370
While I'm at it,
I'll test if 5-8 really is a legend.

51
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,873
Hey, you're the one being tested.
Don't you know what that means?

52
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,292
I do, man! It's like an exam.

53
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,587
Find anything useful?

54
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,553
I GAVE MY ALL TO BECOME A DELIVERYMAN

55
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,471
Give my all? I can risk my life too.

56
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,765
Have you heard of the Gates of Hell?

57
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,184
The Gates of Hell?

58
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,357
Why are they always working late?

59
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,776
I tell them to save oxygen,
but they never listen.

60
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,411
Ma'am.

61
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,413
Yeah, go home.

62
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,456
Are you sure about that?

63
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,836
Is there a situation?

64
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,589
Yes, ma'am. The tracking team sent
an emergency report.

65
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,631
About 5-8?

66
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,843
He went outside the General District.

67
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,888
You're coming with us?

68
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,975
What? Should I go home, then?

69
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,858
PHYSICAL TRAINING FACILITY

70
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,585
Is everyone here?

71
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,426
Let's start.

72
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,391
It's an old training facility
for deliverymen.

73
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,062
I saw 11 people entering, including 5-8.

74
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,648
They were all deliverymen
who used to be refugees.

75
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,776
A group of deliverymen led by 5-8…

76
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,321
The purpose of the kidnapping is

77
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,032
human experiments.

78
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,575
Human experiments?

79
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,370
Do you suspect Cheonmyeong's behind this?

80
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,373
-I'm sure.
-Why target the children of the mines?

81
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,749
To find mutants.

82
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,168
So, they really exist?

83
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,801
ANALYSIS OF REFUGEE SURVIVOR

84
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,810
They do exist.

85
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,816
There are over ten deliverymen,
including 5-8.

86
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,234
If we engage in a fight…

87
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,779
That'd be even better.
It would allow us to arrest them.

88
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,950
His bones are made out of metal,
and his wounds heal extremely quickly.

89
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,867
So it is real.

90
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,747
But then, nothing's impossible in a world
ruined by polluted air and radioactivity.

91
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,791
If they are targeting mutants,

92
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,001
this kid is perfect.

93
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,088
You want to use him to find the children?

94
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,631
If we have to.

95
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,592
He came to 5-8 and said
he wants to become a deliveryman.

96
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,513
That kid needs me too.

97
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,745
What brings you here at this hour?

98
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,545
I felt today was the day for us
to resume our previous conversation.

99
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,392
On all the days of the kidnappings,

100
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,311
5-7 was on leave.

101
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,440
He must have acted as the key,
using his job as a deliveryman.

102
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,777
He died on the day he became wanted,
and the cause was--

103
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,694
Overwork.

104
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,870
Stop right there.

105
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,292
We were ordered
to keep this investigation confidential.

106
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,210
Was he murdered?

107
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

108
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,431
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

109
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,018
The first time a deliveryman has died
from overwork since Earth fell apart.

110
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:31,936
Yes.

111
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,729
At least, officially.

112
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
You don't believe the official account?

113
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,942
It's a reasonable doubt.

114
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,278
The witness hasn't finished
his testimony yet.

115
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,038
5-7 was murdered.

116
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:51,956
Murdered?

117
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,582
Based on what?

118
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,501
He died in front of me.

119
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,754
A tiny bomb went off in his head.

120
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,050
Were there any clues before he died?

121
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,348
Taken away?

122
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,016
To where?

123
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,144
For human experiments…

124
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,405
This is the culprits' tattoo.

125
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,741
It was on their necks.

126
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,829
The kidnappings were not limited
to the General District.

127
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,582
Refugee children have disappeared too.

128
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
Refugee?

129
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,251
Take care of yourself,

130
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,462
Major Jung Seol-ah.

131
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,921
It says he went to 5-8 like you did,

132
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,631
and saw hell.

133
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,841
The Gates of Hell.

134
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,304
Once you go through the gates,
a human being turns into this pulp.

135
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,058
A group of people will beat you up
until you pass out!

136
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,685
A group of people? They'll gang up on me?

137
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,354
The guy who wrote the book

138
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,564
was in a coma for a week.

139
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,777
CHAPTER 3
THE GATES OF HELL

140
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,913
Are you the Gates of Hell?

141
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,338
Here I go.

142
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,146
Just you two?

143
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,815
-What did you expect?
-I mean…

144
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,151
The Gates of Hell…

145
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,695
Ganging up on me…

146
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,535
Did you read that book
I Gave My All or whatever?

147
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,246
Come on up.

148
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,164
No, I'll do it.

149
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,669
He'll die if you do it.

150
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,338
I'll hold back so he doesn't.

151
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,975
Show me what you've got.

152
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,351
Let's do it.

153
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:05,983
Too slow.

154
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,115
One, two.

155
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,868
-Three, four.
-Ouch!

156
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,785
Too slow.

157
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,670
-Tired already?
-Not at all!

158
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,550
Faster.

159
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,226
Get back in here.

160
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,570
One, two, three,

161
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,656
four.

162
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,659
Stop playing. Get serious.

163
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,369
You mean it?

164
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,089
Did you see my fist?

165
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,508
-No.
-Exactly.

166
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,759
That's where you're at.

167
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,558
What do you think?

168
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,560
He's no trained fighter. Slow too.

169
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,520
Yeah.

170
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,614
-Why are you still here?
-You want me to leave?

171
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,702
You said you wanted to be a deliveryman.
Wouldn't you have to register first?

172
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,292
Use your head and think.

173
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,254
Sheesh.

174
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,720
What are you doing?

175
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,019
This stays within the team for now.

176
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,110
Okay, listen up!

177
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,112
We have new information.

178
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,535
We're aiming to recruit a new deliveryman
for Cheonmyeong Group.

179
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,704
PRELIMINARY ROUND REGISTRATION

180
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,290
You all have a fair chance.

181
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,168
Only the final victor

182
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,254

What are you up to?

00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,693
Thinking for the first time in a while.

207
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,530
Are you sad that Yoon Sa-wol
is now Refugee 034?

208
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,453
Not exactly sad, but just…

209
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,454
Do you know my name?

210
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,291
-5-8.
-Exactly.

211
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,336
I'm 5-8, and she's 4-1.

212
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,839
And you're Refugee 034.
Is there a problem?

213
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,136
You're right.

214
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,931
What do I do now?

215
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,408
What's that?

216
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
I have to dodge them?

217
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,585
No, hit them!

218
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,632
Hit them?

219
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,930
Stop dodging and hit them!

220
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,311
Your eyes are slow, like your movements.

221
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,148
No idea what you're talking about.
Why don't you try it?

222
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,359
He just won't freaking listen.

223
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,577
Taking his shirt off again.

224
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,584
Turn it on.

225
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:55,892
Awesome!

226
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,523
We've got a long way to go.

227
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,492
The first round of the Cheonmyeong
Deliveryman Recruitment Tournament begins.

228
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,580
The last participant standing
will make it to the second round.

229
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,626
When the round begins,
the oxygen in the rooms will be cut off.

230
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,054
Don't attack. Just block the attacks.

231
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,764
You do gang up on me.

232
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,642
Oxygen level 100%.

233
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,012
If we push him harder,
he could hit the balls.

234
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,556
He's still only as good
as an average deliveryman.

235
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,482
Speed it up.

236
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,153
What the hell?

237
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,283
Oxygen level 50%.

238
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,826
This is total chaos, total--

239
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,422
Focus and watch the flow
of your opponent's attack.

240
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,762
Yeah!

241
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,556
Cocky kid.

242
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,640
Speed it up!

243
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,309
Come on! It's too easy!

244
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,098
Oxygen level 5%…

245
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,991
Oxygen level 1%.

246
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,705
Oxygen is being restored.

247
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,882
The following participants
will go on to the second round.

248
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,345
Room One, Joo Gyeong-nam.

249
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,265
Room Two, Park Se-seung.

250
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,851
Room Three, Hyeon Su.

251
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,645
Room Four, Yoo Gyeong-sik.

252
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,690
Room Five, Choi Ju-ho.

253
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,443
Room Six, Lee Dong-cheol.

254
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,571
Room Seven, Kim Seung-hyeon.

255
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,199
Room Eight, Refugee 034.

256
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,206
TEHERAN-RO, 2100

257
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,170
He passed the first round.

258
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,513
He's my only son,
and they took him right before my eyes.

259
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,476
The fact that they left you behind means
that only your son mattered to them.

260
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,811
What should I do?

261
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,356
Look for a guy who has this tattoo
on the back of his neck.

262
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,779
I just need to find someone
who has this tattoo?

263
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,072
Yes, we'll make the arrest.

264
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,991
Can I notify other districts?

265
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,326
As many as you can.

266
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,243
Okay.

267
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,293
He has a bad skin condition.
Is he a mine laborer?

268
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,878
Yes.

269
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,339
He was taken young
and barely managed to escape.

270
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,094
The children of the mines.

271
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,873
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

272
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,791
Get off.

273
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:37,919
Take one each.

274
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,721
The destination?

275
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,973
The oxyanium mine.

276
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,768
The construction
in their district is over.

277
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,478
They were planning to kill them.

278
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,272
Are you okay?

279
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,524
I volunteered to be
a refugee administrator.

280
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,276
I'm fine.

281
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,485
What about District A?

282
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,779
They will test
the Air Road operation soon.

283
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,239
Delay it as much as possible.

284
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,617
I'm setting things up here and there
for an incident to happen,

285
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,829
but security's high after the last one.

286
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,539
We can't fail this time.

287
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,165
We'll look for a way too.

288
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,210
Choose. Leg or arm?

289
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,128
What do you mean?

290
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,298
You need a bullet in you
before going back.

291
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,883
No, leg.

292
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,009
Arm.

293
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,344
Who did this?

294
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,138
We don't know yet, sir.

295
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,391
We're questioning a survivor,
but he's rambling on and on.

296
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,727
How dare they go after
Cheonmyeong's property.

297
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,731
Mobilize the guard force
and call the military.

298
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,149
Yes, si--

299
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,322
What is it?

300
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,365
The minister of defense is here.

301
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,000
Hello, sir.

302
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,170
This is Major Jung Seol-ah.

303
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,631
CEO Ryu Seok of Cheonmyeong Group.

304
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,133
Major Jung Seol-ah of the DIC.

305
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,095
The construction is over 90% complete.

306
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,432
We're working with the government
under airtight security.

307
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,518
Your security really is tight.

308
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,688
Too much information
leads to assumptions and confusion.

309
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,191
Are you going to move
District A to the Core

310
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,402
and upgrade the Special District
and the General District by a level?

311
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,032
I can see why the minister thinks
highly of you, Major.

312
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,868
Another mass exodus will begin.

313
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,746
Cheonmyeong Group,

314
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,750
and especially Ryu, is in charge
of this huge undertaking.

315
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,503
Why did you ask for me?

316
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,342
I'd like to have the files
on each district.

317
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,637
We need the DIC's help
for a fair reassignment plan.

318
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,144
Reassignment?

319
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,854
That's right.

320
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,356
Don't feel pressured,

321
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,527
and just cooperate with what Ryu wants.

322
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,779
I look forward to it.

323
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,458
The general consensus is

324
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,628
that you must not be allowed to lead
the District A Relocation Plan.

325
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,257
Because the president said so?

326
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,261
GOVERNMENT RELOCATION EXECUTION PLAN

327
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,555
Because the chairman supports her.

328
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,516
Cheonmyeong must speak as one

329
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,103
if things are to go the way you want.

330
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,859
Nothing's ever easy.

331
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,218
I passed.

332
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,309
Do you know how to drive?

333
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,352
Drive?

334
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,122
So he does drive.

335
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,552
In this round…

336
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,929
SECOND ROUND

337
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,890
…you must deliver a package
safely to the finish line.

338
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,475
At random spots on the route,

339
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,437
hunters with a record of serious crimes
will be waiting for you.

340
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,944
Any hunter who takes your package

341
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,364
will be released from prison immediately.

342
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,327
Use the weapons in each of your vehicles

343
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,413
to stop the hunters' attacks
and protect the package.

344
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,331
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

345
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,666
Can we kill them?

346
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,751
Of course.

347
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,213
In this round,
we'll be selecting two participants

348
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,633
who can deliver their packages
to the destination safely.

349
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,844
We go straight to the final?

350
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,762
If you survive this round.

351
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,604
Why are we here?

352
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,566
You're here as observers
to make sure that the race is fair.

353
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,529
Mr. Ryu is here.

354
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,449
Good work, everyone.

355
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,345
The second round of the Cheonmyeong
Deliveryman Recruitment Tournament begins.

356
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,889
These are all junk.

357
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,527
What's this?

358
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,530
NUMBER EIGHT
REFUGEE 034

359
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,240
You just go straight?

360
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,327
The two participants
who make it to the finish line

361
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,078
