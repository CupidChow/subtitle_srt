1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,973
Cheonmyeong's power comes from oxygen.

2
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,560
If the air gets cleaner,
they'll lose everything.

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:24,858
Seol-ah.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,030
Are you certain they're polluting the air?

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,364
We checked it ourselves.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,159
CEO RYU SEOK OFF-SITE SCHEDULE

7
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,535
What will you do now?

8
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,503
Air purification in prog--

9
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,841
Are the physical examinations going well?

10
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,801
Yes, more people are coming

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,221
after word spread about how the refugees
who got the exam are fine.

12
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,853
VACCINATION COMPLETE

13
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,695
We have a rough road ahead of us,

14
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,031
so let's do as we each see fit now.

15
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,645
Gotcha.

16
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,940
Drop the gun.

17
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,944
I think you should drop your gun.

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,997
-Locate the shooter!
-Here, over here!

19
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,249
Protect Mr. Ryu!

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,210
This way, sir.

21
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,587
Come this way, sir!

22
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,344
Director Oh betrayed us. I'm heading down.

23
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,847
-This way!
-Bring the car quickly!

24
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,655
Cover me! I'll get Ryu Seok!

25
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,217
BLACK KNIGHT

26
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,975
The kidnappings.
The Refugee District explosions.

27
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,977
The truth behind the air purifier trucks.

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,521
Cheonmyeong's name comes up
in all of them.

29
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,734
Do you want me
to take care of this privately?

30
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,071
I'm a soldier.

31
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,158
I'll solve the case
based on concrete evidence.

32
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,291
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON RYU SEOK
SUSPECT 5-8

33
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,673
Deliverymen?

34
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,509
The ones who shot at me
and raided the air purification station

35
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,804
are Cheonmyeong's deliverymen?

36
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,763
Yes, sir.

37
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:28,768
They also hijacked the buses
and blew up the generating units.

38
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,688
There is a secret organization
among the deliverymen,

39
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,024
and the mutant boy
seems to be involved too.

40
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,408
Those bastards wouldn't be able to breathe
or eat without Cheonmyeong,

41
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,077
and they're playing the hero?

42
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,004
Chairman Ryu now knows the truth,
and he's meeting the president tomorrow.

43
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,258
So, you want us to just hide like this
until they reach a conclusion?

44
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,094
And cover up the truth?

45
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,722
If Ryu Seok had died today,
what would've changed?

46
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,932
If you don't stop now,

47
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,685
you might bring about chaos
beyond our control.

48
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,315
The massacre of the refugees

49
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,942
and the pollution of the atmosphere.

50
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,612
They were all carried out by Ryu Seok
to "prevent chaos."

51
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,117
Maybe you're also afraid of
Cheonmyeong's order being broken, Major.

52
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,006
Everything will be resolved tomorrow.

53
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,632
Be careful.

54
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,384
Okay.

55
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,144
If the chairman knows,
isn't Ryu Seok done for?

56
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,731
Major Jung seems sure about this.
I think we should trust her judgment.

57
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,400
We'll know in a day anyway,
so let's wait.

58
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,194
I agree. Let's wait.

59
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,279
We'll split up for now.

60
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,642
Damn, those sneaky rats!

61
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,854
Ditch your GPS devices
and stand by in the Refugee District.

62
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,193
From now on, they are not deliverymen,

63
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,904
but terrorists who threatened
Cheonmyeong and the citizens.

64
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,826
You may kill them all,
effective immediately, but…

65
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,870
make sure to capture
that mutant boy alive.

66
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,080
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,811
GENERAL DISTRICT 2-4

68
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,194
So there was a reason
you've all been dying.

69
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,678
How have you been?

70
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,182
Well, just getting older.

71
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,809
You've aged well.

72
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,314
I'd rather live above ground
even if I have to suffer a little

73
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,900
than be stuck underground
just so I can breathe easily.

74
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,821
It took me five more years to build
the Air Core because you weren't there,

75
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,158
which also delayed
the construction of District A.

76
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:18,164
If I were there,
I'd have set the Air Core on fire.

77
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,128
By the way, how did you raise
your son to turn out like that?

78
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,923
The son takes after the father.
You can't change that.

79
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,342
It's my cross to bear.

80
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,225
The soil is coming back to life
the further south you go.

81
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,186
I heard the air is getting cleaner too.

82
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,190
To hell with District A. Start thinking
about leaving the Core District.

83
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,484
There's still a chance.

84
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,613
You're right.

85
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,573
I should finish this.

86
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,969
I'm a cleaner, and you're a deliveryman,
so why am I delivering this?

87
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,805
You know I got canned.

88
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,560
Ryu Seok revised the government's
refugee reassignment plan.

89
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,896
The physical examination is proceeding
as per the revised plan.

90
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,732
-It will be different this time.
-Are you sure?

91
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,777
Do you have to see it with your own eyes
to feel satisfied?

92
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,905
I wonder when you'll be cured
of that paranoia.

93
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,242
It'll be cured when refugees start
living in the General District.

94
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,939
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION COMPLETE
VACCINATION COMPLETE

95
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,899
CHAIRMAN, CHEONMYEONG GROUP
RYU JAE-JIN

96
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,068
PRESIDENT, REPUBLIC OF KOREA
CHAE JIN-GYEONG

97
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,947
The relocation plan led by the government
will include you, the refugees.

98
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,532
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND VACCINATION

99
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,368
You'll be given relocation rights
to live in the General District.

100
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,954
JOINT AGREEMENT, CHEONMYEONG
WILL ENTRUST TO THE GOVERNMENT

101
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,832
THE RIGHTS TO OXYGEN SUPPLY,
DELIVERY SYSTEM, AND RELOCATION PLAN

102
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,048
I'm sorry about what your son did.

103
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:37,428
It feels like I'm putting
a great burden on you, ma'am.

104
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,107
You've done something
I never would've imagined.

105
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,194
The chairman will give a statement
about the agreement.

106
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,613
You should say your goodbyes.

107
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,239
Madam President--

108
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,909
The minister of defense
will be visiting you soon.

109
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,411
There isn't much time left.

110
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,429
You gave away the heart of Cheonmyeong,
the oxygen and the delivery system. Why?

111
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,058
I created those to save people,
not to kill them.

112
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,601
I'm sorry?

113
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,436
I know about everything you've done.

114
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,939
You put yourself in this situation.

115
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,526
I can make everything right.

116
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,112
If we admit to those things now,
it'll be over for us!

117
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,114
I can't lose Cheonmyeong
like this, Father!

118
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,283
You can't lose it since it was never yours
in the first place.

119
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,203
Father.

120
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:55,506
Now it's your turn to take responsibility
for what you've done.

121
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,052
You are under arrest for violating
the National Security Act, Mr. Ryu.

122
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,015
What?

123
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,644
You're arresting me?

124
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,952
What are you doing?

125
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,085
Why?

126
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,796
Did that surprise you?

127
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,554
I blew up hundreds of refugees in one go.
This shouldn't surprise you.

128
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,241
Why don't you just end me yourself
instead of passing the buck?

129
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
You don't know when to stop.

130
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,916
So make me stop! With your own hands!

131
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,503
You don't think I can?

132
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,701
Father.

133
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,332
Ryu.

134
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,589
The coup is the last step of our plan.

135
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,342
We'll capture the president first.

136
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,830
GENERAL DISTRICT
REFUGEE REASSIGNMENT PLAN

137
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,755
What do you have there?

138
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,385
The refugee reassignment plan.
I'm having a hard time believing it.

139
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,889
I think you'd better believe it this time.

140
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,183
Chairman Ryu came by yesterday.

141
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,938
He promised to relocate the refugees
to the General District.

142
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,566
-He did?
-The official statement will be made soon.

143
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,203
Sir.

144
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,247
Yeah?

145
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,713
I, Ryu Seok…

146
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,340
DELIVERYMEN WANTED

147
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,717
…will carry on
the late Chairman Ryu Jae-jin's will

148
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,802
and lead Cheonmyeong

149
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,889
without faltering.

150
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,686
All high-ranking officers are summoned
to the minister of defense's office.

151
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,564
What?

152
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,233
I'll be working
with the Ministry of Defense to arrest…

153
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,110
Are they staging a coup or something?

154
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,738
…all the deliverymen
who have become terrorists

155
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,909
by destroying safety facilities
and attempting an assassination.

156
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,663
All deliveries will be halted

157
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,125
until all the terrorists are arrested.

158
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,754
We ask for your understanding

159
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,132
in this unavoidable issue.

160
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,803
We only have one option left.

161
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,432
We'll head down to the Core District.

162
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,361
The Core District blueprints.

163
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,114
Chairman Ryu and I created them.

164
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,576
I'd hoped I wouldn't have to use them…

165
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,248
I understand.

166
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,918
We are searching for the terrorists.

167
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,380
Deliveries to all districts
will be completely halted

168
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,841
until all 12 deliverymen are arrested.

169
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,392
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

170
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,780
Cheonmyeong Group and the government
will deliver supplies to each district.

171
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,199
Please check the location
and time of the delivery.

172
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,495
We ask for your full cooperation
to minimize disruption.

173
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,354
Here.

174
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,239
All refugees visiting
the examination center for relocation,

175
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,242
stand in line to register
your personal information.

176
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,871
The comprehensive vaccine was created
by Cheonmyeong Pharmaceuticals

177
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,416
in consideration of your health conditions
and weakened immune systems,

178
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,253
and has gone through
a range of clinical trials and tests

179
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,337
to prove its safety.

180
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,297
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION &
VACCINATION COMPLETE

181
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,383
Isn't it about time they started dying?

182
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,554
Yes, sir. The incubation period is over,
and the drug is taking effect.

183
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,944
What in the world is going on?

184
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,196
It seems to be a contagion.

185
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,699
We'll be moving
to the General District soon.

186
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,034
What terrible luck
ahead of something so great.

187
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,995
A contagion?

188
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:26,957
Useless,

189
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,335
it's the physical examination!

190
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,253
What?

191
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,926
-Oh no.
-What is it?

192
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,304
Dummy and Dumb-dumb
went to get their physicals.

193
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,722
-Huh?
-Shoot!

194
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,005
Sir, what is it?

195
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,677
The physical, the physical examination…

196
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,596
Do not get the physical examination!

197
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,265
If you get the vaccine,

198
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,059
you'll die!

199
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,821
4-1: THE VACCINE WILL KILL YOU

200
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,077
We have to stop it at all costs.

201
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,630
Wow, so one injection is all it takes?

202
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,132
Just a little prick and that's it, right?

203
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
-Next.
-Guys, wait!

204
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,678
You can't go in there!

205
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,264
-The shot will kill you!
-Who are you?

206
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,848
You'll die if you get the shot!

207
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,600
I've checked!

208
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,018
Dummy, Dumb-dumb!

209
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,062
You two, get out of there now!

210
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,022
Huh? What's with him?

211
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,732
Everybody, get out of there!

212
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,111
-Useless!
-Useless!

213
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,696
Don't move!

214
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,741
I'm at the physical examination center.

215
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,701
I'll get started.

216
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,645
Terrorists are appearing
at examination centers in each district.

217
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,731
Heighten security and kill on sight.

218
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,858
Don't move!

219
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,735
Who are you? Tell me now!

220
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,904
What? Why is he there?

221
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,779
Stop!

222
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,158
Stop! Don't…

223
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,463
Useless.

224
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,256
Useless.

225
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,675
Useless!

226
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,178
Useless!

227
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,350
No.

228
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,270
Run, now.

229
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,565
Don't let them catch you.

230
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,901
-Run…
-Hey, are you…

231
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,820
Useless!

232
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,488
Run…

233
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,657
Useless.

234
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:29,991
Useless!

235
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,452
Useless! No!

236
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,996
Useless, no!

237
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,915
Useless.

238
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,251
Useless!

239
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,135
-Sa-wol!
-Useless!

240
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,387
-Yoon Sa-wol!
-Useless!

241
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,484
The mutant deliveryman has been arrested.

242
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,403
He'll be sent here.

243
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,571
Good.

244
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,450
But the vaccine plan has failed
due to the attack on the exam center.

245
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,702
Minister.

246
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,582
Too many things are in our way.

247
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,085
Why don't we just wipe them out at once?

248
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,592
Major,

249
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,262
your brother's been arrested.

250
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,430
Sa-wol?

251
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,265
He's being transported to Cheonmyeong.

252
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,308
Cheonmyeong?

253
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,685
Just give us the order.

254
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,981
We're ready.

255
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,192
No orders.

256
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,361
Please help me.

257
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,586
Good luck.

258
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,796
Don't get hurt.

259
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,343
Who's there?

260
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,484
Did you hear about Yoon Sa-wol?

261
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,363
Yes, he should be
at the Cheonmyeong building by now.

262
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,864
We'll get him back.

263
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,116
Our destination is the same this time.

264
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,536
I'll show you the way.

265
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,262
Did you help me because I'm a mutant?

266
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,641
No, because you're an immature refugee kid
who knows nothing about this world.

267
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,977
What does that mean?

268
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,609
You asked what's so special
about the Special District people.

269
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,861
You said they were born there.

270
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,912
So, what do you think about refugees
living and dying miserably

271
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,457
just because they are refugees?

272
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,044
Refugees are people too.
They breathe and live. That's unfair.

273
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,382
Refugees are not needed
in the world Cheonmyeong's built.

274
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,052
That's how it's been so far,

275
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,346
and how it will continue to be.

276
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,479
That's the reality
of the world you live in.

277
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,691
That's what we're trying to change.

278
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,738
There's only one way
into the Core District.

279
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,441
We'll go to the president.

280
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,554
It's a direct transfusion,
so there may be side effects.

281
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,722
Do you feel any symptoms?

282
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,810
I feel a little strange.
Maybe because it's mutant blood.

283
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,710
-Sir.
-What is it?

284
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,003
Take a look, sir.

285
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,024
I think it'd be safest
if you were to stay here for now, sir.

286
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,650
What the hell is going on?

287
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,027
Where's Director Oh?

288
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,489
They fell from the sky?

289
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,246
What's going on?

290
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,126
What's this?

291
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,545
What do you think?
Deliverymen are here to get you.

292
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,810
Emergency power system activated.

293
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,152
How does this make any sense?

294
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,155
They must've gotten their hands
on the blueprints.

295
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,200
It seems they've cut off
the main line to the Core District.

296
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,828
And the minister?

297
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,789
He's with the president right now.

298
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,517
Gun.

299
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,713
Who do you think will come in?

300
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,132
I'm curious as well.

301
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,238
Minister.

302
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,157
You're under arrest for treason.

303
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,388
This is Major Jung Seol-ah of the DIC!

304
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,391
The minister of defense is under arrest.

305
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,187
Insurgents, drop your guns and surrender.

306
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,361
I repeat.
The minister of defense is under arrest.

307
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,280
Insurgents, drop your guns and surrender.

308
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,078
I'm not going to let it end like this.

309
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,022
Air Core energy overload.

310
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,952
Air Core energy overload.

311
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,579
Please evacuate.

312
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,177
Come out!

313
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,806
Isn't the brat important to you too?

314
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,395
He is.

315
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,826
So, you chose to blow yourself up?

316
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,038
I won't let those refugee vermin
have this.

317
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,373
I'll decide how to end things.

318
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,001
For massacring the refugees,

319
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,378
polluting the atmosphere,

320
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,506
and experimenting on children…

321
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,178
you'll never be forgiven,
even after death.

322
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,889
I have no desire to be forgiven
by the likes of you.

323
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,516
5-8.

324
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,895
There's no world
that can satisfy everyone.

325
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,357
I just did what I had to do.

326
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,874
Energy supply cannot be controlled.

327
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,548
It's all over.

328
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,187
That's not for you to decide.

329
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,233
Energy supply cannot be controlled.

330
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,943
Emergency evacuation.

331
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,404
The Air Core will explode.

332
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,637
District A is now complete,
so we will begin resident relocation.

333
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,642
Refugees will be relocated first,
in order of registration,

334
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,605
and the government will work towards
a safe and speedy relocation.

335
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:04,360
We will also remove the status system
of classifying the population

336
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,279
into refugee, general,
special, and core citizens,

337
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,616
and reform the residential
and oxygen supply system.

338
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,159
We will keep working

339
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,956
so that every Korean citizen can live
equally without discrimination.

340
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,201
THREE MONTHS LATER

341
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,928
Disinfection complete.

342
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,599
Come on, why are you so late?

343
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,229
By the way, when can I go back to work?

344
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,483
This is imprisonment.
I'm going stir-crazy here!

345
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,901
Enough mouthing off.

346
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,404
You have a long way to go.

347
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,617
Aren't you going to check my ID?

348
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,329
Oh, right.

349
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,215
Doesn't the air feel cleaner?

350
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,974
The sky's getting clearer too.

351
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:58,278
