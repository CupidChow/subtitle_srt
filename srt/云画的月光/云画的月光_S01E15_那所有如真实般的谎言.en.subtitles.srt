1
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,965
"There are things
I couldn't tell you in the palace.

2
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,217
They are about your father.

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,387
I'll send you the location
and time to meet."

4
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,593
I will

5
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,430
never forgive you.

6
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,880
I’m only going to believe what you say.

7
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,928
Even if it's a lie,

8
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,932
I will believe it.

9
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,940
For all the times we've shared...

10
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,028
Have you been truthful with me?

11
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,462
My apologies, Your Highness.

12
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,023
You were right, Your Highness.

13
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,858
We need to go now.

14
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,060
Your Highness.

15
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,828
I didn’t expect to see you here,
Minister of Justice.

16
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:01,129
I came to see who sent
the fake letter to set me up.

17
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,799
Was that you?

18
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,177
I’m here

19
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,639
because I received a tip-off about someone
who is trying to meet the rebels here.

20
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,392
That's all, Your Highness.

21
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,400
Someone was trying to frame me
for treason?

22
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,029
Find and arrest them immediately!

23
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,784
That will be the only way
for you to survive, do you hear?

24
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,497
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,528
How is Ra-on doing?

26
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,281
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,160
I’ll be taking her someplace safe soon.
You do not need to worry.

28
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,915
I suppose you’re not going to

29
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,418
tell me where that is.

30
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,088
You will only make things harder for her

31
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,383
if you keep asking.

32
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,182
How did I...

33
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,810
become the person that could hurt her...

34
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,189
the most?

35
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,911
Very well. I won’t ask any questions.

36
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,885
We don’t have much time.

37
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,848
I’m counting on you.

38
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,984
You should go.

39
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,914
Your Highness.

40
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,214
Please do not try to find out where I am.

41
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,679
Even if you hear something about me,

42
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,640
do not let that get to you.

43
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,438
I will also...

44
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,734
do the same.

45
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,460
Crown Princess consort.

46
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,130
There isn’t much to do here.
You must be bored.

47
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,216
Actually, Your Highness,

48
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,720
my day goes by so fast.
There are many things I need to learn.

49
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,891
You’re trying so hard...

50
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,147
Crown Princess consort.

51
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,818
Do you happen to know

52
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,444
why the wedding date hasn’t been decided?

53
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,321
Pardon?

54
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,492
I’ve heard the Royal Astronomical Bureau
will pick a lucky day.

55
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,203
Even if they do, it’ll be no use.

56
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:50,501
The Crown Prince keeps making up excuses
to refuse the suggested dates.

57
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,925
Wouldn't you like to know

58
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,886
the reason?

59
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,601
His Highness must have a reason

60
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,271
to rightfully do so.

61
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,941
Sure he does.

62
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,529
After the eunuch he favored went missing,

63
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,907
His Highness is in despair.

64
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,827
Pardon?

65
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,498
I do not understand.

66
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,375
Do take my place

67
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,962
and bring comfort to His Highness.

68
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,217
Yes, Your Highness.

69
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,813
Tell me.

70
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,232
Do you know where Hong Ra-on is?

71
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,360
No, sir.

72
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,531
I accompanied His Highness as his guard.

73
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,868
When I got there,

74
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,621
Hong Ra-on was already gone.

75
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,711
Who could it be?

76
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,009
Judging by the way
they impersonated me to summon her,

77
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,513
it has to be

78
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,642
an inside job.

79
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,897
Premier Kim's men have already done

80
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,899
all sorts of evil deeds
under Baekwoon Group's name.

81
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,275
And now,

82
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,694
we have to suspect one of our own men?

83
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,823
If we find the traitor,

84
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,744
I swear

85
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,164
I will make him pay.

86
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,590
Mom, you need to rest.

87
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,469
I'm fine.

88
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,054
I do this every day.

89
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,348
Go to sleep.

90
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,809
You haven't taken a break all day.

91
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,937
I'm fine.

92
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,273
I'm Sam-nom,

93
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,526
the fierce, the brave, the limitless.

94
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,782
Do you blame your father?

95
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,421
For putting us through the trouble?

96
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,715
Yes.

97
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,637
You said he did the right thing.

98
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,973
It had to be done by someone.

99
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,352
Yes.

100
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,771
You are right.

101
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,275
But...

102
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,361
I didn't want that somebody
to be my husband.

103
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,782
I didn't want a hero

104
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,037
but someone I can share
a life with, in sickness and in health.

105
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,873
I needed a family instead.

106
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
So how could I not blame him?

107
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,714
Mom.

108
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,176
That sounds to me
like you still long for him

109
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,470
and miss him a lot.

110
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,806
Oh, goodness.

111
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,184
Go to sleep.

112
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,478
Let me finish this.

113
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,439
-There.
-No, that is it for today.

114
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,608
Let's go to sleep.

115
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,885
Are you familiar with this letter?

116
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,516
You will not be punished
if you tell me the truth.

117
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,978
Did you leave this letter

118
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,397
on my desk?

119
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,067
Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,280
Who gave you the order?

121
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,453
I will not hurt him.

122
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,789
I only want to ask him some questions.

123
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,249
Do not be afraid and answer me.

124
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,295
He was a stranger, Your Highness.

125
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,634
He asked if I cleaned
the Crown Prince's palace

126
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,513
and offered me money.

127
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,599
Do you remember what he looked like?

128
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,614
Tell the Painting Bureau
to send in the court painter.

129
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,804
I have realized something
after the incident.

130
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,682
You betrayed Baekwoon Group.

131
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,102
There's no guarantee
you will not betray me.

132
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,190
I just trust the power of money.

133
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,942
I don't trust you, Premier Kim.

134
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,447
You buy what you need,

135
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,616
and I will sell you what I can.

136
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,159
That is all.

137
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,555
Your farmland, as promised.

138
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,231
But first, bring us that girl right now.

139
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,692
Hong Ra-on.

140
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,463
Cover it. Go now.

141
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,857
How great to see you.

142
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,358
There.

143
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,277
Goodness.

144
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,410
How have you been?

145
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,496
Thanks to this angel,

146
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,457
the kisaeng parlor is full of laughter.

147
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,794
All the girls are in love with this child.

148
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,296
She's their new favorite over you.

149
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,382
Good.

150
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,596
But I was surprised
that you asked for such a favor, sir.

151
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
Whose child is it?

152
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,355
Couldn't you tell me?

153
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,195
The poor child lost her parents
and her home overnight.

154
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,450
Poor thing.

155
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,246
Although I am only a lowly kisaeng,

156
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,166
I will raise this child
with all my heart, sir.

157
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,641
Ra-on.

158
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,769
What are you doing? Come inside.

159
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,271
Yes, Mom. I'm coming.

160
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,692
Ra-on!

161
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,946
Ra-on.

162
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,582
Let's go.

163
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,828
Mom.

164
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,121
Mom.

165
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,664
Mom.

166
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,708
Mom.

167
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,960
Mom.

168
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,559
How are you feeling, Your Highness?

169
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,352
Good.

170
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,814
Giving birth to a prince
lightened up my heart,

171
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,359
so my body feels better than ever.

172
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,700
Such a handsome prince.

173
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,953
Do you really think so?

174
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,963
Are you happy?

175
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,341
Of course.

176
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,261
More than words can say.

177
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,722
Are you really

178
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,100
happy with it all?

179
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,448
Please excuse me.

180
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,412
What the hell are you doing?

181
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,874
The snitch who used Baekwoon's name
to work for Premier Kim.

182
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,669
It was you?

183
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,349
So what if it was?

184
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,726
What did you say?

185
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,272
What do you think will happen
to Baekwoon Group if I get caught?

186
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,066
What will happen to you or Chief Eunuch?

187
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,408
You won't be able to do anything to me.

188
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,120
You cannot risk the fact
that you are a spy

189
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,414
assigned to keep an eye on
the Crown Prince

190
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,790
to be revealed.

191
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,208
Aren't I right?

192
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,797
What’s wrong?

193
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
Does it hurt to even think about it?

194
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,472
How many times did I warn you?

195
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,434
The Crown Prince

196
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,521
is not your friend.

197
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,367
Stop right there.

198
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,459
Chief Kim?

199
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,596
I’m here to arrest him.

200
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,806
It is the Crown Prince’s order.

201
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:37,494
Someone tried to frame me for treason
by setting up a trap with a fake letter.

202
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,497
I have arrested the culprit.

203
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,466
Is that true, Your Highness?

204
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,470
Who is this person

205
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,097
that dared to pull off such an act?

206
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
He was also

207
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,019
following someone else’s orders.

208
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,236
Send him to the Ministry of Justice.

209
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,740
I will question this culprit,
Your Highness.

210
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,661
He actually asked
to be questioned publicly

211
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,999
so that he could reveal the truth
in front of everyone.

212
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,443
Don’t worry too much.
I'm sure he knows full well

213
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,237
that he should not give in easily.

214
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,742
Still, shouldn’t we go talk to him
beforehand?

215
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,140
If I understand correctly,

216
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,602
you were my father’s friend

217
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,230
who joined him in his doing?

218
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:30,940
Right.

219
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,069
I have been searching for you

220
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,490
to have you follow
in your father's footsteps.

221
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,620
But I don't want to.

222
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,540
Is it because of the Crown Prince?

223
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:56,716
His Highness keeps delaying
the royal marriage.

224
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,430
He is having trouble sleeping,

225
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,433
and he's not eating well either.

226
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,897
Listen, Ra-on.

227
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,567
When you find a tight knot,

228
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,529
which you cannot undo
no matter how hard you try,

229
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,908
while untangling a ball of yarn,

230
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,160
you shouldn't hesitate

231
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,873
to cut it out.

232
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,588
Do you understand what I’m trying to say?

233
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,803
That is the best you can do
for the Crown Prince.

234
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,517
I am sorry that I had to say this to you.

235
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,395
Take care.

236
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,107
I will see you soon.

237
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,360
What are you doing here

238
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,156
in the middle of the night?

239
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,999
And what brings you here, Your Highness?

240
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,544
I wanted to find out
why he wanted to harm me.

241
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,465
I was just wondering
how the culprit was doing,

242
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,050
so I decided to come and check on him.

243
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,472
You mean, that man over there?

244
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,267
Yes, Your Highness.

245
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,939
By the way,

246
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,399
how did you know

247
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,486
that he was the culprit
I was talking about?

248
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,033
I have never told anyone

249
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,537
his name or what he looks like.

250
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,874
That is...

251
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,967
Commandant,

252
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,761
how about you?

253
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,848
Do you know his name
or what he's here for?

254
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,893
I do not, Your Highness.

255
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,609
I guess the only thing left to do

256
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,780
is ask who he took the orders from.

257
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,540
Get him up.

258
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,677
Get up!

259
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,645
Your Highness!

260
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,068
Did you harm the culprit

261
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,989
even before I started the interrogation?

262
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,243
Your Highness...

263
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,359
Is Premier Kim not joining us today?

264
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,032
I am present, Your Highness.

265
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,951
I have been giving my all
to serve this country

266
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,453
for much longer than you have,
Your Highness.

267
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,959
How can I join you in the meeting

268
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,169
while I’m being framed for a crime?

269
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,922
So,

270
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,551
you’re returning your seal,
the writ of appointment,

271
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,429
and the official uniform?

272
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,931
If that is what it takes

273
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,309
to prove that I’m innocent,

274
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,478
then yes, Your Highness.

275
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,733
I will not allow that. Find another way.

276
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,741
We are all responsible, Your Highness.
Please dismiss us.

277
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,995
Dismiss us all.

278
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,748
-Please understand, Your Highness.
-Please understand, Your Highness.

279
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,175
If you take me as your loyal subject
and allow me to do so,

280
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,636
I will find and arrest
every single one of the rebels

281
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:20,183
that tried to get between us,
Your Highness.

282
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,578
HONG RA-ON, AGE 18, RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE'S PALACE INCIDENT

283
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,748
He looks quite girly.

284
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,917
-I know.
-But he’s a traitor?

285
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,127
-Goodness.
-Oh, my.

286
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,798
-He has done something terribly wrong.
-Let’s just go!

287
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,352
HONG RA-ON, AGE 18, RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE'S PALACE INCIDENT

288
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,447
I don’t think...

289
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,784
she’ll be able to stay...

290
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,246
in the city anymore.

291
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,669
So, she has to leave soon?

292
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,884
Listen, Ra-on.

293
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,346
When you find a tight knot,

294
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,807
which you cannot undo
no matter how hard you try,

295
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,227
while untangling a ball of yarn,

296
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,730
you shouldn't hesitate

297
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,024
to cut it out.

298
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,588
Does she really have nothing...

299
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
she would like to ask me...

300
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,722
or hear from me?

301
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,521
Out of anger

302
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,107
or for help,

303
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,863
or for whatever reason,
does she not want to see me at all?

304
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,078
Is she...

305
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,916
even alive?

306
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,090
Byeong-yeon.

307
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,678
I told you I would not ask you anything,

308
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,723
but I take that back.

309
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,690
Once.

310
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,861
Just this once,

311
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,199
let me see her.

312
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,189
Ra-on.

313
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,860
How about

314
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,489
we go somewhere far away?

315
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,077
Maybe to the Qing Dynasty or an island.

316
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,164
Someplace far away from the capital.

317
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,879
A place where nobody knows who we are.

318
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,258
How does that sound?

319
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,692
Okay.

320
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,235
Let's leave.

321
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,072
Let's find someplace new.

322
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,876
But Mom,

323
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,879
before that,

324
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,840
there's something I have to do.

325
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,052
What is it?

326
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,640
Saying farewell.

327
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,395
For him to carry on

328
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,230
without me.

329
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,155
So that even if someone new

330
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,657
comes along...

331
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,327
He wouldn't have any lingering feelings
for you?

332
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,289
No.

333
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,294
So he wouldn't feel guilty.

334
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,886
HONG RA-ON, RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE'S PALACE INCIDENT

335
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,362
What a cruel fate.

336
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,823
Father a traitor,

337
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,284
daughter a clown
among some wandering performers.

338
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,996
She survived

339
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,623
without any help from her parents.

340
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,543
Don't tell me

341
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,840
you have feelings
for a clown daughter of a traitor?

342
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,514
You should be ashamed of yourself.

343
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,518
I told you to tell me if you want a woman.

344
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,897
I told you to have one if you need one.

345
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,356
I offered you

346
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,192
a house full of kisaeng.

347
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,363
Like you did?

348
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,575
To dispose of them

349
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,827
after a single night?

350
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,958
No matter who they are,

351
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,460
even if they are your own kin,

352
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,504
you abandon them

353
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,422
once you are done.

354
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,301
You call that a family tradition?

355
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,221
Is that

356
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,140
what you want from me?

357
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,811
What's with all that hatred?

358
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,650
That grand plan

359
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,443
of yours.

360
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,865
The one that you've prepared
for a long time

361
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,993
for me.

362
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,999
Think about the honor
you can bring to this family,

363
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,626
let alone your own glorious future.

364
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,546
Could you dare refuse it all?

365
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,132
I do.

366
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,718
No matter how insignificant it may be,

367
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,055
I will build my own future.

368
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:18,929
Ra-on.

369
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,113
Why did you ask for me?

370
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,204
You seem uneasy.

371
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,585
Did anyone follow you?

372
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,630
Did I

373
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,673
put you in danger

374
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,676
by asking to see you?

375
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,231
This moment
when I am standing right in front of you

376
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,984
is the most dangerous moment for me.

377
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,240
If you say one word,

378
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,535
they will arrest me right away.

379
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,173
Ra-on.

380
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,165
Put it down.

381
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,422
Do I really have to tell you

382
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,883
that I would never harm you?

383
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,139
Do you really need to hear that from me?

384
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,226
A lot has changed

385
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,021
since you found out
who I really am, Your Highness.

386
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,316
What do you mean?

387
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,861
I heard

388
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,989
that His Majesty is very ill.

389
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:45,868
Because my father

390
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,247
disturbed his mind greatly ten years ago.

391
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,465
You will hurt yourself.

392
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,717
Put that knife down.

393
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,347
You must be in great pain.

394
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,101
However,

395
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,396
so am I.

396
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,774
Who was it

397
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,778
that accused my father
of treason and killed him?

398
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,352
I promised...

399
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,148
that I would believe
whatever you say to me.

400
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,653
Even if you lie to me...

401
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,872
You can stop this now.

402
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,504
I will never...

403
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,468
I will never ask for you again.

404
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,727
Chinyeongrae will start soon.

405
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,604
CHINYEONGRAE: GROOM TAKING BRIDE HOME
AFTER HAVING THE CEREMONY AT BRIDE'S HOUSE

406
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,523
Are you ready?

407
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,651
Yes, father.

408
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,738
I guess it is my last day

409
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,573
being trapped in the royal villa.

410
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,952
Don't let the extravagance

411
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,288
of the palace fool you.

412
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,041
With your fiery temper,

413
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,211
you may have a hard time staying there.

414
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,090
Don't you worry.

415
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,260
Did you forget that I am your daughter?

416
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,017
Ha-yeon.

417
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,440
Father.

418
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,404
As your father, this is the last time

419
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,324
I can call you by your name.

420
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,121
I will always pray

421
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,582
for your health

422
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,959
and happiness.

423
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,759
Father,

424
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,553
why do you make it sound like
we'll never see each other?

425
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,679
I cannot believe that Your Highness
has become a man.

426
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,849
I'm lost for words to see

427
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,269
that you're soon to be a husband.

428
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,064
It seems like only yesterday

429
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,568
I entered the Crown Prince's palace
and you were only a child.

430
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,320
Your Highness.

431
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,491
May you be happy and well,

432
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,577
and all blessings be yours.

433
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,610
What took you so long?

434
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,561
The ceremony will begin soon.

435
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,690
It will take time for the Crown Princess

436
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,317
to adjust to the palace.

437
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,570
You should help her, my Queen.

438
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,324
Your Majesty,
Lieutenant wishes to see you.

439
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,536
Let him in.

440
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,127
Your Majesty.

441
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,212
Your Majesty,

442
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,048
please forgive me
for overstepping my bounds...

443
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,060
Your Highness.

444
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,022
Something terrible has happened,
Your Highness.

445
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,900
His Majesty has fainted.

446
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,152
What did you say?

447
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,822
Forgive me, but...

448
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,325
Well...

449
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,451
Go on.

450
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,121
Lieutenant just reported to His Majesty

451
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,167
on the arrest of Hong Gyeong-rae.
