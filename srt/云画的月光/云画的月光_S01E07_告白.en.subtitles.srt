1
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,605
You may be excused.

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,649
I’ll escort you
to the Crown Prince's palace.

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,070
Can’t you see
that he is about to pass out?

4
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,244
I’m okay, Your Highness.

5
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,248
Your Highness!

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,918
Where have you been
after making a scene...

7
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,670
Wait...

8
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,173
Did you go to rescue Eunuch Hong,
Your Highness?

9
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,008
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,926
-Ask one question at a time.
-Your Highness--

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,636
Starting tomorrow.

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,184
Then we will get going, Your Highness.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,271
I’ll see you later
at the Crown Prince's palace.

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,445
Your Highness--

15
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,246
JAHYEONDANG

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,920
Chief Kim.

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,090
You're hurt because of me, right?

18
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,261
This is my job. It’s not your fault.

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,180
Don't say it like that.

20
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,390
I know you care a lot about me.

21
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,727
You saved my life.

22
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,688
You even stayed up all night
taking care of me when I was sick.

23
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,192
I told you already that it was not me.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,529
Who else could it possibly be?

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,405
The only people living
in Jahyeondang are...

26
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,283
How did you know

27
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,953
that I got separated from my mother?

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,212
I was dreaming of the night
I parted with my mother.

29
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,643
Chief Kim.

30
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,771
I don’t know why,

31
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,649
but being here again

32
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,985
makes me feel so comfortable.

33
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,531
You once said

34
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,534
that nobody likes living in the palace.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,455
But once you find someone you can trust
with your heart in here,

36
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,126
the place becomes bearable.

37
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,129
I guess I did.

38
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,008
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

39
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,768
Chief Kim,

40
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,521
I’m worried.

41
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,984
I think I’m starting

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,445
to really like this place.

43
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,971
What is wrong with...

44
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,603
Eunuch Hong!

45
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,483
Sir.

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,361
What brings you here, sir?

47
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,030
I need to check something.

48
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,114
Pardon?

49
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,699
Are you hurt anywhere?

50
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,536
I’m doing fine, sir.

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,414
Were you worried about me?

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,876
I was. I hope you don't make me
worry about you ever again.

53
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,713
You are very special to me, Eunuch Hong.

54
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,007
I am?

55
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,095
You’re the only eunuch
that made me run around like a madman.

56
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,683
You and your jokes...

57
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,691
I'm glad to see that you’re all right,
Your Highness.

58
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,820
Byeong-yeon told me

59
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,782
that you played a big part in bringing
the Qing Dynasty’s investigation censor.

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,079
That matter was important for me as well.
I just gave them a little nudge.

61
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,792
It must have been important enough
to go against your grandfather.

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,924
You are saying you only did it
for your interest, aren't you?

63
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,343
That is right, Your Highness.

64
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,064
I’ll get going, sir.

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,043
Your Highness, I cannot help but wonder

66
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,463
what makes you laugh so hard.

67
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,131
Don’t you find it funny?

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,845
Why does His Highness care so much
about that particular eunuch?

69
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,308
I have never seen him
caring for his subjects.

70
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,688
No wonder people are spreading the rumor

71
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,317
that he likes men.

72
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
What did you say?

73
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,988
That’s pathetic.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,534
Did you say his name is Sam-nom?

75
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,578
Yes, Your Highness.

76
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,756
That little...

77
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,886
My apologies, Your Highness.

78
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,097
Do you expect me to drink this

79
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,309
after being disgusted by your gagging?

80
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,772
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

81
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,607
I’ve been sick lately, so--

82
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,235
No need for excuses.
Take her out of my sight!

83
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,072
Your Highness...

85
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,033
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I beg you, please...

86
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,996
Your Highness!

87
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,268
Are you sure this is safe?

88
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,937
Wild ginger can make you all swell up.

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,230
That’s exactly how it works.

90
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,316
If you use a small amount,
it makes your wrinkles disappear.

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,902
It gives you a round forehead,
and nicely fills up under your eyes, too!

92
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,738
It’s a method that can be used

93
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,992
to utilize poison to one’s advantage.

94
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,955
And this man here is Do-gi,
the master of poisons!

95
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,209
Have you all heard?

96
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,422
The furnace is being heated up
a lot these days.

97
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,966
The weather is warm.

98
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,551
Why is it being heated up?

99
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,054
Exactly. Nobody is expected to go
to the furnace room these days.

100
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,017
That’s why it’s a perfect place
for a secret meetup

101
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,060
for a lonely eunuch

102
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,812
and a court lady.

103
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,523
In secret, they...

104
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,443
What do they do?

105
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,908
We wasted too much time.
It’s getting late!

106
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,952
-Are you not leaving?
-We should go!

107
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,079
-You're leaving?
-Bye!

108
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,706
Finish your story!

109
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,959
Maybe they...

110
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,044
Maybe...

111
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,962
Do they eat meat by themselves?

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,551
Her Highness was already annoyed
by the rumors floating around.

113
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,304
On top of that, the court lady gagged

114
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,557
in front of Her Highness.

115
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,809
But His Majesty

116
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,396
hasn't visited the court ladies’ residence
for years.

117
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,190
If it was not His Majesty...

118
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,902
It must have been one
of the royal kindred or the guards.

119
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,612
You never know.

120
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,908
I've seen some eunuchs who managed
to get the thing working again.

121
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,244
The subjects who work under the Queen

122
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,496
must be quite aggravated right now.

123
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,708
Her Highness has ordered everyone
to get to the bottom of this.

124
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,962
Even the eunuchs are
not clear of suspicion.

125
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,884
We will run the drug test again

126
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,346
on every single eunuch.

127
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,350
That is a wise decision, Chief Eunuch.

128
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:24,730
We need to stop this crazy rumor
about us eunuchs once and for all.

129
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,193
What about the eunuch trainees?

130
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,367
Why have you not touched your meal,
Your Highness?

131
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,705
The Crown Prince does not eat anything
that has not been tasted.

132
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,707
FOOD TASTING: CONFIRMING
IF THE FOOD IS SAFE TO CONSUME

133
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,959
I see. Why isn’t there anyone here?

134
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,460
I will go get somebody.

135
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,129
Perhaps you can do the job.

136
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,384
Come closer and have a seat.

137
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,977
Do you want me to taste it, Your Highness?

138
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,591
The food is safe, Your Highness.

139
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,224
It's salty.

140
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,147
It's too fishy.

141
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,732
My goodness.

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,734
He's still fussy about food.

143
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,571
I don't want to eat it. You can have it.

144
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,117
Please think about the effort
all the court ladies put in and have some.

145
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,036
If you don't want it,
I will ask them to take it out.

146
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,746
-Is anybody--
-I will eat it, Your Highness.

147
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,376
I will eat it.

148
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,221
Here.

149
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,373
How can a small person like you

150
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,542
eat this much of food?

151
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,092
Your Highness,

152
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,346
my grandfather once said

153
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,349
-a scholar should never hesitate to ask--
-All right.

154
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,892
Go ahead and ask.

155
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,857
Well...

156
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,694
You have asked me to stay by your side,

157
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,447
and I'm not sure
what you meant by that, Your Highness.

158
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,992
What do you think?
It's just how it sounds.

159
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,704
I simply want to keep a eunuch I favor
close to me.

160
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,205
What is so strange about that?

161
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,670
I see. That's what you meant...

162
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,143
You are already five steps behind me.

163
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,187
Pardon?

164
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,985
I'm here, Your Highness.

165
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,451
You're back, My Lord.

166
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,495
Is Yun-seong in?

167
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,919
Were you reading?

168
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,712
Yes, Grandfather.

169
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,383
I arranged your marriage
with Minister Cho's daughter.

170
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,762
After you get married... After that,

171
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,182
I will make someone from our family
the crown princess consort.

172
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,936
What? But I am not ready yet.

173
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,189
Do you think this is about finding
a match for you?

174
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,733
Until when will you be so nonchalant?

175
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,818
Grandfather, I--

176
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,320
All you need to do is do as I say.

177
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,782
She's known to be beautiful and clever.

178
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,784
There is nothing for you to worry.

179
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,503
-Go inside.
-I don't want to.

180
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,255
Just go inside.

181
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,762
Didn't I tell you we should stop this?

182
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,641
Don't you know that the court lady
who got pregnant has disappeared?

183
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,312
That's why I'm telling you
I will be more careful.

184
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,983
I'm sick of meeting you
in secret like this.

185
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,903
What else could
eunuchs and court ladies do?

186
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,447
Everyone secretly dates each other.

187
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,368
Can you tell other people
that you like me?

188
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,412
Are you out of your mind?

189
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,248
Doing that could put you in danger.

190
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,125
Exactly.

191
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,544
We'll end up hurting each other.

192
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,550
You...

193
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,567
You coward.

194
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,486
Wol-hui.

195
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,780
Wol-hui.

196
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,240
Wol-hui.

197
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,747
Eunuch Ma.

198
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,249
I didn't mean to look, sir.

199
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,501
You.

200
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,545
You'd better seal your mouth.
It's for your sake.

201
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,062
How many did I do?

202
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,648
You did 25.

203
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,734
By the way, Your Highness,

204
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,904
His Highness is almost always surrounded
by court ladies, right?

205
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,658
Yes.

206
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,996
He must want to spend
time alone sometimes.

207
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,541
Sometimes,

208
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,460
he takes a stroll
in the garden by himself.

209
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,046
The garden?

210
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,841
How many did I do?

211
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,765
You girls!

212
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,640
Aren't you the Crown Prince?

213
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,359
Don't tell me you don't remember me.

214
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,112
I remember you.

215
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,574
But what brings you here?

216
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,952
I came to the palace
to see Princess Myeongeun.

217
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,412
Did you get lost again?

218
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,751
I was drawn by the beautiful flowers

219
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,503
and ended up here.

220
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,799
It's not a place
you can just accidentally end up in.

221
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,801
Did Princess Myeongeun

222
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,970
tell you about the quicker way
to get here?

223
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,305
Pardon?

224
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,266
Do you think

225
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,520
I crawled through a doghole to get here?

226
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,033
It's all ruined.

227
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,078
I wanted to give you an impression

228
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,748
that we were fated to run into each other.

229
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,918
"Fated to run into each other"?

230
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,880
My plan has been revealed,
so I can't help it.

231
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,886
BOOK OF CHANGES

232
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,307
According to Book of Changes,

233
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,477
while one should
rectify their mind and train their body,

234
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,105
they should take a rest when night falls.

235
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,481
According to Book of Documents,

236
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,441
one must understand the difficulty
of being complacent

237
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,736
in order to guard oneself
against complacency.

238
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,116
So, you are telling me to just rest
when I'm resting.

239
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,701
Yes, Your Highness.

240
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,704
If you don't mind,
will you put down the book

241
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,373
and take a walk with me, Your Highness?

242
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,251
"There’s no particular reason not to,
but I'm afraid I can't."

243
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,295
I feel so humiliated!

244
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,716
And why did he have to smile like that?

245
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,802
He's getting my hopes up.

246
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,658
This...

247
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,744
This is Ma Jong-ja!

248
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,750
Jong-ja! Fetch me some food!

249
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,878
This is Ma Jong-ja out here!

250
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,514
Come out.

251
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,518
I said, come out!

252
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,232
Come out, Wol--

253
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,700
He must be crazy.

254
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,536
What has gotten into him?

255
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,833
Why are you following me?

256
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,461
Are you after Wol-hui?
If so, I’m going to kill you.

257
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,715
No, I'm just...

258
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,884
I was worried about you...

259
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,428
You should worry about your own problems,

260
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,097
you fake eunuch--

261
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,602
Are you all right?

262
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,115
You're still breathing, so you're fine.

263
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,951
Man up. This should be nothing.

264
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,552
Chief Kim, I have a question.
Can a eunuch and a court lady

265
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,888
ever be together?

266
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,391
It cannot happen
without His Majesty’s permission.

267
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,856
I'll pretend that I didn't hear
what you just said this time.

268
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,524
You should stay out of this.

269
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,320
Did you hear everything, Your Highness?

270
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,866
-But there could be a way--
-It is against the law.

271
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,080
I am aware of that, of course.

272
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,708
But how can anybody say it's wrong

273
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,169
to have feelings for someone?

274
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,663
You little...

275
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,128
How dare you run away
after hitting me in the neck last night?

276
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,879
It wasn't me...

277
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,509
I was trying to stop you
from making a terrible mistake.

278
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,762
You can’t just get drunk and barge into
the court ladies' residence.

279
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,014
-You even yelled, “Come out”--
-Enough!

280
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,397
What do you really want to do, Eunuch Ma?

281
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,690
Who?

282
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,733
Me?

283
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,069
I can’t do anything.

284
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,826
There's nothing I can do about it.

285
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,877
Maybe I can help you, Eunuch Ma.

286
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,464
Are you trying to get me killed?

287
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,427
What if I have an idea?

288
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,813
You are saying the grain storage
at the Famine Relief Bureau was raided,

289
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,191
and Deputy-Minister of Taxation
Kim Jang-seok

290
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,151
decided to take responsibility for it
and resign?

291
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:51,948
Yes, Your Majesty. He is supposed to do so
as it occurred under his supervision.

292
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:57,787
I’ve heard that he had a bad reputation
for keeping the relief rice to himself,

293
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,334
but such things
are not recorded here at all.

294
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,755
Why are you focusing on such minor fault
of the deputy-minister

295
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,425
based on some ridiculous rumors
from ignorant people?

296
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:16,848
Do you even know what kind of people
raided the bureau, Your Majesty?

297
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,311
Tell me who they were.

298
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,814
Those who were involved in
the recent suspicious incidents

299
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,943
were wearing this mask.

300
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,489
They are all

301
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,866
Hong Gyeong-rae’s men.

302
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,750
But he’s already dead!

303
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,921
Right. And that’s why they are so eager

304
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,090
to find his offspring!

305
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,424
Are you saying

306
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,804
that those men wearing the mask
are searching for that traitor’s offspring

307
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,098
to make them as their new leader?

308
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,686
I could not tell you before
since I was worried about your health,

309
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,233
but it seems like Hong Gyeong-rae's men
are up for something.

310
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,902
Capture every one of them!

311
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,865
We can’t let the same thing happen again!

312
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,210
JAHYEONDANG

313
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,187
Chief Kim, are you concerned
about something?

314
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,738
You know, sewing helps to clear your mind.

315
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,032
-Why don’t you--
-Be quiet.

316
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,203
Fine. I didn't expect
you would help me anyway.

317
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,498
This is not something
anyone can do, you know.

318
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,337
I bet you can’t even
thread a needle properly.

319
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,361
You’re awesome!

320
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,863
You always prove yourself
with your actions.

321
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,160
-Blow the candle out. It's time to sleep.
-Wait!

322
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,623
Since you've already
threaded the needle...

323
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,126
please do this one, too.

324
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,592
Chief Kim!

325
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,435
-Break it up!
-Stop!

326
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,854
-Eunuch Jang...
-Stop it at once!

327
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,984
Your Highness.

328
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,125
You are not going to tell me
what happened,

329
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,252
are you?

330
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,134
Well, if you don’t feel like telling me...

331
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,637
Should I have the Office
of Eunuch Attendants handle this matter?

332
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,930
Or the Royal Investigation Bureau?

333
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,979
Bring the Chief Eunuch
and the investigator!

334
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,147
Your Highness!

335
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,317
Some of the eunuchs
were talking nonsense, so I...

336
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,028
I'm sure it wasn't total nonsense.

337
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,407
I'm the Crown Prince,
and I'm used to criticism.

338
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,034
What did they say?

339
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
They were saying...

340
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,332
that Your Highness...

341
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,334
likes men.

342
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,966
How dare they say such a thing about you!

343
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,061
Seriously? That was it?

344
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,521
Forget it.

345
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,524
Do not waste your time on such nonsense.

346
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,694
They say you looked at Eunuch Hong
so affectionately as if he's your lover.

347
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,820
I said, forget it.

348
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,240
They said that Your Highness treats
Eunuch Hong as if he is your lover.

349
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,367
That's enough! Don't say another word.

350
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,077
You will soon carry out

351
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,288
great responsibilities
on behalf of His Majesty.

352
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,833
I could not help it as I was worried
it might bring trouble to you.

353
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,961
My apologies, Your Highness.

354
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,372
What is this?

355
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,791
It is nothing.

356
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,252
Tell me the truth!

357
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,561
What are you planning to do?

358
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,813
I will count to three, and you should...

359
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,440
This thing will convey the true heart

360
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,151
without getting anyone hurt.

361
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,823
I warned you not to intervene
in Eunuch Ma's matter.

362
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,784
I will not do anything
that goes against the law.

363
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,206
It is futile.

364
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,837
Nothing will change even if he tells her
how he really feels about her.

365
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,845
No one stretches their arm up,
expecting to touch the sky.

366
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,727
Everyone knows that all court ladies
belong to His Majesty.

367
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,149
Then?

368
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,068
It's true
that it would not change anything.

369
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,571
But how do you stop yourself
from falling for someone?

370
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,449
Even though you know nothing will change,

371
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,576
you would want the other to know
of your feelings for them.

372
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,130
Getting your feelings out in the open
just to make yourself feel better?

373
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,592
That is very selfish.

374
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:14,182
Is it wrong to confess your love
to someone you can never be with?

375
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,101
You must love someone dearly

376
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,687
to be able to let that person go
for their own good.

377
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,899
Who knows

378
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,361
if the memory of being loved

379
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,488
can give you the strength to carry on?

380
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,620
Your Highness

381
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,873
would never understand such feelings.

382
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,104
Goodness.

383
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,856
You have to say what you want to say

384
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,693
and you cannot stand losing even to a man.

385
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,946
What shall I do with you?

386
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,574
Why are you bringing that up
all of a sudden?

387
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,787
You will be
such a pampered daughter-in-law.

388
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,581
I wonder if your in-laws would be able to
see you in a good light.

389
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,335
What? A daughter-in-law?

390
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,056
Sir.

391
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,604
I really wanted to come sit
under this tree.

392
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,318
Who on earth made you so upset,
Eunuch Hong?

393
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,322
I did.

394
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,783
I am the one
who makes myself angry the most.

395
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,916
It ails me that I seem to bring
trouble to the Crown Prince.

396
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,005
Do you mean that as a eunuch?

397
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,924
Of course.

398
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,806
Maybe it is because you don't belong here.

399
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,437
This robe you're wearing
does not suit you either.

400
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,825
Sir.

401
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,913
Didn't you buy this for someone special?

402
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,706
Right.

403
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,876
I was waiting for the day

404
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,295
she can accept this gladly.

405
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,215
Then why did you bring it here?

406
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,717
I really want to...

407
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,720
ask her something today.

408
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,067
Do you not wish to live as a woman?

409
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,784
From Premier Kim?

410
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,995
Do not be surprised.

411
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,997
You are not a young girl anymore.

412
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,169
Premier Kim has a very reliable grandson.

413
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,883
You have not given him the answer yet,
have you?

414
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,220
Why? Do you not want to get married?

415
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,558
I am a little baffled
as this is something unexpected.

416
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,646
Father.

417
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,524
If I must marry someone,

418
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,861
I would like to marry someone I want.

419
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,419
I am comfortable as I am now.

420
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,923
You can live pretending to be a man,
but it is too dangerous here.

421
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,342
You know that, don't you?

422
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,142
I will help you leave the palace
and live as a woman.

423
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,561
Could you...

424
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
please do that for me?

425
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,402
Since the day I bought this,

426
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,655
I have been wanting to ask you this.

427
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,328
Sir, I am...

428
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,414
I will wait

429
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:53,211
until you find out what you really want.

430
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,077
THE COURT LADY'S LOVER

431
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,664
The most beautiful flower in Joseon,
Do-hwa!

432
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,210
She becomes a court lady
only to be the king's woman.

433
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,879
I am Do-hwa.

434
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,924
I really hate an easy man!

435
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,595
But for over 10 years,
the king has not visited her.

436
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,932
Instead, Eunuch Wang,
who works for the king,

437
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,017
chases after her.

438
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,816
Stop! Do not come near me.
Stay still. Do not move!

439
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,820
I did not become a court lady

440
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,238
to date a eunuch.

441
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,576
However, she only has one person
to rely on in the lonely palace,

442
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,912
and that is Eunuch Wang.

443
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,341
-She's here.
-Is she here?

444
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,986
Where are they going? They're so excited.

445
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,363
The court ladies, who are off duty,
are having a gathering.

446
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,908
I heard some eunuch trainees
will perform something there.

447
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,871
That is ridiculous.
Things are not going well nowadays.

448
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,748
Who are they?

449
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,916
Well, you know.

450
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,543
Is he Hong Sam-nom?

451
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,004
The one who was
among the wandering performers.

452
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,298
Hong Sam-nom?

453
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,799
Yes.

454
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:13,142
At last, the day she will sleep
together with the king has come!

455
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,686
However,

456
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,314
Do-hwa can't get Eunuch Wang off her mind.

457
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,653
Hey.

458
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,114
You have been chasing me around,
saying that you like me.

459
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,533
Why are you not saying anything?

460
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,787
Why can't you tell the world
that I'm your woman?

461
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,539
What am I supposed to do?

462
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,209
A eunuch and a court lady
can never be together.

463
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,797
Are you sure you can live without me?

464
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,007
I will see you around.

465
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,303
Both of us are meant to live
in this palace forever.

466
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:57,353
I'm leaving. It will be useless
if you regret it after I leave.

467
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,939
All right. Go.

468
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,732
Go and live a good life.

469
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,362
If you stay with me, you will only die.

470
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,076
But...

471
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,873
I want to tell you this before you go.

472
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,005
I wanted to say it out loud
in front of all the people.

473
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,221
I love you.

474
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:40,396
I love you more than anything
in this world.

475
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,909
Did you hear that?
Now you know how much I love you.

476
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,463
You may be...

477
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,674
one of many court ladies to the king.

478
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:17,808
But to me, you are my everything.

479
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,243
Now you know.

480
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,719
Is it wrong to confess your love
to someone you can never be with?

481
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,972
You must love someone dearly

482
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,058
to be able to let that person go
for their own good.

483
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,769
Who knows

484
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,647
if the memory of being loved

485
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,732
can give you the strength to carry on?

486
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,645
What do you think you are doing?

487
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,065
Do you not know
what kind of situation we are in?

488
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,695
Who started this?

489
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,399
What brought you here at this hour?

490
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,945
You never responded to my invitation,

491
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,364
my darling Crown Prince.

492
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,287
I took the bait you threw
and came all the way here.

493
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,707
Now that things have turned out
as you wished,

494
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,127
I am going to take this eunuch with me.

495
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,255
Get him up.

496
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,176
I can't let you do that.

497
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,266
This eunuch trainee

498
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,187
has done something he shouldn't have.

499
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,152
Don't you know

500
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,031
that all court ladies
belong to His Majesty?

501
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,279
Please calm down.

502
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,618
It was a love story
of a eunuch and a court lady.

503
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,371
All satirical dramas are like that,
aren't they?

504
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,542
They even call His Majesty

505
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,672
a promiscuous idiot who gets manipulated
by the Queen Consort.

506
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,342
Should we arrest them all
and bring them to you?

507
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,511
Crown Prince!

508
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,764
Get up.

509
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,940
Forgive me, Your Highness.

510
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,942
I told you to get up.

511
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,573
His Majesty can't even sleep at night
because of the violent mobs.

512
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,161
Aren't you worried
about the rumor about you

513
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,123
floating around the palace?

514
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,800
That's enough.

515
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,722
It's a small mistake
made by a young eunuch trainee.

516
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,808
If you let your emotions blind you
and take this further,

517
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,813
things will get complicated.

518
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,073
Let's go.

519
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,961
Are you all right, Your Highness?

520
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,131
I can easily tell by his eyes

521
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,593
that he doesn't consider him as a eunuch

522
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,305
but a lover.

523
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,237
Your Highness, you have handled it well.

524
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,573
Her intention was to get to Your Highness
using him...

525
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,911
Anyway, I'm so glad nothing happened.

526
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,438
I simply want to keep a eunuch I favor
close to me.

527
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,982
What is so strange about that?

528
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,610
You will soon carry out

529
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,654
great responsibilities
on behalf of His Majesty.

530
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,823
I was worried
it might bring trouble to you.

531
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,908
My apologies, Your Highness.

532
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,955
Aren't you worried about the rumor
about you floating around the palace?

533
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,924
EUNUCH TRAINING INSTITUTE

534
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,429
What is there for you to be shy about?

535
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,431
Are you teasing me?

536
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,976
You have to pull your pants down
for the drug test.

537
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,520
This is so frustrating.

538
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,731
In fact...

539
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,941
Eunuch Seong,

540
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,277
I have something to tell you--

541
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,029
No, you don't.

542
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:32,743
Hurry up and pull your pants down.

543
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,954
It's...

544
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,081
I am...

545
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,168
I am...

546
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,423
What is it again?

547
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,343
It's nothing.

548
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,305
Someone sent croakers to the palace,

549
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,725
and the Queen would like you
to take this to Premier Kim's house.

550
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,435
No, I will take it myself.

551
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,519
Hey.

552
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,314
Why would you go there?

553
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,775
I am the Queen's eunuch.

554
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,193
You seemed occupied.

555
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,277
Gosh.

556
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,532
You should run the test on him.

557
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,660
Do it thoroughly.

558
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,744
I will.

559
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,852
PASS

560
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,288
When did you find out, sir?

561
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,708
When the banquet was held.

562
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,631
I am sorry, sir.

563
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,469
Well, that is that.

564
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,474
Thank you.

565
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,234
Seeing you two that night
made me feel better.

566
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,737
Why?

567
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,950
You saved your skin this time,

568
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,121
but even His Majesty cannot ensure
his safety in the palace.

569
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,331
Do you understand?

570
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,294
I do.

571
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,425
I should leave if I can.

572
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,708
Straighten your shoulders
and look me in the eye.

573
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,670
Your Highness.

574
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,340
This is the proper posture for a eunuch.

575
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,591
I know that.

576
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,677
Has someone scolded you?

577
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,889
Are you told not to walk beside me
and make an eye contact?

578
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,059
No, Your Highness.

579
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,352
Then,

580
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,355
I must have upset you.

581
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,327
Your Highness,

582
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,747
you should not be too nice to me.

583
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,753
I can neither be a friend

584
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,090
nor something else to you.

585
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,884
Someone who can neither be a friend

586
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,972
nor something else to me?

587
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,269
A eunuch should stay a step behind you.

588
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,774
I was taught that I should not be closer
or farther than that.

589
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,819
You are my person.

590
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,781
Who can decide the distance
between you and me?

591
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,869
Please be nice to me

592
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,454
as much as you are to other eunuchs.

593
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:52,294
I would be thankful enough for that,
Your Highness.

594
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,106
It's true
that it would not change anything.

595
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,817
But how do you stop yourself
from falling for someone?

596
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,528
Even though you know nothing will change,

597
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,947
you would want the other to know
of your feelings for them.

598
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,603
Do you not wish to live as a woman?

599
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,610
I should leave if I can.

600
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,143
Were you looking for me, Your Highness?

601
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,249
I lied to you.

602
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,505
I told you to stay by my side,

603
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,092
but I didn't mean it as a eunuch.

604
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,934
Then why...

605
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,063
did I say that to you?

606
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,029
To sort this ridiculous mess out,

607
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,031
every night

608
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,075
I questioned myself,

609
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,705
and I finally found the answer.

610
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,346
Your Highness,

611
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,808
may I ask what you are doing?

612
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,731
I am the Crown Prince.

613
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,234
But I am also a human being.

614
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,112
And I am a man.

615
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,619
I am

616
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,663
in love with you.

617
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,045
That is my answer.

618
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,847
No, well...

619
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,892
Why are you doing this to me?

620
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,145
You like beautiful flowers.

621
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,607
I am a man... I mean, I'm a eunuch.

622
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,734
This is not acceptable, Your Highness.

623
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,238
Don't tell me I shouldn't feel this way
about you.

624
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,827
You told me before

625
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,539
that nobody can say it is wrong

626
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,625
to have feelings for someone.

627
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,961
Pardon?

628
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,382
I did.

629
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,260
However,

630
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,973
even when it comes to love,

631
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,142
there is always right and wrong.

632
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,895
No one would see this as...

633
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,065
No one would bless...

634
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,235
-No, you should never do this--
-Yes, I know.

635
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,988
But,

636
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,032
I've already decided to love you

637
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,828
even if it is wrong.
