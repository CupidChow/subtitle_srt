1
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,850
I am Kim Su-ran from Embroidery Bureau.

2
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,481
You can't go in. Go over to that side.

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,571
I did get permission from my superior.

4
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,116
All court ladies in your age are banned
from leaving the palace.

5
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,786
Next.

6
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,047
PASS

7
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,428
-I work at the Crown Prince's palace--
-Hello.

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,348
Hello, sir.

9
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
He's my company.

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,317
Do you need any more confirmation?

11
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,194
No, sir.

12
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,054
I couldn't find any trace of her.

13
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,515
Did you notice anything

14
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,393
before she disappeared?

15
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,104
No, Your Highness.

16
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,835
Minister of Taxation.

17
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,172
Have you heard about
fledgling legerdemain?

18
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,175
Fledgling legerdemain?

19
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,678
The term refers to how the government
registered babies as adults

20
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,306
and levied tax on them.

21
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,229
They even keep the names of
dead men on the tax rosters.

22
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,775
There were times
when the tax was levied wrongly

23
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,069
because tax collectors made mistakes
from time to time.

24
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,199
How could you blame
your subordinates for this?

25
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:06,454
Come up with a way to compensate
those falsely levied subjects right now.

26
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,250
Your Highness.

27
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,419
The financial condition of the government
isn't so great at the moment.

28
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,046
Instead of compensation,

29
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,841
why don't you correct this corruption
with punishment?

30
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,553
However, if the punishment leads to

31
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,098
a decreased number in tax,

32
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,351
the state coffers will face more danger.

33
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,607
I'm touched by how deeply you care
about the nation.

34
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,193
Then

35
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,655
I'll take a special measure
now that the nation is in crisis.

36
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,369
I'll reduce the salaries of the officials
whose ranks are higher than third-rank.

37
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,042
Your Highness,

38
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,711
that can't be done.

39
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,838
It cannot be done.

40
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,673
The government has never reduced

41
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,967
the salaries of all those officials.

42
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,510
Please reconsider.

43
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,179
-Please reconsider.
-Please reconsider.

44
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,473
Subjects

45
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,436
have to pay tax for the deceased
because of the officials' corruption.

46
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,065
How could you make a fuss about this
as the noblemen in this nation?

47
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,067
Do you think

48
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,113
you deserve to receive a salary
from the nation?

49
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,598
-Eunuch Jang.
-Yes?

50
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,391
You look terrible.

51
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,227
Don't get me started.

52
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,563
No wonder why he's like this.

53
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,109
The Crown Prince is so cold
like an icicle in winter these days.

54
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,319
An icicle?

55
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,863
He's so cold and sharp

56
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,241
that it might hurt
a lot if you get pricked.

57
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,244
I don't mind if I get hurt,

58
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,122
but His Highness focuses only on work
all night long.

59
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,041
I'm so worried about his health.

60
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,043
It's killing me.

61
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,462
By the way,

62
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,798
where did Eunuch Hong go?

63
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,466
I have no idea.

64
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,344
He disappeared overnight
without any trace.

65
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,431
He used to jump around here and there
like a rabbit.

66
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,519
I miss Hong Sam-nom.

67
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,856
I'm upset about how he left
without saying goodbye to us.

68
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,029
Eunuch Hong?

69
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,407
Your Highness, I didn't find

70
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,077
any movement of the rebellion
from the dead assassins.

71
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,831
They must be waiting for
things to calm down.

72
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,042
That may be the case,

73
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,795
but I've found something strange.

74
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,172
What is it?

75
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,300
Recently,
Minister of Public Administration

76
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,803
sold a few official positions
for gold bars.

77
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,473
I dismissed him for cornering the market
not long ago.

78
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:13,975
I see.

79
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,687
However, it's suspicious
where the gold bars

80
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:19,981
ended up.

81
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,817
Where is it?

82
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,862
The brother of the dead assassin
went to gamble

83
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,489
with those gold bars.

84
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,868
The dead assassin received the gold bars

85
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,954
in exchange for something?

86
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,248
Yes.

87
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,918
Your Highness,
the Lieutenant is here to see you.

88
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,712
Let him in.

89
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,301
What is the matter?

90
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,635
Your Highness.

91
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,930
While investigating the burglary
of Jung Man-sik's house in Unjongga,

92
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,891
we caught someone suspicious.

93
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,352
She seems to be a teenager,

94
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,065
but we've found evidence
that she's a member of Baekwoon Group.

95
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,071
Let's go.

96
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,407
I need to see her in person.

97
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,483
It's white egret flower, right?

98
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,153
So you remember.

99
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,204
My old friend always carried
a handkerchief,

100
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,873
and it had this flower embroidered on it.

101
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,169
He said it was from his wife
who parted from him.

102
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,924
"I miss you

103
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,468
even in my dream."

104
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:05,271
Do you think Father knew
the meaning of this flower?

105
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,317
Perhaps.

106
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,250
Is it too hard for you?

107
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,212
No.

108
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,011
By the way, how did you get to meet Dad?

109
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,810
We were hometown friends.

110
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,356
He was one of those men who liked me.

111
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,983
The other men gave me

112
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:56,072
ornaments and wildflowers,

113
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,115
but he was a bit different.

114
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
What did he give you?

115
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,749
Barley.

116
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,251
Corns.

117
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,964
If he couldn't get them, he brought me
wild greens or tree bark.

118
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,052
I thought he wouldn't make me starve,

119
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,429
so I proposed to him.

120
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,273
Father knew nothing about romance.

121
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,985
He had fields to work in.

122
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,906
Food to eat when he was hungry.

123
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,327
A house to sleep at night.

124
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,041
Those were all...

125
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,087
that he wanted.

126
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,154
Are you saying when you arrived

127
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,782
she had already disappeared?

128
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,952
Yes.

129
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,247
Of all occasion,

130
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,460
I cannot believe it happened before
we transferred her to the headquarter.

131
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,254
I suppose she had to hide

132
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,215
since the palace guards closed in.

133
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,302
You said

134
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,597
that she knows nothing about
her family history

135
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,891
related to the uprising

136
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,686
or Baekwoon Group, didn't you?

137
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,440
Well, yes.

138
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,486
She did not seem to know at all back then.

139
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,200
I see.

140
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,285
You may leave now.

141
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,045
However, keep one thing in mind.

142
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,176
Even if she knew her identity,

143
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,678
the safest place for her

144
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,348
would be Baekwoon Group.

145
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,155
Your Highness.

146
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,366
Did you want to see me?

147
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,707
Are you all right?

148
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,254
Are you worried about me?

149
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,052
You loved a woman enough to declare
a war against me, and she's gone.

150
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,683
Why are you not curious about anything?

151
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,979
Such as whether she left a letter for me,

152
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,855
or if she told me

153
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,317
where she went?

154
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,864
Even if you know something,

155
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,409
you cannot share it with me anyway,
can you?

156
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,412
That is your relationship with me,
Your Highness.

157
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,083
That is why I am asking nothing.

158
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,965
I am not like that.

159
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,386
Even though it might be useless,

160
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,557
I want to ask you

161
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,560
if you know anything,

162
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,854
whatever it might be.

163
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,860
My apologies, Your Highness.

164
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,862
I'm sorry
I couldn't not be of help to you.

165
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,034
You'd say you know nothing if that's true,

166
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,078
and you'd say the same
even if you know something.

167
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,457
It seems like that to me.

168
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,543
Yes.

169
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,337
You are right.

170
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,006
That is what I would do.

171
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,332
Your Highness.

172
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,593
You are not greeting me
even when you come across me by accident.

173
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,430
I did not see you.

174
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,559
I envy you.

175
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,647
For what?

176
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,400
I wish

177
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,237
I could miss you and walk away.

178
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,491
It would be better

179
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,245
if I could pretend I didn't see you
and walk away indifferently.

180
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,002
Why do you look so depressed?

181
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,671
It breaks my heart.

182
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,679
Why do you have

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,515
such a look in front of me?

184
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,018
You said it's just business.

185
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,483
Well, between man and woman,

186
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,403
emotion other than love can exist.

187
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,614
We may have to make a deal
for the rest of our life together.

188
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,992
Is it wrong if we get little friendlier?

189
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,043
So, I mean,

190
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,298
please do not walk so weakly.

191
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,720
Do not look like you lost everything.

192
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,898
The one you love

193
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,734
would have said the same thing

194
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,404
if she had seen how you look now.

195
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,957
Yes, I will leave.

196
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,710
However,

197
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,672
I will see you again, Your Highness.

198
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,402
CROWN PRINCE'S PALACE

199
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,948
The moon looks like that
when it is seen from the palace.

200
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,203
It is the same moon.

201
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,122
What is different about it?

202
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,668
When I was young,

203
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,462
I went here and there
with wandering performers.

204
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,635
I thought the moon looked different
depending on where you were.

205
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,848
The moon was round in Yeongnam area,

206
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,018
and the moon was crescent in Honam area.

207
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,731
Did you move that much

208
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,775
between the places to stay?

209
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,986
Yes.

210
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,115
It is interesting, right?

211
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,997
Haven't you had such a wild thought?

212
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,500
No.

213
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,922
You find out about the sun,
the moon, and 24 seasonal divisions

214
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,798
when you are only five years old.

215
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,636
How could you have such a silly idea?

216
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,765
All right, all right.

217
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,101
I was just kidding.

218
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,943
I have not told this to anyone.

219
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,113
I was even sillier than you.

220
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,534
When I was young,

221
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,913
I thought this palace
was all of the world.

222
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,712
The highest, noblest, and narrowest
well in Joseon...

223
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,800
is this palace, where I grew up.

224
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,681
So I am better than you.

225
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,644
Even though they were the lowest
and pettiest places,

226
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,480
I hung around in only wide areas.

227
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,493
Ra-on.

228
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,291
Whether seen from the palace
or the noble neighborhood,

229
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,085
the moon is just the moon.

230
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,632
Although I am the Crown Prince,
whatever you are,

231
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,302
wherever we might be,

232
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,930
it is all right
if we have the same thought

233
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,475
like the moon.

234
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,275
Yes, Your Highness.

235
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,649
Your Highness.

236
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,583
-Your Highness.
-Please pluck up.

237
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,793
Please brace yourself.

238
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,257
Please hang in there!

239
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,343
-Your Highness!
-You should not stop!

240
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,969
Pull yourself together, Your Highness!

241
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,266
The due date is a month ahead.

242
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,018
How can this happen?

243
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,812
Your Majesty.

244
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,564
She will be all right.

245
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,484
Please do not worry.

246
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,916
Her Highness has finished
the delivery already.

247
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,376
She is taking a rest.

248
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,545
She said you do not need to come.

249
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,797
Why have you not informed me earlier?

250
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,007
It just happened suddenly.

251
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,384
My apology.

252
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,270
The baby is coming out.

253
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,953
It's a princess, Your Highness.

254
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,146
Your Highness,

255
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,773
are you really

256
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,318
not going to see her face?

257
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,363
I don't need to.

258
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,577
Take her away.

259
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,503
She gave birth to a prince.

260
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,715
Congratulations, sir.

261
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,092
Congratulations.

262
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,261
Don't make a fuss about it.

263
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,723
Now, we should get things ready.

264
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,393
What do you mean?

265
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,313
The new Prince is born,

266
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,649
so the Crown Prince's palace
needs a new owner as well.

267
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,527
Watch what you say.

268
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,322
It's because I'm bothered by
Minister Cho's attitude.

269
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,619
I was worried the Crown Princess consort
might come from his family.

270
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,332
This way, we just have to change
the owners of the Crown Prince's palace.

271
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,168
There's no need to rush

272
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,546
whoever sits in that position.

273
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,340
That's right, sir.

274
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,733
Hold on.

275
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,071
All right.

276
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,990
Let's go. Goodness.

277
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,493
Cover it. Go now.

278
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,604
One, two, three.

279
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,734
Your Highness.

280
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,613
Oh, goodness.

281
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,616
I didn't know you were there.

282
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,203
Yes, Your Highness. Have you been well?

283
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,997
Yes.

284
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,709
I'm on my way for a walk.

285
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,587
Join me if you'd like.

286
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,643
I liked that groundless rudeness of yours.

287
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,438
It made me feel so relieved.

288
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:18,279
So how about we become friends
and talk to each other casually like this

289
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,158
when we're alone?

290
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,120
Deok-ho.

291
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,295
I can't do that, Your Highness.

292
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,757
Why not?

293
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,593
It's because...

294
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,516
I don't even know your name.

295
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,233
My name is Myeong-eun.

296
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,487
Okay,

297
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,907
Myeong-eun.

298
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,348
How dare you!

299
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,559
This is too soon.

300
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,020
Right? My apology, Your Highness.

301
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,396
Wait, no. Myeong-eun.

302
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,318
But it hurts so much.

303
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,994
I got news from
the Queen's palace just now.

304
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,374
The Queen has given birth to a prince.

305
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,756
Congratulations, Father.

306
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,221
I'm well aware
that it's not something to be happy about

307
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,642
in your position as the Crown Prince.

308
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,733
The throne is hard to protect
just as it's high and noble,

309
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,362
but he's my little brother
who just came out to this world.

310
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:27,200
Please don't worry, Father.

311
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,424
The Crown Prince
must be feeling so anxious.

312
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,095
He must be
because his precious eunuch disappeared.

313
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,014
What? A eunuch disappeared?

314
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,183
Didn't you know?

315
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:57,313
The day when the palace was busy
looking for Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter,

316
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,607
he disappeared like without a trace.

317
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,987
I see. That's suspicious.

318
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,075
Don't get me started. He got caught,
running away on the first day.

319
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,871
Not long ago, he was taken to the Queen

320
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,249
because we found women's clothes
in his residence.

321
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,751
It was crazy.

322
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,089
Like always,
the Crown Prince saved him from there.

323
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,384
Women's clothes?

324
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,053
The Crown Prince saved him?

325
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,432
Yes. He adored that eunuch so much

326
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,977
because he worked
at the Crown Prince's palace.

327
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,773
How interesting.

328
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,164
Your Highness.

329
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,010
The assassins attacked your residence,
and your precious eunuch ran away.

330
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,266
My heart broke
when I heard you were in agony these days.

331
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,855
That's right.

332
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:27,236
While I was interrogating
the criminal the other day,

333
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,323
I discovered something very amusing.

334
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,327
Something amusing?

335
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,334
His family

336
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,587
had heavy gold bars

337
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,007
which came from your pocket.

338
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,013
I don't know what you're talking about.

339
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,349
That's what I want to ask.

340
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,853
In exchange for what
did you give that gold bar

341
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,190
to the assassin who attacked my palace?

342
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,331
Who knew that the gold bars
had numbers engraved on them?

343
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,709
This is going to be a headache.

344
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,837
I gave a huge amount of money to
someone who attacked his palace.

345
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,007
I can't cover the fact
from being revealed as high treason.

346
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,052
The Queen gave birth to a prince,
but he's still so stubborn.

347
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,139
I thought he was only a baby.

348
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,600
What if Premier Kim
gets implicated in this?

349
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,436
It could be horrible then.

350
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,116
Premier Kim.

351
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,621
My apology.

352
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,376
Don't even start anything
that you'll apologize for.

353
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,267
It's so pretty.

354
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,401
I mean, the moon.

355
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,115
Do you want to look at it more closely?

356
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,959
What is that?

357
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,170
It's called binoculars.

358
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,675
It enables you to look at
faraway objects more closely.

359
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,222
Like this.

360
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,037
You are right.

361
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,041
My eyes are filled with the moon.

362
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,848
Whether seen from the palace
or the noble neighborhood,

363
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,934
the moon is just the moon.

364
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,898
Although I am the Crown Prince,
whatever you are,

365
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,650
wherever we might be,

366
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,321
it is all right
if we have the same thought

367
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,365
like the moon.

368
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,425
Is it that amazing?

369
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,808
You must be missing someone

370
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,478
who is far away now.

371
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,610
No, I am not.

372
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,363
The moon is so big like a basket,

373
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,741
so I kept my eyes open wide in awe.

374
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,648
Premier Kim is waiting for you.

375
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,025
Please come inside.

376
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:55,166
The eunuch from Crown Prince's palace
is the daughter of Hong Gyeong-rae?

377
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,084
My goodness.

378
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,796
How can a woman become a eunuch?

379
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,673
At that, in a palace,

380
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,717
by the Crown Prince's side as a spy.

381
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,305
Don't we have to arrest her right away?

382
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,932
It is too late.

383
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,602
She must have run away already.

384
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,563
What did you

385
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,648
just say?

386
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,737
Her name as a child was Hong Ra-on.

387
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,538
That was why he was so pale that day.

388
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,755
If she ran away, we can catch her.

389
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,761
Do you know where she is hiding
by any chance, sir?

390
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,899
Shame on Minister Kim.

391
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,486
Within a month, for the same reason,

392
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,905
he might be discharged from your office.

393
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,241
About the gold bars,

394
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,119
I need a clear explanation.

395
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,873
Do you know what information
Minister Kim tried to buy

396
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,875
with such a huge amount of money?

397
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,795
What is it?

398
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,216
Hong Ra-on.

399
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,848
The spy from Baekwoon Group
who sneaked in by your side.

400
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,560
She gave help for attacking
Crown Prince's palace.

401
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,939
What is the evidence?

402
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,609
She is the clear evidence.

403
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,657
I am sure you are furious enough
to shudder.

404
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,618
Do not worry.

405
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,664
I will bring her in front of you

406
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,834
even if I have to cut off her limbs.

407
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,175
By any chance,

408
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,136
were you already aware of it?

409
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,215
Is there an insider from that night

410
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,301
who opened the gates
and allowed your entry?

411
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,513
There is

412
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,974
a Baekwoon Group spy within the palace.

413
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,845
It does not make sense.

414
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,771
What kind of Crown Princess consort
are you going to be?

415
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,233
I will just love,

416
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,195
love, and love him.

417
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,538
Only the loving heart can enable
the perseverance

418
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,874
and sacrifice for the Crown Prince.

419
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,293
That is what I believe.

420
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,471
Your Highness.

421
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,314
You will stay here

422
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,399
while you are being educated.

423
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:28,207
Why have you taken so much work
like this again?

424
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,211
It's good to make much money
when I have much work to do.

425
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,884
People might be getting
nice clothes to get married.

426
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,179
I heard it on my way here.

427
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,306
The marriage prohibition is over.

428
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,433
What?

429
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,939
The spouse for the Crown Prince
is decided.

430
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,774
Only the wedding ceremony is left now.

431
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,654
The Crown Princess consort is
the daughter of Minister of Rites.

432
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,749
That is nice.

433
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,129
I will help you with this.

434
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,423
That's all right. I can do it.

435
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,968
You need something to put these in.

436
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,761
I will bring one for you.

437
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,822
Why are you so surprised, Your Highness?

438
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,410
Shouldn't you be at your own palace?

439
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,997
Did you hear that?

440
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,542
That you are selected
as the Crown Princess consort?

441
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,295
Yes, I did.

442
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,468
I will do my best to assist you.

443
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,554
It is just business.

444
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,390
You do not have to do so.

445
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,439
If you can reign peacefully,

446
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,068
that is a good thing to my family.

447
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,616
As the one doing the business,

448
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,494
I will do my best for my duty.

449
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,209
Instead,

450
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,795
promise me one thing.

451
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,424
What shall I promise?

452
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,595
Do not come in here,

453
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,765
ever again.

454
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,136
I told you not to come.

455
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,189
You starved all day again, didn't you?

456
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,110
-Stand up. Let's--
-Well...

457
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,615
It's too hard for me to see you.

458
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,997
I keep wanting to ask about
how the Crown Prince is.

459
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,961
I have to forget,

460
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,590
and I shouldn't know,
but I keep wanting to know...

461
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,428
whether he eats and sleeps well.

462
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,264
Whether he's sick or not...

463
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,479
You're so good to me,

464
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,857
but I keep wanting to ask you
about these things,

465
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,568
and I hate it so much.

466
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,821
So please don't come.

467
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,075
Please.

468
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,708
It's all right.

469
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,589
I think of

470
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,217
shameful things in mind every day as well.

471
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,096
I think once these hell-like days go by,

472
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,265
you might...

473
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,353
start to like me.

474
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,450
Go ahead and cry.

475
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,748
I will neither be hopeful...

476
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,919
nor be mistaken.

477
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,411
I wasn't going to cry,

478
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,631
but my heart aches so much.

479
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,786
If...

480
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,580
you have to let go of something

481
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,875
in hard times,

482
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,922
it should not be me.

483
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,884
Can you promise me that?

484
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,304
Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,229
I have one request.

486
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,942
Would you allow me

487
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,112
to be right by your side all day long?

488
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,936
Whom are you looking for?

489
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:37,023
I'm here to see Eunuch Hong Sam-nom
on an errand for Chief Eunuch.

490
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,194
Are you here from the palace?

491
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,434
"I have things which I couldn't tell you
in the palace.

492
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,561
It's about your father.

493
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,897
I'll send you the location
and time to meet."

494
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,942
Do you know where that wench is?

495
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,780
We should bring her right now then.

496
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,575
We have her in our hands already,

497
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,744
so we should use her

498
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,914
for a bigger plan now.

499
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:21,336
Then are you saying you'll have
the Crown Prince involved in this?

500
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,048
If it's said that the Crown Prince

501
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,718
has met secretly
with the daughter of the traitor,

502
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,513
what will happen then?

503
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,717
I will

504
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,554
never forgive you.
