1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,473
I tried so hard to escape

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,183
from that dreadful fate.

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,981
I can't let her stay there anymore.

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,942
If anyone

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,403
finds out

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,032
that she's Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter...

7
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,568
I always wondered

8
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,780
why I had to dress as a boy,

9
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,950
run and hide.

10
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,205
Ra-on.

11
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,795
But now I understand
how you must have felt.

12
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,010
You could not tell me

13
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,222
because Father was infamous, right?

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,769
You did not want me to live as the

15
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,689
daughter of a traitor
responsible for the death of thousands.

16
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,363
Do not hate your father

17
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,573
too much.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,537
He only did that to make this
a better place...

19
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,164
for you.

20
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,213
You should have kept it a secret
from me until the end.

21
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,051
No.

22
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,972
You should have told me sooner.

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,483
Ra-on.

24
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,986
I am so sorry.

25
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,863
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,751
Mom.

27
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,421
Let me go.

28
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,843
Ra-on.

29
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,931
I'll be back before you know it. Please?

30
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,811
Ra-on, please, I can't let you.

31
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,146
Please don't go.

32
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,694
He is waiting for me.

33
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,031
Without knowing anything...

34
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,198
JAHYEONDANG

35
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,537
Did you wait for long, Your Highness?

36
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,741
I promised myself not to smile
when I see you again.

37
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,247
I was worried because
you didn't show up on time.

38
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,874
Why?

39
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,835
Will you punish me again?

40
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,257
You seem to be expecting it.

41
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,610
I will forgive you
since you have returned safely.

42
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,107
How is it

43
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,818
that no one else is in sight?

44
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,446
By chance,

45
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,282
has Hun-nam left you with all the work?

46
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,578
I asked to take on the work.

47
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,956
You already have enough on your plate.

48
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,293
I requested to work night shifts
of the Crown Prince's palace

49
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,837
for the next few days as well.

50
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,845
I wasn't there by your side

51
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,223
while you were ill in bed.

52
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,856
I was told to watch out for women
who were filled with jealousy.

53
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,025
If you want me so badly...

54
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,906
you can have me.

55
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,327
Your Highness.

56
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,667
I have one request.

57
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,294
What is it?

58
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,715
Would you allow me

59
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,844
to be right by your side all day long?

60
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,931
Yes.

61
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,810
To rest on your shoulders,

62
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,812
to fall asleep on your lap--

63
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,729
As you wish.

64
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,319
I will plead that you look at me
instead of your books.

65
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,373
It is now my turn.

66
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,962
Are you prepared?

67
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,173
Pardon?

68
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,594
What is it?

69
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,464
You do not have to make requests.

70
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,889
I will grant

71
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,807
all your wishes.

72
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,459
I cannot believe that it happened
undetected by dozens of guards.

73
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,962
This awful and devastating event

74
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,589
has left us speechless.

75
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,551
If I told you

76
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,096
I felt more awful and devastated

77
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,640
over your presence even
after your dismissal,

78
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,850
what would you say?

79
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,399
He loyally took your place
while you were ill.

80
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,653
It is also considered disloyal
for disobeying the orders

81
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,697
of his dismissal and probation.

82
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,169
I may have been ordered for dismissal,

83
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,672
I had to deal with unexpected threats
in the palace.

84
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,467
How could I simply turn my head away
from the issue?

85
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,177
It is true.

86
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,432
He was royally granted his return
for his loyal service.

87
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,642
I beg your understanding.

88
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,147
Your Highness,
please show your understanding.

89
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,317
-Please show your understanding.
-Please show your understanding.

90
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,248
After the alarm drums
and the palace guards' arrival,

91
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,542
only the bodies of nine attackers
remained at site.

92
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,337
Nine bodies...

93
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,630
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,299
All we needed was to catch one alive,

95
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,135
and we could have interrogated him
to uncover the truth.

96
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,137
I apologize.

97
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,100
They could not have breached the walls
without anyone knowing.

98
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,687
There must have been an insider.

99
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,234
We must find

100
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,695
the rest of them.

101
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,489
Yes, Your Highness.

102
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,392
Eunuch Hong.

103
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,819
How do you deal with
the discomfort of your injured hand?

104
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,907
The look on your face
seems more uncomfortable.

105
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,867
Pardon?

106
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,833
You must have been frightened
the other day.

107
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,335
I'm all right.

108
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,629
I didn't get hurt or anything.

109
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,425
How is His Highness doing?

110
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,843
I'm all right.

111
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,892
As you can see.

112
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,705
At some point

113
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,417
it started to get harder to
treat you as I did before.

114
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,755
Maybe it's because I am

115
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,842
the only legitimate son of the Kim family.

116
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,054
I think that is one of the reasons.

117
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,435
However,

118
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,273
I felt sorry to see you block the sword
with your bare hands...

119
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,777
which was aimed at me.

120
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,285
Perhaps, I was making it
all too complicated.

121
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,125
I felt indebted to you.

122
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,253
May I think

123
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,840
I repaid you a little bit?

124
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,348
From now on,

125
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,600
I won't wait, be considerate,

126
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,937
nor ask for your favor anymore.

127
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,275
I don't intend to stop you.

128
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,654
Only after you try enough,

129
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,866
you will be able to give up.

130
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,888
Please listen carefully, Your Highness.

131
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,892
These books on the left need to be dried,

132
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,061
these books on the right are damaged,

133
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,272
and I sorted out the books that

134
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,982
need to be written anew.

135
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,861
Do I have to know that?

136
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,490
You don't have to do it in one go.

137
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,450
You're overexerting yourself.

138
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,167
Whether in one go or slowly,

139
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,629
I need to do it anyway.

140
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,640
Your Highness.

141
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,352
Shall I write down the story I told you

142
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,730
when you couldn't sleep?

143
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,612
It's okay.

144
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,908
Whenever I want to hear that story,
I can call you over.

145
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,913
You are right.

146
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,803
Ra-on.

147
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,741
Your Highness.

148
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,370
I'd like to stay like this

149
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,081
for a moment.

150
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,510
You may stay like that

151
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,346
for as long as you want.

152
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,240
I heard His Highness started
to tend state affairs again.

153
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,451
Yes, My Lady.

154
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,372
You know, Eunuch Hong.

155
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,754
His Highness didn't accept my heart

156
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,255
after all.

157
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,220
So I decided not to show my feelings

158
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,723
to stay beside him.

159
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,351
Are you going to hide your feelings

160
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,645
to stay beside him?

161
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,191
In that case,

162
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,194
although I can't be the one
who he cares for,

163
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,655
but the one who can be of help to him.

164
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,037
Won't it be too difficult for you?

165
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,083
I have a feeling that it will be.

166
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,794
But

167
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,713
he might be able to accept

168
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,049
my love someday.

169
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,977
I look pathetic, don't I?

170
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,232
No, you don't.

171
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,568
Please take good care of him.

172
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,156
He needs

173
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,909
someone like you.

174
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,959
I feel like you are my friend now.

175
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,089
When I feel upset again,

176
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,008
can I call you over and chat with you?

177
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,142
I think I should get going.

178
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,894
In the hope of bumping into him,

179
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,813
I walked around the garden for too long,

180
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,690
so my legs hurt so much now.

181
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,289
My lady...

182
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,612
Where did you go without saying...

183
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,203
What brings you here?

184
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,371
My apologies.

185
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,665
As I have something to tell you,

186
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,501
I got some help from my friend.

187
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,090
Are you feeling better, Your Highness?

188
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,092
I am okay.

189
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,094
I'm feeling much better.

190
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,351
Last time,

191
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,270
you said that you have someone else
in your heart.

192
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,316
I thought a lot about that.

193
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,196
You have someone in your heart,

194
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,531
but you strongly refuse to get married.

195
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,785
Does that mean she is
someone you can't marry?

196
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,123
What do you want to say?

197
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,584
I want to be

198
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,671
your nest.

199
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,803
You can't refuse to get married forever.

200
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,846
If you can't avoid getting married,

201
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,516
how about placing someone
who can be of help

202
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,269
to His Majesty and you in that position?

203
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,064
Do you mean you are

204
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,233
the one who can be of help?

205
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,568
Yes.

206
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,989
In order to start soaring

207
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,907
with your great ambitions,

208
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,328
please use my family and me.

209
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,421
What is it, sir?

210
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,972
Why do you look at me that way?

211
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,849
You look like you are angry.

212
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,145
I really am angry

213
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,689
at myself who has always been

214
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,358
one step behind.

215
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,489
But this time,

216
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,409
I think I should not be one step behind.

217
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,328
Not because of myself,

218
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,413
but because of you.

219
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,293
I don't understand what you mean.

220
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,879
You need to get out of here.

221
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,299
You should leave

222
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,217
the Crown Prince too.

223
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,228
I can't

224
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,898
love you at all though.

225
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,865
I am not such a pathetic woman

226
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,909
who begs love

227
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,578
from a man who has someone else
in his heart.

228
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,957
Then,

229
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,960
why do you want to get married to me

230
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,422
despite this poor treatment?

231
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,429
For the future of my family.

232
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,641
Your family may prosper,

233
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,478
but you will become extremely lonely.

234
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,022
It doesn't matter.

235
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,775
It is just business

236
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,653
for the benefit of both parties.

237
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,209
I am not telling you to come to me.

238
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,336
I just want to help you

239
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,172
to be safe as soon as possible.

240
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,012
I will be leaving.

241
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,352
So please, pretend you don't know.

242
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,772
The more you know about me,

243
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,900
the more it is of danger to you.

244
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,988
Eunuch Hong.

245
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,409
What do you mean by that?

246
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,872
-Are you--
-I believe I just told you

247
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,541
to pretend you don't know.

248
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,588
It is easier said than done.

249
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,719
I must get going now, sir.

250
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,075
There is an emergency.

251
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,620
The one who escaped from the palace
has been arrested and

252
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,788
is being transported
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

253
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,711
If the truth is revealed
in the courtyard...

254
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,464
What are you talking about?

255
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,970
I asked what you were talking about.

256
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,310
Premier Kim, we sent ten assassins

257
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,729
to the Crown Prince's palace.

258
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,024
However, only nine bodies remained.

259
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,072
Are you telling me that the one
who escaped has been arrested

260
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,740
and is in transport?

261
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,410
Yes, Your Lordship.

262
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,461
So this is not the doing of
the Baekwoon Group?

263
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,463
No, Your Highness.

264
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,715
They are named after their white masks,

265
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,635
and known for writing the character Woon
in their messages.

266
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,721
Which is why they are named
the Baekwoon Group.

267
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,474
I am aware.

268
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,226
Of course.

269
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,355
However, the masks are not meant to cover.

270
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:09,401
But rather to raise awareness.

271
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,737
To raise awareness?

272
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,407
That is why with every case,

273
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,370
marks are left representing their purpose.

274
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,288
How?

275
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,747
Like this.

276
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,542
WOON

277
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,546
No marks were found at
the Crown Prince's palace?

278
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,466
No, marks were not found.

279
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,678
Only that they attempted in
your assassination.

280
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,225
Your Highness, this is Byeong-yeon.

281
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,740
You must come with me right away.

282
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,895
What is the reason

283
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,982
for your attempted murder
of the Crown Prince?

284
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,027
Please spare my life.

285
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,655
I was only doing what I was told.

286
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,159
Who ordered this act of treason?

287
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,178
Resume the torture.

288
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,014
Stop immediately.

289
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,742
The judge is to stop the torture

290
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,703
and inquire once again.

291
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,416
Stop.

292
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,090
I will ask again.

293
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,845
Who ordered this act of treason?

294
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,522
Will you able to repeat this
in front of the Crown Prince?

295
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,984
Can I trust you?

296
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,653
If I do as you ask...

297
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,700
Yes.

298
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,871
This is the only way for
you and your family

299
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,748
to survive.

300
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,722
The Baekwoon Group...

301
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,864
Is there an insider from that night

302
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,701
who opened the gates
and allowed your entry?

303
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,998
Yes, there is.

304
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,547
Tell me.

305
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,302
There is a Baekwoon Group spy

306
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,348
within the palace.

307
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,319
Hong Gyeong-rae may be dead.

308
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,657
But his daughter,
possessing the same thought and values,

309
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,035
is here in this palace.

310
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,207
I heard she's planning a rebellion again.

311
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,674
Who is that?

312
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,468
It is...

313
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,847
It is...

314
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,501
Premier Kim!

315
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,384
He has just confessed

316
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,304
as a traitor to this country.

317
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,224
He may be a criminal,

318
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,312
but you have no right to execute
without the King's orders.

319
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,606
I had to step in due to Your Majesty's

320
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,775
and Your Highness's hesitation.

321
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,168
Executing my subject in front
of me, the Crown Prince,

322
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,088
is also an act of treason.
Did you not know?

323
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,676
If my act threatens my position as
the Premier,

324
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,346
you can take my life with the sword.

325
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,773
Your Highness, please have mercy.

326
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,276
-Your Highness, please have mercy.
-Your Highness, please have mercy.

327
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,237
If any group threatens the subjects,

328
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,365
or puts this country at risk,

329
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,493
it must be dealt with immediately.

330
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,328
That is exactly why

331
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,082
I cannot sheath this sword.

332
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,422
-Your Highness, please have mercy.
-Your Highness, please have mercy.

333
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,684
Your Highness.

334
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,185
Let go.

335
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,738
EUNUCH TRAINING INSTITUTE

336
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,665
Have you heard?

337
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,375
What?

338
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,503
The invader of the palace confessed...

339
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,298
and is apparently an act of
Hong Gyeong-rae remnants.

340
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,386
Did something happen at the palace?

341
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,265
Keep quiet and finish your meal.

342
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,600
I'll beat you to a pulp.

343
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,984
That threat message was not
just a happening.

344
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,614
There is a rumor...

345
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,535
that the daughter of Hong Gyeong-rae
is in the palace as a spy

346
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,537
and opened the gates for the invasion.

347
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,624
How dare you!

348
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,834
That is nonsense.

349
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,336
We will finish our meals.

350
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,550
-Are you sure?
-Of course I am.

351
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,631
This is me.

352
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,636
"I could say

353
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,222
I have a lover or maybe not.

354
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,308
Jeong Deok-ho."

355
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,145
Jeong Deok-ho?

356
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,775
Master Jeong?

357
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,365
Yes, you are right.

358
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,041
You did it again?

359
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,294
Jeong Deok-ho is...

360
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,046
me.

361
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,468
Are you Master Jeong?

362
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,971
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,144
But the one you loved

364
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,146
is Wol-hui.

365
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,317
My goodness.

366
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,652
What do you mean?

367
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,030
This is ridiculous.

368
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,531
The one I...

369
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,908
The one I...

370
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,077
The one I love is--

371
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,038
How dare you touch me?

372
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,415
I mean the one I love

373
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,709
-is--
-Let go of me!

374
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,212
It is...

375
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,005
Hey!

376
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,846
It is you.

377
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,139
It is you

378
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,895
whom I am in love with.

379
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:40,549
We found the man Chil-seong
contacted right before he died.

380
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,885
If we meet him,

381
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,054
we'll be able to confirm what information

382
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,223
he found out that day.

383
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,104
About the girl named Hong Ra-on.

384
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,065
is said to be in the palace now.

385
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,747
Yun-seong.

386
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,040
Yes?

387
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,504
What did you say Grandfather?

388
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,842
I told you to pay a visit to the Queen
before she delivers a child.

389
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,261
Okay, I will.

390
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,067
How did it go?

391
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,738
She gave birth to a baby just now,

392
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,073
and it is a boy.

393
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,958
Gag him or something

394
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,170
so that his cry won't be heard.

395
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,798
Yes, Your Highness.

396
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,303
Okay.

397
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,515
Go ahead and kick me.

398
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,936
Resent me and hate me as much as you want.

399
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,733
My goodness.

400
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,947
Your...

401
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,785
Your Highness, Official of Ministry
of Rites is here to meet you.

402
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,342
Welcome.

403
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,887
Are you okay?

404
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,849
Yes, I am.

405
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,477
What brought you

406
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,480
all the way here?

407
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,443
My grandfather wanted me to

408
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,778
visit you before your delivery.

409
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,419
Premier Kim,

410
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,255
is it true that you killed the criminal

411
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,591
while the Crown Prince
was questioning him?

412
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,177
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,681
That kind of absurd behavior
is not like you.

414
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,225
My apologies, My Majesty.

415
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,935
However,

416
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,606
as I was busy finding out
if what the criminal said was true,

417
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,483
I couldn't tell you about it in advance.

418
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,363
You mean you found out if there was
a spy in the palace indeed?

419
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,115
Yes.

420
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,495
What the criminal said was true.

421
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,790
And we found out who it was.

422
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,386
HONG RA-ON

423
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,263
"Hong Ra-on?"

424
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,141
Is this

425
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,519
Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter then?

426
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,395
Yes.

427
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,565
All we have to do now is find her.

428
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,501
They are very well aware

429
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,087
of the power

430
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,714
that the name Hong Gyeong-rae itself has

431
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,426
although there is just the name.

432
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,428
Then,

433
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,557
what are you going to do with Hong Ra-on?

434
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,809
In the name of Baekwoon Group,

435
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,353
I will protect her.

436
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,524
It is too late to wait for her decision.

437
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,404
-Are you going to abduct her or something?
-We can't

438
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,032
leave her in danger like that anymore.

439
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,453
Tomorrow,

440
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,082
I will take her to the headquarters

441
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,835
in secret.

442
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,885
When the day breaks,

443
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,430
a massive search will begin.

444
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,182
If she really is the spy
Baekwoon Group planted,

445
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,101
she won't be the only one.

446
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,981
If we keep investigating all those
who are relevant,

447
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,943
the palace will become bloody
for quite a while.

448
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,281
We should find Hong Ra-on first
and seize her.

449
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,491
If we hold her,

450
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,328
she will be of use to us.

451
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,248
Of course she will.

452
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,584
There is no doubt about it.

453
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,244
Were you waiting for me?

454
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,830
I want to ask you for a favor.

455
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,166
You do?

456
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,919
-What kind of--
-It's about her.

457
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,591
About Eunuch Hong?

458
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,760
Last time,

459
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,471
you saved her

460
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,515
against Premier Kim's will.

461
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,399
Please take her out of the palace.

462
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,238
To a place no one knows

463
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,823
without anyone knowing.

464
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,784
Can you?

465
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,265
When you're sitting over there,

466
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,934
how can I fall asleep?

467
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,606
You already have such sleepy eyes.

468
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,863
I said you don't need to
stay up all night.

469
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,908
I just want to look at your face

470
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,702
all night.

471
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,542
You can look at me tomorrow
as much as you want.

472
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,720
What you always see

473
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,805
and always do

474
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,016
sometimes

475
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,603
seem very precious all of a sudden.

476
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,817
When you think it is the last time,

477
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,278
you get to feel that way.

478
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,239
Pardon?

479
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,747
Yes, that is right.

480
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,088
All the things you thought trivial

481
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,635
because it happened everyday

482
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,222
suddenly mean a lot

483
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,060
if you think it is the last time.

484
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,693
All right then.

485
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,987
Okay.

486
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,909
Come here

487
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,787
to see my face.

488
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,508
Your Highness.

489
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,306
If I was...

490
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,144
born into a noble family

491
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,521
then came to you,

492
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,236
would you have taken me in with love?

493
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,074
Of course I would have.

494
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:34,995
Then

495
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:36,705
Your Highness.

496
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,751
If I had not

497
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,253
dressed up as an aristocrat that day

498
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,214
and went to Mongmyeoksan,

499
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,303
would we have been

500
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,806
destined to meet at all?

501
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,437
That is obvious as well.

502
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,999
I told you.

503
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,252
We have been destined

504
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,129
go around in circles

505
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,800
and still meet each other in the end.

506
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,195
Then

507
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,947
your Highness.

508
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,200
If one day,

509
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,913
you found out I was
the daughter of a traitor,

510
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,042
would you not regret

511
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,421
meeting me?

512
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,300
Would you

513
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,511
ever think back

514
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,306
and reminisce about this moment

515
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,060
at least once?

516
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:02,804
Ra-on.

517
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,022
Ra-on.

518
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,654
Eunuch Hong.

519
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,327
Is anyone there?

520
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,412
Yes, Your Highness.

521
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,961
Have you awakened already?

522
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,255
Where has Eunuch Hong gone?

523
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,844
I have not seen him since early morning.

524
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,792
Your Highness. I'm glad you're here.

525
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,213
Why is the palace in such disorder?

526
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,591
Have you not heard
about the royal command?

527
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,343
What royal command?

528
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,137
Tell me the details.

529
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,391
There is a search for the traitors.

530
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,102
Have you not heard from before?

531
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,603
Daughter of Hong Gyeong-rae

532
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,481
is within the palace as a spy
from the Baekwoon Group.

533
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:41,528
They finally found
the detailed information.

534
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,113
What?

535
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,199
So they are searching among
the younger palace servants first?

536
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,660
Yes, Your Highness.

537
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,331
I understand.
You can continue with your business.

538
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,291
Of course.

539
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,380
One moment.

540
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,342
What is the given information?

541
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,930
Has the montage been released?

542
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,933
No montage has been revealed.

543
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,102
Only that she is around the age of 18,

544
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:17,772
and resided in Pyeongan-do
before the riot.

545
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:25,155
Her real name given by Hong Gyeong-rae
is Hong Ra-on.

546
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,828
We have called for all servants
around the age of 18...

547
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,714
Just now...

548
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,924
What did you say?

549
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,600
That we have called for

550
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,893
all servants who are 18.

551
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:55,935
No.

552
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,563
The name.

553
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,779
Do you mean Hong Ra-on?

554
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:15,121
Her name as a child was Hong Ra-on.

555
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,918
Of course, she would be using
a different name now.

556
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,592
If you will excuse me.

557
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,226
My Lady, what should I call you?
