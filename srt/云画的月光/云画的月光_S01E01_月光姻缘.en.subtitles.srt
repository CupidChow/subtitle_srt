00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:13,281
THE JOSEON LOVE STORY
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT, BY HONG SAM-NOM

2
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:21,039
The reason why I came here is...

3
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,835
Well, this is not about me.

4
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,172
My very close friend

5
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:33,092
is onto something very peculiar,
and I am seriously worried.

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,679
What is that peculiar thing he does?

7
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:41,476
While walking around absent-mindedly,
he runs into a wall.

8
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,938
He's never been a drinker,
but he would drink

9
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:49,109
and get into a fist fight
which he had never gotten into before.

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,155
And he gets upset

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,616
whenever someone mentions
a certain lady, doesn't he?

12
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,451
That's right.

13
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,789
"You don't stand a chance.

14
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,415
She's out of your league."

15
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,002
He must have been upset when his friends
discouraged him by saying such a thing.

16
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,213
How did you know?

17
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,676
I heard you are like a psychic
when it comes to love issues.

18
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,178
You do live up to your fame.

19
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,559
My life is so miserable these days

20
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,768
because of...

21
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,897
that lady.

22
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,192
It's all right. I understand.

23
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,614
No man has been strangled to death
because he confessed his love.

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,159
So why don't you...

25
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,079
muster up your courage?

26
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,172
Are you going for a walk, My Lady?

27
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,513
Are you all right?

28
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,229
Take care, My Lady.

29
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,568
She doesn't even look at you.
She's Ms. Impregnable, indeed.

30
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,529
Ms. Impregnable?

31
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,409
That means it's very hard
to make her open her heart.

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,537
What should I do then?

33
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,750
Just for ten days, don't do anything.

34
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,169
What if she forgets me for good?

35
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,381
There is no woman who wouldn't
become curious

36
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,800
when the man who has always been around
suddenly disappears.

37
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,428
On the tenth day...

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,830
My Lady, are you hurt?

39
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,457
What do you think you are doing?

40
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,255
Are you all right?

41
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,966
Yes, I am fine, My Lady.

42
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,468
Don't let it happen again.

43
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,442
No, I will continue
to save you every time.

44
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,236
Even if a big tree falls on me,

45
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,904
even if people throw stones

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,531
or point fingers at you,

47
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,658
I will protect you every time.

48
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,082
Where on earth

49
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,544
have you been

50
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,879
for the last ten days?

51
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,085
MAN FROM HWASEONG AND WOMAN FROM GUNSAN

52
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,004
THE JOSEON LOVE STORY WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

53
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,274
Are you awake, Your Highness?

54
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,154
Your Highness, my sincere apologies,

55
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,698
but the matter is too urgent
that I cannot delay.

56
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,617
Go in.

57
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,202
Go inside. Come on.

58
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,718
-His Majesty is...
-No need.

59
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,054
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,644
Your Majesty.

61
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,438
Premier Kim.

62
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,900
Last time, we had a lecture
on Jin Nam-dang's

63
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,777
Disciplines for Virtuous Scholars.

64
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,070
Do you remember it?

65
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,655
When morning comes

66
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,366
and you wake up to a cock's crow,

67
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,328
wash yourself, brush your hair,
and dress for the day.

68
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,206
Open your book

69
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,458
and learn from the sages

70
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,877
as if Confucius is with you,

71
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,881
and Yan Ying and Zengzi
are there in the front and back.

72
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,301
And what does that mean?

73
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,054
A true scholar should wake up
in the early morning,

74
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,224
dress properly,
and meet the sages in the book

75
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,435
with a pious attitude.

76
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,312
That's right, Your Highness.

77
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,566
You should always keep
Jin's teachings in mind

78
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,152
and try to live by them.

79
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,486
I will,

80
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,113
Master.

81
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,202
Watching the Crown Prince
devoting himself to studies

82
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,288
makes me feel happy.

83
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,226
I can't believe this.

84
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,821
"In the book you just quoted,

85
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,491
-what does it say about an attire?"
-"What does it say about an attire?"

86
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,119
"Perhaps..."

87
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,288
"Perhaps,

88
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,416
you will laugh at me
for asking such a question."

89
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,756
Why?

90
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,973
Even that laughter is scripted.

91
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,058
LAUGH THREE TIMES

92
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:41,354
Is this some kind of joke?
I can't believe this.

93
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,359
Bring it to me.

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,444
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:23,437
Your Majesty, please kill me.

96
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,524
Your Majesty, please kill me.

97
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,652
That idiot.

98
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,542
KIM HEON, CHIEF STATE COUNCILOR,
THE QUEEN CONSORT'S FATHER

99
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,718
I just followed my master as I was taught.

100
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,513
But it seems like things
have gotten worse than before.

101
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,056
I was just trying to...

102
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,391
You see.

103
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,604
You should be teaching your student.

104
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,398
You shouldn't be pretending to teach.

105
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,567
And yet you just pretend to teach.

106
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,613
My apologies, Your Highness.

107
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,072
My goodness.

108
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,285
I'm only joking around, Master.

109
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,579
You have done nothing wrong.

110
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,791
It's the wind that unexpectedly blew
that is to blame.

111
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,631
Your Highness, what is that?

112
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,300
It's a paper that flies.

113
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,843
A flying paper!

114
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,486
Sam-nom!

115
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,862
Hey!

116
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,530
Good luck.

117
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,535
What's all the fuss about that little man?

118
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,914
He's a popular figure in Unjongga.
Don't you know him?

119
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,084
He's so talented. He's bound to succeed.

120
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169
He'd do anything for money.

121
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,838
That is Sam-nom!

122
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,827
RECRUITING EUNUCHS
TEN SILVER COINS WILL BE REWARDED

123
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,328
With ten silver coins,

124
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,664
I'd still have a plenty of money
even after paying off the debts.

125
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,418
Eunuch?

126
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,684
You know it’s time for your medicine.
Get up.

127
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,310
Why did you just turn over?

128
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,854
I don't want it.

129
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,856
What medicine?

130
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,276
I’m so deep in debt.
I can’t even buy food.

131
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:21,407
-Don't be like that, Father. Get up.
-I said I don't want it!

132
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,909
Why can't you stop bothering me?

133
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,955
I’m not even your real father.
It's not like we are related in some way.

134
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,083
What holds you back from leaving me?

135
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
For goodness sake!

136
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,296
You know I’ve got nowhere else to go!

137
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,882
If you’ve decided to raise me,
you should take responsibility!

138
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,593
Well, I’m doing a terrible job!
I’m just a burden to you.

139
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,431
You said you were going to save up
and go find your birth mother.

140
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,226
How long are you going to live like this,
pretending to be a man?

141
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,480
-This again...
-Sam-nom, are you in there?

142
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,315
Coming!

143
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,569
Stop saying stuff like that.
Just take your medicine and get better.

144
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,615
Ra-on...

145
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,331
I told you not to call me by that name.

146
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,875
My name is Sam-nom. Hong Sam-nom.

147
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,838
I'll be glad if you decide
not to come back one day.

148
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,758
You know what I mean, right?

149
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,428
Well, I wouldn't be.

150
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,722
I should go.

151
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,607
Young Master, Sam-nom is here.

152
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,615
Welcome!

153
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,784
-Hey!
-Oh, gosh.

154
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,664
What's that you're wearing?

155
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,000
I made it myself. What do you think?

156
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,920
It's great for camouflage
when you're on a battlefield.

157
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,547
If I hide in the bush like this,

158
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,007
you won't be able to tell if I'm there.

159
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,801
You'll never know!

160
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,138
I see. Anyway, what did the letter say?

161
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
Let's see.

162
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,231
She’s worried
if I’ve been developing a cough

163
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,234
because of all the flower pollen.

164
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,655
So, what's your reply?

165
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,031
What do you think I should say?

166
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,450
Well, you have to speak your mind first.

167
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,078
I only write down what you’re thinking.

168
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,455
I can’t come up with ideas myself.

169
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,082
You’re right, I suppose.

170
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,961
I’m going to leave this place
with the wandering performers soon.

171
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,380
Are you just going to keep
exchanging letters with her like this?

172
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,966
What else can I do?

173
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,845
Don't you want to meet her?

174
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,642
Do you not want to see her in person?

175
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,186
Of course I do...

176
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,109
"Eyes as bright as black pearls.

177
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,529
Nose as sharp as a crescent moon.

178
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,532
And the lips as red as a pomegranate"?

179
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,748
Who sent this?

180
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,836
Who is trying to deceive my little sister
with these absurd lies?

181
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,339
I don’t know who it is!

182
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:28,177
I only pick up and bring the letter
from the arranged place.

183
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,596
That’s all I know, Your Highness!

184
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,312
“I wish to see you before the spring ends.

185
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,314
I’ll be waiting under the same tree we met

186
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,692
at the foot of Mongmyeoksan..."

187
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,740
-Do you approve of this?
-Certainly not!

188
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,287
So, what should you tell
Princess Myeongeun?

189
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,455
Pardon, Your Highness?

190
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,293
I have to tell Her Highness
that she can't go there.

191
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,836
That would make her want to go there.

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,005
I'll tell Her Highness
that Your Highness is worried sick...

193
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,715
That would make her resent me.

194
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,552
Should I just tell Her Highness
that he didn't reply?

195
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,888
I like that option. You may go now.

196
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,473
Thank you, Your Highness!

197
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,489
I finally figured out why everyone hates
working at the Crown Prince's palace.

198
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,368
How can they take away
three days' worth of payment?

199
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,413
It feels like shit as if they are pulling
bean sprouts out of my asshole.

200
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,499
Stop saying "asshole"!

201
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,085
People are eating here.

202
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,754
And I'm having bean sprouts!

203
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,637
They did go a bit too far.

204
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,433
I don’t even eat smelly stuff like garlic

205
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,060
and chew on bitter cloves all the time,

206
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,479
so I won't have smelly breath.

207
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,398
I feel so bummed.

208
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,527
I should ask for someone
determined and smart

209
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,154
among the new recruits.

210
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,197
We are so understaffed here.

211
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,450
There are too many things
to be taken care of here.

212
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,618
-Eunuch Jang!
-What?

213
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,997
-We're in trouble. Crown Prince is...
-What now?

214
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,375
He changed out of his dragon robe
and disappeared again!

215
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,003
Oh, Your Highness, please!

216
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,645
All right!

217
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,192
Your Majesty!

218
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,152
Go ask the Queen consort's father!

219
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
Your Majesty!

220
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,532
I said, go ask the Queen consort's father!

221
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,619
-Ouch!
-Hey!

222
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,792
Oh, no. I came to look
for some pretty ladies,

223
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,003
but instead, I groped a man's
squishy part with my hands!

224
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,130
Gosh, yuck!

225
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,509
How dare you speak to me in that manner?

226
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,345
Who the hell are you?

227
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,513
Why you...

228
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,516
How dare you talk to me like that?
Who the hell are you?

229
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,477
You little... I am...

230
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,064
You go first!

231
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,903
Oh, me? I came from the palace
far, far away.

232
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,405
I took hundreds of steps to the left,
and to the right,

233
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,157
and then to the left and right.

234
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,035
-From the huge Crap Prince's Palace...
-Wait!

235
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,040
I think I know where that is.

236
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,668
I live there, too!

237
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,633
Father?

238
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,886
Crown Prince?

239
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,597
What the...

240
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,976
Shouldn't you be studying right now?

241
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,812
Why are you out here,
chasing after some ladies?

242
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,818
Let me join you.

243
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,281
You rascals!

244
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,994
How dare you mock the Great King and...

245
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,291
the Crown Prince?

246
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,421
You should practice more
on playing your instruments

247
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,965
instead of coming up with dumb jokes.

248
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,636
-Tie that loose rope, you idiot.
-What was that all about?

249
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,727
What is he talking about? It's not loose.

250
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,395
Gosh.

251
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,483
Now you’re in trouble.

252
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,155
Hey, stop!

253
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,533
What are you doing?

254
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,870
Take off! Put this on!

255
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,456
"Take off your clothes, and put on mine."

256
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,417
That's what Young Master is trying to say.

257
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,712
-He tends to stutter when he’s nervous.
-Right.

258
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,422
Oh, I see.

259
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,591
But why do you need my clothes?

260
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,429
You should... go...

261
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,933
"You should go to Mongmyeoksan Mountain
today on behalf of me."

262
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,267
That's it!

263
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,854
Oh, has she agreed to meet you there?

264
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:36,568
She is... so high...

265
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,196
"Since she is so high above my reach,
we can never be together.

266
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,241
-So you should end it on behalf of me."
-Yes.

267
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,328
What? End it?

268
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,164
Well, I did write the letters for you,

269
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,501
but I thought you meant every word!

270
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,169
Am I wrong?

271
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,297
Let's say I do go out there as you.

272
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,466
That means that I have to pretend
to be a nobleman.

273
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,760
If I get exposed,

274
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,304
I'll be dead!

275
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:08,976
Sam-nom! Here... Money...

276
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,603
-"I'll pay you well!"
-That's right.

277
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,110
Is that how you think of me?

278
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,820
I'll give you more!

279
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,996
-You can’t win people over with money!
-Oh, okay.

280
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,081
-Should I put this on?
-Yes, hurry.

281
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,188
I've been watching you from afar
for a long time,

282
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,274
but this is my first time
being so close to you.

283
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,653
I don't know what to do
with my racing heart.

284
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,833
Even if I write you a hundred letters,

285
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,212
mere word won't be able to express
how much I long for you.

286
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,924
"My eyes are fixated on you."

287
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,053
Wonderful voice.

288
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,737
Was it not supposed to be a petite girl?

289
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,031
Why does this man have the love letter?

290
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,577
We can never be together.

291
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,413
Please tell her to forgive me
for falling in love with her

292
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,540
when I should not have.

293
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,716
I just thought it was a lady
from a noble family,

294
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,551
but it was a man!

295
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,804
My gosh.

296
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,640
I'll give you more!

297
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,536
That was quite a letter.

298
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,167
Especially this part.
Even I couldn't help...

299
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,090
but tear up a bit.

300
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,851
When you feel that way,
just cry your eyes out.

301
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,188
-What?
-It must have been very tough

302
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,441
for you to be in love with someone
you can never be with.

303
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,986
It's okay.

304
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,654
I understand you.

305
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,659
Why did you ask to meet me?

306
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,786
You must have known
that this is meaningless.

307
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,916
I know we cannot be together.

308
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,918
Even if I know that,

309
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,130
I cannot stop my heart from loving you.

310
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,217
I'm here for only one purpose.

311
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,846
I'm here to tell you

312
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,098
how deep...

313
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,309
my feelings for you are.

314
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,565
I get you. You must've missed me a lot.

315
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,443
Let's not waste time here.

316
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,738
Let's forget the world

317
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,115
and make a memory

318
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,992
we can keep forever.

319
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,662
Just the two of us.

320
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,289
Let's go.

321
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,379
Welcome.

322
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,132
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

323
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,344
You idiot! Look what kind of mess
you've made here!

324
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,179
Clean that up, you idiot.

325
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,433
This place serves the best gukbap.

326
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:24,564
The owner used to be a court lady
at the royal kitchen.

327
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,860
You poor sons of bitches.

328
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,072
How much more kimchi
are you going to eat, you fucking idiots?

329
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,201
Why are you laughing, you shitheads?

330
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,205
Don't you think you're being too rude
to your customers?

331
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,706
Cut the crap, you idiot.

332
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,168
I need to earn money, too, you bastards.

333
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,587
Eat this, you idiots.

334
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,303
Why are you laughing at curse words?

335
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,223
-Is that a joke?
-It's a question.

336
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,518
Gosh, you're boring.

337
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,436
How is that a curse?

338
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,272
She reminds us of our grandmothers,

339
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,607
and it's just her friendly gesture.

340
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,818
My grandmother never cursed like her.

341
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,529
-Is that right?
-Yes.

342
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,365
Have you ever been hit by your grandpa
for doing a poor job

343
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,909
-reading the Thousand-Character Classic?
-Never.

344
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,495
I mastered that book at three.
Why would I get it wrong?

345
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,375
Then have you ever been slapped
for peeing while sleeping?

346
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,043
I have never done that.

347
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,878
Even if I have done that,

348
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,756
nobody would dare to touch me.

349
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,018
I guess I should start
calling you "Silver Spoon."

350
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,353
What do you mean?

351
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,354
Well,

352
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,441
you were born with a silver spoon
in your mouth, wrapped in silk.

353
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,109
And then you were raised delicately

354
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,361
like a flower.

355
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,988
A flower?

356
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,906
I'm not like that.

357
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,950
It's all right.

358
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,579
Not every man is supposed to be
reassuring like an old tree.

359
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,164
Some men are delicate

360
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,790
like flowers.

361
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,791
I said you're wrong.

362
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,128
All right. Let's just say put it that way.

363
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,839
You...

364
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,591
You brats.

365
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,887
Stop chatting and get the hell out
if you're done.

366
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,807
How dare you look straight into my eyes?

367
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,310
You look familiar.

368
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,569
Your...

369
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,203
Try this.

370
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,454
What are you doing?

371
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,831
Kimchi goes the best with gukbap.

372
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,504
It's so good.

373
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,424
Follow me.

374
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,012
Where are you going?

375
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,806
I haven't finished this.

376
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:04,974
Wait.

377
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,440
You should've told me
if you were not hungry.

378
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,777
You didn't even touch it. What a waste!

379
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,820
My gosh.

380
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,614
Come on.

381
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,575
You can't do this here.

382
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,578
Instead of ordering people to get you,

383
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,705
I came to catch you myself.

384
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,458
It was because I was hoping

385
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,586
that you would turn out
to be a nice person.

386
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,508
But you don't even know
who you wrote a love letter to.

387
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,635
And you are terrible at pretending
to be a nobleman.

388
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,556
How should I kill you?

389
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,892
What?

390
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,353
What do you mean I am pretending?

391
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,023
I am a nobleman.

392
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,610
I meant what I said in the letters.

393
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,615
You did?

394
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,621
Lead the way.

395
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,583
I need to see which family you are from.

396
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,629
Go.

397
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,549
Go where?

398
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,509
Go.

399
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,190
She was so close to being respected
as a virtuous woman.

400
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,402
Damn it. How dare he run away
with someone else's wife?

401
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,363
What are you doing?

402
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,865
Go get them.

403
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,284
Go get them right now!

404
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,966
Be careful.

405
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,848
Why did they come all the way here?

406
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,498
How dare you behave in this rude manner?

407
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,210
It's the sun that is rude.

408
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,337
It's so strong and hot

409
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,465
that it might damage the beautiful face.

410
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,883
It deeply worries me.

411
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,441
But who are you to worry about me?

412
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,821
"Worry about me"?

413
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,576
I see. The beautiful face...

414
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,829
I was talking about mine.

415
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,008
-You have a trust issue.
-Hurry.

416
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,435
Here comes the poop water!

417
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,147
It stinks!

418
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,648
Take it easy.

419
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,318
If you don't bring me the interest
within three days,

420
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,779
I won't be pouring poop water over you.

421
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,744
I'll burn you in a fire.
Do you understand?

422
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,710
Hey, I need to take a piss.

423
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,384
Are you going to watch?

424
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,429
You can join me.

425
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,002
My back hurts.

426
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,008
What was that?

427
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,011
Are you hurt?

428
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,471
Why did you push me?

429
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,265
That's...

430
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,643
Snake!

431
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,104
Do you have to lose your head...

432
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,106
Snake.

433
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,543
Bend down.

434
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,630
Bend down. I will go up and help you out.

435
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,008
You have to help me out first.

436
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,592
-Then I will...
-I said, bend down.

437
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,678
-I will go...
-Bend down!

438
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,109
Let's just stay here together.

439
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,111
I'm sure someone will pass by.

440
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,904
Someone will.

441
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,907
I can't believe this!

442
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,451
Bend down. Right now.

443
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,536
Bend down!

444
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,461
Gosh, I told you that we should wait.

445
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,943
You have to stand like this
for me to hold you up.

446
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,453
Can you reach it?

447
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,121
What?

448
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,086
No.

449
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,173
How about now?

450
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,426
Just a little more.

451
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,346
When I get out,

452
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,057
I will make you wish
that you had stayed behind

453
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,475
in this pit.

454
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,853
What? What did you say?

455
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,772
Nothing.

456
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,607
Can you reach it?

457
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,111
I can't reach it.

458
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,612
Push me up a little more.

459
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,031
Come on.

460
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,742
Stretch your arm a little more.

461
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,662
Come on and use more strength.

462
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,333
How about now?

463
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,796
I'm...

464
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,798
I'm out.

465
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,850
Hey.

466
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,443
Go find something you can use
to pull me up.

467
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,283
What are you thinking?

468
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,620
Silver Spoon,
I’ll send help your way soon.

469
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,498
-I'm truly sorry!
-No.

470
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,209
I'll send someone to help you
within an hour.

471
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,420
Wait, if you get me out...

472
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,675
I’ll let you leave, no strings attached.

473
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,802
Get me out of here.

474
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,305
I heard everything, you know.

475
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,390
You said you are going to make me suffer.

476
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,560
That was just a joke. Hey!

477
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,272
You! Do you even know who...

478
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,317
You think you can get away with this?

479
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,029
If I ever see you again,
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

480
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,948
Should you want me to be your dog,
I shall!

481
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,618
I am really, truly sorry!

482
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,496
-Sorry!
-Hey!

483
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,125
No, wait. Hey!

484
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:56,047
-Hey! Come back!
-See you never!

485
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,966
You little...

486
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,636
You little bastard!

487
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,930
Come back!

488
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,163
What did these people do?

489
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,960
That servant ran off
with his master’s daughter-in-law.

490
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,797
What? Was she not his master's daughter?

491
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,508
Was she the daughter-in-law?

492
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,076
Then,

493
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,871
what did this guy do?

494
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,083
The servant paid this guy money

495
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,544
so that he can win over
the daughter-in-law's heart.

496
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,254
He's so terrible.

497
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,965
Hey, it's not like...

498
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,217
Well...

499
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,554
He probably just helped them realize
their feelings for each other.

500
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,850
Excuse me.

501
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,061
What are you doing?

502
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,527
These two already ran off.

503
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,779
But this guy...

504
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,074
What will happen to him if he gets caught?

505
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,828
The master is probably going to kill him
before he even gets arrested.

506
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,416
This is just something I've heard, but...

507
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,669
I heard that this lady...
I mean, this madam

508
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,173
was treated really badly.

509
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,717
When she thought she was all alone,
suffering from pain,

510
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,179
this man was the only one
who looked after her.

511
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,433
Well, that’s what I’ve heard.

512
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,478
How do you know so well?

513
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,613
Hey, wait.

514
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,573
Let me see your face.

515
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,576
This is ridiculous.

516
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,995
Come on. Show your face!

517
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,553
You're not coming?

518
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,810
Aren't you old enough
to take care of yourself?

519
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,729
You look like a mess, covered in dust.

520
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,697
The ones responsible for the riot
regarding rice problems

521
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,908
have all been beheaded.

522
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,036
But we also cannot just ignore

523
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,831
the price fixing problem in the market.

524
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:22,711
So I think it would be best to execute
the merchant, Kim Jae-seok

525
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,548
and the store owner, Ha Yeon-su.

526
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,259
Do what you think is right.

527
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,554
Yes, Your Majesty.

528
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,601
Wait.

529
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,646
Didn't you say some people
were already beheaded?

530
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,232
I was never informed.

531
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,152
I gave the orders.

532
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,615
I believe we share the same thoughts,
Your Majesty.

533
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,785
Premier Kim,

534
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,871
before thinking about

535
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,540
a better solution for the people

536
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,500
so that they would never have to steal

537
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,378
because of hunger,

538
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,965
do you really believe
that I'd want to kill them off?

539
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,137
You are so weak-minded.

540
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,975
If you give the starved riot something,

541
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,853
they’re going to demand more and more.

542
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,354
And before you know it,

543
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,983
they are going come for you
to get more out of you.

544
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,738
There is no guarantee of your safety.

545
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,491
Remember what happened ten years ago?

546
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:54,011
You still have trouble falling asleep,
don’t you?

547
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,558
I only want the best for you.
Your Majesty.

548
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,229
Leave everything to me

549
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,107
and focus on your health.

550
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,780
Any more questions?

551
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,115
No.

552
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:33,342
Did you really think you could fake it?

553
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,930
Are you talking about the mole?

554
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,607
Well, since you figured everything out,
I’m not going to lie to you anymore.

555
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,694
Thanks for helping me earlier.

556
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,447
I helped you because I didn't think
you did something evil.

557
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,783
But...

558
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,495
You just got away with it one time.

559
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,957
People are going to recognize you.
It'll be tough for you.

560
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,462
Take care.

561
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,933
Right. Hey!

562
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:32,568
I forgot to mention that the couple
looked very happy together.

563
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,279
You're quite fast.

564
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,282
My gosh.

565
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,993
Let go of me!

566
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,039
Hold him still!

567
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,504
Yes, it's done!

568
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,425
What the hell are you doing?

569
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:01,263
Sam-nom, even if I’m selling you off,

570
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,600
never ever forget this.

571
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:09,396
This place is much better
than the other one. I guarantee you that.

572
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:13,525
What do you mean by that? Where?

573
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,820
EUNUCH TRAINING INSTITUTE
CASTRATION FACILITY

574
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,740
Let go of me!

575
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,038
Open up! Please!

576
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,438
Excuse me.

577
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:56,151
-Where am I?
-You're in Eunuch Training Institute!

578
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,238
What is this place for?

579
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,116
Others call it, the eunuch making factory.

580
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,662
You make what?

581
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,414
Eunuch.

582
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,707
What?

583
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,043
Eunuch.

584
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,846
No. I'll never become one!

585
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,975
Open up!

586
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,853
Please, open this door.

587
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,688
Eom-gong.

588
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,149
What? Eom-gong?

589
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,485
Hi, Eom-gong.

590
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,195
No, Lord Eom-gong?

591
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,531
Right! Master Eom-gong!

592
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,325
Please spare me!

593
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,917
Go away! Don't come any closer!

594
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,299
I'm not going to do anything to you now.

595
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,977
Don’t waste your energy now.

596
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,898
You need preparation. You can't eat
or drink water for three days.

597
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,400
You're a pretty boy.

598
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,909
Food, water... None of those matters.

599
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,747
I just... I don't have those!

600
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,375
You don't have what?

601
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,759
Has the letter arrived today?

602
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,303
No, Your Highness.

603
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,307
There was nothing under the tile.

604
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,229
It’s far past the date we promised.

605
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,648
Why is he not writing me back?

606
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,861
Your Highness...

607
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,697
How can he be so cruel?

608
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,450
Young Master...

609
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,204
Damn it.

610
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,541
Stop crying. There’s no turning back.

611
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,085
The contract has already been signed.
It’s a done deal.

612
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,089
You either have to live as a eunuch,
or die.

613
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,300
Still...

614
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,762
I am very fortunate.

615
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,139
What?

616
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:37,271
I hear that you are very skilled

617
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,523
and no one can beat you in this.

618
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,233
Me?

619
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,946
I sure am skilled.

620
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:54,246
Others can barely save
about three to four guys out of ten,

621
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,039
but as for me,

622
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,126
I can guarantee
that I can save five out of ten.

623
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,590
That is amazing.

624
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,843
That's not all.

625
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,305
-Ten years ago...
-Ten years ago?

626
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,141
But this is a secret.

627
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,399
I was able to make a clean cut
like a sword master

628
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,318
even when I was wasted.

629
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,737
Like a sword master?

630
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,449
Is that true?

631
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:34,286
How could you do that
with alcohol in your system?

632
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,498
Because this hand here remembers it all.

633
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,083
Oh, this hand here.

634
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,879
However,

635
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,841
I haven't met a single man
who hasn't bragging about his glory days.

636
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,885
Hey!

637
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,348
That's how it goes.
When people grow old like you,

638
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,891
they make mistakes...

639
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,894
Don't you dare underestimate me,
Eom-gong, who has the hand of God.

640
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,024
Oh, you're a real man.

641
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,985
Of course, I'm a real man.
What do you think I am, a girl?

642
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,989
-Drink one more glass like a real man.
-Bring it. You think I can't handle that?

643
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,165
Now that I'm done with the drinks,

644
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,543
time for work.

645
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,255
Actually...

646
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,158
These goddamn drinking habits.

647
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,245
I tampered with the blade
drunk again. Damn it!

648
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,163
Sam-nom!

649
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,174
You're alive. You are!

650
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,220
Sir.

651
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,315
What in the world...

652
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,989
You remember
what happened last night, right?

653
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,242
You were so sure of yourself.

654
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,997
Don't you remember?

655
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,083
What are you talking about?
Of course I do.

656
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,170
I remember. I did, you know...

657
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,756
Anyway,

658
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,591
how are you feeling?

659
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,846
You had skills like those
of a sword master.

660
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,640
I did, didn't I?

661
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,562
I want to sleep.

662
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,691
Sure, take a rest. Go ahead.

663
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,943
Yes, go on.

664
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,738
Rest.

665
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,437
Come on.

666
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,149
Even if you wait any longer,
Sam-nom will not come.

667
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:56,571
-Let's go.
-Sure. I'm not waiting for anybody.

668
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,449
Let's go.

669
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,334
Hong Ra-on.

670
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,549
-Take that off right now.
-No.

671
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,384
Can I wear this just for today?

672
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:03,513
No, just until sunset. Please?

673
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,723
Mom.

674
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,812
You are not a girl.

675
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,397
You're a boy.

676
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,691
Don't you get it?

677
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:18,695
Do I have to say that again?
Or do I have to slap you again?

678
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,325
Take that off right now.

679
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,808
Ra-on.

680
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,980
I'll be glad if you decide
not to come back one day.

681
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,816
You know what I mean, right?

682
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:05,742
He must have been so happy
thinking that I ran away.

683
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,537
Are you happy now?

684
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,391
Take it away!

685
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,184
Come on, Your Highness.

686
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,312
I'm dying here, worried about you.

687
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,315
I'll take my revenge.

688
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,526
I'll take hold of him

689
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,194
and shred him.

690
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,701
Could it be possible that he's ill?

691
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,953
Your Highness.

692
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,292
What are you doing here, Yeong?

693
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,254
Am I not allowed to come here?

694
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,716
Look at you. You look so terrible.

695
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,559
What is this?

696
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,021
I'll tell you once you eat this.

697
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,113
It's a book containing personal details

698
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,323
and descriptions
of the finest men in this country.

699
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,577
Why are you giving me this?

700
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,206
Take your pick.

701
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,084
I'll bring him for you no matter what.

702
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,545
What?

703
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,880
It's a big world out there

704
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,214
and there are plenty of men.

705
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,388
You call that skinny thing a man.

706
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,558
His Highness is entering the palace!

707
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,116
You'll need to brace yourself.

708
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,827
After a simple test in the morning,

709
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,578
they'll train you hard right away.

710
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,914
What test?

711
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,833
The penile test, of course.

712
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,293
It's only to check if it's cut off clean.

713
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,419
But don't you worry.

714
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,671
You know how good I am.

715
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,590
Who are you?

716
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,538
Silver Spoon?

717
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,166
Jeong Deok-ho?

718
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,338
You think you can get away with this?

719
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,507
If I ever see you again,

720
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,300
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

721
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,928
Should you want me to be your dog,
I shall!

722
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,358
Good to see you again.

723
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,110
Puppy.

724
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,019
-The physical exam shall begin.
-I can't live like this.

725
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,896
I can still recognize a woman's figure.

726
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,524
Puppy?

727
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,276
What on earth is your identity?

728
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,653
Look at what he goes around doing.

729
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,072
Dethroning him will be easy.

730
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,117
After him!

731
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,535
Isn't it a brilliant coincidence?

732
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,746
The Crown Prince made an appearance
soon after an assassin shot an arrow.
