1
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,977
A man shouldn't have done this.

2
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,271
I'm mortified.

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,442
I just heard that

4
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,570
the prince needed
the banquet to be a success.

5
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,242
My Lord, could you look
the other way just this once?

6
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,413
Are you saying you took such a risk

7
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,667
just to help the crown prince?

8
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,212
What other reason could there be?

9
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,215
I am a man of the Crown Prince's palace.

10
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,758
Then

11
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,470
what is the reason for becoming a eunuch

12
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,056
when you're a lady?

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,644
Your Highness.

14
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,230
-Your Highness.
-Did you ask around?

15
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,608
I met every dancer at the Office of Music,

16
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,402
but I couldn't find her.

17
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,071
No one knew who that lady was either.

18
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,241
She knew the order of the banquet

19
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,077
right down to the part only Ae-sim knows.

20
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,329
-Sorry?
-The solo dance

21
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,748
wasn't like one from any other banquet...

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,544
Record everything
regarding the preparation.

23
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,421
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,799
You’re saying you memorized everything?

25
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,510
Yes. When it comes to dancing,

26
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,262
I’m a genius.

27
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,183
Where's Eunuch Hong?

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,772
I left my post vacant for too long.

29
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,533
You can't go anywhere like that.

30
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,385
Please wait here for a while.

31
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,196
I can't find Eunuch Hong.

32
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,031
-You can't?
-No, sir.

33
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,115
Your Highness.

34
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,581
Are you looking for Eunuch Hong Sam-nom?

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,333
Have you seen him?

36
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,460
Yes.

37
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,714
He thought you'd return to your quarters,
so he hurried back.

38
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,871
You're back.

39
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,791
Since when were you here?

40
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,338
I couldn't find you after the banquet,

41
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,340
so I hurried back here.

42
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,636
What have you been doing?

43
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,642
You ordered me to organize the sheet music

44
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,352
for the new musical scores.

45
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,845
What you're thinking is preposterous.

46
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,519
Is there something else you need me to do?

47
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,981
No.

48
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,900
Carry on.

49
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,277
Yes, Your Highness.

50
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,214
-You must hurry.
-What?

51
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,926
The prince was looking for you,
so I told him you went to his palace.

52
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,595
Please hurry.

53
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,961
Do that again.

54
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,295
Sorry?

55
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,554
No, not that. Sneeze again.

56
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,394
Like this?

57
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,520
That isn't it!

58
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,414
I don't want to be startled,
so hold your sneezes.

59
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,834
My apologies, Your Highness.

60
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,252
I'll try not to...

61
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,796
Again?

62
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,966
What can I do?

63
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,343
I can't stop myself from sneezing.

64
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,558
Anyway, Your Highness,

65
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,687
Thanksgiving is
right around the corner, right?

66
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,064
Why do you ask?

67
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,026
I was wondering if

68
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,987
I could step outside the palace.

69
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,533
You want to be go to the Lantern Festival.

70
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,077
How did you know that?

71
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,040
Come closer.

72
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,108
Your Highness!

73
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,986
You're too sick to be at a festival.

74
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,114
This common cold will never wear me down,

75
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,033
so don't you worry.

76
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,078
Worry? As if!

77
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,581
You will not leave Jahyeondang today.

78
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,876
If I catch your cold,
you'll be severely punished!

79
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,130
Understood?

80
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,940
Did my proposal alarm you?

81
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,901
I meant nothing else.

82
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,780
I just heard you brew the most

83
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,490
delicious tea.

84
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,328
Who told you that?

85
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,498
I don't know.

86
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,094
It's heavy in scent and flavor. Very nice.

87
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,306
I'm glad you like it, Your Highness.

88
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,560
You told me before that

89
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,687
even though you wrote the letter,

90
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,898
his feelings for me were genuine.

91
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,026
Yes.

92
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,987
I may have rephrased it a bit,

93
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,699
but I swear I never wrote anything false.

94
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,369
I only conveyed Master Jeong's feelings

95
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,455
for you.

96
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,834
What does he look like?

97
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,046
He has manly features.

98
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,049
-What about his voice?
-Your Highness.

99
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,969
Didn't you order Eunuch Hong

100
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,597
to stay in Jahyeondang all day?

101
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,266
-I did.
-But...

102
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,060
Over there, sir.

103
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,988
Unbelievable.

104
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,620
Eunuch Hong, you don't look so good.

105
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,580
We should head back.

106
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,167
My apologies, Your Highness.

107
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,964
That reminds me.

108
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,009
I heard you also had a cold that day.

109
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,637
That day? When?

110
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,474
The day Master Jeong wrote
his first love letter to you.

111
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,603
He loved how you played on the swings

112
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,522
even while coughing.

113
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,111
The swings? A cold?

114
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,076
Is that

115
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,579
what Master Jeong said?

116
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,665
Your Highness...

117
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,751
Are you all right?

118
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,296
I asked you a question!

119
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,011
Your Highness. It's dangerous!
Please sit down, Your Highness!

120
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,139
-Oh my!
-Oh no!

121
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,474
Your Highness!

122
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,362
Eunuch Hong!
Eunuch Hong, are you all right?

123
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,489
Eunuch Hong!

124
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,492
Eunuch Hong! Eunuch...

125
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,460
Eunuch Hong!

126
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,795
Your... Your Highness!

127
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,632
Your Highness!

128
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,235
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

129
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,570
Your Highness!

130
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,984
-Help His Highness!
-Yes, Master.

131
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,237
Oh no...

132
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,030
-Your Highness...
-Your Highness.

133
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,415
You! Get up right now!

134
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,918
You should be assisting His Highness.
What do you think you're doing?

135
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,088
I apologize.

136
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,760
I jumped in at my own will.
Don't scold him.

137
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,024
Your Highness, what are you doing?

138
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,737
Do you think a eunuch that put you
in danger will get out of this alive?

139
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,379
I'm fine. Put that away.

140
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,547
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,385
Apologize to His Highness immediately!

142
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,348
I have committed a mortal sin,
Your Highness.

143
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,144
You may get up.

144
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,104
The ground is cold.

145
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,291
I'll give you a severe punishment.
Follow me.

146
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,428
My Lord, Premiere Kim is waiting.

147
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,472
Go ahead without me. I'll be right there.

148
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,068
Look here! I'm over here!

149
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:30,030
Where are you going? I'm over here!

150
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,161
Why isn't anyone looking at me?

151
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,789
JAHYEONDANG

152
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,061
Sir.

153
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,564
Why are you so surprised to see me?

154
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,524
I'm a little sad.

155
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,235
You approached me without a sound.

156
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,697
Are you all right?

157
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,034
Oh, yes. I'm fine.

158
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,661
Thank you, sir.

159
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,875
Eunuch Hong...

160
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,795
you think I figured out
your secret, don't you?

161
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,512
Can't you just think of it...

162
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,265
as sharing your secret with me?

163
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,977
"How dependable."

164
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,439
Can't you just think of it that way?

165
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
Don't worry because of me.

166
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,407
Don't avoid me either.

167
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,165
I should get going.

168
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,895
Jahyeondang?

169
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,942
Eunuch Jang.

170
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,821
About the woman who danced
at the festival...

171
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,656
Did you find her?

172
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,575
Don't even bring that up.

173
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,453
His Highness ordered me to search
the entire palace for her

174
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,915
so I searched the entire place
a million times

175
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,834
but I couldn't find her.

176
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,670
Hey, don't even bring that up.

177
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,755
Just thinking about how much
trouble I went through...

178
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,549
it makes me lose my appetite.

179
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,467
Completely.

180
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,993
HONG SAM-NOM

181
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,168
There's no way he avoided this.

182
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,547
Your Majesty.

183
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,260
This is the tribute list from the envoys.

184
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,473
They'd like 30,000 nyang of silver
from the royal palace,

185
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,642
200 geun of ginseng,

186
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,978
150 sheets of leopard skin,

187
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,439
50 brushes made of weasel-tail hair...

188
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,774
Why are they demanding more
than they did last time?

189
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,404
This list is significantly longer than
the one they sent a month ago.

190
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,115
That's because the matters related to
appointing you as regent

191
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,868
are in the hands of the Qing envoys.

192
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,996
They are asking for more and more.

193
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,665
They are being greedy.

194
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,419
If the side that wields the sword
demands that much,

195
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,755
there's not much we can do.

196
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,924
Who put that sword in their hands...

197
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,134
in the first place?

198
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,261
If you want to take a shortcut,

199
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,181
you should be ready for a difficult
and lonely journey.

200
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,979
We can't expect to receive without
giving something in exchange.

201
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,774
Your Majesty.

202
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,027
What should we do?

203
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,074
I don't want to ruin their mood
by trying to haggle.

204
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,994
Crown Prince,
let's turn a blind eye this time

205
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,746
and pretend we don't know anything.

206
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,541
If we turn a blind eye this time...

207
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,211
they'll try to take our eyes
out next time.

208
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,424
I apologize...

209
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,303
but I can't do that, Your Majesty.

210
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,990
Mom...

211
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,661
Make a wish! Make a wish!

212
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,039
That's nice!

213
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,674
That way!

214
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,097
Ra-on, should we play hide and seek?

215
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,474
I'll count to ten

216
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,352
so go hide down there, okay?

217
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,981
You can hide really well
so no one can see you, right?

218
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,192
If you don't find me in
100 seconds, I win.

219
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,863
No, not this time.

220
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,283
You can't come out until I find you.

221
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,743
Ra-on.

222
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,537
You can't tell anyone who you are, okay?

223
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,166
You can't get caught
no matter what happens, okay?

224
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,170
I'm going to start counting, okay? One.

225
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,464
Go on. Two.

226
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008
Please, Ra-on. Three.

227
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,301
Four.

228
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,264
Five.

229
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,601
Six.

230
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,021
Seven.

231
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,399
Seven.

232
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,171
She's over here! Catch her!

233
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,264
Mom.

234
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,529
Mom...

235
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,614
Mom...

236
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,464
Mom.

237
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,844
Mom. Mom...

238
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,387
What a baby.

239
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,628
You were talking in your sleep.

240
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,881
Chief Kim...

241
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,722
I was dreaming of the night
I parted with my mother.

242
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,692
It was a sad dream.

243
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,821
No, it was a happy dream.

244
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,620
At least I got to see my mother again.

245
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,738
Your Highness, I didn't expect you here.

246
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,993
-You dove into the pond to save me...
-Puppy.

247
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,205
I told you to stay away
as long as you have a cold.

248
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,667
I knew it.

249
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,504
I'm fine now.

250
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,133
It's all thanks to Chief Kim
for nursing me all night.

251
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,554
Chief Kim?

252
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,558
That's right.
He's nothing like someone I know

253
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,561
who only worries about himself

254
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,646
and shakes in fear he might catch a cold.

255
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,442
Come here and sit.

256
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,235
I don't want to.

257
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,030
You don't want to?

258
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,039
As you can see, I'm still coughing.

259
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,834
I don't want to be punished
for giving you the cold.

260
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,683
What is this?

261
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,268
Chew before you swallow.

262
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,814
It's ten times more effective
than Chief Kim.

263
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,422
Sam-nom!

264
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,132
Yes?

265
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,260
Have you no idea of what's going on?

266
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,763
-Did something happen?
-Yes, it did.

267
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,059
It affects every eunuch trainee
who worked the banquet.

268
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,856
You were all granted
a Thanksgiving holiday.

269
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,276
PASS

270
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,488
Eunuch Jang, thank you so much!

271
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,864
Thank you!

272
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,873
What's up with the Crap Prince?

273
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,043
Since when did the prince
issue holidays to the trainees?

274
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,753
He's awesome.

275
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,765
Is something wrong?

276
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,100
Eunuch Hong,

277
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:51,146
Eunuch Do's bowl of rice
was taken away from him.

278
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,398
That's right.
I washed and cooked the rice,

279
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,525
and let it steam thoroughly,

280
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,694
but it was taken from me.

281
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,029
What are you talking about?

282
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,158
As you know, he's been
preparing to greet the envoy...

283
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,618
ever since he was recruited
by the Envoy Residence.

284
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,704
Once the envoy arrived though,

285
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,665
he was taken off the list.

286
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,878
Is working at
the Envoy Residence that good?

287
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,547
Of course.
Once you're chummy with the envoy,

288
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,175
your life as a eunuch will be smooth.

289
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,513
Who on earth took your place then?

290
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,477
Instead of guiding the trainees,

291
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,438
he was despicable enough
to ruin our chances.

292
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,231
Who did such a thing?

293
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,201
I see you are

294
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,120
pretty enough to be a kisaeng.

295
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,380
It was that bastard.

296
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,133
What?

297
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,762
What a prick.

298
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,352
Premiere Kim, what are your thoughts?

299
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,814
Is the crown prince smart enough to be

300
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,398
appointed as regent?

301
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,403
He's more than enough.

302
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,118
However, it's too soon.

303
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,121
A child who can barely use chopsticks

304
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,084
will only hurt himself
if he wields a sword.

305
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,465
So you're saying he's not ready yet.

306
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,803
I'll be sure to tell the emperor

307
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,388
how you adore

308
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,224
the crown prince.

309
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,982
Please forgive me,

310
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,902
but I should get ready for the banquet.

311
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,328
Joseon has beautiful mountains

312
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,957
and the peninsular
is surrounded by three exquisite seas.

313
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,585
The best beauty it has to offer though

314
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,254
is its ladies.

315
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,092
Is there one you're particularly fond of?

316
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,136
I saw her at the banquet.

317
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,557
The solo dancer was quite memorable.

318
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,351
If only I could

319
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,854
see her dancing one more time.

320
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,488
Is that who you want?

321
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,038
Can't you make the shot?

322
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,041
-Of course I can.
-Throw it in an arc.

323
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,628
I can do it!

324
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,796
It was the right angle.

325
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,423
-That was close.
-Try again.

326
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,679
-Yes!
-High-five!

327
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,181
Did you see that?

328
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,231
Your Highness, Your Majesty approaches.

329
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,441
What?

330
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,575
So where's my father?

331
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,035
I was joking.

332
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,289
You... Stop right there!

333
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,466
What are you doing here?

334
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,643
Do you still spend a lot of time
at Jahyeondang?

335
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,853
Here and other places.

336
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,108
Enjoying an idle life
is in my job description.

337
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:11,280
Then why did you accept the proposal?

338
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,248
Why did you agree to be regent?

339
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,293
Are you curious?

340
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,602
It's to get rid of

341
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,523
my maternal relatives.

342
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,596
Let me tell you what I think.

343
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,182
Childhood friends

344
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,226
are of a linear relationship.

345
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,395
Meanwhile,

346
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,732
a sovereign and a subject
have a vertical one.

347
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,777
If you had to choose between the two,

348
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,404
which one would it be?

349
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,295
This is what I'll choose.

350
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,214
What does it mean?

351
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,051
My role as a friend and a subject
are one and the same.

352
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,596
If he steers in the wrong direction,

353
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,515
it's my job to correct him.

354
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,059
I will

355
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,896
forever be by his side
and help him make the right choices

356
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,898
as a friend and wise king.

357
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,068
Your Highness, what are your thoughts?

358
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,030
With a good friend and
subject like Yun-seong by my side,

359
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,242
I'll be able to be a great king.

360
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,978
Hello? Is anyone here?

361
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,108
I see no one's here.

362
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,696
I guess I have no choice.
I'll come back later.

363
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,208
Are you here because of Eunuch Do
and Eunuch Ma's matter?

364
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,880
Yes, that's right. How did you know?

365
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,258
When I looked through the list,
something seemed strange,

366
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,178
so I was going to send someone to
the Office of the Eunuchs.

367
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,097
Thank you.

368
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm always thankful to you, sir.

369
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,145
You only express it in words.

370
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,897
Pardon?

371
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,650
How should I show my gratitude?

372
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,611
That's what I wanted to hear.

373
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,031
I heard you received a special vacation.

374
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,574
Please give me...

375
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,243
a quarter of your day.

376
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,955
I'm sorry, Sir.

377
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,291
I already have plans
at the Lantern Festival...

378
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,877
Then can you meet me after your plans?

379
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,798
I'll take that as a yes.

380
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,094
Oh, also...

381
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,227
Here.

382
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,189
Oh, I already had one.

383
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,941
His Highness gave it to me.

384
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,734
His Highness?

385
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,860
Yes.

386
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,905
He kindly gave me medicine
and told me to stay away

387
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,199
in fear that he might get sick, too.

388
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,675
This is the place he referred to
in his first letter, isn't it?

389
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,886
Yes, it is.

390
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,890
He said this is where he first saw you.

391
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,733
-That looks fun!
-That looks fun!

392
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,419
I heard you had a cold then, too.

393
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,886
Do you know what colds
and love have in common?

394
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,640
You can't hide either one.

395
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,435
And there's one more.

396
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,895
Both colds and love...

397
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,106
hurt.

398
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,778
What's so great about a man
whom I've never met?

399
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,572
Forget it.

400
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,074
I should just end it here.

401
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,792
Your Highness, let's go fly some lanterns
instead of moping around here.

402
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,918
Okay?

403
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,422
Come on. Let's go.

404
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,554
This place is still the same.

405
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,098
But she probably forgot about me already.

406
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,560
Of course. You stopped writing
to her a long time ago.

407
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,978
That's enough.

408
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,696
But I'd still...

409
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,741
like to see her one more time.

410
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,411
I don't want anything else.

411
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,089
After his time as a governor in Yeongnam,

412
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,841
he was recently appointed as the
Minister of Culture and Education.

413
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,677
This is Minister Cho Man-hyeong.
Introduce yourself.

414
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,514
I'm Kim Yun-seong.

415
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,018
You're just as handsome
as I heard you were.

416
00:39:56,435 --> 00:40:00,147
I see why he's known as the most
desirable groom, even in Yeongnam.

417
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,358
Goodness, you are too kind.

418
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,195
But he's no comparison to your daughter.

419
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,118
Please look upon him favorably.

420
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,537
I'm just a countryman
who entered the city.

421
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,914
I might need a lot more help

422
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,708
if I want to get adjusted to
living in the city.

423
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,669
I doubt that.

424
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,214
I heard that you haven't seen
each other in years.

425
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,633
May I excuse myself

426
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,219
so that you can catch up with one another?

427
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,595
Stay.

428
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,099
This meeting is also for you.

429
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,564
Minister Cho, will you accept
a drink from Yun-seong?

430
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,692
Of course.

431
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,286
Goodness.

432
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,413
Look at this one!

433
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,124
Please buy a lantern!

434
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:30,154
I was dreaming of the night
I parted with my mother.

435
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,621
At least I got to see my mother again.

436
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,840
Mom...

437
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,967
Mom.

438
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,136
Mom.

439
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,180
Mom.

440
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,599
Mom.

441
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,419
You made it seem like you were
going to have a lot of fun.

442
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,421
What are you doing here?

443
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,384
I'm having a lot of fun right now,
Your Highness.

444
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,055
Well, puppies do love this the most.

445
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,016
They love it when there's snow
or lights in the sky.

446
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,896
Well, I thought you didn't
want to go out tonight.

447
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,522
What are you doing here?

448
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,399
You didn't bring a companion either.

449
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,734
I have one right here.

450
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,736
I have plans with someone tonight.

451
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,907
Okay, let's pretend that's true.

452
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,456
Are you going to keep standing here?

453
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,418
You only have four hours left
of your precious vacation.

454
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,630
Follow me.

455
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,759
I apologize, Your Highness.

456
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,429
But this is my vacation,
so please let me go...

457
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,516
Geez, you don't listen, do you?

458
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,768
What is Eunuch Jang teaching you?

459
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,938
-Let's go.
-Wait...

460
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,301
Goodness, take a look around...

461
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,816
Please buy a lantern.
Please buy a lantern.

462
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,030
Please buy a lantern.
It will make your wish come true.

463
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,868
Did you make these?

464
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,828
Yes, it's five bun...

465
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,247
but I'll give it to you for three bun.

466
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,169
Take it. I don't need a lantern.

467
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,589
If you're not going to buy one, just go.

468
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,467
I'm here to sell lanterns that will
make your wish come true.

469
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,344
I'm not a beggar.

470
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,723
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

471
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,062
A lantern that will make
my wish come true...

472
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,982
If it were you, what would you wish for?

473
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:04,029
I'd wish to meet the King, just once.

474
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,282
What would you say to the King?

475
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,370
I want to ask him to make Joseon
a better country.

476
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,793
What makes a country great?

477
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,753
Well...

478
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,176
I'm sure the King would know,
since he worries about his people.

479
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,809
I'll buy a lantern.

480
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,602
It's three bun.

481
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,812
Okay, one moment...

482
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,695
I'll buy all of your lanterns.

483
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,121
You didn't have to do that.

484
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,090
I'm trusting you since you said they work.

485
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,217
Really?

486
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,601
This is for you.

487
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,938
Watch and see if your wish comes true.

488
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,648
Thank you, sir.

489
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,360
Here.

490
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:29,865
This is for those
who can't afford to make a wish.

491
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,795
I hope your wish comes true, My Lady.

492
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,087
-Wait...
-My Lady!

493
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,208
She fled at the sight of me.

494
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,503
She doesn't even know who you are.

495
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,798
She's as fair as always.

496
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,514
It was Yeong, wasn't it?

497
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,516
Yes, it was him.

498
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,896
Your Highness, where's your lantern?

499
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,707
I hope we meet again.

500
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,214
I wish to be pretty

501
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,091
like her.

502
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,313
Every lantern

503
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,524
holds a wish of the people.

504
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,529
They want enough to eat and to be healthy.

505
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,784
All of those wishes

506
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,870
are directed at me.

507
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,584
Chief Eunuch,

508
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,587
I have no lantern,

509
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,050
but I hope to make a wish to you as well.

510
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,179
Of course.

511
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,726
Look after the Crown Prince.

512
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,064
I was too foolish,

513
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,817
and I crumbled and grew weak.

514
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:55,070
Make sure he doesn't.

515
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:04,329
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

516
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,924
AUGUST 30

517
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,886
That's when the Qing envoy
will return home.

518
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,266
You have until then
to map out the route they'll take.

519
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,353
They are taking home
what are hardworking people made.

520
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,231
The people should get it back.

521
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,612
What's wrong?

522
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,448
Are you afraid
the Crown Prince will look incompetent?

523
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,870
We should wait for his decision--

524
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,371
Don't forget your duty.

525
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,750
You're not his friend.

526
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,515
What are you looking at?

527
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,730
Nothing, sir.

528
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,205
The festival sure is a delight.

529
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,624
Look at the crowd.

530
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,709
You should write down your wish.

531
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,961
I'm good.

532
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,632
Please do tell.

533
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,469
If only one of our wishes can come true,

534
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,222
it'll be better for it to be yours.

535
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,758
Your Highness, shall we send it up?

536
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,984
Please!

537
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:42,612
Please let us have a year of good harvest.

538
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,974
Please make the Crown Prince's wish
come true.

539
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,774
I HOPE EUNUCH HONG FINDS HIS MOTHER

540
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,612
I hope Eunuch Hong finds his mother.

541
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,963
Was...

542
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,924
Was that your wish?

543
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,719
That's right.

544
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,305
I wish that

545
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,183
your wish comes true.

546
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,835
She's with you?

547
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,254
Are you from the palace?

548
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,548
Show your face.

549
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,930
She's my lady, Your Highness.

550
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,977
Can't you just think of it...

551
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,105
as sharing your secret with me?

552
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,273
"How dependable."

553
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,068
Can't you just think of it that way?

554
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,532
Welcome.

555
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,664
Your Highness.

556
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,460
How did you know that

557
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,255
I got separated from my mother?

558
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,529
Why are you staring at me like that?

559
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,490
I know it's preposterous,

560
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,786
but why do I see

561
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,124
someone else in you?

562
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,043
Someone else?

563
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,837
That's right.

564
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,216
Another woman.

565
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,645
Eunuch Hong.

566
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,325
I apologize for my tardiness.

567
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,915
Your Highness, I'm sorry

568
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,833
but we have plans.

569
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,383
Have you forgotten about it?

570
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,054
I'd like you to join me if you can.

571
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,150
My apologies, Your Highness.

572
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,001
I won't allow it.

573
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,047
Your Highness?

574
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,804
He is my person.
