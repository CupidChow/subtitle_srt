1
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,988
Sorry, I didn't know you had a visitor.

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,665
Did you go to Supyo Bridge again?

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,792
Yes.

4
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,836
I saw someone

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,922
who looks just like my daughter
at the lantern festival.

6
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,925
I've been having nightmares since then.

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,181
If...

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,810
you have to let go of someone

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,022
when things get tough,

10
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,237
it should not be me.

11
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,158
Can you promise me that?

12
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,045
Yes, Your Highness.

13
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,508
Good.

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,219
I think

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,222
my wish has finally come true.

16
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,352
What do you mean?

17
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,942
I wished for

18
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,945
your wish to come true.

19
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,917
I found your mother.

20
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,534
Mom.

21
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,123
Ra-on.

22
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,127
I'm sorry it took me so long to find you.

23
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,591
Mom.

24
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,887
Mom.

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,726
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,566
Mom.

27
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,367
Mom.

28
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,111
Why are you hiding it?

29
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,114
What do you mean?

30
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,492
About Ra-on's mother.

31
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,710
You know they're desperately
looking for each other,

32
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,713
but why do you keep silent?

33
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,342
What if she really is her mother?

34
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,720
Of course, I should help them reunite.

35
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,140
What would you do

36
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,226
if their reunion could put you in danger,
Your Highness?

37
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,188
If you let this one go,

38
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,774
you and Ra-on

39
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,570
might be able to live happily together.

40
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,492
I don't know
what kind of danger it may be,

41
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,704
but I don't want to stop
a mother and her child from reuniting.

42
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,201
You went through so much, didn't you?

43
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,456
I've already forgotten about it.

44
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,085
I thought
I'd never be able to see you again,

45
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,921
but I met you again like this.

46
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
By the way,

47
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,772
what on earth happened?

48
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,942
How did you become a eunuch?

49
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,070
I'll tell you little by little.

50
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,906
Don't worry too much.

51
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,701
I met a lot of nice people.
I'm doing very well.

52
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,205
His Highness is good to me too.

53
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,378
His Highness?

54
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,674
Are you saying the man over there

55
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,218
is the Crown Prince?

56
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,735
I won't ask you any more questions
since I made you a promise.

57
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,992
I'm curious and worried about
what you told me,

58
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,121
but still, thank you
for giving me a chance to choose.

59
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,249
Your Highness.

60
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,336
Destiny can neither be made

61
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,422
nor be avoided.

62
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,050
That's exactly what I want to say.

63
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,949
I'll grant her an official holiday
and send her to come see you soon.

64
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,910
Don't feel so bad
to say goodbye to her now.

65
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,332
Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,548
I'll see you soon, Mom.

67
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,062
I'm relying on you,
so please take good care of her.

68
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,356
Don't drink too much, Grandfather.

69
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,358
I told you not to call me that.

70
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,986
Do I look that old?

71
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,076
Let's go.

72
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,524
Now everything is up to Ra-on.

73
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,695
This isn't a matter of choice.

74
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,364
She's working at the palace.

75
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,450
What's more,
she's serving the Crown Prince.

76
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,369
It doesn't make sense.

77
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,289
You're well aware that this is not right.

78
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,719
Your Highness.

79
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,562
It doesn't seem like it will stop soon.

80
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,273
I know.

81
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,444
Your Highness, wait here for a minute.

82
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,696
I'll go get an umbrella.

83
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,906
Go ahead.

84
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,369
You know

85
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,582
I wouldn't say that.

86
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,185
Why don't we walk a little faster?

87
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,576
A crown prince
would never run in the palace.

88
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,496
Never.

89
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,166
I'm aware of that.

90
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,921
So what?

91
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,591
Do you think any crown prince
has ever loved a eunuch?

92
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,471
It all happened to be that way.

93
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,160
BLACK MARKET LEDGER

94
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,226
Are you all right, Your Highness?

95
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,617
What if you catch a cold?

96
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,331
I'm afraid.

97
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,795
Of what?

98
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,424
Of being too happy.

99
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,014
What if I am this happy

100
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,142
because someone else's happiness
came to me?

101
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,228
What if...

102
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,149
they come and take it away from me?

103
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,822
Are you that happy
to be reunited with your mother?

104
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,244
There are people I wish to be with

105
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,788
both inside and outside the palace.

106
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,249
How could I not be happy?

107
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,296
If you are happy, I am happy.

108
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,633
But...

109
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,887
you make it sound like you would be
just fine without me outside the palace,

110
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,056
and that makes me sad.

111
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,894
Don't worry, Your Highness.

112
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,899
I will not go anywhere
without your permission.

113
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,777
Do you mean that?

114
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,320
Of course.

115
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,378
I left it on the Crown Prince's desk

116
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,004
as you requested.

117
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,924
Good work.

118
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,929
If something like this keeps happening,
they will tighten security.

119
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,139
Would you be okay then?

120
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,267
It would not have been necessary
for me to hide

121
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,562
if I had decided not to take any action.

122
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,359
We need to let him know

123
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,989
that he is always being judged
by the people.

124
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,494
You may go.

125
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,831
Yes, sir.

126
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,503
When will you...

127
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,922
tell her?

128
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,217
I'm talking about Hong Ra-on.

129
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,178
I'm waiting for the moment

130
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,100
when the Crown Prince
becomes incapacitated.

131
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,971
Do you know what these are?

132
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,308
I do not know, Your Highness.

133
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,644
These are letters that accuse you
of cronyism and corruption.

134
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,731
But...

135
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,609
why was I never notified of these...

136
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,362
when so many have come in already?

137
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,908
Chief Royal Secretary,

138
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,243
speak up.

139
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,750
Your Highness,

140
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,545
the accusations made in the letter
have not been confirmed,

141
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,381
and it is possible
that they are only trying to defame him.

142
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,850
It's as if they already knew
you would say that

143
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,688
because they even sent evidence this time.

144
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,903
BLACK MARKET LEDGER

145
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,368
This is the list of people
who bought their posts from you.

146
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,750
BLACK MARKET LEDGER

147
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,548
It states when, where, whom,

148
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,467
and which posts were bought for how much.

149
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,097
Your Highness, I feel wronged.

150
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,390
Chief Royal Secretary.

151
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,978
I ordered you to confirm the allegations
with the people on this list.

152
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,605
What happened with that?

153
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,193
They all confessed that it is true.

154
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,788
Your Highness, this is definitely slander.

155
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,292
You abused your power
to take bribes for posts

156
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,044
and corrupted the Royal Court.

157
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,338
I order you to remove Minister Kim Ui-gyo

158
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,841
from office.

159
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,053
Yes, Your Highness.
I will follow your command.

160
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,597
Remove me?

161
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,225
Your Highness,
please retract your command!

162
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,855
You must make a careful decision

163
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,859
after the formal investigations
are completed, Your Highness.

164
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,070
You are right.

165
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,700
I am investigating this thoroughly,

166
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,120
so I will question and hold those,

167
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,081
who kept quiet about this all along
accountable.

168
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,597
That was the book that disappeared
when the storage was raided

169
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,557
by Baekwoon Group.

170
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,101
But...

171
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,772
how did it end up
in the Crown Prince's hands?

172
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,066
My thoughts exactly.

173
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,321
So he ordered your removal from office?

174
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,743
My Lord, this is Chil-seong.

175
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,953
You may come in.

176
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,045
Did you look into it?

177
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,757
I went to meet the man
who had the information,

178
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,717
but he was already dead.

179
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,433
I think they killed him
because he figured out their identity.

180
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,771
What? Then, you don't have
any more information?

181
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,483
I found out that the name
of Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter

182
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,402
is Hong Ra-on.

183
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,740
Hong Ra-on?

184
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,330
But I'm sure she had to use
a different name.

185
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,003
Keep looking into it
until you find more information.

186
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,337
Yes, My Lord.

187
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,944
Hello, Chief of Mistry of Rites.

188
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,280
Let His Highness know that I am here

189
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,532
to discuss the date
for the Princess Consort selection.

190
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,952
Yes, My Lord.
But His Highness is in the library.

191
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,787
Shall I relay your message?

192
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,584
No, I'll go there myself.

193
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,002
Yes, My Lord.

194
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,959
Can you see me even with your eyes closed?

195
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,966
You were smiling while you were sleeping.

196
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,803
Yes.

197
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,765
I had a dream about you.

198
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,866
What kind of dream was it?

199
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,412
It's the dream

200
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,125
where you called me Ra-on
for the first time.

201
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,883
Sleep some more, Ra-on.

202
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,554
Ra-on?

203
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,851
I found out that the name
of Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter

204
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,603
is Hong Ra-on.

205
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,313
Ra-on.

206
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,857
Hong Ra-on.

207
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,405
The Crown Prince's palace?

208
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,992
We shouldn't sit back and watch

209
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,536
how the Crown Prince behaves so rudely.

210
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,623
If we're going to sway him,
we should do it properly

211
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,791
so that he doesn't act up anymore.

212
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,960
Still, it can be considered...

213
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,463
treason.

214
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,635
I have a good idea.

215
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,650
We'll disguise it
as if it's Baekwoon Group's doing.

216
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,569
Is that what you mean?

217
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,198
Rebel forces are going rampant anyway,

218
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,408
so there is no reason why we shouldn't.

219
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,123
Gather a few merciless assassins.

220
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,418
Once everything comes to an end,

221
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,506
they'll leave this mask and disappear.

222
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,967
We'll catch three birds with one stone.

223
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,719
The date of the royal marriage
will be advanced,

224
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,597
the guard against Baekwoon Group
will be tightened,

225
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,935
and the Crown Prince
will stop acting up and kneel before us.

226
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,106
He'll kneel before us in fear.

227
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,320
How should we tell this to Premier Kim?

228
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,990
He'll know about it
even if we try to hide.

229
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:19,202
Still, he won't stop us
even if he knows about it.

230
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,209
What brings you here?

231
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,462
I told you I wouldn't forgive you

232
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,173
if you showed yourself before me again.

233
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,258
Your Highness, the truth is...

234
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,470
Tell me right this instant

235
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,847
just what you were scheming
in front of my residence.

236
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,727
The clouds... No, the sun...
I mean the weather is nice, and...

237
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,567
Actually, I couldn't forget
about the beautiful lady

238
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,569
who stayed in the residence the other day,

239
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,280
so I paid a short visit.

240
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,744
Someone who stayed in the residence?

241
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,372
A beautiful lady other than me?

242
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,000
Could it be Wol-hui?

243
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,127
She has become sharp...

244
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,550
I mean, she's not here anymore.

245
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,014
What is that? Bring it to me.

246
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,775
I was reminded of her favorite snack,
so I brought some.

247
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,485
Awesome.

248
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,494
Wol-hui doesn't like this kind of stuff.

249
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,205
Take it back.

250
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,458
Out of sight, out of mind.

251
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,673
I don't know who she is,

252
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,884
but I guess you liked someone
with a very similar taste to mine.

253
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,139
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
You may go now.

254
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,685
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,746
What brings you here?

256
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,586
Byeong-yeon.

257
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,382
Are you in there?

258
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,620
Your Highness.

259
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,504
How have you been?

260
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,010
I thought I would be able to know

261
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,599
whether he was alive or dead
if I met his family.

262
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,978
This is why I cut ties with you.

263
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,441
Have you ever thought about
how Ra-on and I had been

264
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,487
during the ten years when my husband
was focused on nothing but the uprising?

265
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,909
We'll protect you now.

266
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,411
No.

267
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,289
What are you trying
to do to Ra-on this time?

268
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,751
Help us
so that the thousands of sacrificed lives

269
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,961
don't go in vain.

270
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,759
We know nothing.

271
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,304
Please...

272
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,808
Please do not get us involved in it again.

273
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,494
Your Highness.

274
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,584
Byeong-yeon.

275
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,715
Are you hurt?

276
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,390
Well, there has been an accident.

277
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,937
One of our new trainees made a mistake
during the training yesterday.

278
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,692
It must have been dangerous.

279
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,405
What about your wound?

280
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,074
Is it okay?

281
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,202
Yes, I'm fine, Your Highness.

282
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,924
Chief Kim left work?

283
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,218
Already?

284
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,888
Yes, he told us that he wouldn't
participate in the training

285
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,515
because he wasn't feeling well.

286
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,226
Did he get hurt badly
during the training yesterday?

287
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,603
We didn't have any training yesterday.

288
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,442
So, there was no training.

289
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,527
No, Your Highness.

290
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,169
Hello, My Lord.

291
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,382
I'm on my way to Premier Kim's house.

292
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,552
At this hour?

293
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,138
I finally found out

294
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,641
about the girl named Hong Ra-on.

295
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,899
What did you find out?

296
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,527
It's said that she's in the palace now.

297
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,740
In the palace?

298
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,369
Are you certain about that?

299
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,707
Yes, I need to inform Premier Kim quickly
in order to sneak her out first.

300
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,587
You haven't reported this
to anyone yet, have you?

301
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,880
No.

302
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,799
I just...

303
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,302
found out about it.

304
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,139
Good. Go ahead.

305
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,016
I want to take my time and walk home.

306
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,267
Yes, My Lord.

307
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,502
It's you, My Lord.

308
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,046
I forgot to tell you something.

309
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,049
Please go ahead, My Lord.

310
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,304
You see...

311
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,368
HONG GYEONG-RAE'S DAUGHTER
IS IN THE PALACE

312
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,902
I apologize for visiting so late,
Your Highness.

313
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,031
If it is about Sam-nom,
do not say anything.

314
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,618
If there's anything she needs...

315
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,704
I'll help her.

316
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,122
No.

317
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,375
I must say it.

318
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,295
What Eunuch Hong needs...

319
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,423
is to get out of here.

320
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,718
Kim Yun-seong.

321
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,763
I told you
that she's none of your worries.

322
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,308
Eunuch Hong shouldn't be here.
This palace...

323
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,559
I will...

324
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,646
find a way.

325
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,357
If you two stay together,

326
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,735
you will also face great danger.

327
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:09,161
What would you do if their reunion
could put you in danger, Your Highness?

328
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,334
What is that danger...

329
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,254
you speak of?

330
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,431
Forget it.

331
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,935
If I was going to be shaken up
by such words,

332
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,313
I wouldn't have loved her
in the first place.

333
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,899
You may go now.

334
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,291
The bloodshed

335
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,086
has probably started by now.

336
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,242
What was that?

337
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,245
Is anyone out there?

338
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,860
Is anyone there?

339
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,831
Who are you?

340
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,860
As you can see, I'm empty-handed.

341
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,406
I don't know what you want,

342
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,575
but we will start talking

343
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,036
after you let her go.

344
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,601
Is that you, Byeong-yeon?

345
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,833
Yes. I apologize for being late,
Your Highness.

346
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,189
Your Highness.

347
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,191
Your Highness!

348
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,568
Your Highness.

349
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,449
Your Highness!

350
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,542
Your Highness.

351
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,674
Your Highness.

352
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,137
Your Majesty.

353
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,850
Premier Kim, what should we do about this?

354
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,979
Is it true that masked bandits
broke into the Crown Prince's palace?

355
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,355
Yes, Your Highness.

356
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,527
You must stay strong at a time like this.

357
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,907
I can't believe I have to worry
about this information leaking out

358
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,578
when my son, the Crown Prince,
suffered such a dangerous incident.

359
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,458
I'm sure you want to call in the chief
of the royal guard and reprimand him.

360
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,587
But what good will come
of people finding out?

361
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,512
They will try to stir up public sentiment
and cause more trouble.

362
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,974
I will take care of this,

363
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,102
so that the public won't be disturbed.

364
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,752
Did you handle it properly?

365
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,795
Of course, Premier Kim.

366
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,257
His Majesty ordered us
to stay quiet about this,

367
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,426
so we couldn't be more grateful.

368
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,263
But don't let your guard down
until it's finished.

369
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,601
Of course. There's no question about that.

370
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,980
We will excuse ourselves.

371
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,703
What will we do about this?
We sent ten assassins.

372
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,705
Yet only nine bodies were found.

373
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,375
He probably got away, right?

374
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,588
Should we report this or not?
Still, I shouldn't turn a blind eye to it.

375
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,263
GYEONCHUNJEON

376
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,735
I'm the eunuch
from the Crown Prince's palace.

377
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,530
May I go in for a while?

378
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,490
-No.
-Sir.

379
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,952
How is His Highness?

380
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,163
Please tell me if he is okay, sir.

381
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,957
Step aside.

382
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,261
Please

383
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,056
stay stong, Your Highness.

384
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,835
When will you come back?

385
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,612
Your Highness, can you see me?

386
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,831
There were dead bodies of assassins
and their blood

387
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,041
everywhere in your residence,

388
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,460
so we brought you here for the time being.

389
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,965
Also, His Majesty has ordered
not to send anyone in

390
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,592
except for physicians.

391
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,932
You may not get up yet, Your Highness.

392
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,937
There's something I need,

393
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,524
so bring me a eunuch from my residence.

394
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,622
Your Highness,

395
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,501
I'm here.

396
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,344
Are you all right?

397
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,024
Your Highness.

398
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,445
Do you remember

399
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,698
when I told you

400
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,284
that I was afraid of being too happy?

401
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,252
When you fell down,

402
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,007
I was so scared.

403
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,720
I thought

404
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,808
they were

405
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,061
taking this happiness back away from me

406
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,814
in the end.

407
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,321
Please do not let go of my hand.

408
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,079
I...

409
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,374
I won't let go of your hand either.

410
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,950
How dare you?

411
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,580
No one can take away your happiness

412
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,292
without my permission.

413
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,841
So don't cry.

414
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,222
I will

415
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,892
never let go of your hand.

416
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,068
What time will you return?

417
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,781
-Before the curfew--
-No.

418
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,784
Come back before sunset.

419
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:14,042
You have to come back by my side
before sunset no matter what.

420
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,421
Do you understand?

421
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,218
Yes, Your Highness.

422
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,479
You can't go anywhere
with her alone right now.

423
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,984
She's in the palace,
serving the Crown Prince.

424
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:43,530
This happened while I had my hands off
out of fear and agitation.

425
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,200
So I can't sit back and watch anymore.

426
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,634
Ra-on and the Crown Prince

427
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,472
love each other dearly.

428
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,934
Do you truly not know what that means?

429
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,665
Has the time passed this much already?

430
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:39,836
Yes, Your Highness.
It's time for evening assembly soon.

431
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,174
Okay, get things prepared.

432
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,383
Yes, Your Highness.

433
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,892
I told her to come back before sunset.

434
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,651
I tried so hard to escape
from that dreadful fate.

435
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,572
She was such a beautiful child,

436
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,702
but I punished her hard
and made her live as a boy.

437
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:20,210
I can't let her stay there
for even a second anymore.

438
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,921
If anyone

439
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,465
finds out

440
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,219
that she's Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter...

441
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,455
JAHYEONDANG

442
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,974
If...

443
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,520
you have to let go of someone

444
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,815
when things get tough,

445
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,989
it should not be me.

446
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,993
Can you promise me that?

447
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,705
Don't worry, Your Highness.

448
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,418
I will not go anywhere
without your permission.

449
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,386
Have you been waiting long, Your Highness?
