1
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,275
I order the Crown Prince

2
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,528
to be my regent.

3
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,197
Your Majesty, that is--

4
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,908
I will leave everything to him

5
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,786
-except military power--
-Your Majesty.

6
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,293
I am truly touched

7
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,671
by His Highness’s kind heart

8
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,758
and his desire to share your burden.

9
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,801
Thank you.

10
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:56,222
You don’t know how happy I am
to hear you say that.

11
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,932
However,

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,729
choosing an interim king
is an important decision

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,564
as the nation's reputation is on the line.

14
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,235
In the past, when Joseon
broke the pact with Qing Dynasty,

15
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,572
we had to face two wars.

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,199
After that,

17
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,785
an alliance was no more,

18
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,995
and we became their subject.

19
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,040
Appointing the Crown Prince as regent

20
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,001
is a great change,
involving diplomatic matters.

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,670
We need to ask The Qing Dynasty

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,590
for approval first.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,511
Please, revoke your orders.

24
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,723
Please understand, Your Majesty.

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,643
-Please understand, Your Majesty.
-Please understand, Your Majesty.

26
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,161
Indeed...

27
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,706
Premier Kim is brilliant.

28
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,918
I wish

29
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,755
to lighten your burden this very moment.

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,715
But as Premier Kim said

31
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,302
we should be extremely cautious

32
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,222
as it involves diplomatic matters.

33
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,311
I heard that
the Qing Dynasty's envoys will visit

34
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,939
for your 40th birthday banquet.

35
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,613
Please understand
the concerns of your subjects,

36
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,784
who care for the nation,
and postpone your decision

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,829
so that I may become the interim king
with Qing's blessing, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,756
Please delay your orders, Your Majesty!

39
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,136
-Please understand! Your Majesty!
-Please understand! Your Majesty!

40
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,111
THE CROWN PRINCE’S LIBRARY

41
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,172
Silver Spoon!

42
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,592
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,263
What about you?

44
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,849
I'm running errands.

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,106
Have you seen His Highness?

46
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,317
I heard he is in here.

47
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,818
What?

48
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,446
No, I haven't.

49
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,448
Thank goodness.

50
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,617
I was so nervous.

51
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,038
What are you doing there?

52
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,501
This library is for His Highness only.

53
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,545
Get out at once if you are done.

54
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,048
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,891
Silver Spoon!

56
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,937
Did you hear that? Let's go.

57
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,856
This place is off limit
except for His Highness.

58
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,239
What are you doing?

59
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,616
We have to leave.

60
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,202
Let's go before we run into His Highness.

61
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,249
Why do you hide it from him,
Your Highness?

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,626
He will find out soon anyway.

63
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:04,095
I'm telling you this as your friend,
so keep that in mind.

64
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,763
My friend?

65
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,558
Since when were we friends?

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,686
If not friends, what are we?

67
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,699
Then what is your name, Silver Spoon?

68
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,830
Hey...

69
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,125
You asked me what my name is.

70
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,912
Lee Yeong.

71
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,830
That is my name.

72
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,387
Wait, Silver Spoon.

73
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,265
This attire...

74
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,186
Looks too much like a dragon robe.

75
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,438
It is.

76
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,065
Goodness...

77
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,317
Why are you wearing this?

78
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,320
What if the Crown Prince sees...

79
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,789
Silver...

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,166
Silver...

81
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,755
Silver...

82
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,468
Your Highness! Just kill me, please!

83
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,011
Please...

84
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,889
Really?

85
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,892
What? No...

86
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,853
Spare me!

87
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,547
Kill or spare...

88
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,888
Do you think I only have two options
to choose from?

89
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,309
After all...

90
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,604
We’re friends.

91
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,233
Friends?

92
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,528
It was you, who said it.

93
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,740
"If not friends,

94
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,075
what are we?"

95
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,978
You were threatened?

96
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,439
I’m telling you.

97
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,943
"It was you, who said it.

98
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,905
If not friends, what are we?"

99
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,826
Why wouldn't it be a threat?

100
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,247
His Highness must be furious.

101
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,792
The Crown Prince possesses

102
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,335
the blood of a human and a beast.

103
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,712
And he's a like a crazy dog
that doesn't know

104
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,173
when to bark or when not to bark...

105
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,142
Stop doing that. You’ll break the pillar.

106
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,396
I’m worthless than this pillar.

107
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,607
Why did I say that in front of
His Highness?

108
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,032
Are you really the Chief?

109
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,661
Or are you hiding something, too?

110
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,746
I'm not.

111
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,419
It seems like you are.

112
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,551
"Are you awake, Your Highness?"

113
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,555
His Highness often stays up late,
so there might be no response.

114
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,473
You’ll have to ask many times.

115
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,391
Follow my lead.

116
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,270
Ask many, many times...

117
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,772
And You may go inside
as soon as he clears his throat.

118
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,983
Yes, but Eunuch Jang.

119
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,651
Yes?

120
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,488
I promise I am not picky when it
comes to my assignments.

121
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,452
Good, you are the talented individual
this palace has been searching for.

122
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,997
But due to my current circumstances,

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,249
I'm willing to do anything, anywhere else.

124
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,669
Is it possible for me to work
at another place?

125
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,508
You don't like me, do you?

126
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,469
Do you dislike me that much?

127
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,970
-Pardon?
-Well?

128
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,890
Oh, it's not because of you--

129
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,850
-Well, that's what it sounds like.
-Then

130
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,269
is it because of me?

131
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,338
Tell me.

132
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,677
Why do you want to work anywhere but here?

133
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,266
That's not true.

134
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,813
How could I dare to be picky
about where I work?

135
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,121
Then is it okay to point fingers at me,
bite my finger,

136
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,874
and exhibit your drunken habits?

137
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,050
Of course not.

138
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:02,263
I deserve to be punished
for the arrogant acts I committed

139
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,348
because I failed to recognize you.

140
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,103
Do you regret the time we spent together?

141
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,278
Yes.

142
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,406
I regret it.

143
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,328
You resent me, don't you?

144
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,251
If you had told me the truth earlier,

145
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,336
I...

146
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,882
wouldn't have dared to suggest that

147
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,967
we be friends.

148
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,931
That's why I didn't tell you.

149
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,769
I knew you'd react like that

150
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,938
if you knew I was the Crown Prince.

151
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,691
Pardon?

152
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,277
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

153
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,699
Did you order everyone else
to leave the room,

154
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,536
so you could tell me that?

155
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,915
Not to punish me?

156
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,334
You may treat me as your friend

157
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,669
whenever it's just the two of us.

158
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,423
No, I command you to do so.

159
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,551
Do you understand?

160
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,416
Do you know anything about the minister

161
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,252
who will be visiting as an envoy?

162
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,129
Yes.

163
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,257
He may be known as a loyal
subject to the emperor,

164
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,970
but he has a bad reputation
amongst the subjects.

165
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,932
Is it true that he demanded a coffer

166
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,602
filled with silver when he comes?

167
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,730
Even though he said it as a joke
over a few drinks,

168
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,940
given what I already know about him,

169
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,735
I don't think it was just a joke.

170
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,906
Seeing how he's demanding
so much with confidence,

171
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,366
we're in for quite a challenge.

172
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,039
Arrange a meal with the envoy
when he gets here.

173
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,543
I don't think any good will come
of staying close to him.

174
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,214
If it's for our country, we should be
willing to endure hardships.

175
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,345
But I understand your concern for me.

176
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,597
Yes, Grandfather.

177
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,019
I should head back so I can
prepare for the banquet.

178
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,146
Sure, go ahead.

179
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,447
Let's just give him everything he wants.

180
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,408
If you get on his good side by doing so,

181
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,204
you can ask him to oppose appointing
the Crown Prince as regent.

182
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,789
Didn't I tell you

183
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,751
that politics is similar to winning
over the heart of a woman?

184
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,171
If you just give them everything
they ask for,

185
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,425
you'll get nothing more than
one night of fun.

186
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,304
Then, how do you plan on
bringing him down?

187
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,809
How would our high-spirited
Crown Prince act

188
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,729
if he met an envoy like him?

189
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,816
Goodness, with a temper like his,

190
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,110
let's hope he doesn't grab him
by his throat.

191
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,032
Are you suggesting that we get them

192
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,326
to fight each other?

193
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,913
A power tripping envoy
and a Crown Prince with a temper.

194
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,834
If we're lucky, we'll get what we want
without getting our hands dirty.

195
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,552
You sure are wise, Premier Kim.

196
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,686
Don't you miss the outside?

197
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,192
I'd be lying if I said I don't.

198
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,528
What is it that you miss so much?

199
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,199
The busy streets,

200
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,368
rice cakes with steam coming out of them

201
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,788
and the exciting games.
I miss all of that.

202
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,376
The palace is only filled with
things we mustn't do.

203
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,170
That's true.

204
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,339
You must feel suffocated
after living so freely.

205
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,719
Yes, it's not easy for trainees
to go outside.

206
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,929
Oh dear...

207
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,560
Get ready to go outside.

208
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,438
I'll help you take a trip
outside this palace.

209
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,858
Do you mean that?

210
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,195
How is it that...

211
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,657
everything eunuch Jang
said about you is true?

212
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,329
You can't do that.
He warned me that if I follow you out

213
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,915
or happen to lose you out there,

214
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,458
I'll be severely punished.

215
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,210
Fine. Forget it.

216
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,050
Oh, my stomach.

217
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,428
You're not pretending to have
a stomachache, are you, Your Highness?

218
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,724
No, there's no way.

219
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,019
The Crown Prince wouldn't...

220
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,441
I need to go to the library.
Bring those books with you.

221
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,206
Your Highness, I searched everywhere,
but I can't find that book you mentioned.

222
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,752
Don't you remember the title?

223
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,714
There are way too many books
to search through

224
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,092
for a book with a smudged title.

225
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,887
Please answer me...

226
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,809
"You may treat me as your friend
whenever it's just the two of us.

227
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,770
No, I command you to do so."

228
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,565
What are you doing?

229
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,818
I don't know either.
His Highness told me to say that.

230
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,863
I'm speechless.

231
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,115
What? You're speechless?

232
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,452
Eunuch Hong
I command you to find your speech!

233
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,080
Is this the time for jokes?

234
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,083
No, wait! His Highness told me to do this!

235
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,713
The job of setting up Jagyeong Palace...

236
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,257
will be Eunuch Ha's job.

237
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,592
Yes, Eunuch Seong.

238
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,678
-I want you two to follow me.
-Yes, sir.

239
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,266
Wait, the kitchen just asked for
two more helpers.

240
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,479
Tell them to manage
with the staff they have!

241
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,149
Look at this! There's so much to do!

242
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,734
But we only have...

243
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,235
Oh my, My Lord.

244
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,113
You should have sent someone.

245
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,450
What brings you all the way here?

246
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,080
I want to send folding screens that need
repair to the Painting Bureau.

247
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,249
You all seem to be very busy.

248
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,835
It is fine.
I'll just manage with the staff...

249
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,712
No, we aren't busy at all.

250
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,424
You see those over there
who are hanging around?

251
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,761
Sam-nom, come here.

252
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,192
Are you sure he is here?

253
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,570
Yes, I heard that he has been staying here

254
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,030
after his exile was over a month ago.

255
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,909
Hello, welcome.

256
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,331
Are you looking for Mr. Jeong?

257
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,878
Go that way. He is fighting with a dog.

258
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,643
He really is fighting with a dog.

259
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,939
I had better meet him alone today.

260
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,024
Yes, Your Highness.

261
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,987
Can you do it in three days?

262
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,155
Do not worry.

263
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,283
Pay special attention to it.

264
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,995
It is to be used in the palace.
I will make the best one.

265
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,487
Hong Ra-on.

266
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,491
Take that off right now.

267
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,909
No.

268
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,537
Can I wear this just for today?

269
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,164
Mom...

270
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,417
You are not a girl.

271
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,878
You are a boy.

272
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,880
Don't you get it?

273
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:46,073
You look as fine and pretty
as a porcelain vase,

274
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,741
yet you are so picky when choosing items.

275
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,703
Let us go, Eunuch Hong.

276
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,289
Yes, sir.

277
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,756
By the way...

278
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,092
What now?

279
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,177
This one.

280
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,354
He has come after all. Mr. Jeong is here.

281
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,066
Are you here for me?

282
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,493
Sir, let me carry that baggage for you.

283
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,829
It is not heavy.

284
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,831
There is not much inside.

285
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,171
Are you all right?

286
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,631
Yes.

287
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,022
You can use this.

288
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,648
What?

289
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,860
How can a man wear a woman's clothes?

290
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,989
The eaves are short.

291
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,242
Just use it to take shelter from the rain.

292
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,750
No.

293
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,045
You said you would give it
as a gift to someone noble.

294
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,257
That is true.

295
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,470
However, I think
now is not the time for that.

296
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,600
I think I have to wait
until she receives this

297
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,977
with a pleasant heart.

298
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,941
So take this without worry.

299
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,152
I am fine.

300
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,474
I will go buy an umbrella.

301
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,851
Please wait a minute here.

302
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,339
Yeong, you've never
gotten rained on, have you?

303
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,009
Have you, Mother?

304
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,472
I have, like this green grass

305
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,349
in the rain.

306
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,567
Why? Do you not like it?

307
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,611
It's not that I don't like it,

308
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,364
but I do not have clogs or umbrella

309
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,157
as it is raining so suddenly.

310
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,326
So this is a very good opportunity.

311
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,127
Mother!

312
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,348
You are the Queen

313
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,308
and I am the Crown Prince.

314
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,477
How can we get in the rain
without anything to cover?

315
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,521
Why do we have to do that?

316
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,064
Pardon?

317
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,400
Why do the Queen and the Crown Prince

318
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,152
need so many things all the time?

319
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,948
Is it against the law
if we get rained on barefoot?

320
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,157
Does anyone say that?

321
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,865
It will stop soon.

322
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,243
You can wait.

323
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,747
Pardon?

324
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,502
It is fun to play in the rain,

325
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,046
but the cold lasts long.

326
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,008
Don't you think so?

327
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,680
I agree.

328
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,324
Your Highness?

329
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,164
Are you traveling in disguise?

330
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,251
Are you not aware?

331
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,005
The moment I get recognized,
I'm not traveling in disguise anymore.

332
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,049
I'm sorry.

333
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,762
I couldn’t just ignore you
since I’m with company.

334
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,181
She's with you?

335
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,561
Are you from the palace?

336
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,729
Show your face.

337
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
She is

338
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,615
my beloved, Your Highness.

339
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,501
She is a bit startled since she
met Your Highness unexpectedly.

340
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,010
I get it. One wouldn’t want
to meet a Royal Family

341
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,178
outside the palace.

342
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,309
Whoever that is, tell her I'm leaving.

343
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,061
And that I am no ghost.

344
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,606
There is no need to be scared.

345
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,766
The Qing Dynasty’s permission is needed

346
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,685
for Your Highness’s appoint as regent.

347
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:24,233
That’s right. They’re probably going to
make me look bad,

348
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,611
so it will be denied.

349
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,156
Just be obedient.

350
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,828
The Qing Dynasty would have no reason
to refuse then.

351
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,626
I do not wish things to be that way.

352
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,504
I want Joseon to become even with them.

353
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,006
But in reality...

354
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,596
there are enemies even on the inside
that needs to be dealt with first.

355
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,100
Like Premier Kim.

356
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,145
The best option...

357
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,612
would be to kill him off.

358
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,994
So the last one standing

359
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,829
wins the war?

360
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,503
If I knew you were going to
give me that kind of advice

361
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,381
I should’ve just hired an assassin
instead of meeting you.

362
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,758
It was wrong of me to come here.

363
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,469
I'll get going.

364
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,349
I’m sorry to have wasted your time.
Your Highness.

365
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,435
Farewell.

366
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,857
Although...

367
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,447
When I said, “killing”
I didn’t mean it literally.

368
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,661
There are many ways to lure the enemy

369
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,955
to their own destruction.

370
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,885
OFFICE OF MUSIC, INSTRUMENT STORAGE

371
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,978
What brings you here this late at night,
Your Highness?

372
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,899
There are many ways to lure the enemy

373
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,318
to their own destruction.

374
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,488
Indeed.

375
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,157
There is no need to draw out a sword.

376
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,701
I will lure them

377
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,995
with songs and dances.

378
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,259
I cannot believe my eyes!

379
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,597
Why are all these kisaeng
roaming around the palace?

380
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,644
The Crown Prince

381
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,396
gathered them from all over the country.

382
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,234
His Highness is acting rather reckless

383
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,779
since he took responsibility for the
40th birthday banquet preparation.

384
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,865
The situation is only going to get worse.

385
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,409
It cannot be overlooked.

386
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,128
For the solo dance in the end...

387
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,840
I will leave it to Ae-sim.

388
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,638
Pass around the choreography papers.

389
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,394
Hong Sam-nom.

390
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,521
From now on,

391
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,482
you must never leave my side

392
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,360
and record everything regarding
the preparation.

393
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,821
Do you understand?

394
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,781
Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,911
What?

396
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,619
That's not it.

397
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,082
Wrong! Again!

398
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,669
Again.

399
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,342
Get up.

400
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,429
Get...

401
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,523
I'm sure you know the importance
of the last performance

402
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,525
that you will partake in.

403
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,361
Of course, Your Highness.

404
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,537
That’s enough for today.

405
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,456
You may be excused.

406
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,458
Yes, Your Highness.

407
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,044
Your Highness...

408
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,424
Comfort her!

409
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,768
What a delightful sight.

410
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,813
If the Crown Prince holds more power

411
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,483
the palace will be full of kisaeng.

412
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,529
Go tell my father that
there is no need to worry.

413
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,740
Just tell him to enjoy the show

414
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,828
when the Qing Dynasty’s envoys are here.

415
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,675
Your Highness.

416
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,596
So we are supposed to
slowly count up to 50

417
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,224
after Ae-sim’s solo dance, right?

418
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,892
That’s right.

419
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,104
It will be silent without any music.

420
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,065
Is there a specific reason for doing that?

421
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,569
You'll find out.

422
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,114
The real show will start then.

423
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,830
What are you doing there, anyway?

424
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,373
Me?

425
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,253
I was ordered to draw the choreography,
Your Highness.

426
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,838
So.

427
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,008
What are you drawing now?

428
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,469
You’re supposed to copy this book.

429
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,681
I don’t need to see that.
At least not yet.

430
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,561
You’re saying you memorized everything?

431
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,899
That's right.
I may not be very good at studying

432
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,402
But when it comes to dancing,
I’m a genius.

433
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,822
You’re bluffing. Give me that!

434
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,748
This is...

435
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,211
You really memorized all this
at one glance?

436
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,148
Are you awake, Your Highness?

437
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,782
Your Highness?

438
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,287
What was that? Is that the new signal?

439
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,538
Your Highness!

440
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,374
Are you awake?

441
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,959
Your...

442
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,630
I'm coming in, Your Highness.

443
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,673
No. No!

444
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,347
Your...

445
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,898
I will sleep for a little longer.

446
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,317
Come back in an hour.

447
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,655
Yes, Your Highness!

448
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,311
You get scared easily for a boy.

449
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,422
Oh, Chief Kim. Did you
sleep well last night?

450
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,636
If you're wondering why I didn't
come back last night...

451
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,556
Geez, don't remind me.

452
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,309
That Silver Spoon

453
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,020
made me do so much work last night.

454
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,356
It's true!

455
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,692
I worked all night long.

456
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,694
I didn't ask.

457
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,112
Pardon?

458
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,449
You didn't, did you?

459
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,868
Do your best to help him.

460
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,454
The Royal Banquet is important
to His Highness.

461
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,334
He's probably having a hard time because
so many are trying to bring him down.

462
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,712
But, this is His Majesty's
birthday banquet.

463
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,464
Who are those people?

464
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,965
There are some people

465
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,509
who are ready to pounce

466
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,095
as soon as one little thing goes wrong.

467
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,897
Are the preparations
for the envoys going smoothly?

468
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,983
I studied to become a Eunuch
at the training institute

469
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,735
in the Qing Dynasty.

470
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,363
I made sure to prepare
everything from the bedding

471
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,948
to food ingredients

472
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,368
according to the envoys' preferences.

473
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,870
Your confidence makes me
even more worried.

474
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,291
He's here.

475
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,965
Welcome Envoy Mok.

476
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,636
Thank you for coming all this way.

477
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:45,474
You haven't changed at all
since the last time we met.

478
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,312
The Emperor ordered me to
come here as an envoy.

479
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,775
Shouldn't Joseon language be
a basic knowledge for a diplomat?

480
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,902
Why, yes.

481
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,615
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

482
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,534
Welcome.

483
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,496
Thank you for coming all this way.
Please follow me.

484
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,332
Right this way.

485
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,044
You are incredible.

486
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,882
Right before your performance
is supposed to begin,

487
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,093
I'll have a palanquin waiting
for you at the back door.

488
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,472
Sneak out of Jagyeong Palace
without anyone noticing

489
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,474
and get in the palanquin.

490
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,517
Pardon?

491
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,563
If I ruin the banquet,
I won't get out of this alive.

492
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,525
I heard you became a kisaeng because
you're the breadwinner of your household.

493
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,278
Do you

494
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,281
want me to get rid of your family

495
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,700
who is only a burden to you?

496
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,666
The performance will begin soon.
Are you ready?

497
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,959
-Yes.
-Yes.

498
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,864
What?

499
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,784
How did that happen?

500
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,369
I'll go look for her.

501
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,462
What's the matter?

502
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,256
Well...

503
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,716
The solo dance is supposed to start soon

504
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,510
but the dancer is nowhere to be found.

505
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,803
What did you say?

506
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,223
I can't believe this is happening
at such a serious event.

507
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,684
I might lose my head for this.

508
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,645
That won't happen. I'll look for her, too.

509
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,189
Yes, My Lord. I'll...

510
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,828
Oh my, Eunuch Hong!

511
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,663
You're slyer than you look.

512
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,540
He barged in here without a sound.

513
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,750
I wonder what he was so curious about.

514
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,461
You've misunderstood.
I'm looking for the dancer.

515
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,130
The solo dancer for the last performance.

516
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,090
-Ae-sim?
-That's right.

517
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,217
She was here just a moment ago.

518
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,385
Where...

519
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,762
Isn't this Ae-sim's outfit
for the performance?

520
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

521
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,265
It is, isn't it?

522
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,537
Get up.

523
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,918
I'm sure you know the importance
of the last performance

524
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,046
that you will partake in.

525
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,591
Do your best to help him.

526
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,177
This is very important to him.

527
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,180
He's probably having a hard time
because there are many

528
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,806
who are trying to bring him down.

529
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,060
But, this is His Majesty's
birthday banquet.

530
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,645
Who are those people?

531
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,146
There are some people

532
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,649
who are ready to pounce

533
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,068
as soon as one little thing goes wrong.

534
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,526
The Crown Prince has prepared
the banquet for several days,

535
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,446
but there seems to be a problem
in organizing it.

536
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,990
There is music, but no dancers.

537
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,493
That is what I am saying.

538
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:43,540
It is because he is not experienced.
Please generously forgive him.

539
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,292
It is interesting.

540
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,505
I wonder if the Crown Prince
of Joseon is a man of great caliber.

541
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,549
I will watch it to the end.

542
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:42,200
You are the Queen
and I am the Crown Prince.

543
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,286
Why do we have to do that?

544
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:48,415
Is it against the law
if we get rained on barefoot?

545
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,088
This is for His Majesty.

546
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,591
The Crown Prince will read
the congratulatory message.

547
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,901
It is such a joyous day today.

548
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,862
For today, I prepared the rite
and musicians.

549
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:47,117
I am truly happy that I could present
this for you, Your Majesty.

550
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,496
So, with all the people's loyal hearts,

551
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,873
Thus, I shall give someone
the honor to give the speech.

552
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,005
Chief State Councilor, Kim Heon.

553
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,217
Come forth and accept this honor.

554
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,119
It will be silent without any music.

555
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,496
Is there a specific reason for doing that?

556
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,415
You'll find out.

557
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,293
The real show will start then.

558
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,258
Who is going to perform it?

559
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,595
There is someone.

560
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,725
A clown who cannot even imagine
he is going to perform it.

561
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,770
CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE

562
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,702
"It has been 30 years
since the King started his rule.

563
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,790
It is his 40th birthday today.

564
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,544
I wish him to live long until Mongmyeoksan
wears out and disappears.

565
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,715
The subjects notice
that the royal face looks pleasant.

566
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:31,262
We cannot look up to the royal
throne as it is so high.

567
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,601
We are grateful for the King's grace
and exclaim this.

568
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,938
As the sole light of the East,

569
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,982
may he be well like today

570
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,610
forever and ever."

571
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,252
This banquet is not for drinking
and having fun.

572
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,046
What are we going to do now?

573
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,299
It is an official ceremony with
an envoy from Qing Dynasty.

574
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,760
Everyone is pledging his loyalty
to the King.

575
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,305
He cannot justify himself
if he denies doing so.

576
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,683
The Crown Prince got him.

577
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,936
He got him just right.

578
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:25,316
Long live the King!

579
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,737
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

580
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:34,868
Long live the King!

581
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:39,080
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

582
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:44,085
Long live the King!

583
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,838
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

584
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,727
Who are you?
