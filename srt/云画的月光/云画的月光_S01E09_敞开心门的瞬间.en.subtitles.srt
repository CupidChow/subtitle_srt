1
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,021
Did you already know?

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,817
Yes.

3
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,155
Did you know then too?

4
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,576
At the flower garden?

5
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,796
Did you not say anything

6
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,216
to make a fool out of me?

7
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,016
JAHYEONDANG

8
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,896
Hong Sam-nom.

9
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,483
She's in the palace now.

10
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,029
She was sold off to the palace
because of her debt.

11
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,124
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,585
However,

13
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,713
it wasn't because I thought less of you.

14
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,053
First, I was annoyed.

15
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,264
But then, I was in joy. After that...

16
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,227
Well, I just couldn't say it.

17
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,823
When I was seated in a palanquin,

18
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,325
you walked on foot.

19
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,328
When I walked,

20
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,998
you followed holding the heavy parasol.

21
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,170
I sit on silk

22
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,882
when you sit on dirt and soil.

23
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,428
How could I tell you
that I liked you as a woman?

24
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,942
I'm a eunuch
who must attend to your needs.

25
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,945
I was doing my job.

26
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,661
However,

27
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,581
it's not how a man should treat his lady.

28
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,758
Now,

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,721
I'll treat you
as the most precious woman in the world.

30
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,977
I'll block the wind

31
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,980
and sun for you.

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,442
I will treasure you.

33
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,113
Could I do so?

34
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,484
That's right.

35
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,863
I am a woman.

36
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
However,

37
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,998
I've never lived as one.

38
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,087
You can from this day on.

39
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,717
No.

40
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,973
I shouldn't be here.

41
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,185
I'm sorry for doing something

42
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,104
I shouldn't do.

43
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,982
I was a disservice to you--

44
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,734
I'm not blaming you.

45
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,195
I'm blaming me for not realizing sooner.

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,613
-So--
-Your Highness.

47
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm needed back at the office.

48
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,999
I should get going.

49
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,311
JAHYEONDANG

50
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,281
Now,

51
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,285
I'll treat you
as the most precious woman in the world.

52
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,500
That's right.

53
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,879
I am a woman.

54
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,174
However,

55
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,845
I've never lived as one.

56
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,440
JAHYEONDANG

57
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,294
It's said that Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter
is alive somewhere in the capital.

58
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,004
If that's true,

59
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,590
we need to find her

60
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,759
before Premier Kim does.

61
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,304
We need to find her first.

62
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,141
She'll be the glue
that brings the group together.

63
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,602
What would you say that for?

64
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,687
You know I like you the most.

65
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,758
JAHYEONDANG

66
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,364
Chief Kim, you seem worried.

67
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm not.

68
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,038
But I have a question.

69
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,209
Ask away.

70
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,381
What did you do
before you became an eunuch?

71
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,634
Didn't I already tell you?

72
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,511
I was a wandering performer.

73
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,346
What about before that?

74
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,599
I lived with my mother.

75
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,811
What about your father?

76
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,608
I heard he passed away.

77
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,278
It was when I was little.

78
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,447
I don't even know his name.

79
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,993
That's why

80
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,454
I only remember my mother.

81
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,417
It must've been tough.

82
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,840
Why are you suddenly asking about my past?

83
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,134
Do you still

84
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,722
like it at the palace?

85
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,989
Sam-nom.

86
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,700
What's this rubbish you're speaking of?

87
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,953
We're busy as it is
now that the prince is too.

88
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,623
I apologize.

89
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,959
I guess you stuck around long enough.

90
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,171
Can't you take it anymore?
Do you wish to be transferred?

91
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,966
What? We can't leave his spot vacant
without the prince's approval.

92
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,094
I'd love a chance to fill that vacancy.

93
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,013
Could I get a taste of it too?

94
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,515
You clueless bunch of idiots.

95
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,434
At his first assembly,

96
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,437
none of the government officials attended.

97
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,442
See? What did I tell you?

98
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,571
I told you that becoming a regent could

99
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,698
lead to his demise.

100
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,325
Eunuch Seong!

101
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,497
You heard him.

102
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,668
Your behavior can also
bring disgrace to our prince.

103
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,755
I'll keep that in mind.

104
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,592
Your Majesty!

105
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,303
The regular examination
taken every three years

106
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:23,182
is the only opportunity
for scholars to achieve fame and prestige.

107
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,143
Please let us take it as per schedule

108
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,313
and have us display
what we've been studying.

109
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,191
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

110
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,111
-Please reconsider!
-Please reconsider!

111
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,406
The scholars who have been
studying for the exam are devastated.

112
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,241
Can't you feel that?

113
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,119
Crown Prince,

114
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,539
is there not a way to console them?

115
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,917
We opened up the path.

116
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,837
The door at the end should be opened too.

117
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,968
How can it be fair if the results
are already decided?

118
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,178
Your Highness...

119
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,514
Do not forget

120
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,435
that your decision effects
many people’s future.

121
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,112
CROWN PRINCE'S PALACE

122
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
I haven’t seen Eunuch Hong in a while.

123
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,009
I have been wondering that myself.

124
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,554
You used to be so nice to him.

125
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,514
What made you change?

126
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,810
Is he deliberately not coming here,
because of me?

127
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,437
Seems so.

128
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,190
He’s busy running around elsewhere

129
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,358
volunteering to do grunt work.

130
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,737
So...

131
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,656
where is he now?

132
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,202
Go hide.
I’ll go find you after counting to ten!

133
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,371
One...

134
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,957
Your Highness.

135
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,920
Are you out of paper and ink?

136
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,964
I brought more.

137
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,720
I see you’re playing hide and seek.

138
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,933
I can wait here. Go hide!

139
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,602
I’m coming now!

140
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,814
Your highness, please come out.

141
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,734
Where are you, Your Highness?

142
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,790
Eunuch Jang told me everything.

143
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
You were planning to run away?

144
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,093
Yes.

145
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,264
Can I ask why?

146
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,810
I deceived everyone in the palace.

147
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,356
And you found out about everything…

148
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,859
I don’t know what to do.

149
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,613
I just can’t…

150
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,492
Can’t you see?

151
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,204
I just want you to take a step,
get closer.

152
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,915
Not as a eunuch, but as yourself.

153
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,295
Your Highness,
you’re the one who can’t see.

154
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,924
How can I...

155
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,011
a sinner, who deceived so many people

156
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,224
make another excuse to stay by your side

157
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,935
other than being a eunuch?

158
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,981
That is...

159
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,863
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

160
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,116
Your Highness!

161
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,744
You’re still searching?

162
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,747
I asked Her Highness to come out
many times

163
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,041
but she won’t come out.

164
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,961
Where did you see her last?

165
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,547
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness!

166
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,340
-Your Highness!
-Please come out!

167
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,134
Your Highness!

168
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,802
Your Highness!

169
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,555
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness...

170
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,312
Your Highness.

171
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,626
Your Highness?

172
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,806
Your Highness! This is Eunuch Hong!

173
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,767
Your Highness!

174
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,381
Your Highness! Your Highness...

175
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,842
Are you okay, Your Highness?

176
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,391
It must have been terrifying for her.

177
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,977
She couldn’t even cry out for help...

178
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,067
At least Eunuch Hong was able to find her.

179
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,027
I am so relieved...

180
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,617
She used to be a chatty kid

181
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,537
before...

182
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,000
The most frustrated one

183
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,253
would be herself.

184
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,133
At least she got much better

185
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,053
after you taught her
how to write, and read letters.

186
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,811
THREE YEARS AGO

187
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,408
I am only going to write it once,
so guess what it is.

188
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,619
This time

189
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,706
I’m going to write your favorite season.

190
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,444
She still

191
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,989
doesn’t remember anything about that day?

192
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,992
No.

193
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,040
It must have been too painful for her
to endure the fever for days.

194
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,376
Maybe she decided to erase the memory

195
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,087
to protect herself...

196
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,101
Yun-seong.

197
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,898
Where do you think you’re heading?

198
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,067
The palace.

199
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,694
The palace, you say?

200
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,366
Don’t you know everybody has been
avoiding the palace

201
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,409
to teach the Crown Prince a lesson?

202
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,537
That’s exactly why I’m going.

203
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,999
How dare you!

204
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,460
Yun-seong...

205
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,762
Are you worried about His Highness
as a friend?

206
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,016
I believe His Highness
made the right choice.

207
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,310
I see.

208
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,522
You may think that way now.
That it’s right to be fair.

209
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,606
However

210
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,944
being fair, is not always the best
for the people.

211
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,033
I’m afraid I cannot agree with that.

212
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,496
The growth of our family

213
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,416
has nothing to do with
making people’s lives better.

214
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,168
If there are two strong parties

215
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,671
do you think they’ll be well balanced?

216
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,799
No, both will always fight over power.

217
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,345
Politicians must not be in
an equal relationship with the people.

218
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,265
They must hold on to the power

219
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,767
and lead the people from above.

220
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,103
Is that the reason why I have to marry

221
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,148
the Minister of Public Administration’s
daughter?

222
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,650
That is right.

223
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,321
I refuse to do that.

224
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,407
Please revoke that decision.

225
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,620
I wish to marry someone I like.
I don’t want my marriage

226
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,415
to be a part of some power game.

227
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,546
Then I’ll be going, Grandfather.

228
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,571
Her Highness saw me visit
the bookstore in Unjongga

229
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,448
so many times

230
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,493
that she lent me some books
for me to read.

231
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,997
You love to read, so I’ve heard.

232
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,712
But that’s not the only reason why

233
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,381
I visit the palace.

234
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,176
What do you mean?

235
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,887
That person I mentioned before...

236
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,224
He is here, in the palace.

237
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,769
You’re actually very close to him.

238
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,113
It’s the Crown Prince!

239
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,053
Why aren't you saying anything?

240
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,638
Did I catch you off guard?

241
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,935
Yes, I guess I'm a little surprised.

242
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,273
He would only nonchalantly
give me short answers though.

243
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,901
I'm tired of coming up with more excuses.

244
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,046
That. I remember seeing it.

245
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,721
When shared by two people,

246
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,640
it will bring them together again someday.

247
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:42,272
I didn't know it held such a meaning.

248
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,484
You received a gift
not knowing what it means?

249
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,406
Whoever it is,
she must be as reckless as I am.

250
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,618
It takes quite a woman
to give this to a man.

251
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,852
Now,

252
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,648
I'll treat you
as the most precious woman in the world.

253
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,654
There. Try this.

254
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,657
I'm good at this.

255
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,784
It's your turn.

256
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,926
How long do I have to be a boy?

257
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,137
Keep your voice down.

258
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,848
Until I'm ten? 20?

259
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,642
Until I die?

260
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,270
Ra-on.

261
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,814
Now is not the time.

262
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,984
I told you to wait a while longer.

263
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,861
But what for?

264
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,281
When will I know why?

265
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,242
Will I actually die not knowing?

266
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,573
I see you heard that
the royal court is a mess.

267
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,993
That's right.

268
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,996
You canceled the scheduled examination.

269
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,999
Scholars from around the country

270
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,295
start and end the day
swearing and cussing at you.

271
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,963
That's what I hear.

272
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,804
Will you still hold
the special examination as planned?

273
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,598
SPECIAL EXAMINATION:
AN EXAM HELD BY THE KING

274
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,767
The battle has begun.

275
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,729
You'd look weak to back down now.

276
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,109
This is what my grandfather used to say.

277
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,279
"Argue with your spouse
with an intention to win,

278
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,990
and you'll be the demise of your family."

279
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,284
That's what he said.

280
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,580
What does that have to do with anything?

281
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,749
Your initial goal was

282
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,043
to rectify the errors of the state exam

283
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,796
and appoint outstanding individuals.

284
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,925
But what about now?

285
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,345
What's your goal?

286
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,807
Is it to win

287
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,226
or is it to make a difference?

288
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,187
Well...

289
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,278
Following your initial goal is never easy.

290
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,182
Princess Yeongeun, it's Eunuch Hong.

291
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,895
I came here to talk about me,

292
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,273
so you can tell me to leave.

293
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,611
When you don't feel like talking,

294
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,031
you can always communicate with me
with your hands.

295
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,285
Do this when you agree

296
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,828
and do this...

297
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,549
Forget about it.

298
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,095
You don't have to answer
any of my questions.

299
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,264
You see,

300
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,145
I have a lot of secrets too.

301
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,030
I don't know what's bothering you,

302
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,242
but I think I can understand how you feel.

303
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,915
I do because

304
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,960
I feel trapped too.

305
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,423
While forced to stay hidden,

306
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,760
I live in worry that

307
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,387
someone might open the door

308
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,350
and figure out who I am.

309
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,650
When will we be able

310
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,780
to open the door and
come out of our hiding places?

311
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,623
What's it like to be back here,
Premier Kim?

312
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,669
Every office is on emergency duty,

313
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,463
but it's awfully quiet here.

314
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,968
Did you summon me to ask how I feel?

315
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,138
I will hold
the regular examination as scheduled,

316
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,392
so please attend the assembly.

317
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,563
Do you mean it?

318
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,940
Why would I lie?

319
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,612
I only suggested the special examination

320
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,739
to tell apart

321
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,284
the outstanding individuals
as it's supposed to.

322
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,163
It wasn't my intention to cause trouble
with the government officials.

323
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,667
Your Highness.

324
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,461
Only thinking of your goal

325
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,756
and making ends meet
with temporary solutions

326
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,301
can never be an appropriate measure.

327
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,096
If you're willing to make wiser choices

328
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,974
and adhere to principle,

329
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,728
the officials will join you
at the assembly

330
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,522
and assist you in any way they can.

331
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,025
Don't worry.

332
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,404
I will do what the officials want
and hold the state exam

333
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,989
adhering to principle.

334
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,586
Here is your test!

335
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,591
WHO DOES JOSEON BELONG TO?

336
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,518
Wait...

337
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,903
All rise for the Crown Prince.

338
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,228
Here is your test!

339
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,699
Is this a joke?

340
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,454
How will you persuade one
who objects just to object?

341
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,586
There's no right answer.

342
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,216
Just persuade me with your own words.

343
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,973
I will await desperately
for the fresh and various thoughts

344
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,267
that will brighten Joseon's future.

345
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,979
You will begin.

346
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,886
You've been

347
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,598
able to avoid me wherever I am.

348
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,394
You know me better than anyone else.

349
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,356
If you are really determined
to hide from me

350
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,067
I won't be able to find you.

351
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,279
Many watch your every move

352
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,282
and listen to everything you say.

353
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,993
If you're with me,

354
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,372
you'll never be able to feel at ease.

355
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,415
Then how about this?

356
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,961
I'll be just as frustrated

357
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,381
if I'm not with you.

358
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,263
Your Highness

359
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,308
when I served you an a eunuch

360
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,354
I felt like I was able to be of help

361
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,107
even if it was just a little bit.

362
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,860
However

363
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,822
everything is different, now.

364
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,242
I’m scared.

365
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,204
What if I cause you trouble

366
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,499
or hurt you

367
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,044
in any way

368
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,049
by trying to get closer to you?

369
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,411
I know it’s a lot to ask

370
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,289
but if you allow me to leave the palace

371
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,127
I will forever be in your grace.

372
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,465
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

373
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,803
Are you sure that is what you want?

374
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,890
Do you mean it?

375
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,103
Yes.

376
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,689
I can move mountains for you.

377
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,400
I have thousands of things
that I want to do for you.

378
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,488
But this is what you're asking me to do?

379
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,701
You’re asking me to let you leave,
so you can run away from me

380
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,329
and live elsewhere
for the rest of your life?

381
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,379
Yes.

382
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,519
Fine.

383
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,189
You may be excused.

384
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,907
THREE YEARS AGO

385
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
Someone’s coming?

386
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,027
What were you trying to give
the Crown Prince?

387
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,030
Why do you ask?

388
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,867
Do you have something you need to hide?

389
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,537
If you think killing me

390
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,706
will stop the truth from being revealed

391
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,835
then go ahead!

392
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,951
Even

393
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,245
if I die...

394
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,414
I well never

395
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,833
leave this place.

396
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,919
I will reveal...

397
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,300
what really happened...

398
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,012
to the Queen.

399
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,348
I will...

400
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,932
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

401
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,017
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness...

402
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,788
What? Is she okay?

403
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,791
Yes, Your Highness. She is doing okay.

404
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,126
I need to see her.

405
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,218
By the way

406
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,888
why did you go there, Your Highness?

407
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,232
There’s no need to answer,
if you don’t feel like it.

408
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,485
I was just wondering, that is all.

409
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,844
You once asked me,

410
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,556
"When will we be able

411
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,851
to open the door and
come out of our hiding places?"

412
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,935
I should have...

413
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,567
pretended not to know.

414
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,240
I was not aware that you wanted

415
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,201
to run away from me.

416
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,788
If I knew that beforehand...

417
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,751
I wouldn’t have debated with myself,
about what I should treat you as.

418
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,632
I would have just...

419
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,968
wanted you...

420
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,556
to stay by my side, as long as possible.

421
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,529
I guess I was being too selfish.

422
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,657
I apologize.

423
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,374
Good night, Your Highness.

424
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,219
But even so...

425
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,355
won’t you consider

426
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,484
staying by my side?

427
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,617
Don’t go anywhere else.

428
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,079
Stay here.

429
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,834
For me.

430
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,659
You’ve come such a long way, Young Master.

431
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,454
Passing the state exam!
This is truly a miracle.

432
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,748
Dal-bong.

433
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,210
I don’t know if I can do this without you.

434
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,421
You just have to avoid one person.
The mongmyeoksan...

435
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:44,551
Her, Her Highness doesn’t know my face.

436
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,929
It'll be, It'll be fine.

437
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,598
You need to be, be careful at all times.

438
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,850
Okay, okay.

439
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,436
Give me a hug.

440
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,607
-You go this way...
-I’ll go...

441
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,150
-That way...
-Here...

442
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,610
-So you...
-Okay...

443
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,673
-Your Highness!
-Are, are you alright?

444
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,605
I'm fine.

445
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,786
I feel like I have seen her before.

446
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:56,957
She doesn't seem lovely at all
with her harsh angles.

447
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,877
A lady should be as gracious as

448
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,672
Princess Myeongeun.

449
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,466
-What is wrong with you?
-I'm off.

450
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,385
Sir...

451
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,431
The examination was a success.

452
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,185
You changed the questions
on the day of the exam

453
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,646
and provided the final policy question.

454
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,607
POLICY QUESTION:
EQUIVALENT TO A MODERN-DAY ESSAY

455
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,735
Even with all the changes I made,

456
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,487
seven out of 33 who passed

457
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,990
were from your family.

458
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,079
Your family was able to turn out
so many talents fair and square.

459
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,456
I'm impressed.

460
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,002
To hear you highly praise my family

461
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,630
makes me shed tears of gratitude.

462
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,383
I'll make you a promise.

463
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,261
From this day forward,

464
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,430
I will adhere to principle,

465
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,600
not tolerate expediency or corruption,

466
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,602
and appoint only those

467
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,521
who show skill and talent.

468
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,833
Did all the officials
return to their places?

469
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,294
Yes, Your Majesty.

470
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,172
They all

471
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,717
made an appearance for today's assemblies.

472
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,511
SANGCHAM, JOGYE, YUNDAE:
TYPES OF AUDIENCES

473
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,054
That's good to hear.

474
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,598
Chief Eunuch,

475
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,019
why do you think I became such

476
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,437
an incompetent king?

477
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,276
It's because I had no one.

478
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,320
I had no one to help me.

479
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,284
I'm truly sorry, sir.

480
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,621
No one in this palace is

481
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,665
truly on my side.

482
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,669
No one from the council, or the ministry.

483
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,838
Not even those of the three offices.

484
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,924
They're all loyal to Premier Kim.

485
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,932
I can't let my son be of the same fate.

486
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,727
We need someone.

487
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,812
Someone that is loyal to him.

488
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,901
Chief Eunuch.

489
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,700
Prepare a royal marriage
for the crown prince.

490
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,333
Princess, where are we going?

491
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,918
Princess?

492
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,301
Princess!

493
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,894
I appreciate the written and
spoken language you taught me,

494
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,897
but I like Eunuch Hong's signs even more.

495
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,401
When everyone learns
of the signs you agreed on,

496
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,403
you'll no longer need these notes.

497
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,324
We'll be able to communicate
even without them.

498
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,578
Could you teach them to me?

499
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,879
I...

500
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,882
like...

501
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,387
you.

502
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,187
Actually,

503
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,899
I love you.

504
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,122
So please...

505
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,854
What can be the sign that tells someone

506
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,522
to not leave?

507
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,115
How about this? Here.

508
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,038
Don't leave.

509
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,165
Don't leave.

510
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,089
And stay by my side.

511
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,637
And stay by my side.

512
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,306
Your Highness.

513
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,142
What do you mean by this?

514
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,148
I'm telling you to give me space.

515
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,858
Yes, of course.

516
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,396
When will we be able

517
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,401
to open the door and
come out of our hiding places?

518
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,120
But what for?

519
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,456
When will I know why?

520
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,209
Until I'm ten? 20?

521
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,920
Until I die?

522
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,475
Until you're able
to take care of yourself.

523
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,063
When you're old enough
to not need me anymore.

524
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,318
You can live as a girl then.

525
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,583
Won’t you consider

526
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,669
staying by my side?

527
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,632
Don’t go anywhere else.

528
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,135
Stay here.

529
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,848
For me.

530
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,895
Mom,

531
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,439
aren't I strong enough now?

532
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,484
I've made it through

533
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,362
the 10 years you've been gone.

534
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,325
I'm now strong enough to look after

535
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,244
myself.

536
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,732
My Lady,

537
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,485
what should I call you?

538
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,200
I'm Hong Ra-on,

539
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,368
Your Highness.

540
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,082
Hong Ra-on...

541
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,054
Ra-on.
