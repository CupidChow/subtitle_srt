1
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,656
I tried to hide my feelings from everyone.

2
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,659
That's what I thought I had to do

3
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,787
to keep you by my side.

4
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,919
Is it wrong to confess your love
to someone you can never be with?

5
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,797
You must love someone dearly

6
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,383
to be able to let that person go
for their own good.

7
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,511
Who knows

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,931
if the memory of being loved

9
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,184
can give you the strength to carry on?

10
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,617
This robe you're wearing
does not suit you either.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,748
Do you not wish to live as a woman?

12
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,763
Because of what you said,
I decided to muster up my courage

13
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,183
although confessing my love to you

14
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,394
could put me in danger
or make me lose you.

15
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,358
Don't tell me I shouldn't feel this way
about you.

16
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,655
You told me before

17
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,408
that nobody can say it is wrong

18
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,453
to have feelings for someone.

19
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,872
Pardon?

20
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,502
I've already decided to love you

21
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,089
even if it is wrong.

22
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,564
Did something happen?

23
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,485
Chief Kim.

24
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,361
Don't you think you're being rude?

25
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,989
-What did I do?
-I mean,

26
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,408
it's rude to ask that question...

27
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,911
when nothing happened.

28
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,414
Really?

29
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,041
I'm sorry.

30
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,960
Chief Kim.

31
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,380
Can I...

32
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,925
ask you a question?

33
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,301
What is it?

34
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,929
From what I heard,

35
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,973
the person whom His Highness
cherishes the most

36
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,391
is you,

37
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,269
followed by Eunuch Jang.

38
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,189
So...

39
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:44,112
has he ever loved a woman before?

40
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,200
Ever? At all?

41
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,326
No.

42
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,953
Not even once.

43
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,416
No?

44
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,961
Not even once?

45
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,718
I'm thinking of allowing you
to leave the palace.

46
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,180
I'll get rid of all records of you.

47
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,015
Would you like to leave here
and live together?

48
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,519
Yes, Your Highness.

49
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,733
If you go to this place,
they'll find you a place to live and work.

50
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,612
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,325
Thank you for teaching me

52
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,496
that true love can create miracles.

53
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,043
I hope you live a long
and happy life together.

54
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,338
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

55
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,264
Eunuch Ma.

56
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,809
You have to live a happy
life together, okay?

57
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,396
You're the 30th couple I have helped.

58
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,773
Don't worry about
helping other people fall in love,

59
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,942
and take a good look around.

60
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,986
There is not just one, but two people.

61
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
Can't you see?

62
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,918
That is the list of the item writers and
the test takers who passed

63
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,836
in the last ten years.

64
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,299
The ones who wrote the questions
are from the Kim family,

65
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,510
and the ones who passed the exam
are from the Kim family.

66
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,221
They're all from the Kim family.

67
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,558
How interesting.

68
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,230
These are the exam questions

69
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,689
and answers.

70
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,317
EXAM QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

71
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,827
How did they pass the exam
with such typical answers?

72
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,039
But then again...

73
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,500
what they wrote didn't really matter.

74
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,919
You can easily pass the exam

75
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,296
if you're from a prestigious family.

76
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,424
What are your thoughts on this?

77
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,219
Do you want to know my thoughts as a Kim

78
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,638
or as the Chief of the Ministry of Rites?

79
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,934
I guess your answer
depends on such factors.

80
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,563
As a Kim, I must accept the reproach,

81
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,523
but as the Chief of Ministry of Rites,

82
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,983
I must work hard to correct this.

83
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,318
Do you mean that?

84
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,445
If I said yes,

85
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,573
would you believe me?

86
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,245
You'd be in trouble
if Premier Kim heard this.

87
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,665
I'll take a look at this. You may go.

88
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,158
Eunuch Hong.

89
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,202
Can you spare me some time?

90
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
Pardon?

91
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,958
-I am...
-Sam-nom, come here.

92
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,338
Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,677
Thank you, sir.

94
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,200
You're right.

95
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,744
Being a eunuch

96
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,330
doesn't suit me.

97
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,086
I should leave the palace
as soon as possible.

98
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,714
And?

99
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,177
I...

100
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,057
I don't want to leave.

101
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,022
It's strange.

102
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,568
No matter how much I think about it,
I come to the same conclusion.

103
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,280
I...

104
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,283
want to stay here a little longer.

105
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,666
My apologies, sir.

106
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,754
I'm curious to know

107
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,384
what has made you take the risk

108
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,304
and stay here.

109
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,614
So, you are saying
you are going to the temple

110
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,032
to lose weight, right?

111
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,701
Yes.

112
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,996
They say if I eat as the chief monk
tells me to for 15 days,

113
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,372
I'll lose so much weight

114
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,667
and my face will shrink in half.

115
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,545
Who told you that?

116
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,131
Is it trustworthy?

117
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,467
THE JOSEON LOVE STORY WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

118
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,636
I heard it from the one
who wrote this book.

119
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,182
The author knows everything
about love and relationships.

120
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,186
Can I...

121
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,733
borrow this book?

122
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,826
How may I help you, Your Highness?

123
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,080
It's said that Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter
is alive somewhere in the capital.

124
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,126
Have you heard the rumor?

125
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,087
I haven't, Your Highness.

126
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,215
One word from Premier Kim

127
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,343
has worsened my father's anxiety.

128
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
This mask

129
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,020
is just like the one we saw

130
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,813
at Premier Kim's feast.
You remember, right?

131
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,484
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,528
I need you to look into this.

133
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,156
Find out who they are and if it's true

134
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,283
that they are looking for
Hong Gyeong-rae's daughter.

135
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,701
If so, find out why.

136
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,957
Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,792
If it's true,

138
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
we must find her

139
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,631
before Premier Kim does.

140
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,409
It's heavy. Give it to me.

141
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,743
No, Your Highness.

142
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,997
This is my duty, Your Highness.

143
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,791
People are watching, Your Highness.

144
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,715
All right.

145
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,509
I am fine with being out in the sun,
so put it away.

146
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,512
Your Highness.

147
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,308
The sun is blazing,
so please stay in the shade.

148
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,728
I'm okay, Your Highness.

149
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,898
As a man, I should be able to
carry something like this with ease.

150
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,116
-Hun-nam.
-Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,618
I like the breeze,

152
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,078
so I'm going to take a nap over here.
Don't wake me up.

153
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,955
Yes, Your Highness.

154
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,417
And you, hold this properly.

155
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,210
Understood?

156
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,656
Your hands are small,

157
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,533
but why are they so rough?

158
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,120
That's how all men's hands are.

159
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
Right.

160
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,585
Your eyes, nose, and lips

161
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,296
are those of a manly man.

162
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,423
I fell for...

163
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,843
your manliness.

164
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,513
Pardon?

165
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,561
I fear someone may hear, Your Highness.

166
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,231
Please take back

167
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,774
what you said to me.

168
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,276
You should never take back
what you've said.

169
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,531
You should take responsibility for it.

170
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,221
Take some rest.

171
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,765
I will read slowly.

172
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,314
Your Highness.

173
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,484
Although you are so kind to me,

174
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,446
I cannot be happy.

175
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,455
Do not think
that you know everything about me.

176
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,626
I never said I did.

177
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,129
I only told you to take some rest.

178
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,978
Your Highness,

179
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,481
do not be so good to me.

180
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,192
I cannot help wanting to lean on you,

181
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,152
and it's tormenting me.

182
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,161
Eunuch Hong.

183
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,248
She's the Princess' friend.

184
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,672
Are you Eunuch Hong?

185
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,966
Yes, My Lady.

186
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,182
In conclusion,
he's a high-ranked, handsome man.

187
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,227
He's cold-hearted,
and he's not interested in

188
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,354
beautiful women like you.

189
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,652
I tried to draw his attention
several times,

190
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,987
but nothing worked.

191
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,531
May I ask how, My lady?

192
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,908
When I tripped because of him,

193
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,995
-I asked him to help me back up.
-Goodness.

194
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,790
You should've slapped his cheek

195
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,583
as if you weren't interested.

196
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,544
Is that what I was supposed to do?

197
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,716
I cannot help but smile when I see him.

198
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,387
That's not all. I suggested him
to go for a walk with me,

199
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,640
but he rejected me at once.

200
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,187
Did you really suggest him that?

201
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,315
I was shameless.

202
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,907
Why are you looking at me like that?

203
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,452
Is there no way for you to help me?

204
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,206
No.

205
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,625
I do not think you need my help, My Lady.

206
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,006
What is the point of knowing everything
about love and relationships?

207
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm envious of

208
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,428
how you can express your feelings for him.

209
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,764
-You're envious of me?
-Yes, My Lady.

210
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,727
I am sure you will soon be able to
be with him.

211
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,855
You see, sincerity is very powerful.

212
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,746
Your Highness.

213
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,207
As someone who is being
appointed as a regent

214
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,375
before the age of 20,

215
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,045
you must be quite shaken up inside.

216
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,673
However, if you stay strong,

217
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,301
do not be lazy
in overseeing political affairs,

218
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,013
and continue to study,

219
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,390
-nothing will...
-Hun-nam.

220
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,934
bring you down--

221
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:27,976
Yes, Your Highness?

222
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,354
Do not beat around the bush.

223
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,022
"Please be strong."

224
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,815
That's all you need to say.

225
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,526
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,737
Your Highness.

227
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,531
Please be strong.

228
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,118
Thank you.

229
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,122
What about you?

230
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,960
Do you not have anything to say to me?

231
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,465
I do not, Your Highness.

232
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,016
I know you'll do a great job,
Your Highness.

233
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,259
The Crown Prince is entering!

234
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,217
His Highness must have been very surprised

235
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,219
after seeing the empty assembly hall.

236
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,014
He has probably entered there
with confidence right about now.

237
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,392
I feel so bad for him.

238
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,605
He should not have canceled
the regular exam

239
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,899
and replaced it with the special exam
written by the King.

240
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,528
He must have figured out
that the result has already been decided.

241
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,658
He is making a statement

242
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,869
that he will get in the way
of the Kim Family's success.

243
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,038
This exam is to find talented individuals

244
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,873
who will oversee political affairs
with the King.

245
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,417
Let him do as he wishes.

246
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,714
He might give up on his own.

247
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,177
What could he possibly do by himself

248
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,637
in an empty assembly hall?

249
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,307
As the ones who lead
the royal court for decades,

250
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,601
let's teach him a lesson.

251
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,395
Don't you agree?

252
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
The Minister of Taxation

253
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,078
cannot attend the assembly
due to acute indigestion.

254
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,755
Supreme Commissioner Kim Su-yong
has a high fever.

255
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,972
Oh, no.

256
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,266
Someone even has a skin rash.

257
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,060
How could they be so disloyal?

258
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,437
Your Highness,

259
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,899
shall I send someone and bring them here?

260
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,278
Come on.

261
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,280
Did you not hear?

262
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,908
They're all very sick.

263
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,636
I understand that it is hard for you
to take your eyes off me,

264
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,390
but do you not think
you are being too obvious?

265
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,017
Pardon?

266
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,855
You look down, Your Highness.

267
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,538
Please have some of these, Your Highness.

268
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,252
Sweets are the best when you feel down.

269
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,266
What would you do?

270
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,977
About what?

271
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,939
If you had to face someone
who is difficult to deal with,

272
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,942
what would you do?

273
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,655
If it is someone I must fight against,

274
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,074
I will fight with all my might.

275
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,246
And if that doesn't work...

276
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,374
I would have no choice
but to go with the flow.

277
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,683
I will excuse myself, Your Highness.

278
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,539
Your Highness...

279
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,712
You're right.

280
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,963
It's the best.

281
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,304
You have not tried it yet.

282
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,098
I'm talking about you.

283
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,194
Go on and call the royal physician
and pharmacist.

284
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,738
EUNUCH WHO MANAGES MEDICINAL HERBS

285
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,697
Pardon?

286
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,782
Your...

287
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,458
We found someone who was close to
Hong Gyeong-rae over ten years ago.

288
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,919
We'll check if they know anything
about the whereabouts

289
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,755
of Hong Gyeong-rae's family.

290
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,590
Find out quickly.

291
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,425
Find out before those thieves do.

292
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,302
Yes, My Lord.

293
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,141
They're still waiting for someone,
who died ten years ago,

294
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,934
to come back to life.

295
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,688
Hong Gyeong-rae must have been
an impressive man.

296
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,648
My thoughts exactly.

297
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,152
Whichever side they are on,
they are looking all over the place

298
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,488
and making a fuss
to find a daughter of his.

299
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,795
"Kim Ui-gyo."

300
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,923
"Kim Geun-gyo."

301
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,680
What's this?

302
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,934
That's the Crown Prince.

303
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,895
Is it really him?

304
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,529
I was worried if I could deliver
all this medicine to each of you.

305
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,155
But surprisingly,

306
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,825
you're all here together,

307
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,035
which brings me relief.

308
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,793
Here.

309
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,840
I heard you have acute indigestion,

310
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,384
so I got you medicine
that will relieve it.

311
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,930
I hope they work.

312
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,058
Do you not agree?

313
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,938
Your Highness.

314
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,572
Please come inside.

315
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,501
At first, I thought she was widowed

316
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,296
because it was just her and her daughter.

317
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:22,010
But I heard her argue with someone
once in a while,

318
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,804
and a man came to their door

319
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,432
and left bags of barley rice for them.

320
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,310
I assumed he was the father...

321
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,774
but he turned out to be Hong Gyeong-rae.

322
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,234
Have you heard about them
after the uprising?

323
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,820
I'm sure they died.

324
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,948
The royal guards
searched all around the country

325
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,950
to get the entire family.

326
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,869
They wouldn't have left them alive.

327
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,123
Is there anything else you remember
about the daughter?

328
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,960
Well, not really.

329
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,134
She was just a little girl.

330
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,263
She had round, big eyes.

331
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,973
She was pretty.

332
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,518
What was her name?

333
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,478
Let me think.

334
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,564
It began with "Ra."

335
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,277
Ra-on.

336
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,112
"Ra-on."

337
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,741
Hong Ra-on.

338
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,330
I guess there is something special
about this house.

339
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,501
All the officials
who were too sick to do their duty

340
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,044
recovered so quickly here.

341
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,630
I'm thinking of

342
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,509
holding the royal court in your house,
not in the palace.

343
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,010
What do you think?

344
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,597
Please understand
that the officials gathered here

345
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,017
to discuss political matters

346
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,019
out of their devotion to Your Highness
and the country.

347
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,608
Had it not been for the effort
the noblemen put forth,

348
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,819
Joseon would not have lasted
for 400 years.

349
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,779
However,

350
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:09,450
you're ignoring their effort
and trying to go your own way.

351
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,911
It's our duty to guide you

352
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,747
and help you take the right path.

353
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,709
I guess

354
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,461
you and I have different concepts

355
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,464
about the right path.

356
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,177
If a red flower blooms

357
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,555
in a field of green grass,

358
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,391
anybody would want to

359
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,810
pick that flower.

360
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,606
"You'll get harmed
if you stand out too much."

361
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,150
Is that what you mean?

362
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,735
However,

363
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,112
if you try to pick that flower,

364
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:51,618
you will have to trample
on the grass around it first.

365
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,581
Don't you remember

366
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,959
how much His Majesty regretted it

367
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,003
after the late Queen passed away
seven years ago?

368
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,173
Please

369
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,760
don't ignore my loyal advice.

370
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,351
You may come to me whenever you need help.

371
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,897
As people say,

372
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,275
knowing your place

373
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,569
isn't something to be ashamed of.

374
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,711
I am Kim Yun-seong.

375
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,340
I am Cho Ha-yeon.

376
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,511
Were you surprised that I asked you
to meet me all of a sudden?

377
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,846
Not really.

378
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,765
You must have your reasons.

379
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,226
Let us sit.

380
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,400
I know I shouldn't be doing this,

381
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,736
but I was so curious about
my future husband

382
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,239
that I committed such rudeness.

383
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,827
Has your curiosity been satisfied?

384
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,579
Yes,

385
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,957
but I'm worried.

386
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,295
I am not good enough

387
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,799
to be the wife of a great man like you.

388
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,596
Could you be more specific?

389
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,936
I'm the only daughter in the family,
so I'm not considerate of others.

390
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,855
I lack patience.

391
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,899
Oh, dear.

392
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,445
That is bad.

393
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,615
Also,

394
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,785
I enjoy reading more than embroidering.

395
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,998
I know all the dirty stories
which you might be surprised to hear.

396
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,795
So my parents

397
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,465
are so worried about me.

398
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,638
Well,

399
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,475
I'm not as upright as
the rumor says either.

400
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,770
There is no need for you to worry.

401
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,276
That cannot be true.

402
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,282
What I mean is I get what you want,

403
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,534
so you do not need to worry anymore.

404
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,454
Pardon?

405
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,956
You don't want to marry me,

406
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,335
but you are too afraid of the consequences
you will face after rejecting me.

407
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,589
How did you...

408
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,598
By any chance,
do you have someone else in mind?

409
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,392
It seems like we both are
in the same situation.

410
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,026
What should we do then?

411
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,029
Let's find a way

412
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,657
to break this marriage

413
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,450
peacefully.

414
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,708
My Lord,

415
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,254
please take a look at these.

416
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,425
They are the eternal love bracelets
that connect the two souls.

417
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,473
Eternal love bracelets?

418
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,518
If you wear these with your lover,

419
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,021
you will end up meeting her again

420
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,315
even though you happen
to part ways with her.

421
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,011
I did not expect
that I would see you here, Your Highness.

422
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,644
Why are you looking at me like that?

423
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,857
Did you purposely run into me again?

424
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,609
Pardon?

425
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,779
It is a coincidence for real this time.

426
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,785
Does this mean

427
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,164
that we are actually destined
to be together?

428
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,169
She is way too direct.

429
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,268
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

430
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,562
I'll be at the training grounds all day

431
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,272
for the group training
with the palace guards.

432
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,982
Who are they?

433
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,484
I'll jump into them on the count of three.

434
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,777
Please run to the back.

435
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,197
One, two, three.

436
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,231
Are you okay?

437
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,740
I am so glad

438
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,076
that you are safe, Your Highness.

439
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,881
Your Highness,

440
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,136
why are you not asking me about it?

441
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,436
About who was chasing you?

442
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,983
If you could tell me,

443
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,610
I'm sure you would have already.

444
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,865
-Your Highness--
-I want to be alone for a moment,

445
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,992
so you may go.

446
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,673
Byeong-yeon.

447
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,681
If...

448
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,393
I were to trust only one person
in this world,

449
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,563
it would be you.

450
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,607
You know that, right?

451
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,318
Don't you remember

452
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,863
how much His Majesty regretted it

453
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,074
after the late Queen passed away
seven years ago?

454
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,538
I heard the court ladies talking about it.

455
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,915
They said she didn't pass away
from a disease!

456
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,668
Who tried to harm Mother?

457
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,669
Crown Prince!

458
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,880
You should never say
such a thing ever again.

459
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:30,881
Do you understand?

460
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,383
Father!

461
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,885
Please uncover the truth.

462
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,179
Please find them!

463
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,392
Please get those who harmed Mother.

464
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,102
Crown Prince!

465
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,756
Your Highness,

466
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,968
where have you been?

467
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,015
I went to visit someone I miss dearly.

468
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,517
May I ask whom you are referring to?

469
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,855
My mother.

470
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,579
What kind of person...

471
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,999
was the late Queen?

472
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,755
She did not like to be trapped
in the palace

473
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,591
and was curious about the outside world.

474
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,138
That reminds me of you, Your Highness.

475
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,310
She also did silly things

476
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,813
that gave the court ladies a hard time.

477
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,694
That also reminds me of you,
Your Highness.

478
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,366
However,

479
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,327
she was warm-hearted

480
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,621
and wiser than anyone else.

481
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,839
I could not protect her.

482
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,136
I could not.

483
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,396
That's when I realized

484
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,358
that I must be strong

485
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,944
in order to protect
those who are precious to me.

486
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,489
Your Highness.

487
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,250
Were you worried
because I disappeared without a word?

488
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,554
You don't need to say anything.

489
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,642
All you need to do is stay by my side

490
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,066
because seeing you cheers me up
like sweets do.

491
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,165
What is this?

492
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,919
This was sent from Minister Cho's house,
Your Highness.

493
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,270
Your...

494
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:45,028
He rescued me
when I was in danger not so long ago.

495
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,614
If this isn't fate, what else could it be?

496
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,996
I'm going to follow your advice

497
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,873
and confess my sincere feelings to him.

498
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,785
Is my gift not to your liking,
Your Highness?

499
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,662
I did not open it

500
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,790
because I did not know
why you gave me this.

501
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,503
You saved my life.

502
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,716
That was just by accident.

503
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,723
I have no talent for embroidery,

504
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,852
so I stayed up for several nights
to make this.

505
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,779
I cannot stop thinking about you,

506
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,448
and I miss you every day.

507
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,800
Does this mean that you cannot stand

508
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,427
being even a step away from me?

509
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,319
Your Highness,

510
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,364
may I ask you

511
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,991
one thing?

512
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,333
Have you ever

513
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,878
loved a woman?

514
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,052
Yes.

515
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,808
You have?

516
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,771
When? What kind of woman is she?

517
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,567
I'm in love

518
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,945
with a beautiful woman now.

519
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,118
Then,

520
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,330
why are you like that to me?

521
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,626
-That's--
-All day long,

522
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,421
I become happy, angry, and heartbroken
because of you.

523
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,257
I have been tormented.

524
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,179
Even though I wonder

525
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,389
your true feelings about me,

526
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,142
am I not supposed to ask?

527
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,396
I'm a eunuch who serves you,
the Crown Prince,

528
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,401
but you cannot tell me what to do
with my feelings.

529
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,889
I'm a eunuch who serves you,
the Crown Prince,

530
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,934
but you cannot tell me what to do
with my feelings.

531
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,392
What brings you here,

532
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,394
Your Highness?

533
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,201
Ra-on?

534
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,995
Why are you looking for her?

535
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,371
I mean,

536
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,581
how do you know that name?

537
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,335
Is she the girl whom you found
at the lantern festival ten years ago?

538
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,340
I'm not trying to harm her.
I'm only trying to protect her.

539
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,883
So please tell me.

540
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,553
Whatever the case may be,

541
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,097
she ran away a long time ago
and is not here anymore.

542
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,516
Do you not know where she went?

543
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,436
I don't know. That is why I came here

544
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,563
just in case she would be here.

545
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,615
If others come and ask about her,

546
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,826
tell them you know nothing.

547
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,244
No,

548
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,496
leave this place before they come.

549
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,915
It's dangerous here.

550
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,628
Wait.

551
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,093
Nothing is going to happen to her, right?

552
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,365
What are you doing?

553
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,106
What...

554
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,608
is this, Your Highness?

555
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,530
It's a perfect bracelet
for a beautiful woman.

556
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,031
What else would it be?

557
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,079
"A beautiful woman"?

558
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,460
-Whom--
-I told you

559
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,673
that I'm in love with a woman.

560
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,510
And she is standing right in front of me.

561
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,275
Hey.

562
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,406
Are you sure

563
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,908
that you are looking for her
to protect her?

564
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,582
Damn it.

565
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,502
Sam-nom.

566
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,468
What did you just say?

567
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,178
Hong Sam-nom.

568
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,973
She's in the palace now.

569
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,559
She was sold off to the palace

570
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,478
because of her debt.

571
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,690
That is what I heard.

572
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,129
Now,

573
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,091
I'll treat you
as the most precious woman in the world.

574
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,681
Would you allow me to do that?
