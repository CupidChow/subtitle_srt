1
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,190
What took you so long?

2
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,361
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,657
Please forgive me
for overstepping my bounds...

4
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,413
Inform His Majesty.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,625
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,128
Hong Gyeong-rae is alive.

7
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,884
What did you say?

8
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,313
Nan-hui.

9
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,777
Gyeong-rae?

10
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,782
You need get away from here.
Where's Ra-on?

11
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,203
Ra-on? She's up on the hill.

12
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,292
Come this way.

13
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,752
Stay right here.

14
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,675
No, you can't.

15
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,934
No...

16
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,443
You two.

17
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,403
Are you looking for me?

18
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,333
He is being escorted to the
Royal Investigation Bureau as we speak.

19
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,211
How dare you!

20
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,047
Do you take me for a fool?

21
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,132
I can't believe it either,

22
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,468
but it's the truth.

23
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,182
No, this can't be. He died ten years ago.

24
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,726
The rumors about

25
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,563
him surviving at Jeonju Castle back then
and plotting another uprising was true.

26
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,321
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty!

27
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,781
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

28
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,617
Your Majesty...

29
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,953
Bring in the royal physician!

30
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,873
Your Majesty.

31
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,750
Your Majesty...

32
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,498
Your Highness, His Majesty has fainted.

33
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,669
Hong Gyeong-rae has been arrested.

34
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,677
Mom, are you all right?

35
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,015
They took him.

36
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,853
Took who?

37
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,939
Your father...

38
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,571
What...

39
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,240
What do you mean?

40
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,618
Your father...

41
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,084
I thought he was dead.

42
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,422
I wished that he was alive somewhere...

43
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,885
But I thought he was dead.

44
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,765
Please don't die...

45
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:42,193
He's alive.

46
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,386
Clear a path!

47
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,513
Make way.

48
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,892
-Hong Gyeong-rae.
-It's Hong Gyeong-rae.

49
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,686
Hong Gyeong-rae was alive!

50
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,439
Tell me about it. My goodness.

51
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,524
Move out of the way!

52
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,651
Dear god, it's Hong Gyeong-rae.

53
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,781
He was alive all this time.

54
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,408
Make way!

55
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,742
Move!

56
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,830
I've waited for so long.

57
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,126
Is this the only way we could've met?

58
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,920
What a pity...

59
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,968
I heard the King ordered him to the palace
and not the Royal Investigation Bureau.

60
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,347
I don't care if it costs me my life.

61
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,268
I will help him escape.

62
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:16,120
We're guarding this place thoroughly,
so don't worry.

63
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,084
How's your mother?

64
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,175
She must still be in shock.
She can't seem to wake up.

65
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,515
She will get better with some rest.

66
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,100
Don't you worry.

67
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,062
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

68
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,565
Take care then.

69
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,193
Sir.

70
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,114
I have something to ask.

71
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,285
No.

72
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,874
Have you really no idea
how dangerous the palace is for you?

73
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,127
I know.

74
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,714
He is a felon
who took ten years to capture.

75
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,637
The life of you
and your father is at stake.

76
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,473
That's why I'm pleading.

77
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,228
If things don't turn out right...

78
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,357
Chief Eunuch.

79
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,027
The whole nation knows my father.

80
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,947
I'm the only one who doesn't.

81
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,908
I can't put you in harm's way too.

82
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,912
One last time...

83
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,667
No, it'll be my first time.

84
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,422
Please help me meet my father.

85
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,978
He was alive.

86
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,566
A few nights ago,
he came by while I was sleeping.

87
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,360
It wasn't a dream. It just wasn't.

88
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,995
We were supposed to celebrate
the Prince's marriage today.

89
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,165
How could this have happened?

90
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,586
Your Majesty, we will soon
set another date,

91
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,796
so please don't worry about
the royal marriage.

92
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,466
You need to focus more on your health.

93
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,053
He played me like a fiddle
for over ten years.

94
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,598
Dismemberment would seem
like a mercy right now!

95
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,475
Of course.

96
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,228
I am as horrified as you are.

97
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,649
Since he committed high treason,

98
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,734
you should interrogate him yourself

99
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,905
and sentence him to death by beheading.

100
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,495
Premier Kim, how dare you suggest that.

101
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:08,417
You very well know how
His Majesty responded to the arrest.

102
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:14,131
I agree. You aren't strong enough,
Your Majesty.

103
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,177
No.

104
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,765
Like Premier Kim suggested,
I will interrogate him myself.

105
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,425
Keep your head down and follow me closely.

106
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,141
Are you the one

107
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,310
who will escort me?

108
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,564
Do not ask questions until we get inside.

109
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,907
Your Highness, where are you going?

110
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,284
To prison.

111
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,953
But why at this hour?

112
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,165
I have to see him myself.

113
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,846
I will wait here.

114
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,088
-He can't avoid it.
-Exactly.

115
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,005
Are you

116
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,008
really Hong Gyeong-rae?

117
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,053
Yes, I am.

118
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,352
What brings the honorable Crown Prince

119
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,771
all the way to prison?

120
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,523
Is your family

121
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,694
aware of your arrest?

122
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,324
I don't have a family.

123
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,913
I heard you want the King to perish.

124
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,916
If so,

125
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,252
am I also your target?

126
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,341
Has the interrogation already begun?

127
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,177
I lost

128
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,639
something I hold dear because of you.

129
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,150
Heaven chose the leader

130
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,777
for the people.

131
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,823
Not for one man to rule over others

132
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,409
to fulfill his own greed.

133
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,328
Is that

134
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,331
what Baekwoon Group believes in?

135
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,002
No, not quite.

136
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,298
I believe there is an error
in that statement.

137
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,592
What would that be?

138
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,972
Heaven does not choose

139
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,808
the leader for the people.

140
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,103
The leader for the people

141
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,733
is chosen by the hands of the people.

142
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,591
We shall stay in Jahyeondang
until daybreak to avoid the risk.

143
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,179
I put you through too much trouble.

144
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,521
Did you bring her here?

145
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,899
My apologies, Your Highness.

146
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,122
Are you sure it was her?

147
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,209
I thought it was strange
when he avoided eye contact.

148
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,253
He was unusually small, too.

149
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,713
I checked the drawing when I came back

150
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,175
and it was definitely her.

151
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,304
How dare she set foot in here?

152
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,267
You must capture her
before the interrogation.

153
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,852
Yes, sir.

154
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,565
No one can leave or enter
under these circumstances.

155
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,444
I wonder what the Crown Prince would say
when the father meets the daughter.

156
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,184
If anyone

157
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,520
follows you to Jahyeondang,

158
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,522
hide in here.

159
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,612
Even the door is hard to find
from the outside.

160
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,364
I didn't know

161
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,326
this place existed inside Jahyeondang.

162
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,287
My mother

163
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,333
used to come here.

164
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,634
Are you all right?

165
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,724
Yes, Your Highness.

166
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,771
When the guard change shifts

167
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,940
I'll help you meet him.

168
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,948
He is the one

169
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,452
you are longing for.

170
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,939
Pass.

171
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,859
Pass.

172
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,614
Pass.

173
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,826
Pass.

174
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,716
This is terrifying.

175
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,600
HONG RA-ON. AGE 18.
THE DAUGHTER OF THE REBEL HONG GYEONG-RAE

176
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,187
Is that a familiar face
or is it my imagination?

177
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,565
I hope I am wrong.

178
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,151
Eunuch Hong?

179
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,862
The daughter of a rebel?

180
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,781
Not even a son,

181
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,034
but a daughter?

182
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,668
Eunuch Hong?

183
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,173
What is this?

184
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,218
The eunuch His Highness favored
from the Crown Prince's palace

185
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,054
is a girl.

186
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,557
What?

187
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:35,103
We found out that she is the daughter
of the rebel Hong Gyeong-rae.

188
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,324
In two days,

189
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,119
we will break him out at 1 p.m.

190
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,751
Seize the palace guards
at the time of their rotation.

191
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,128
We will be dressed in camouflage
and open the prison doors.

192
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,800
Lead him to the underground passage,

193
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,761
and I will smuggle him outside the palace.

194
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:09,930
Yes, sir.

195
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,432
How many will be in camouflage?

196
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,727
Ten, including you.

197
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,813
Yes, sir.

198
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,941
Remember.

199
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,485
Keep the child hidden and safe.

200
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,488
I will, sir.

201
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,268
What brings you to my palace?

202
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,229
We weren't able to exchange nuptials,

203
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,524
but I guess I am now the Crown Princess.

204
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,112
I was allowed to wait here

205
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,574
even in your absence.

206
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,996
I am sorry for keeping you waiting.

207
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,206
However,

208
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,334
since it's late why don't you
come back during the day?

209
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,456
Your took...

210
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,084
the bracelet off?

211
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,721
I'm only asking because

212
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,015
I thought it was special to you.

213
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,936
I just left it somewhere else.

214
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,985
Sharing the bracelet

215
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,114
ties one's fate to another's
to make sure that

216
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,575
the two meet again.

217
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,585
Street merchants come up
with odd sayings these days.

218
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,342
They know the desperation

219
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,889
of those who want to believe
what is obviously a lie.

220
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,845
I have feelings for someone else.

221
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,973
Who is

222
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,309
that woman?

223
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,189
Your Highness, it is an emergency.

224
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,232
Eunuch Hong...

225
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,817
What is it?

226
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,528
You should head to the Queen's palace.

227
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,697
Hurry.

228
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,452
Do not come in here,

229
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,580
ever again.

230
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,921
Do you have anything to say?

231
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:58,093
I was only asked to fill in for the guard.

232
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:04,891
Is it the same guard
who asked you here yesterday?

233
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,622
Ra-on.

234
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,340
Yes?

235
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,011
Hong Ra-on.

236
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,733
I gave you that name
to live a better life.

237
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,444
I am...

238
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,029
so sorry.

239
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,617
When...

240
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,665
were you going to show yourself to me?

241
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,501
I don't know.

242
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,087
I guess the day

243
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,383
that you're safe enough
to no longer pretend

244
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,552
to be a man.

245
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,347
You...

246
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,019
didn't have to change the world.

247
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,732
You could've...

248
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,611
been there for me...

249
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,532
as a caring father.

250
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,453
The world is a mess.

251
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,123
I didn't want

252
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:59,005
to raise my child in an environment
where I couldn't do anything for her.

253
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,133
That's why

254
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,761
I wanted to change its ways.

255
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,891
I wanted

256
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,062
you to live in a much better world.

257
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,856
Still,

258
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,860
I would have liked to know that...

259
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,449
you were alive.

260
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,543
I would have missed you

261
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,340
and called your name out many times.

262
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,139
Father.

263
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,749
Forgive me, My Lord.

264
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,542
I just have urgent news.

265
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,516
What's with the ruckus?

266
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,144
My Queen...

267
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,021
I found her.

268
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,858
What do you mean?

269
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,611
I mean Hong Sam...

270
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,905
No, Hong Ra-on.

271
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,118
Is she really within palace walls?

272
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,536
Yes.

273
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,041
Fearless, isn't she?

274
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,877
So, where did you see her?

275
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
I saw her exiting the palace prison.

276
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,049
She's now on her way to Jahyeondang

277
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,259
with the Crown Prince!

278
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,973
To Jahyeondang with the Prince?

279
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,894
Call for the Commandant of Palace Guards.

280
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,438
I want to see this myself.

281
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,321
Yun-seong, what brings you by?

282
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,575
Your Highness,

283
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,328
Grandfather asked me to deliver this tea.

284
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,206
There is something
I have to tell you first though.

285
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,252
Thank you, but this is not a good time.

286
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,878
-Perhaps--
-No.

287
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,758
You will want to hear me out.

288
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,636
Come back some other time.

289
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,054
It is about

290
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,850
a newborn baby that was
sneaked out of the palace recently.

291
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,564
Shall we really talk later?

292
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,754
I see you have the audacity

293
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,965
to disdain the Queen
with such treacherous lies.

294
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,344
The person belittling the people
isn't me but you.

295
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,388
You very well know that.

296
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,516
Shut your mouth!

297
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,269
Forget what Eunuch Seong said.

298
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,190
Don't tell the King or Grandfather.

299
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,028
If you do so, I will keep quiet about--

300
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,988
What will you do if I tell?

301
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,452
Will you tell the King
about the baby being swapped?

302
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,871
No one would believe you.

303
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,043
I would need evidence to back up my claim.

304
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,547
Yet, here you are blackmailing me.

305
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,759
"Blackmailing"?

306
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,974
What if that baby is still alive?

307
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,728
Would that change things?

308
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,967
I did my best not to put
Your Highness in danger

309
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,595
ever again.

310
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,099
Do not say that.

311
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,481
Before you and I even met,

312
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,985
our fate led us this way.

313
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,822
So don't

314
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,241
be sorry.

315
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,536
or blame yourself.

316
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,884
It is getting too late.

317
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,680
You should go back, Your Highness.

318
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,353
The clouds covered the moonlight.

319
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,068
How could I walk through the dark alone?

320
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,782
Let me stay...

321
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,955
just a little longer.

322
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,520
Countless times a day,

323
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,692
I imagine what it would be like

324
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,112
if we aren't who we are.

325
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,038
Even for a moment,

326
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,750
in a place where no one knows,

327
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,505
can't we forget everything

328
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,509
and face each other?

329
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,765
Ra-on.

330
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,469
Tonight, I think I will

331
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,473
fall asleep in peace for
the first time in a long time.

332
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,849
Did you break out of prison?

333
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,486
The prisoner is on the loose.

334
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,863
Seize him.

335
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,577
Guards! Bring in Premier Kim.

336
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,121
I command you

337
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,124
to open the courtyard
for Hong Gyeong-rae today.

338
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,761
I didn't expect the courtyard
to open so soon.

339
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,517
Breaking him out of the courtyard

340
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,353
is ten times harder

341
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,022
than doing it from prison.

342
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,984
Yes, sir. I am aware.

343
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,199
Byeong-yeon.

344
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,663
Jang Ki-baek died in prison.

345
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,626
I did that.

346
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,591
Even if he betrayed us,

347
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,804
he was my friend of over ten years.

348
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,181
But,

349
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,561
feelings are a luxury for the cause.

350
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,989
Give everything you have...

351
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,830
to help the man escape
from that courtyard.

352
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,293
Yes, sir.

353
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,547
Dress Ra-on in camouflage

354
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,800
and tell her to hide
next to the palace door.

355
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,013
We will smuggle out both.

356
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,183
It is safer that way.

357
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,311
Yes, sir.

358
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,591
The interrogation is about to begin.

359
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,843
What makes you so impatient?

360
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,430
About what you said before,

361
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,560
by "the leader chosen by the people,"

362
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,730
do you mean another puppet monarch

363
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,400
who listens to the people?

364
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,030
No.

365
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,658
I want it, too.

366
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,577
Politics for the people.

367
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,247
However,

368
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,501
how could the people choose
a King to rule above them?

369
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,718
What we want

370
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,805
is more than politics for the people.

371
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,599
We want politics by the people.

372
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,395
A King chosen by heaven like you

373
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,314
think you are the sun.

374
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,317
The absolute power.

375
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,072
The King chosen by the people
is different.

376
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,493
How so?

377
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,081
He believes that he is equal to his people

378
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,875
as a person.

379
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,555
People dream of being treated as such.

380
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,643
Ironic, is it not?

381
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,609
Why do you think

382
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,820
the solution is to rid of the King?

383
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,493
No King can give up his throne.

384
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,371
You and I,

385
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,582
nobles and slaves,

386
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,084
women and men.

387
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,047
An offspring of a traitor
and the heir to the throne.

388
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,676
Can you allow all these people

389
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,473
to be equals when you are King?

390
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,109
You must attend the interrogation
at the courtyard, Your Highness.

391
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,375
The one chosen by the people

392
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,086
isn't the only one who will treasure them.

393
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,714
A leader who treasures
each and every one of his people

394
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,677
can never treat them like animals.

395
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,518
So,

396
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,188
what are you trying to say?

397
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,941
You and I

398
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,527
dream of the same world.

399
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,446
The only difference is

400
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,825
how long it will take to build.

401
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,458
I will return after the interrogation.

402
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,253
Perhaps,

403
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,506
we can do this without wasting any lives.

404
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,760
We can work together

405
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,888
to build the world we dream of.

406
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:09,159
Hong Gyeong-rae,
do you confess to committing high treason?

407
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,039
I don't know what that is,

408
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,501
so I can't confess to anything.

409
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:29,513
There is evidence that
you betrayed this country and your people.

410
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,558
So stop telling lies.

411
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:37,145
What is this betrayal you accuse me of?

412
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,897
How dare you!

413
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,358
Begin the torture on this traitor.

414
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,862
Continue until he confesses to his crimes.

415
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,169
Lie to His Majesty once again,

416
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,172
and you'll be sentenced to a beheading.

417
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,301
Hong Gyeong-rae,

418
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,179
you began an uprising 10 years ago,

419
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,057
brought misery to the people,

420
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,060
and killed thousands.

421
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,895
Do you confess?

422
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,899
Is that what you meant?

423
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,321
Is that your definition of
treason and betrayal?

424
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,284
If so, then I admit all charges.

425
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,414
That's not all.

426
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,378
Those who shared my vision that day

427
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,755
are here right now.

428
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,354
They extorted the people
with too much taxation.

429
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,981
Noble families pocketed most of it

430
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,819
just so that they can live cushy lives.

431
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,825
I led the starving people

432
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,413
to fight until they met their ends.

433
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,501
All they wanted was a better life,

434
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,338
but the King demolished
all hopes and dreams

435
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,592
by firing explosives at them.

436
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,847
Come hither!

437
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,975
Off with that traitor's--

438
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,852
I'm confessing!

439
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:29,359
Sentence them
to an execution by beheading too.

440
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:36,867
That's the way of repaying
for the bloodshed

441
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,119
by the thousands of people.

442
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,458
I order you

443
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:48,003
to behead him immediately. Immediately!

444
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,588
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,177
Your Majesty,

446
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,429
please recant.

447
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,931
Crown Prince!

448
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,771
Please compose yourself.

449
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,356
It's proper procedure

450
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,693
to handle sentencing
after the interrogation is over.

451
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,700
Lower your swords!

452
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,661
That's not the real reason though.

453
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,084
We're in the midst of punishing a traitor.

454
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,963
This is no time to be swayed
by your personal feelings.

455
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,758
Premier Kim.

456
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:40,764
Rumors regarding your relationship
with his daughter have been flying around.

457
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,908
Premier Kim, what are you talking about?

458
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,914
Are the rumors true?

459
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,089
My Prince, why aren't you saying anything?

460
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,508
Is he telling the truth?

461
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,975
Bring her in.

462
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,301
This is the girl.

463
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,224
My Prince!

464
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,227
Is what he saying true?

465
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,705
Hong Ra-on, the daughter
of traitor Hong Gyeong-rae.

466
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:34,044
Is she the spy
you've been hiding in your quarters?

467
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,048
You fell in love
with a traitor's daughter.

468
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,259
Is it true you hid her
for that very reason?

469
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,901
Let me answer to my own sins.

470
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,489
I've never even seen her once
or called her name before.

471
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,868
She has no connections to me!

472
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:23,134
Convince us all that you weren't in league

473
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,970
with the traitors.

474
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,017
All you have to do

475
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,437
is behead this girl.

476
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,752
My Prince, why are you hesitating?

477
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:03,174
Come hither. Off with her head!

478
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,843
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

479
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,819
Your Highness.

480
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,864
As of this moment,

481
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,616
do not love me anymore.

482
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,119
Only

483
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,123
remember me as a traitor's daughter.

484
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,377
I don't want you to feel guilty

485
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,464
for the rest of your life

486
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,593
for not being able to save
the woman you love.

487
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,590
Protect the King and Prince!

488
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,518
How dare you!

489
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:41,439
Off with all the traitors' heads!

490
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,081
If you wish to save his life,

491
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,088
lower your swords.

492
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,946
Byeong-yeon...
