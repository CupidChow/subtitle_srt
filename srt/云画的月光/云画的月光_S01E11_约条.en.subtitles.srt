1
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,568
Chief Eunuch.

2
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,112
What brings you here, sir?

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,614
I have been searching for you

4
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,285
for a long time.

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,995
Pardon?

6
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,248
For me?

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,503
I have something to tell you,

8
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,840
Ra-on.

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,976
How do you know my name, sir?

10
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,025
How did you know that his name...

11
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,784
is Hong Ra-on?

12
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,599
Your Highness.

13
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,563
Although he does not remember me,

14
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,984
we have met some time ago.

15
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,713
I was surprised to see you

16
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,799
in such an unexpected place.

17
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,596
So was I, Your Highness.

18
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,560
What is it that happened in the past

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,856
that made you look for him all this time?

20
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,738
I owe Eunuch Hong's mother

21
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,116
a lot, Your Highness.

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,788
I wanted to take care of him

23
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,082
and lay down the burden of my heart,

24
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,335
but we parted ways unexpectedly.

25
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,297
So I could not reach him anymore.

26
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,051
So you knew him before he lost his mother.

27
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,140
If so,

28
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,935
do you already know?

29
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,443
That he is incapable of becoming a eunuch?

30
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,326
I think this is your chance
to pay back your debt.

31
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,165
Please take care of her
as a chief of eunuchs

32
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,626
while she remains in the palace.

33
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,007
Yes.

34
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,510
I will, Your Highness.

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,893
Chief Eunuch.

36
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,981
You must have a lot of questions.

37
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,361
I'll set up a time, so wait until then.

38
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,935
I will ask Jeong Yak-yong to reschedule
the meeting to sometime after Wednesday.

39
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,853
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:32,897
By the way,

41
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,900
what is he like?

42
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,905
He is someone you can learn a lot from.

43
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,201
But he has a bad drinking habit.

44
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,080
What is he like when he is drunk?

45
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,418
He befriends all the little things
in the world.

46
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,842
I knew a man like him.

47
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,761
My grandfather was like that.

48
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,933
When he drank, all the villagers

49
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,062
and even the dogs would run away from him.

50
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,407
Ra-on.

51
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,603
Do you think this is funny?

52
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,567
It's a gift from my heart.

53
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,531
Are you talking about this?

54
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,872
I have always wanted to mark you
as my own.

55
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,208
Just like that.

56
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,733
Have you been hiding your identity

57
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,986
to punish the traitors?

58
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,156
I was never worried about you.

59
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,744
You already know very well

60
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,997
who ruined your family

61
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,125
and killed all your kin.

62
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,421
For decades,

63
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,800
I served three kings

64
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,011
in closest proximity.

65
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,143
It always started with a faint hope
when they took the throne

66
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,230
and ended with despair and anger.

67
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,947
Joseon under the Lee regime
no longer has hope.

68
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,329
Then what must Baekwoon group do

69
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,250
for the new hope?

70
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,340
Do we need to start another uprising?

71
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,385
That is only a method.

72
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,930
An uprising cannot give hope.

73
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,106
Does the child remember anything

74
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,318
about the uprising from ten years ago?

75
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,698
No, I do not think she remembers anything.

76
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,891
What makes a country great?

77
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:43,481
I'm sure the King would know,
since he worries about his people.

78
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,531
That is not acceptable.

79
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,326
A child cannot handle
such a cruel punishment

80
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,578
that can break a grown man's leg.

81
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,373
That child might as well be beheaded.

82
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,458
Being young

83
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,835
is no excuse for insulting
the Royal Family.

84
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,629
If so,

85
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,091
bring proof that the child
is an infiltrator.

86
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,176
That is why

87
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,012
I am trying to interrogate her,
Your Highness.

88
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,849
Book of Documents states

89
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,810
that a single spark
can start a prairie fire.

90
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,314
You should not let a single spark
bring about worse disasters,

91
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,483
Your Highness.

92
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,734
Silence!

93
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,655
If a ten-year-old learned
to be an infiltrator before anything else,

94
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,533
the people who should be punished

95
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,286
are you and I.

96
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,081
Release the child.

97
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,251
-Please understand, Your Highness.
-Please understand, Your Highness.

98
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,444
What is it?

99
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,407
How could this be?

100
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
Is anybody out there?

101
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,164
Anyone?

102
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,296
What is with all the hurry?

103
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,591
Wait.

104
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,886
What is going on?

105
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,891
It turned out that His Majesty's food
was poisoned.

106
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,810
What? How is His Majesty?

107
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,729
Is His Majesty all right?

108
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,023
Luckily, he is fine.

109
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:57,740
This will cause a lot of trouble
for the Office of Eunuch Attendants.

110
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,200
Goodness.

111
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,919
Did you bring all the court ladies
who entered the Royal kitchen today?

112
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,962
Yes, sir.

113
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,882
However, there was one
who is not a court lady.

114
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,385
Someone who is not a court lady?

115
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,970
Who was it?

116
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,138
That day,

117
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,100
there was a man who brought
the ingredients for the Royal kitchen.

118
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,603
I went after him, but he was already gone.

119
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,232
Who is he?

120
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,362
He is the father of a child
who was found carrying the leaflets.

121
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,323
What?

122
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,971
Your Highness, I advise you not to go
for a run without eating anything.

123
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,431
I am worried you might get ill.

124
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,266
Do not be silly!

125
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,726
Don't you know that keeping in shape
is harder than losing weight?

126
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,938
Do not follow me.
You are getting in my way.

127
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,475
Who are you?

128
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:52,229
Your Highness... I am...

129
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,648
Stay away from me! I will call the guards!

130
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,817
I am going to... give you this...

131
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,652
-What?
-I would like to...

132
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,655
What are you doing? Anybody there?

133
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,356
-Are you all right, Your Highness?
-How rude!

134
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,651
Are you truly all right, Your Highness?

135
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,620
I will not forgive you if I ever see you
hovering around me again.

136
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,891
Yes, that is true.

137
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,977
She is the girl who we released

138
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,062
according to your command.

139
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,279
I came with my dad who supplies
ingredients to the dessert kitchen.

140
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,783
Are you saying that she and her dad

141
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,202
ran away together?

142
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,247
That is right, Your Highness.

143
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,217
Your Highness, they are criminals
who tried to harm His Majesty.

144
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,387
Please give us a command

145
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,556
to capture and execute them!

146
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,696
We've already searched
the eunuch's quarters.

147
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,408
-Why should we search here as well?
-A strange one lives here.

148
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,038
Keep quiet and search first.

149
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,417
Sir.

150
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,012
What is this?

151
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,433
I cannot believe this.

152
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,894
Your Majesty.

153
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,897
You must be worried very much.

154
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,983
Everyone can make a mistake

155
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,235
when they are too enthusiastic.

156
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,948
It is a relief that the criminals
who ran away are captured.

157
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,075
Yes.

158
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,494
However,

159
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,330
considering the Crown Prince's temper,

160
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,833
this incident is only the beginning.

161
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,838
What do you suggest we do?

162
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,258
I understand that he is still young,

163
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,804
but we need to make sure
that he doesn't repeat the same mistakes.

164
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,724
To settle down the public sentiment,

165
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,394
we need to hasten the royal marriage.

166
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,730
However,

167
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,650
the Crown Prince does not want
to get married.

168
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,527
Nothing turned out right

169
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,654
when we did things
as the Crown Prince wished.

170
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,120
I told the Department of Ceremony to make
an announcement about the selection.

171
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,295
I will help you release
your worries, Your Majesty.

172
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,275
What kind of a king
would you like me to be, Mother?

173
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:13,282
I would like you to be a king
who has a keen eye.

174
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,242
"A keen eye"?

175
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,037
When someone is in a high position,

176
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,748
they might not be able to understand
those who are in lower positions.

177
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,167
Is there anything else?

178
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,212
I hope you don't become dull of hearing.

179
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,883
You should not listen only to those
who speak loudly in front of you.

180
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,637
You mean I should care for people
regardless of their status,

181
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,514
and listen to the subjects

182
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,768
while distinguishing between flattery
and honest advice, right?

183
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,229
Protect each of your people

184
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,608
as if they are your only people.

185
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,616
Can you promise me

186
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,368
that you will make such a king?

187
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,915
I will keep that in mind, Mother.

188
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,135
Ra-on.

189
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,851
How do I know
what I am seeing is the truth?

190
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,188
Whom should I trust?

191
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,151
What should I do if what I thought
was right is actually wrong?

192
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,324
What am I supposed to do
when everything is so difficult?

193
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,583
Your Highness.

194
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,798
My grandfather said

195
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:58,470
that you tend to doubt everything
when you feel sad.

196
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,350
"You tend to doubt everything

197
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,478
when you feel sad."

198
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,947
Then,

199
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,491
I need you now.

200
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,622
Do something that would make me
feel joyful and clear my doubts.

201
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,344
Will this do, Your Highness?

202
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,307
Yes.

203
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,059
I am filled with joy now.

204
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,077
If the royal marriage proceeds,

205
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,621
other marriages will be prohibited.

206
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,124
I suppose the marriage
between our children will be delayed.

207
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,084
Right.

208
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,714
I did not imagine His Majesty would
hasten the Crown Prince's marriage.

209
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,967
Everything is already decided.

210
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,303
So the selection will proceed fast.

211
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,892
Do you mean that who will be selected
is already determined?

212
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,312
If not someone from the Kim Family,

213
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,856
who can dare to take that position?

214
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,612
I heard

215
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,366
that His Majesty secretly called you
the other day, Minister Cho.

216
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,952
Well, yes.

217
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,912
As a matter of fact,

218
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,248
I've been having a heavy heart
because of that.

219
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,459
There is no need for you to feel that way.

220
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,753
You do not need to take it too seriously.

221
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,881
I told you before

222
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,219
that you do not need to overthink it.

223
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,846
You can either cooperate with me,

224
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,057
or I can hold you in check.

225
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,184
Those are the two options for you.

226
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,699
What on earth does this mean?

227
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:29,329
It is hard to guess.
I am so curious, Your Majesty.

228
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,873
No way!

229
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,919
I know he looks even prettier than a girl.

230
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,590
If you are curious,

231
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,593
you can check it out.

232
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,514
Would the Crown Prince allow it?

233
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,142
Of course he would not.

234
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,065
That is why I want to do it more.

235
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:03,155
It is an important moment
when the royal marriage will proceed.

236
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,420
Eunuch Hong!

237
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,592
What is the matter?

238
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,054
Eunuch Do.

239
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,639
I heard that you know a lot about poisons.

240
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,766
Is that true?

241
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,893
No, it is not.

242
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,936
I just picked up a little.

243
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,108
What do you want to know? Tell me.

244
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,198
About the rumor that someone
poisoned His Majesty's meal...

245
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,285
They gave the leftover to animals,

246
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,953
but none of them were dead.

247
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,041
The silver spoon turned black, right?

248
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,349
This water is called jogaksoo.

249
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,643
It is made by brewing honey locust.

250
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,998
You can't clean the silver spoon
that has turned black

251
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,167
due to poison even with jogaksoo.

252
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,795
That means His Majesty's meal
was not poisoned.

253
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,467
Why did the color change, then?

254
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,970
We will have to find out.

255
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,658
PHARMACY

256
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,437
Poison?

257
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,190
Is His Majesty all right?

258
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,235
He is having a hard time
especially after the leaflet incident.

259
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,948
When will you accept my offer
and come back to the royal court?

260
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,952
I am sorry, Your Highness.

261
00:24:56,494 --> 00:25:00,332
I am busy helping the sick
with my mere skills in acupuncture.

262
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,211
There are many more talented physicians
in the palace.

263
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:09,090
It is not about medicine.
It is about saving an innocent child.

264
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,136
"Do not give up on a single one
of your people."

265
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,472
That is what you told me, remember?

266
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,725
I need your help.

267
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,948
I asked for you because I found something
interesting in your residence.

268
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,034
Pardon?

269
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,346
This is...

270
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,977
Why?
Are you going to deny that it is yours?

271
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,694
All right. You do not need to answer.

272
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,823
I just have to see for myself.

273
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,163
Strip him.

274
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,503
Your Highness.

275
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,290
Did you come out for some fresh air,
Your Highness?

276
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,251
You really are fearless.

277
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,047
Forgive me, Your Highness.

278
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,424
If I interrupted you--

279
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,927
You are all by yourself at this hour
in a place like this.

280
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,436
I did not know
I was this brave and courageous

281
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,772
until I met you.

282
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:38,114
Your Highness, may I ask you a question?

283
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,789
Do you not like me

284
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,832
because I was rude to you
when I first met you?

285
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:52,545
Do you find me boring
because I do not hide my feelings for you?

286
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,848
I have feelings for someone else.

287
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,731
What I'm saying is
that it is not anyone's fault.

288
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,609
Will you take that as an answer?

289
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:21,074
Who is... that woman?

290
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,663
Your Highness, we have a huge problem.

291
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,582
-Eunuch Hong...
-What is it?

292
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,335
Eunuch Hong...

293
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,130
I said, what is it?

294
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,341
You should head to the Queen's Palace.

295
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,677
Hurry.

296
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,398
Your Highness,
the Crown Prince has arrived.

297
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,332
Welcome, Crown Prince.

298
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:21,217
Why did you bring in the eunuch
from the Crown Prince's palace this time?

299
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,352
I've always wondered

300
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,397
whenever I saw this eunuch trainee.

301
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,235
How can a man have a pretty face like his?

302
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,037
What do you think, Your Highness?

303
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,798
Take your hand off him.

304
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,682
I understand that a face this pretty
can distract you.

305
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:14,896
He looks more like a girl than a girl.
No wonder you are confused.

306
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:20,693
The thing is, during the search
throughout the subjects' residences today,

307
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,113
they found this.

308
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,795
I know all the rumors have troubled you.

309
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,550
So I, as your mother,
will clear all the doubts

310
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,010
in front of everyone here.

311
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,598
If you say so.

312
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,819
Why do you have a woman's clothing?

313
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,407
I...

314
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,704
I was...

315
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,707
I told you that you do not need
to answer my question.

316
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,376
Shut your mouth

317
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,297
and take off that eunuch's robe!

318
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,221
Eunuch Hong.

319
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,143
Obey Her Highness' order.

320
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,033
You called in a mere eunuch

321
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,413
and harassed him by ordering him to strip.

322
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,835
When will you stop harassing others
because of those silly rumors?

323
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,505
Why don't we

324
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,884
find out who is right?

325
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,599
If anyone did wrong,
I would hold them accountable.

326
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,606
Sure.

327
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,776
You are right, Your Highness.

328
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,616
I have already told you to strip!

329
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,918
Your Highness.

330
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,087
Chief Eunuch Han has arrived.

331
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,901
What business do you have here?

332
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,611
Your Highness.

333
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,824
You can make a mere eunuch
disrobe if you wish.

334
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,246
But I plead you not to dishonor
the office of Eunuch Attendants

335
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,000
and the ladies of the court.

336
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:32,051
This trainee has passed the office
of Eunuch Attendants' examination.

337
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,600
Eunuch Seong.

338
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,229
Didn't you re-examine him yourself?

339
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,942
I did.

340
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,531
Your Highness.

341
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,369
I understand that you are only trying to
reprimand a eunuch.

342
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,956
But it is not acceptable
for a mother of this country

343
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,916
to check the body of a naked man herself

344
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,004
especially when she is bearing a child?

345
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,762
If His Majesty

346
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,014
finds out about this...

347
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,775
Chief Eunuch.

348
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,906
Both Her Highness and I cannot stand
anything suspicious.

349
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,365
Let her do it.

350
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,666
Your Highness, what are you waiting for?

351
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,711
See for yourself.

352
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,730
Take him away.

353
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,983
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,298
JAHYEONDANG

355
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,718
Did something happen, Your Highness?

356
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,015
I just want to have someone dear to me
by my side.

357
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,435
But I do not know why

358
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,313
things I feel sorry for keep happening.

359
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,359
Your Highness.

360
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,286
So I am thankful for you.

361
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,764
What is the matter?

362
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,308
You asked to meet me.

363
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,729
I felt that you are of the same mind.

364
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,234
Also, I was also reminiscing
about our old days.

365
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,573
Right.

366
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,409
We used to spend a lot of time together

367
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,329
at Jahyeondang before.

368
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,792
By the way,

369
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,212
I heard what happened
at the Queen's Palace.

370
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,262
Is Eunuch Hong safe?

371
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,767
His Highness is with him.

372
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,399
When I was young,

373
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,694
I wanted to be the most reliable friend
to the Crown Prince.

374
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,365
However, at one point,

375
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,036
I became someone
he feels uncomfortable to be with.

376
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,793
And I met a woman
whom I want to be together--

377
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:16,961
Do not say it.

378
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,509
Just keep your feelings to yourself.

379
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,640
No.

380
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,145
I won't do that anymore.

381
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,983
This is the first time that I desire

382
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,111
something this much.

383
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,799
-May I ask for directions?
-Sure.

384
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,069
-My grandfather
-My grandfather

385
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,904
-said...
-said...

386
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,822
Grandfather?

387
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,282
Ra-on?

388
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,826
Are you Ra-on?

389
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,537
No, I am Sam-nom here, Grandfather.

390
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,165
You rascal!

391
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,168
I've told you not to call me Grandfather
many times.

392
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,214
By the way,

393
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,092
how come you are here?

394
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,302
Moreover,

395
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,222
as a eunuch?

396
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,017
It is a long story,
but it turned out to be this way.

397
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,730
I am acknowledged as a good eunuch,
so do not worry.

398
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,401
You punk. How can I not worry?

399
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,492
It has been so many years.

400
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,829
We finally meet each other like this.

401
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,543
My grandfather said

402
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,548
that those who are supposed to meet
are going to meet in the end.

403
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,360
We are looking for the family

404
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,737
of Hong Gyeong-rae, who committed treason.

405
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,158
May we search inside?

406
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,800
The guards are gone. You can come out now.

407
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,479
You separated with your mother
in Unjongga, didn't you?

408
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,897
I did.

409
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,817
Well...

410
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,861
How do you know each other?

411
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,917
Are you here to meet the Crown Prince?

412
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,800
Then,

413
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,802
Grandfather,

414
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,513
you are...

415
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,101
"Grandfather"?

416
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,706
This caused the discoloration.

417
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,291
Hooker chives.

418
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,794
Hooker chives?

419
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,254
Right.

420
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,506
It's an interesting ingredient

421
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,300
that tastes sweet, spicy, and bitter
all at the same time.

422
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,928
This contains sulfur,

423
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,932
so it caused the discoloration
of the spoon.

424
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,434
However, it is not poisonous.

425
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,646
Are you saying
that the meal was not poisoned?

426
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,124
Would you believe me now?

427
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,214
Even though it comes from the West,

428
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,300
but the physicians should have known.

429
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,926
Why did everyone shut their mouth

430
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,304
and pretend
as if something terrible happened?

431
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,529
Nothing new from the Crown Prince?

432
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,407
He must be anxious.

433
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,409
I feel sorry for him.

434
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,370
The physicians are keeping
their mouths shut.

435
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,705
He can never know the truth.

436
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,292
Who would dare to reveal the truth

437
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,502
unless they are determined
to go against Premier Kim?

438
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,131
It is about time
the Crown Prince should realize

439
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,802
that no one in the palace is on his side

440
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,846
Don't you think so?

441
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,025
Your Highness!

442
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,532
Aren't you the nobleman
at the Lantern Festival?

443
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,826
He is the Crown Prince.

444
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,080
Your Highness! Thank you for saving
our lives.

445
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,290
I appreciate it.

446
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,461
It is all right.

447
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,421
Look at me.

448
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,386
I am sorry that you had to go through
this hardship at an early age.

449
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,555
Has my wish to meet the King

450
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,808
been granted, Your Highness?

451
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,603
Right.

452
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,899
You did not forget what you wanted
to ask him, did you?

453
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,194
Please keep your eyes on me

454
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,655
until I make this country
a better country.

455
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:01,907
I will, Your Highness.

456
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,470
I could save an innocent child
thanks to you.

457
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,181
By the way,

458
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,560
when are you going to reply to my request?

459
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,273
I am an old man
who cannot be of much help to you.

460
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,900
I should go, Your Highness.

461
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,238
Grandfather!

462
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,328
Have you ever heard

463
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,914
about my mom after then?

464
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,923
I wish I have good news for you
next time I see you.

465
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,610
The royal marriage will proceed.

466
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,488
Father.

467
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,615
Do you also consider me

468
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,911
as a coward who lacks judgment?

469
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,913
No, I don't.

470
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,415
I just...

471
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,920
I do not want to have
an unwanted marriage.

472
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,131
I know.

473
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,258
I understand how you feel.

474
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,345
Yeong.

475
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,185
Since the day I sat on the throne
at the young age of ten,

476
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,189
there has not been a single day

477
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,608
when I was not confused or scared.

478
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,406
You must feel like you are walking
as you cleave through the rough waves.

479
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,994
In your mind, you would think
you have taken ten steps forward,

480
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,454
but soon you would realize

481
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,166
that you have been stamping your feet
on the same spot all along.

482
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,421
To reach where the water is calm,

483
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,842
you need to hold on to a twig
at the least.

484
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,224
You should marry

485
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,977
Minister Cho's daughter.

486
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,081
How nice would it be

487
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,041
if His Highness marries
a Crown Princess consort

488
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,377
from a good family, gains more power

489
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,628
and have more people on his side?

490
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,965
How frustrating.

491
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,693
Ra-on.

492
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:30,741
Your Highness.

493
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,784
You startled me.

494
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,164
What was distracting you?

495
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,876
Your Highness.

496
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,919
What is it?

497
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,714
Your Highness.

498
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,968
Could you walk me to Jahyeondang?

499
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:14,076
We've been walking back and forth
the Crown Prince's palace and Jahyeondang.

500
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,829
You must want to stay with me
as long as you can.

501
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,627
Do you know when I am the happiest?

502
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:32,219
It is when you call my name.

503
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,098
So am I.

504
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,768
That is when I am the happiest.

505
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,812
When I call your name,

506
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,690
you come right before my eyes.

507
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,986
What more do we need?

508
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,615
I could not ask for more.

509
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,370
I want more than that.

510
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,748
When you are in love,

511
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,835
it is natural to want more and more.

512
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,381
You're right.

513
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:13,009
Please do so since I am already yours.

514
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,474
However,

515
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,394
I do not want you to risk anything for me.

516
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,651
My feelings for you will not disappear

517
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,446
only because I cannot stay with you
as a lady.

518
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,990
So--

519
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,700
Do not say a word.

520
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,496
Please do not refuse the royal marriage,

521
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,749
Your Highness.

522
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,709
I told you to stop.

523
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,966
The woman I have told you about

524
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,302
is Hong Ra-on.

525
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,683
The woman you wanted to
present a home and parents?

526
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,062
Yes.

527
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,817
Why do you care about her?

528
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,778
She is only a eunuch.

529
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,658
She is my lover

530
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,910
who happens to stay with me as a eunuch.

531
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,124
A difference in status,
an irony of fate...

532
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,796
You asked me to help you
overcome all the obstacles.

533
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,632
I did.

534
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,759
However,

535
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,348
the person she needs

536
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,352
is not you, your Highness.

537
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,373
Your Highness.

538
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,670
What brings you here at this early hour?

539
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,464
There is something I need to tell you.

540
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,398
Do you remember the child

541
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,650
who was selling the lantern?

542
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,403
Yes, Your Highness.

543
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,532
I still remember the joy in her eyes

544
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,286
when she saw her father.

545
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,415
The child said this to me.

546
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,502
The King would know

547
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,881
what a good country really is.

548
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,637
What is Joseon

549
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,725
that you dream of like?

550
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,520
Well...

551
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,357
The country where all the children

552
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,736
and all the women

553
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,323
can be as they are
and live happily ever after.

554
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,259
Could you wait

555
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,221
until I build that country

556
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,474
for you?

557
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,649
In the new Joseon I will build,

558
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,235
you...

559
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,613
will be my first.

560
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:07,262
What would you do if their reunion
could put you in danger, Your Highness?

561
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,932
If you let this one go,

562
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,727
you and Ra-on

563
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,397
might be able to live happily together.

564
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,569
If...

565
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,990
you have to let go of someone

566
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,702
when things get tough,

567
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,667
it should not be me.

568
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,671
Can you promise me that?

569
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,600
Yes, Your Highness.

570
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,979
Good.

571
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,732
I think

572
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,735
my wish has finally come true.

573
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,907
What do you mean?

574
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,205
I wished for

575
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,416
your wish to come true.

576
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,305
I found your mother.

577
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,006
Mom.

578
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,511
Ra-on.

579
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,849
I'm sorry it took me so long to find you.

580
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,060
Mom.

581
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,480
Mom.

582
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:07,150
Mom.

583
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,406
I'm sorry.

584
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,121
Mom.

585
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,796
Mom.

586
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,664
I am afraid

587
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,749
of being too happy.

588
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,376
I'm waiting for the moment

589
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,503
when the Crown Prince
becomes incapacitated.

590
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,474
What if I am this happy

591
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,601
because someone else's happiness
came to me?
