1
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,447
My Lady,

2
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,158
what should I call you?

3
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,915
My name is Hong Ra-on,

4
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,833
Your Highness.

5
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,631
Hong Ra-on.

6
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,560
Ra-on.

7
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,454
"Ra-on" means joy, doesn't it?

8
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,084
Yes. I heard that my father

9
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,004
named me so,
hoping that I live a life full of joy.

10
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,967
It suits you well.

11
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,353
Your Highness, are you awake?

12
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,568
Yes, come in.

13
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,916
How is the weather outside,

14
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,835
Ra-on?

15
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,796
Pardon?

16
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,762
The sun is bright.

17
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
Okay.

18
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,184
Did you pack the books
for the morning lesson,

19
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,144
Ra-on?

20
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,734
Yes, Your Highness. By the way,
will you keep calling me by that name?

21
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,488
What is wrong with calling you
by your real name?

22
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,574
What if someone hears you?

23
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,496
Then I'll call you by your name
only when we are alone,

24
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,706
Ra-on.

25
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,547
I will call your name as much as I want
for all the times I could not do so.

26
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,259
Sure, Your Highness.

27
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,275
You're an expert in love, so tell me.

28
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,613
Don't all women dream of
a romance with a crown prince?

29
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,916
You could not find her?

30
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,462
The old woman next door
did not remember anything.

31
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,008
Neither the face nor the name?

32
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,926
No, sir.

33
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,682
I see. All right.

34
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,317
What happens if we find her?

35
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,819
We will take her as our own
and protect her.

36
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,615
Why do you ask?

37
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,786
Nothing, sir. I will keep searching.

38
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,188
Out of the way.

39
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,648
Catch him.

40
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,942
Hear the sound of millions cry of hunger

41
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,194
all across the land.

42
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,614
The ignorant King does not own this land

43
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,325
but the people who lived through history.

44
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,787
The uprising of the Hong of Hamgyong
begins once again.

45
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,082
And it will not fail
as it did ten years ago.

46
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,042
They say it is time.

47
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,087
They are stirring up the people,

48
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,381
saying that they must not repeat
the same mistakes of the past.

49
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,299
Your Majesty.

50
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,719
Leave this to me and do not worry.

51
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,264
I am concerned about your health.

52
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,057
They would rather have

53
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,394
the ghost of Hong Gyeong-rae
on this throne than me.

54
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,022
Tell me why

55
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,192
countless royal guards
could not arrest a single rebellion.

56
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,654
We joined forces with the palace guards
to search everywhere inside out.

57
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,407
We will soon find out who is behind this,
Your Majesty.

58
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,743
This palace is not safe.

59
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,456
They would try to murder me
in my sleep if they could.

60
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:41,210
Search every corner
of this palace right now.

61
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,339
Should anything look suspicious,
they will be brought to justice.

62
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,734
Byeong-yeon.

63
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,361
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,283
I had hoped His Majesty's fears
were unfounded.

65
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,620
But things are not looking good.

66
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,625
Did you hear anything more

67
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,711
about Hong Gyeong-rae's family?

68
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,590
No, Your Highness.

69
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,593
Nothing yet.

70
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,264
Premier Kim, Hong Gyeong-rae,

71
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,266
and Father.

72
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,146
I swear I will sever ties among them.

73
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,609
I need your help.

74
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,072
Understood, Your Highness.

75
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,672
Do you consider this
as an unforeseen misfortune?

76
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,638
What do you want to say, Premier Kim?

77
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,020
Fear always seeps into the weakest places.

78
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,899
You mean, I,

79
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,611
a weak regent, brought fear?

80
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,783
I respect your will to bring change,

81
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,161
but in reality,
you brought nothing but chaos.

82
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,123
In difficult times,

83
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,418
you need help from a skilled,
experienced subject.

84
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,005
Why don't you pretend to give in

85
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,508
and take refuge under my shadow?

86
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,553
I don't know.

87
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,806
But I cannot pretend

88
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,892
not to notice the filth
underneath that shadow.

89
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,866
Open them all.

90
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,757
Eunuch Jang.

91
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,594
What is going on, sir?

92
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,721
They are searching every inch
of the palace

93
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,349
from the Office of the Eunuchs

94
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,560
all the way
to the Court ladies’ residence.

95
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,314
What did they hand out
in the capital city to cause this uproar?

96
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,486
Those propaganda leaflets claimed
that the current king must be overthrown,

97
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,529
and the people should
become the rulers of this country.

98
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,864
-What?
-Be quiet.

99
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,200
But that is treason.

100
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,036
During the uprising ten years ago,

101
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,580
no one knew that an infiltrator

102
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,290
crept into the palace.

103
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,627
Anyway, be careful.

104
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,713
At times like this,
it does not matter if you are innocent.

105
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,757
You can get accused of treason

106
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,635
along with everyone else
around you, including me.

107
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,930
Then they sear you with a hot iron,
and that stuff can kill you.

108
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,182
-It kills you?
-For sure.

109
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,366
Has it been a long day, Your Highness?

110
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,701
Yes.

111
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,291
You must have been upset
because of the disarray in the palace.

112
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,669
Yes.

113
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,588
I have not seen you all day.

114
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,142
Lay yourself down
and get some rest, Your Highness.

115
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,401
There.

116
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,585
You haven’t been sleeping well, have you?

117
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,174
I can tell you a story

118
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,802
until you fall asleep.

119
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,347
Go on.

120
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,143
It’s from a western book I read

121
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,396
when I was in Unjongga.

122
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,942
You once told me

123
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,154
that it is every woman's dream

124
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,781
to fall in love with a crown prince.

125
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,954
The story goes just like that.

126
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,459
It's a story about a mermaid
from the ocean...

127
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,670
falling in love with a prince.

128
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,021
Is he as handsome as I am?

129
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,402
I'm talking about that prince
from the West.

130
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,530
Pardon?

131
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,827
I suppose so.

132
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,373
He must be because the mermaid
fell in love with him at first sight.

133
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,293
Just like you did, right?

134
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,722
The mermaid fell in love,

135
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,268
and she decided to trade her voice
for a pair of legs.

136
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,604
That way, she could stay
by the prince's side.

137
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,191
But without her voice,
she couldn’t tell him

138
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,236
who she really was.

139
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,618
Continue the story,

140
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,578
Ra-on.

141
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,964
Chief Eunuch,

142
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,801
as soon as the Crown Prince
was appointed as a regent,

143
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,429
things are getting worse by the day.

144
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,515
I can already see it coming.

145
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,310
Everyone will try to attack
the Crown Prince

146
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,604
and stop him from doing anything.

147
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,816
Just like they did to me.

148
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,985
Your Majesty.

149
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:50,074
Regarding the royal marriage
you mentioned before,

150
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,201
shall we postpone it?

151
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,205
No, I would like you to rush the process

152
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,915
and set up the Department of Ceremony.

153
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,252
A royal marriage is a joyous occasion.

154
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,715
We need to show the people

155
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,387
that there is no trouble
within the royal family.

156
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,514
Have you...

157
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,643
thought of any candidates?

158
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,568
Arrange a meeting with Minister Cho.
Do it secretly.

159
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,116
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,708
Your Highness.

161
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,835
This is Jeong Deok-ho,

162
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,837
who passed the regular exam
in first place.

163
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,758
Your Highness!
I will do anything and everything I can

164
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,052
to serve you and this country!

165
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,931
-I will prove how devoted I am by--
-You don’t have to prove me anything.

166
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,977
Since you seem to be interested in combat,

167
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,895
I’m appointing you
to be a part of the royal guard.

168
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,814
So show me what you can do.

169
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,484
Yes, I will do so, Your Highness.

170
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,711
Young Master...

171
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,970
Please tell her to forgive me

172
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,848
for falling in love with her

173
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,851
when I should not have.

174
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,189
Do you two know each other?

175
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,066
Yes... No, that is not--

176
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,445
Not really. We came across each other
in Unjongga several times.

177
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,988
Right, I mean...

178
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,458
I see. You may be excused.

179
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,470
Sam... Sam-nom...

180
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,056
You... should never...

181
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,227
I, Hong Sam-nom, won’t say a word.
You do not need to worry about a thing.

182
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,770
Thank you!

183
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,564
By the way, how did you...

184
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,983
Did you really get first place?

185
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,779
I know, I still can’t believe it myself.

186
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,615
Me? First place? More like worst face!

187
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,368
-Funny, right?
-Not really, no.

188
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,413
Eunuch Hong!

189
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,749
Your Highness.

190
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,885
Eunuch Hong!

191
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,560
I thought I saw someone
standing next to you just now.

192
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
Why do you look so surprised?

193
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,860
Pardon?

194
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,990
My apologies, Your Highness.
It was hard to recognize you at first.

195
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,578
Have you always had
a high nose bridge like you do now?

196
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,414
Do you really think so?

197
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,086
I, as well, have just recently found out
that I have a high nose bridge.

198
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,591
I’ll see you soon, Eunuch Hong.

199
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,634
Yes, Your Highness.

200
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,437
How did she...

201
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,523
become so stick-thin like that?

202
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,026
You will be coming to the palace a lot.

203
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,652
How are you going to handle this?

204
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,115
Things will go bad if she recognizes me.

205
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,995
I just have to avoid her as much as I can.
I have no choice.

206
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
But really, how did she become so thin?

207
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,772
A lantern that will make
my wish come true...

208
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,692
If it were you, what would you wish for?

209
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,739
I would wish to meet the King just once.

210
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,211
My Lord!

211
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,839
What brings you here?

212
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,218
Are you here to meet the King?

213
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,555
I came with my dad who supplies
ingredients to the dessert kitchen.

214
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,021
Your Highness--

215
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,366
Give the Crown Prince’s snacks

216
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,410
to this child.

217
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,550
Your Majesty.

218
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,263
Why have you asked me to come so secretly?

219
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,852
Let us get straight to the point.

220
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:57,065
I would like you to help me
and the Crown Prince.

221
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,156
Allow me to have your daughter
as the Crown Princess consort.

222
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,492
Please be on the Crown Prince's side.

223
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,000
They must be talking
about the royal marriage!

224
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,296
His Majesty is planning to work
with Minister Cho on the selection.

225
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,967
Does this royal marriage
involve His Highness?

226
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,302
Yes.

227
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:31,683
Is that why Yun-seong’s marriage
kept getting delayed?

228
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,270
His Majesty is trying
to make a strong foundation

229
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,522
for the Crown Prince.

230
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,068
If he's appointed as a regent,
and if the royal marriage proceeds...

231
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,402
Something must be done.

232
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,696
What if Minister Cho decides
to stand by the Crown Prince,

233
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,116
and the new Crown Princess consort
conceives a royal descendant?

234
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:53,080
The Queen will give birth to a new Prince.
We have the upper ground for now.

235
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,460
We can never afford to lose
this opportunity.

236
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,254
No need to worry.

237
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,553
His Majesty cannot make
such an arbitrary decision on his own.

238
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,853
Do you have a plan in mind
to stop the royal marriage?

239
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:24,319
Your little daughter...
How old was she again?

240
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,372
Lift up both of your legs, Eunuch Hong.

241
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,166
This is so much better. It's so fun!

242
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,752
-Let's go!
-Let’s run all the way like this!

243
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,008
What is so funny?

244
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,887
Your Highness,
Eunuch Hong sprained his ankle.

245
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:56,434
Yes. We were helping him get to...

246
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,941
Let's go.

247
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,526
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

248
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,581
Way to go.

249
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,127
I was climbing a tree
to pick a persimmon, then I fell.

250
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,004
Nicely done.

251
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,840
You put your arm around other men.

252
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,842
You were smiling at them, too.

253
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,261
And you even hurt yourself!

254
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,853
Do not get hurt.

255
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,688
That is an order.

256
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,733
It is not like I wanted to.

257
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,195
Even if you feel like laughing
in front of other men, do not.

258
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,614
That is an order, too.

259
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,450
No, Your Highness.

260
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,827
What? What did you just say?

261
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,658
That is a punishment

262
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,410
for going against the Crown Prince.

263
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,592
Me?

264
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,138
We were in the middle of arranging
a marriage with Premier Kim's family...

265
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,809
What should we do?

266
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,438
Father.

267
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,483
Please follow His Majesty's command.

268
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,070
It is not that simple.

269
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,365
I heard that His Highness is in distress

270
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,993
because of the disloyal subjects.

271
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:23,832
I was wondering how I could console him.

272
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,753
I did not know you were
so deeply concerned for His Highness.

273
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,756
I would like to help His Highness.

274
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:37,512
Even if what His Highness needs is not me
but our family,

275
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,890
I do not mind.

276
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,519
Are you sure?

277
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,105
If Premier Kim drags you down

278
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,566
from the final selection
with one of his tricks,

279
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,944
you will never be able to marry anyone
and live alone forever.

280
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,033
Yes.

281
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,661
Whatever happens, I will not regret.

282
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,894
Stay right here until I get back.

283
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,938
Eunuch Jang will be looking for me.

284
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,648
That is exactly why.

285
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,528
I am afraid it will get worse
if you move around working.

286
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,991
It is not that bad.

287
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,286
Are you going to disobey me again?

288
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,166
No, Your Highness.

289
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,253
I will not.

290
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,598
There.

291
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,424
Father.

292
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,095
Minister Cho and I have started
discussing the royal marriage.

293
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,389
Your Majesty, you must not.

294
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,559
This was not an easy decision.

295
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,937
In Joseon where the Kim family
has all the power,

296
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,939
his family is the only one

297
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,942
that will not be swayed by Premier Kim
and come to your aid.

298
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,069
This is the best option.

299
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,780
They are another powerful family
who could become meddlesome.

300
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,450
May this royal marriage
bring peace to the royal palace

301
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,911
and to the hearts of the people
in disarray.

302
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,706
The moment you waver,

303
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,626
the rebels will agitate our people
once again.

304
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,342
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

305
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:26,723
I will not marry someone
only to extend my political power.

306
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,976
-Crown Prince.
-I will find my own way

307
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,061
to find those who would stand by me.

308
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,647
Please withdraw your command,
Your Majesty.

309
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,658
How do you expect me to rest in bed

310
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,412
after hearing such shocking news?

311
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,334
Marriage is no surprise
at His Highness' age.

312
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,960
Father.

313
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,174
Is this child in my womb
of no concern to you?

314
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,011
That is why the Crown Prince's
people are rushing this.

315
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,474
Don't you think that they already know
that timing is the key?

316
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,311
If a girl from the Cho family
becomes the Crown Princess consort...

317
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,563
I made you, who was nothing
but a mere kisaeng,

318
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,067
the Queen of this country.

319
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,653
Father.

320
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,031
This is my advice for you

321
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,952
so that you can stop worrying needlessly
and focus on safe delivery.

322
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,162
Do you understand?

323
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,008
Minister Cho and I have started
discussing the royal marriage.

324
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,808
His family is the only one
who will come to your aid.

325
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,190
Bring peace to the people in disarray.

326
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,785
Stay right here until I get back.

327
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,082
This is enough for today.

328
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,209
You may be excused.

329
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,921
Yes, Your Highness.

330
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,906
You ordered me to stay right here.

331
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,075
What took you so long?

332
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,043
I cannot believe
you are smiling right now.

333
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,508
Get on my back.

334
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,885
Pardon?

335
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,307
A eunuch cannot ride on a prince's back.

336
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,434
I cannot do that, Your Highness.

337
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,811
Don't get me wrong.

338
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,731
I would do the same for Hun-nam.

339
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,360
Still, I can't, Your Highness.

340
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,279
This is an order.

341
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,450
You told me to be your friend
when we are alone,

342
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,036
but you always tell me to obey you.

343
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,162
So,

344
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,165
are you saying
that you are going to disobey me?

345
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,515
How come you are as light as a feather?

346
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,768
Do you mean that?

347
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,022
I think your arms are shaking a bit.

348
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,654
Your Highness, what if someone sees us?

349
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,991
Do not worry.

350
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,411
I was born and raised here,

351
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,123
and I know plenty of routes
where nobody ever walks on.

352
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,629
Right,

353
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,883
about the story of a mermaid
you told me before.

354
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,845
What happened to those two

355
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,389
in the end?

356
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,269
You fell asleep
and missed the end, didn't you?

357
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,896
I did.

358
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,526
The prince never realized
the mermaid's love for him

359
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,987
and married another lady.

360
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,199
So the mermaid turned to sea-foam
and disappeared forever.

361
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,873
That is such a sad story.

362
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,920
Your Highness.

363
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,549
We are almost near Jahyeondang.
You can let me down.

364
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,847
No.

365
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,224
Let us go back
to the Crown Prince's palace.

366
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,393
Pardon?

367
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,273
Your Highness, you must let me down
in front of the Crown Prince's palace.

368
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,776
No, we will come back to Jahyeondang.

369
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,738
Your Highness, someone might see us.

370
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,306
Help yourself.

371
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,103
What a luxury for a pregnant court lady.

372
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,271
You are a lucky girl.

373
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,316
Thank you, ma'am.

374
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,193
But,

375
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,990
what will happen to me and my baby?

376
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,786
Watch your mouth and you will be fine.
Don't you worry.

377
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,471
I'm certain Her Highness
will give birth to a Prince.

378
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,642
You will face grave consequences
if you are wrong about this.

379
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,935
Are you certain?

380
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,940
Yes. I can sense strong and bright energy.

381
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,535
So, the results...

382
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,289
they’re the same as before?

383
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,874
Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,294
I’m afraid it will be a Princess.

385
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,965
I have waited six years for this chance.

386
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,427
I will not allow anything

387
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,973
to stand in my way.

388
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,566
I will do whatever it takes

389
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,777
to be the mother of a prince

390
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,113
who will rule Joseon.

391
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,916
Gather around. Silence!

392
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,043
Look at me.

393
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,757
If there’s anyone who thinks they have
way too much free time, come forward.

394
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,719
I can tell just by looking at your face!

395
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,845
You.

396
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,013
Me?

397
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,807
You seem like you have enough energy.
Come.

398
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,353
Come where?

399
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,981
The Department of Ceremony. You'll be
helping them prepare the royal marriage.

400
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,108
Is anyone getting married?

401
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,695
Who do you think? Of course it's the one
from your Crap Prince’s Palace!

402
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,864
What did you say?

403
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,742
Out of my way!

404
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,679
Right,

405
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,558
about the story of a mermaid
you told me before.

406
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,937
What happened to those two

407
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,231
in the end?

408
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,944
The prince never realized
the mermaid's love for him

409
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,530
and married another lady.

410
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,534
So the mermaid turned to sea-foam
and disappeared forever.

411
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,748
That is such a sad story.

412
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,602
Eunuch Hong.

413
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:36,939
Sir.

414
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,983
No need to get up.

415
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,699
Right as I thought I needed a break...

416
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,202
You’re so hard to resist, Eunuch Hong.

417
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,538
What do you mean?

418
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,085
Every time I see you, I just want
to lay down and be all lazy.

419
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,132
You must have a lot on your plate lately.

420
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,801
That’s right. The Department...

421
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,684
I already heard
about the Department of Ceremony.

422
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,853
I see.

423
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,690
There’s always something going on
in the palace.

424
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,734
The Ministry of Rites is always busy.

425
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,339
I was going to pretend
that I did not notice,

426
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,636
but I just can't because you are not good
at hiding your emotions.

427
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,354
Well, I will just pretend
that I am busy at the moment.

428
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,524
Please enjoy your alone time.

429
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,799
Cry as much as you want.

430
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,510
Spend as much time as you want

431
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,012
to let it all out.

432
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,890
And then, you can come to me.

433
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,821
So what you’re saying is

434
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:54,368
that you will offer me a great position
if I choose to be on your side?

435
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,998
Being on my side does not necessarily mean
that you are my person.

436
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,416
Well,

437
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,461
what is it that you expect from me?

438
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,297
Sincerity.

439
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,594
I need a man with honesty, integrity

440
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,515
and with many experiences
so he can handle any sly enemy.

441
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,434
Your Highness,

442
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,398
if you try to stretch a bowstring too far,
it will break.

443
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,068
You're right.

444
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,740
I would like you to guide me
to the right path just like you did now.

445
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,201
That is

446
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,078
what I expect from you.

447
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,001
I remember you saying
that you had two things to ask me.

448
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,753
What is the second one?

449
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,175
It’s about this lady.

450
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,179
A lady?

451
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,265
Yes.

452
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,602
I need your help

453
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,939
to make her stay with me.

454
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,296
What are you doing in here?

455
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,009
Eunuch Seong asked me
to bring the ledger to you, sir.

456
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,513
And then?

457
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,894
I saw this handkerchief
with white egret flower embroidery.

458
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,900
I see you know a lot about flowers.

459
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:54,405
Not many people know the name of this one.

460
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,033
It was my mother’s favorite.

461
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,828
Not only is it pretty,

462
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,122
but she also liked the message it conveys.

463
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,795
This flower was embroidered
on my old friend’s handkerchief

464
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,464
that he always carried around.

465
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,262
He said his wife gave it to him
before they got separated.

466
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,063
If you don’t have anything else you need,
I’ll excuse myself.

467
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,983
All right, you may go.

468
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,422
Are you sure this is not yours?

469
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,342
No, it’s not!
I know nothing about it, sir.

470
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,140
This was found in your cart.

471
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,100
Are you going to keep denying it?

472
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,645
I know nothing about it, sir.

473
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,147
She must be one of the rebels.

474
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,899
Take her
to the Royal Investigation Bureau!

475
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,109
-No, please!
-Yes, sir!

476
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,388
There is no evidence that shows
I took part in this treason!

477
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,682
We know that you’ve been secretly
communicating with the rebels

478
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,434
and aiding them with various supplies.

479
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,144
How dare you!

480
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:53,148
How is providing food
to the starving people considered treason?

481
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,985
They are no rebels nor rioters.

482
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,198
They are just people
suffering from famine!

483
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,661
Are you saying that I should have
just let them die out on the street?

484
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,247
Do you think that will do

485
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,458
any good for this country?

486
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,475
Father.

487
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,139
The uprising?

488
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,391
Did you lose your parents
during the uprising

489
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,934
that occurred ten years ago?

490
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:15,022
Yes. I lost my mother then.

491
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,193
How old are you?

492
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,153
I am 18 years old.

493
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,457
She is only ten years old.

494
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,753
That must be the reason why
they used her to deceive us!

495
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,382
You never know
how many of them are behind her!

496
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,636
There must be millions
of vicious rebels hiding out there!

497
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,513
That girl

498
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,142
probably cooperated with them
for some money or food.

499
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,686
She can’t even read.

500
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,315
There is no way she could have known
that it was about a serious matter.

501
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,401
All she wanted was some food.
She never intended to commit treason.

502
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,238
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

503
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,574
You need to listen to me, Crown Prince.

504
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,369
The very moment you let your guard down
is when the enemy is going to strike.

505
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,164
We need to make an example of her.

506
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,999
Hold her accountable
and punish her severely!

507
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,521
I...

508
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,774
want to stay here a little longer.

509
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,569
I'm curious to know

510
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,073
what has made you take the risk

511
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,159
and stay here.

512
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,495
I will not allow it.

513
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,333
He is my person.

514
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,848
I need to talk to you, Your Highness.

515
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,141
Come in.

516
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,524
I have been thinking

517
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,235
whether I should ask you a favor
as your subject

518
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,112
or tell you how determined I am

519
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,197
as your friend.

520
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,825
So,

521
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,369
what is your conclusion?

522
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,373
It depends entirely on you, Your Highness.

523
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,377
Why don't I hear you out first?

524
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,174
The Ministry of Rites has started
preparing for your marriage.

525
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,885
And?

526
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,095
Someone has to bear the pain

527
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,722
of seeing their love
marrying someone else.

528
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,140
Still,

529
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,101
that someone will put on a smile

530
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,520
for you.

531
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,484
What are you saying?

532
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,694
That someone

533
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,990
is the one I love.

534
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,376
I don't want to see her get hurt

535
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,837
because of your greed.

536
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,589
Actually,

537
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,133
I will not let that happen.

538
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,980
I heard you were asking for me.

539
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,660
Hong Ra-on.

540
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,958
Why did you not tell me?

541
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,088
Were you planning to hand her over
to the Crown Prince?

542
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,258
No, sir.

543
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,676
Then to whom?

544
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,637
Premier Kim?

545
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,518
She has been through a lot.

546
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,896
So I did not want her to go through

547
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,357
the same pain

548
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,776
I went through.

549
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,325
She knows nothing.

550
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,747
She cannot tell you anything
about Hong Gyeong-rae.

551
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,290
Please, sir.

552
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,042
Can we not

553
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,462
get her involved in this?

554
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,801
When I sent you off to the Crown Prince,

555
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,512
I told you many times

556
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,475
not to make any judgments
on your own and do as I say.

557
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,519
I told you that nobody is more dangerous

558
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,563
than an infiltrator
who acts with free will.

559
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,820
Stop.

560
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,645
Your Highness, here is a letter
from Master Jeong.

561
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,198
I found a way to grant your request.

562
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,451
Please arrange me a meeting with her.

563
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,491
Will you come with me?

564
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,976
Is he...

565
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,146
the leader of Baekwoon Group?

566
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,947
The man who brought me here
ten years ago...

567
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,117
Was that you, Chief Eunuch?

568
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,077
Yes.

569
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,789
I have been watching you.

570
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,879
On the day of the gathering
of Baekwoon Group,

571
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,257
in front of everyone,

572
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,803
we will present the daughter
of Hong Gyeong-rae.

573
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,741
JAHYEONDANG

574
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,463
Are you smiling
because you are happy to see me?

575
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,383
Yes.

576
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:26,638
Every time I look at you, it is like
we are meeting for the first time.

577
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,182
What do I do?

578
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,945
Why do you act like you do not know?

579
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,617
No.

580
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,079
Why do you act like you are okay?

581
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,377
Your Highness.

582
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,505
Do not push yourself.

583
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,969
There is no way out.

584
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,848
You cannot cry over it forever.

585
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,270
Why?

586
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,025
Were you going to put on a smile
in front of me

587
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,028
as if nothing is wrong
and disappear like sea-foam?

588
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,967
I found a way

589
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,928
for you to stay with me as my lady.

590
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:57,979
Pardon?

591
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,065
I do not like that story you told me.

592
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,651
I am going to change the ending.

593
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,821
Those two

594
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:11,534
lived happily ever after.

595
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,246
Just like us.

596
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,169
Your Highness.

597
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,364
There is someone we need to meet.

598
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,534
Meet me at the inner gate
at eight o'clock in the morning tomorrow.

599
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,119
Chief Eunuch.

600
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,205
What brings you here, sir?

601
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,541
I have been searching for you

602
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,128
for a long time.

603
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,838
Pardon?

604
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,216
For me?

605
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,430
I have something to tell you,

606
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,558
Ra-on.

607
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,777
How do you know my name, sir?

608
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,951
How did you know that his name...

609
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,460
is Hong Ra-on?
