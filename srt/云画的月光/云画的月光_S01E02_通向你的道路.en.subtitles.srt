1
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,437
Silver Spoon?

2
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,856
Jeong Deok-ho?

3
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,111
You think you can get away with this?

4
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,865
If I ever see you again,
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

5
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,826
Should you want me to be your dog,
I shall!

6
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,173
Good to see you again.

7
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,884
Puppy.

8
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,728
You made it out safely.

9
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:07,525
When I had to leave you there
it broke my heart.

10
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,404
It broke your heart?

11
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,407
I didn't know you were a palace guard.

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,578
No wonder why you looked so experienced
when you took out your sword.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,622
I can't believe

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,583
I called such a strong man
a "Silver Spoon."

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,211
-Goodness.
-Nothing's there.

16
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,047
Even if you sneak around like this,

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,675
there won't be any ditches or snakes.

18
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,306
You must've gone through a lot that day.

19
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,267
I made sure to
send someone quick to help you.

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,393
Did you?

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,438
He was fast,
but he must have been blind and deaf.

22
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,899
I had to scream until I lost my voice
for him to find me

23
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,651
even though he was nearby.

24
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,988
-Oh, dear.
-By the way, Jeong Deok-ho,

25
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,325
why are you here wearing a eunuch uniform?

26
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,660
Pardon?

27
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,750
Actually, my dream was to become a eunuch

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,628
-since when I was little.
-If that's true,

29
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,339
where are you going
with your stuff at this night?

30
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,926
I'm running an errand at the moment.

31
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,761
Well...

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,556
-For the chief eunuch.
-Oh, the chief eunuch.

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,016
Who goes there?

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,227
-Oh, goodness.
-Eunuch Seong.

35
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,271
It's me, Chief Lee.

36
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,440
Well, why...

37
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,318
Yes, Chief Lee, sir.

38
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,114
Sir, my foot.

39
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,119
I guess the Office of Eunuch Attendants
has a lot of work these days.

40
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,956
Seeing how he's running
an errand at this time of night.

41
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,793
And you, the head of the Office of Eunuch
Attendants, were the one who ordered him.

42
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,044
Out of all people...

43
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,212
Pardon?

44
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,592
I thought a scared eunuch trainee

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,844
was running away.

46
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,444
Seeing how your security is so tight,

47
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,572
I feel like I can always rely on
the Office of Eunuch Attendants.

48
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,453
Follow me.

49
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,422
Silver Spoon... Just hit me in the face.

50
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,384
Hit me, and let's forget about
what happened that day.

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,185
I shouldn't abuse my puppy.

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,313
I should be nice and play with him.

53
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,941
I'll see you around.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
Go puppy.

55
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,910
Go.

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,417
Go.

57
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,422
You made three mistakes at once.

58
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,716
First, you ran away. Second, you lied.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,637
Third, you got caught by
the most ill-tempered...

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,722
Goodness.

61
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,937
What a disgrace...

62
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,066
My apology.

63
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,152
Being in this unfamiliar place
made me feel scared so...

64
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,404
All right.

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,573
I'll fix that fear of yours

66
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,451
and turn you into a great eunuch.

67
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,997
You'll sleep here tonight.

68
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,668
Sir...

69
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,064
EUNUCH TRAINING INSTITUTE

70
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,698
Attention, everyone.

71
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,955
Eunuchs hold an important role

72
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,708
of taking care of the Royal Family.

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,837
We must become one.
We must become the King's hands and feet,

74
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,757
the King's lamp that lights his path,

75
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,968
and the King's shield
in moments of danger.

76
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,680
We share a common fate
to protect the royal family.

77
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,185
If anyone makes a mistake

78
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,104
which disgraces
the Office of Eunuch Attendants,

79
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,107
he will have to pay the price

80
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,486
with his life.

81
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,112
Keep this in mind.

82
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,074
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

83
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,629
One of them already wet his pants.

84
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,091
Do we have to frighten
new eunuchs like this every time?

85
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,220
It's better to keep them on their toes
from the start to make it easier later.

86
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,807
Is that right? Still, go easy on them.

87
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,351
You know well that
if they faint during the training,

88
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,229
they'll get teased for it

89
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,189
for a while.

90
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,025
Did anyone faint before?

91
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,072
It's none of your business.

92
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,032
I figured it out.

93
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,957
There will be a total of
three examinations.

94
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,876
They're the physical examination,
the written test

95
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,795
and the mentality test.

96
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,423
You'll be sent out of the palace
if you fail even one of them.

97
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,219
So be on your toes.

98
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,387
Do you understand?

99
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,721
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

100
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,058
I'm Ma Jong-ja,

101
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,643
and I'm in charge of your training.

102
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,856
I'm also called the public enemy
of the eunuch trainees.

103
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,152
I'll now begin the physical examination
from now on.

104
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,114
Move to the examination room
when your name is called.

105
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,616
-Kim Dal-geun.
-Yes.

106
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,201
Oh Dong-i.

107
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,494
Take your clothes off.

108
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,331
Pass.

109
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,000
Pass.

110
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,668
Fail.

111
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,964
Pass.

112
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,049
Pass.

113
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,177
Oh, sorry.

114
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,847
My apologies.

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,349
It's okay.

116
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,977
I'm also a eunuch trainee,
so you don't have to be so polite.

117
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,147
Okay.

118
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,276
He's 18 years old just like me.

119
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,613
What? I'm 18 years old too.

120
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,823
What?
Then the three of us are the same age.

121
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,535
Wait a second.
Why are you sweating so much?

122
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,247
Is it raining outside?

123
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,585
Is it raining really hard?
Is it monsoon season?

124
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,091
Do you not want to get checked up
by any chance?

125
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,470
Is there a way that I can avoid it?

126
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,681
Come on. Then are you...

127
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,974
What?

128
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,770
What... What do you mean?

129
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,231
Do you not like this palace?

130
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:47,068
Is that why you're complaining?

131
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,697
You're hilarious.

132
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,241
I like it so much.

133
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,326
Next.

134
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
Hong Sam-nom,

135
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,539
Do-gi, and Park Seong-yeol.

136
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,873
Yes, master.

137
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,125
-You're Hong Sam-nom, right?
-Wait...

138
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,212
Pass.

139
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,014
If anyone makes a mistake which disgraces
the Office of Eunuch Attendants,

140
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,893
he will have to pay the price
with his life.

141
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,478
Keep this in mind.

142
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,779
Take your clothes off.

143
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,830
Pass.

144
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,208
Pass.

145
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,299
What are you waiting for?
Take your pants off already.

146
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,758
Pardon?

147
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,762
Take it off.

148
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,975
Well...

149
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,020
Well...

150
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,522
I... I...

151
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,778
What are you saying?

152
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
We're in trouble.

153
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,752
The royal physician wants to
see you immediately!

154
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,669
What's the matter?

155
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,963
The Queen has collapsed!

156
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,257
What?

157
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,551
Let's go!

158
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,802
Master!

159
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,513
Master!

160
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,558
You should finish up before you go!

161
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,648
Park Seong-yeol and Do-gi. Pass.

162
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,107
Thank you.

163
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,611
HONG SAM-NOM
PASS, FAIL

164
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,907
Hong Sam-nom.

165
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,325
Yes?

166
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,998
More than half of the stamp is on "Pass."
So you pass.

167
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,375
-Here.
-Pardon?

168
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,834
Take it.

169
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,212
Thank you.

170
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,464
The rest of you will be re-examined

171
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,299
so wait outside! Go on!

172
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,553
Come on.

173
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,140
Are they trying to kill me or save me?

174
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,188
That was so quick!

175
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,607
That was way too quick!

176
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,486
How did they know already?

177
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,156
I heard the Queen had collapsed,
so I hurried over...

178
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,951
but they said she's pregnant.

179
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,206
Now, we just have to wait for the Queen
to give birth to a prince.

180
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,166
And then after that

181
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,044
we must make him the heir to the throne.

182
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,964
The current Crown Prince
gets away with everything

183
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,966
because he is the only one.

184
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,593
Look at what he goes around doing.

185
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,678
Goodness.

186
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,681
Dethroning him will be easy.

187
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,309
Would it really matter if
the horses on the game board

188
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,936
are cows or pigs?

189
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,355
The hand that moves the horse.

190
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,233
This hand...

191
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,610
is all that matters.

192
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,115
But, what if she doesn't
give birth to a son?

193
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,453
Well, even if that's the case,
this is the perfect timing

194
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,123
to tame the current Crown Prince.

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,133
This is the Crown Prince's palace
where the Crown Prince lives.

196
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,386
Have you heard the rumors
about this palace?

197
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,721
Which rumors?

198
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,805
Get out of here!

199
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,687
Wait!

200
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,273
Chief Eunuch Seong, are you all right?

201
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,903
Your foot. Your foot.

202
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,156
I apologize.

203
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,033
I told you to get out of here!

204
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,331
Where... where are you going? Wait!

205
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,587
-Are you all right?
-Don't get yourself involved.

206
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,755
I'm all right.

207
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,425
But the rumors were true. This palace is
known as "Crap Prince's Palace."

208
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,593
"Crap..."

209
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,846
If Eunuch Seong is treated like that,

210
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
what will happen to us trainees?

211
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,935
If you do anything foolish, you're dead.

212
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,395
But in the end, how we're treated

213
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,064
depends on how we perform.

214
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,526
Are we inside or outside
the Crap Prince's Palace?

215
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,777
-Out...
-Out...

216
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,739
Do you find that funny?

217
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,990
Isn't it?

218
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,951
Your Highness! Your Highness!

219
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,120
How could you kick out Eunuch Seong?

220
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,791
He only came to deliver the news
about the Queen's pregnancy.

221
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,711
Your Highness,
is it that difficult to say,

222
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,298
"Congratulations, Your Highness?"

223
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,925
Why don't you just...

224
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,385
That's enough.

225
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,095
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,225
Your Highness.

227
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,823
EIGHT YEARS EARLIER

228
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,678
Your Highness, what did you think?

229
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,931
When you moved your fingers like this,

230
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,268
it sounded like the leaves were fluttering

231
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,353
in the spring wind.

232
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,940
That's right. It's called a vibrato.

233
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,695
Would you like me to teach you
how to play?

234
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,113
Really?

235
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,535
But you must keep this
between the two of us.

236
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,621
Yes, Mother.

237
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,753
That's a vibrato.

238
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,513
Your Highness.

239
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,476
Oh, Premier Kim.

240
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,231
Are you here to see the Queen?

241
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,902
Yes, after hearing the news
about her pregnancy

242
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,904
I wanted to congratulate her.

243
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,615
I see.

244
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,994
I should take care of these things now

245
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,040
so that I won't suffer
the consequences later on.

246
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,210
I'll be going then.

247
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,140
I almost forgot what you looked like
because it's been so long.

248
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,019
But you are very handsome
every time I see you.

249
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,271
Are you that happy to see me?

250
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,442
It is always delightful
and exciting for a mother

251
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,569
to see her child.

252
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,073
A mother...

253
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,076
Don't you agree, Your Majesty?

254
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,830
Yes.

255
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,918
Look at how happy she is.
Visit her more often from now on.

256
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,840
May I really do that?

257
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,174
Crown Prince.

258
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,637
It is basic etiquette to visit
your parents

259
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,264
every morning.

260
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,767
How could you ask if you may do something

261
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,729
that you should have been doing all along?

262
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,980
My Queen.

263
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,607
Why, Your Majesty?

264
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,652
Do you mean to say that I'm not his mother

265
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,155
because I'm only five years older?

266
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm doing this for your sake
and my sister's sake

267
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,952
so please don't take it the wrong way.

268
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,163
What did you say?

269
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,665
They say that when you're pregnant,

270
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,001
you should only see and hear nice things

271
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,420
to have a beautiful baby.

272
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,966
I'm not sure...

273
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,344
if seeing me will do your baby any good.

274
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,805
Think about it.

275
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,227
What if you have another baby like me,
who'll give you headaches?

276
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,523
That wouldn't be good, would it?

277
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,358
Crown Prince.

278
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,906
Look. She looks displeased already.

279
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,869
I think it will be best if you don't see
me until you have your baby.

280
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,538
You may go.

281
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,917
I'll get going then.

282
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,920
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

283
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,839
I hope you have an enjoyable time.

284
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,442
Are they the new trainees?

285
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,238
Yes, they have a written exam today.

286
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,621
What happens if they don't pass the test?

287
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,914
They'll...

288
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,751
probably get kicked out of the palace
before they can become a eunuch.

289
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,213
-Really?
-Yes.

290
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,591
If that's true...

291
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,219
where are you going
with your stuff at this night?

292
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,972
I'm sure you're not running away

293
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,349
after your dream of becoming
a eunuch came true.

294
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,396
Eunuch Jang?

295
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,356
Yes.

296
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,196
Wait, Your Highness. Not here.

297
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,118
Your Highness.

298
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,382
If you cheat

299
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,677
or display any suspicious behavior,

300
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,180
you will be kicked out immediately.
Do you understand?

301
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,681
-Yes, Master!
-Yes, Master!

302
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,308
Okay!

303
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,976
You may begin!

304
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,441
It may seem like I'm just sitting here,

305
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,567
but I can see you.

306
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,319
I can see everything.

307
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,073
If I catch you doing
anything foolish, I'll...

308
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,898
THREE

309
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,824
FOUR

310
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,078
THREE

311
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,832
It's three.

312
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,419
What are you doing here?

313
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,468
Goodness.

314
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,221
You won't be able to pass
the test like this.

315
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,599
You're aware
that you'll have to leave the palace

316
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,018
if you fail at least once, right?

317
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,360
Were you a eunuch?

318
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,654
You were wearing
a palace guard uniform then.

319
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,614
Maybe you were mistaken
because it was dark.

320
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,199
Go ahead and mark your answer.

321
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,535
It's three.

322
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,755
I came here
because I just couldn't turn a blind eye

323
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,924
to your lifelong dream to be a eunuch.

324
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,261
Don't worry and trust me.

325
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,674
Do it again.

326
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,595
It looks good. Submit it.

327
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,440
HONG SAM-NOM

328
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,608
Pass.

329
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,902
Congratulations.

330
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,329
This is the last test
given to the eunuch trainees.

331
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,625
You'll take one of the questions
presented by eunuchs.

332
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,003
The King and the Queen

333
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,924
will examine the answers of the trainees

334
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,134
who applied to serve them.

335
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,304
Will we have to leave the palace

336
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,056
if they fail us?

337
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,516
Of course.

338
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,561
Next.

339
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,359
I'll be able to leave the palace
if I submit a blank sheet this time.

340
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,448
It's such a strange question.

341
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,826
-Let me see.
-Take a look.

342
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,120
"He lost his appetite.

343
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,997
He doesn't talk much,
and he doesn't sleep either.

344
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,667
He laughs, cries, then gets angry,

345
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,586
but even a royal physician
doesn't know why."

346
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,672
I won't get kicked out for this

347
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,299
after all my effort to become a eunuch.

348
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,553
I know the answer.

349
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,055
Really?

350
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,024
There's no such woman.

351
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,279
I don't know where she went, but there is.

352
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,199
Whether she's beautiful or ugly,

353
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,578
every woman wants to look pretty

354
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,121
especially if she is

355
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,874
in front of a handsome man like you.

356
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,418
Whatever she wears,
be it an armor or a men's robe,

357
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,546
I can still recognize a woman's figure.

358
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,011
What did you do
to make your superiors hate you?

359
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,639
You'll stay in Jahyeondang
for the time being.

360
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,979
Who lives in that place?

361
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,439
No one lives there.

362
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,437
Byeong-yeon, are you inside?

363
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,621
Puppy?

364
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,123
Do you know him?

365
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,758
Okay. That's enough.

366
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,726
Good job. You may leave now.

367
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,816
You say that women's bodies
are most beautiful

368
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,194
and that they give you
the artistic inspiration.

369
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,281
But why can't you embrace them?

370
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,409
By any chance,

371
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,954
do you have an unspeakable reason for it?

372
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,131
Unlike this candlelight,

373
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,178
my heart isn't swayed.

374
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,934
It's not my type to do something

375
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,603
when I don't feel like it.

376
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,204
How was your trip?

377
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,624
Yes, it was not bad.

378
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,336
I heard the news when I came back.

379
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,422
I heard the Queen is pregnant.

380
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,883
Does everyone in the capital
talk about it?

381
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,720
It may be good for you to stop
coming here. At least for the time being.

382
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,973
Will I be safe

383
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,934
if I live quietly?

384
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,114
This isn't a place for trainees.
Go back to your residence.

385
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,533
I don't have a place to stay
in the eunuch's residence

386
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,161
thanks to someone.

387
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,790
And you passed all the tests
thanks to that someone.

388
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,378
You don't have to be so grateful.

389
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,300
What on earth is your identity?

390
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,469
Are you a palace guard or a eunuch?

391
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,596
You appear here and there.

392
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,890
And who are you?

393
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,018
Are you the ghost who lives in this place?

394
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,029
How dare you touch him?

395
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,615
What?

396
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,369
It's okay, Chief Kim.

397
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,583
Goodness.

398
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,309
Look.

399
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,691
Silver Spoon has met his new lover

400
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,276
and is so happy now.

401
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:05,160
What should be a good way to train
a spoiled puppy?

402
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,078
There's no drink left.

403
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,456
-A severe training.
-Right?

404
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,957
Like this.

405
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,173
Roll to the left. Roll to the right.

406
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,009
Sit down. Stand up.

407
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,261
Bark.

408
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,305
That's how I should train him.

409
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,643
You'll be sent out of the palace
if you fail even one of them.

410
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,898
Right, I'm going to leave the palace soon.

411
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,692
So why should I hold back?

412
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,295
Are you coming home now? You're late.

413
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,172
Yes, Grandfather.

414
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,007
Have a seat.

415
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,395
Yun-seong.

416
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,525
Is the position that's been
given to you too low,

417
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,443
that it's boring you?

418
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,195
Not at all.

419
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,657
"One who fails to take responsibility
for a low position

420
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,492
will never succeed."

421
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,537
That's what you've taught me.

422
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,705
Yes, that's right.

423
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,542
You must take one step at a time

424
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,629
so that you won't waver
once you get to the top.

425
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,673
Do you remember that?

426
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,468
Yes, I always keep that
in mind, Grandfather.

427
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,305
I painted something grand
with you in mind.

428
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,641
That's why I'm saying this.

429
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,936
However,

430
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,607
what is the purpose of your paintings?

431
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,612
Is it for fame, honor,
your family's authority,

432
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,573
or the future of this country?

433
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,828
I asked you what you're painting them for

434
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,039
I just...

435
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,918
paint for the sake of painting.

436
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,714
Do you feel safe
or happy in your hollow life

437
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,300
when you paint those prostitutes?

438
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,102
Forget it.

439
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,315
It's not like a tiger without its claws

440
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,358
will ever become the King.

441
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:48,406
Yun-seong, if you ever want to paint,
let me know.

442
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,409
I'll call over as many prostitutes
as you want,

443
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,953
whether it's tens or hundreds
of them. Okay?

444
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,878
These are pretty good. I like them.

445
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,721
Your Highness, it's time for bed.

446
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,810
Wait, what is this? Are you hurt?

447
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,228
I got bitten by a dog.

448
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,480
That little...

449
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,651
How did you run into such a crazy dog

450
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,361
that dared to bite you?

451
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,867
I know, right?

452
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,079
How did I run into a punk like that

453
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,456
who dared to bite me?

454
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,672
Where did Silver Spoon go?

455
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,632
Did he go home?

456
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,384
Then why aren't you...

457
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,973
It's better that you don't know
who he is or where he went.

458
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,599
Why?

459
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,866
EUNUCH TRAINING INSTITUTE

460
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,165
Are you sure this is right?

461
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,962
You can trust me on this one.

462
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,137
Hong Sam-nom!

463
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,888
Yes?

464
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
Did you just hand in a blank paper?

465
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,061
This will get you kicked out
of the palace.

466
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,855
Are you sure you won't regret it?

467
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,899
Yes.

468
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,486
I couldn't find the answer.

469
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,449
You may go.

470
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,749
Hey, you should have
at least tried to guess or something.

471
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,501
How could you hand in a blank paper?

472
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,962
There's nothing I can do now.

473
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,926
I see you're leaving on the dot.

474
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,428
Trainees.

475
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,305
Come here.

476
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,768
You are coming with me
to Premier Kim's feast.

477
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,400
Did the Minister of War not come
to the palace today?

478
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,321
Your Majesty, I've already told you

479
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:37,742
that he postponed the meeting
because he is feeling ill.

480
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,495
That's right.

481
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,914
I asked just in case.

482
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,751
The palace is so quiet

483
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,339
that I feel like I can hear the sounds
from Premier Kim's feast.

484
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,346
Send him plenty of rare
alcohol and snacks.

485
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,975
The purpose of that feast is
to congratulate the Queen

486
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,436
on her pregnancy, after all.

487
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,696
-Byeong-yeon.
-Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,283
Shall we go to a feast?

489
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,537
That looks good.

490
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,498
I need you to help them make pancakes

491
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,793
and I need you to help them
cook over there. Go on.

492
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,504
-Eunuch Seong, you're here.
-Thank you for your efforts.

493
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,049
We need someone to catch
a few chickens for us.

494
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,093
I happen to have one more
trainee right here.

495
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,970
You go.

496
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,974
If you go around that way,
you'll find a door to the mountain.

497
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,392
Yes, Master.

498
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,939
Is the chicken coop in the mountains
instead of a farm?

499
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,025
You'll see when you get there.

500
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,652
Catch two...

501
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,737
No, catch 20 chickens and bring them here.

502
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,030
Twenty chickens?

503
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,367
How will I catch that many?

504
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,579
I don't care what method
you use to catch them.

505
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,999
But if you don't bring them here
in an hour, you'll be punished.

506
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,375
Go on!

507
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,210
Please follow me.

508
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,713
Eunuch Seong.

509
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,257
Our master cherishes those
chickens very much,

510
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,717
so if he actually catches 20...

511
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,511
How can he catch that many?
There's no way.

512
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,848
I'm just trying to punish him
for his bad manners

513
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,474
so look the other way.

514
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,393
Yes, sir.

515
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:58,716
-Young Master!
-Congratulations, Young Master!

516
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,801
Please accept this, Young Master!

517
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,595
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

518
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,389
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

519
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,486
I'm sick of this.

520
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,697
I wish to be struck by lightning.

521
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,964
My wish came true...

522
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,507
after all.

523
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,184
Your Highness.

524
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,520
These are the answer sheets to the exam
that the trainees wrote.

525
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,150
The eunuchs from each building
came up with questions

526
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,403
regarding issues that we consider
our biggest concerns.

527
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,825
You can look through them and pass
the ones that seem all right.

528
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,412
Are you sure you don't want to
check them over?

529
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,085
Give it to me.

530
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:52,181
How... How dare he?

531
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,983
I was right, after all.

532
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,197
Yes, you're right. I'm the guy
who disguised himself.

533
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,449
That's not what I'm talking about.

534
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,996
What else is there?

535
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,182
Are you really a eunuch?

536
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,186
That's right.

537
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,689
Is there a fake eunuch then?

538
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,774
Have you

539
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,402
really become a eunuch?

540
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,490
You're looking down on me

541
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,451
because I don't have a complete body.

542
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,870
"Eunuchs aren't men."

543
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,788
Is that what you want to say?

544
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,415
No.

545
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,377
Then are you saying that a person like me

546
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,797
who get chased by thugs
doesn't have the right to be a eunuch?

547
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,257
No.

548
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,259
Then what's the problem?

549
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,726
It's not fair for a eunuch
to be this beautiful.

550
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,690
Then again, men can also be beautiful.

551
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,109
I didn't mean anything by it.

552
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,746
He must be exhausted by now.

553
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,835
That crazy brat caught
all 20 mountain chickens.

554
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,214
He caught all these precious chickens.
Is he out of his mind?

555
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,133
You caught
all our precious mountain chickens.

556
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,845
Are you out of your mind?

557
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,145
-Here.
-Let's drink.

558
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,278
Look how happy they are.

559
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,697
They should drink
when they're in a good mood.

560
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,699
They're not happy because they're drunk.

561
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,244
They're excited because of the fact

562
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,162
that they've won your favor.

563
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,251
A long line of people couldn't
come in this house and had to go back,

564
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,420
so no wonder why they're so excited.

565
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,507
Even a flying bird

566
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,510
wouldn't want to rest on a sick tree.

567
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,639
Are you talking about the sick tree
in the palace?

568
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,236
All right.

569
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,614
I hope you enjoy your time all you want

570
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,950
under the shadow of the large tree.

571
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,618
How nice.

572
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,036
Let us drink.

573
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,838
-What?
-What's going on?

574
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,391
That...

575
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,480
What are you waiting for? Chase that man.

576
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,940
-Yes, master.
-Yes, master.

577
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,930
Put down your swords.
He's the Crown Prince.

578
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,810
Put down your swords
and show your courtesy

579
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,896
to the Crown Prince.

580
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,110
Over there.

581
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,508
Your Highness,

582
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,261
what brings you here outside the palace?

583
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,390
I shouldn't miss out
on a party with drinks and music.

584
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,185
The Queen is pregnant

585
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,604
with my younger sibling.

586
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,816
I just wanted to share
a celebratory drink with you.

587
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,734
Is that so weird?

588
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,029
Thank you.

589
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,534
But what is going on with the party?

590
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,663
An unwelcome guest caused a commotion.

591
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,471
"There are gods on the ground.

592
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,057
They're the officials.

593
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,270
The subjects are innocent

594
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,106
except for being poor.

595
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,903
The officials have exploited the subjects.

596
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,906
Thus, the subjects are poor

597
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,826
because of the officials."

598
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,039
Is this right?

599
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,420
What do you think, everyone?

600
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,133
WOON

601
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,802
The poverty of the subjects isn't
because of the officials.

602
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,263
It's the King's fault

603
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,807
for not managing the officials properly.

604
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,275
I was just joking.

605
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,611
There is no need to take it so seriously.

606
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,654
Now,

607
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,199
congratulating the Queen's pregnancy,

608
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,495
why don't you pour me a drink?

609
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,755
Your Highness.

610
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,512
May I pour you a drink?

611
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,022
What's the ruckus?

612
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,191
An arrow flew in the feast.

613
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,693
Now, the Crown Prince is here.

614
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,655
Where? Let me see.

615
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,705
-What are you doing here? Go back to work.
-Yes, sir.

616
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,795
Long time no see.

617
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,213
Yes, Your Highness.

618
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,299
I was going to greet you
after coming back from the Qing.

619
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,301
There's no need.

620
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,264
I don't think we are close enough
to greet each other.

621
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,059
You're still obvious when you lie.

622
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,897
And you're still so cold to me.

623
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,068
Are you upset?

624
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,404
I can't say that I'm not

625
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,156
-because we were...
-Friends.

626
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,303
How do you like it?
You want to have a drink as well?

627
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,724
Why?

628
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,727
You won't
because I'm not your friend anymore?

629
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,107
No palace guard can have a drink
while guarding the Crown Prince.

630
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,193
Right.

631
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,572
You're still a loyal servant
and close friend...

632
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,034
of the Crown Prince.

633
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,551
He's much more of a Crown Prince material
than the real Crown Prince.

634
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,554
The only thing Yun-seong lacks

635
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,723
is that he's from the Kim family,

636
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,184
not the Lee family.

637
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,569
8 YEARS AGO

638
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,328
That was close.

639
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,413
-Did you see him?
-Yes, sir.

640
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,793
I carefully observed
every inch of His Highness.

641
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,087
What is he like?

642
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:30,133
His kind appearance might look weak,

643
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:34,304
but he's brave and competitive
on the inside.

644
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,307
I could read the grace of the Royal Family

645
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,226
in his face.

646
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,563
However,

647
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,190
there is one thing...

648
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,485
What is it?
Don't hesitate and tell me what it is.

649
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,570
Well...

650
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,990
I'm afraid His Highness
is destined to live short.

651
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,620
Also, I felt this unusual energy

652
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,956
from one of the Crown Prince's friends.

653
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,127
He had a warm heart, an unyielding spirit,

654
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,423
and all lineaments
fit to become a great king.

655
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,635
There was a crane embroidered on his...

656
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:18,432
How dare you! You shouldn't be saying
such a horrible thing.

657
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,225
However,

658
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,186
But I cannot lie to you.

659
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,232
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

660
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,111
Don't you dare tell anyone about this.

661
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,697
If you do, I'll kill you.
Do you understand?

662
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,781
Yes, sir.

663
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,825
I won't tell anyone.

664
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,244
I'll remember that, Premier Kim.

665
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,544
Yun-seong.

666
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,004
Oh, Grandfather.

667
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,353
He certainly had the face of a great king.

668
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,327
It was perfect.

669
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,039
The Crown Prince showed up
right after the arrow was shot.

670
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,339
Stop looking at me. This is an order.

671
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,507
Yes, Your Highness.

672
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,178
The man who shot that arrow...

673
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,639
was wearing a mask, wasn't he?

674
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,141
Did you see that?

675
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,145
Who could it be?

676
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,367
Okay.

677
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,577
Do you know what this is?

678
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,331
This is a rare chicken from
Premier Kim's feast.

679
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,999
Premier Kim?

680
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,252
Take it away.

681
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,629
Look at you.

682
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,048
You still have no appreciation
for a person's sincerity.

683
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,510
This is probably the last gift
you'll ever get from me.

684
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,012
What?

685
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,309
It seems like something upset you today.

686
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,520
Here.

687
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,065
If you're hungry too,
you'll feel even sadder.

688
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,485
Do you feel sad when you're hungry?

689
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,281
Not everyone is like you.

690
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,285
Don't jump to conclusions
based on your low standards.

691
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,163
I've never been hungry in my life.

692
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,879
Maybe you've never been hungry...

693
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,132
but I bet you've been heartbroken
many times before.

694
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,217
What?

695
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,804
It's very easy to comfort
someone who's hungry.

696
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:08,476
But, it's not easy comforting
someone who's heartbroken.

697
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:13,148
They usually lie and act like
they're okay.

698
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,443
That's enough.

699
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:22,324
How about you share some affection
with someone with a big heart?

700
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,327
Okay.

701
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,955
As the person with the biggest
heart in this region,

702
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,416
I'd like to...

703
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,627
give you my affection.

704
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,183
If you don't have an appetite,
it's not because of food.

705
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:52,103
If you lack energy,
it's not because you're ill.

706
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,358
There is no medicine
that will cure your pain.

707
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,819
This isn't something you can overcome,

708
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,948
but it's something you must endure.

709
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,493
Don't think about it as love
that you couldn't have,

710
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,621
but think about it as love

711
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,957
that you can cherish in your heart.

712
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,001
It wasn't love that I couldn't have...

713
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,130
but it was love that I can
cherish in my heart.

714
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:27,013
He said something like that, too.

715
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,882
Is anyone out there?

716
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:11,599
By the way, I saw the crown prince
earlier today.

717
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,809
-What?
-What?

718
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,729
His Highness?

719
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,277
Not his face. I just saw
the back of his head.

720
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:30,952
Do you happen to know
the Crown Prince's nickname?

721
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,121
Oh, geez.

722
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,708
What is it? "Flower Prince?"

723
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,043
Crap Prince's Palace.

724
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,630
I knew it! Everyone knows!

725
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,299
What else?

726
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,508
"Half-Human, Half-Beast."

727
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,970
That's right. The Crown Prince

728
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,557
possesses the blood
of a human and a beast.

729
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:56,352
And he's a like a crazy dog
that doesn't know when to bark

730
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,064
-or when not to bark...
-That's enough! Eat this.

731
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:05,403
But is he really that ill-tempered?

732
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,780
Damn it.

733
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,203
Did you laugh?

734
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,039
I just thought he had a problem
with his face.

735
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,709
I didn't laugh.

736
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,461
I saw it, Chief Kim.

737
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,506
I guess you find
the Crown Prince's nicknames funny.

738
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,928
I think the food went down the wrong pipe.

739
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,513
What's the matter?

740
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,682
By the way, what did you think
of the Crown Prince's back?

741
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,559
It was quite a sight.

742
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,737
"Hong Sam-nom, you failed."

743
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,990
"Yes, Eunuch Seong."

744
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,870
Are you Hong Sam-nom?

745
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,594
Did you write this?

746
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,189
Yes.

747
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,817
Then...

748
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,488
did you write this, too?

749
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,410
This...

750
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,412
This is...

751
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,418
How dare you...

752
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,297
mock me by writing a letter
for someone else?

753
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,592
How dare you...

754
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,387
How dare you mock the princess?

755
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,224
Pardon?

756
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,812
The princess?

757
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,114
I have committed a mortal sin!

758
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,284
I'm glad you know that.

759
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,707
Your Highness!

760
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,543
Okay.

761
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,588
I'll give you what you asked for.

762
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,303
Stop.

763
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,414
Your Highness!

764
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,545
Do you know
what I am most thankful for you, sir?

765
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,005
I pretend I do not know the truth.

766
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,799
Isn't that it?

767
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,343
You don't deserve to be king!

768
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,012
No. No!

769
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,223
What are you so afraid of
that you cannot do anything?

770
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,143
You should have done something
instead of shuddering in fear!

771
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,187
Shut your mouth
and take what the eunuch gave you.

772
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,445
I will order the Crown Prince
to be my regent.

773
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:19,574
-We beg of you, Your Majesty.
-We beg of you, Your Majesty.
