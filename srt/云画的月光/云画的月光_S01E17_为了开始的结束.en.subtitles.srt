1
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,159
Byeong-yeon.

2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,417
Arrest him immediately!

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,255
No one...

4
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,048
No one move!

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,313
His Highness' safety is the top priority.

6
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,398
Make way, all of you!

7
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,472
Ra-on.

8
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,746
It will be a difficult fight.

9
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,708
But I must learn

10
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,588
the identity of Baekwoon Group
and the wall that separates me...

11
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,092
from my people.

12
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,432
It is beyond that wall.

13
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,023
The country you dream of,

14
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,858
Your Highness.

15
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,404
Is that so?

16
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,074
I long

17
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,329
to see it, Your Highness.

18
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,167
Then you must help.

19
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,423
Forgive me,

20
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,470
Your Highness.

21
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,641
Byeong-yeon.

22
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,103
I truly believe

23
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,982
Baekwoon Group's ideal Joseon

24
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,278
is no different from yours, Your Highness.

25
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,371
Beyond the wall
between you and your people,

26
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,044
and the country you will build...

27
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,801
I long to see it.

28
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,576
Do not withdraw your sword.

29
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,415
The moment you withdraw,

30
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,711
I will lose you.

31
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,053
Your Highness.

32
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,555
Do not withdraw your sword.

33
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,352
That is an order.

34
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,443
Your Highness, I apologize...

35
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,240
for disobeying...

36
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,996
your order.

37
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,917
No.

38
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,268
No.

39
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,990
Stop.

40
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,990
Byeong-yeon.

41
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,788
Move out of the way.

42
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,504
Your Majesty.

43
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,713
Escort His Majesty.

44
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,304
Out of the way, I said!

45
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,727
Byeong-yeon.

46
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,733
Do not forget.

47
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,489
If I had to trust

48
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,327
only one person in the world

49
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,042
without a doubt,

50
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,839
it is you.

51
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,930
Thank you...

52
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,478
for trusting me,

53
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,487
my friend.

54
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,724
Byeong-yeon.

55
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,526
Byeong-yeon.

56
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,488
Byeong-yeon.

57
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,059
May we be nothing

58
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,478
but friends

59
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,814
in our last moment.

60
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,831
Halt.

61
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,213
Why are you leaving
the palace at this hour?

62
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,597
Open the gates.

63
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,647
His Majesty's ordered us

64
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,149
to take the prisoner
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

65
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,777
Chief Eunuch.

66
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,279
Yes, sir.

67
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,656
Open the gates.

68
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,999
Traitors! Close the gates!

69
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,001
Catch them!

70
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,053
Hurry.

71
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,473
-Ra-on.
-Hurry.

72
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,855
What are you doing? Come on!

73
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,941
I will try to buy you some time.

74
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,902
Chief Eunuch.

75
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,031
What are you doing? Hurry and take them.

76
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,576
-We must go.
-No.

77
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,606
We need to go now.

78
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
Wait, we just need a moment.

79
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,504
Wait...

80
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,057
Look...

81
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,268
He is an old friend of mine.

82
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,438
Can you let me take him from here?

83
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,690
-I can't...
-Wait.

84
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,455
Chief Kim.

85
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,668
A MONTH LATER

86
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,921
Your Highness, are you awake?

87
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,758
Your Highness?

88
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,803
Are you awake?

89
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,015
Your Highness.

90
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,476
Are you awake?

91
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,355
Your...

92
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,068
Your Highness.

93
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,365
Of course you’re not awake.

94
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,783
You’re not even here.

95
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,161
I assume you didn't go to study.

96
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,997
That's fine.

97
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,001
Whatever happens, I’m the one
that’s going to be scolded.

98
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,919
Worry not, Your Highness.

99
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,007
Let's go get scolded.

100
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,550
Let's go...

101
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,901
This must be your first time here.

102
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,778
Is it?

103
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,656
I'm always drunk,

104
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,242
so I don't remember.

105
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,204
Come often from now on, okay?

106
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,833
I'll think about it.

107
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,090
The Crown Prince

108
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,968
is not joining the meeting again?

109
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,847
His Highness went against your orders

110
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,182
in the courtyard,

111
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,185
and now he’s not even

112
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,937
taking responsibility in his job.

113
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,731
Your Majesty

114
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,149
what you have there is

115
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,736
only a small portion of a huge pile of
letters of appeal

116
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,571
asking the Crown Prince to be dethroned.

117
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,907
I remember saying

118
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,742
not to bring that up again.

119
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,327
But we need to.

120
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,997
Please don’t risk making the situation

121
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,249
worse for the country, Your Majesty.

122
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,380
The Crown Prince is not the one

123
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,173
making things worse.

124
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,305
You kept questioning his relationship
with Baekwoon Group,

125
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,349
nitpicking every little thing
that he does.

126
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,184
And even made the students

127
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,104
pile up letters about those matters.

128
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,439
That is exactly my point.

129
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,068
Your Majesty.

130
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,070
Everyone has lost

131
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,322
all their faith in the Crown Prince.

132
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,659
He has been visiting the kisaeng parlor

133
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,619
more often than he joins us in meetings.

134
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,832
Your Majesty, please set things right

135
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,167
by dethroning the Crown Prince

136
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,586
and enthroning a new heir.

137
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,338
That is what everyone is asking.

138
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,718
-Please understand us.
-Please understand us.

139
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,429
-Please understand us.
-Please understand us.

140
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,224
-Please understand us.
-Please understand us.

141
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,978
-Please understand us.
-Please understand us.

142
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,819
Come again, sir.

143
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,490
-He’s so cold.
-He is.

144
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,658
Hey, look.

145
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,122
Come over here!

146
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,469
How is the Prince doing?

147
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,096
He's fine.

148
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,849
I can feel he’s getting stronger
every day.

149
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,685
That is good.

150
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,605
He'll soon become the new Crown Prince.

151
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,398
He must stay strong.

152
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,359
That's another virtue to greatly uphold.

153
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,321
Pardon?

154
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,866
Father, what did you...

155
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,452
What did you just say?

156
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,746
Why are you so surprised?

157
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,500
The Crown Prince’s Palace
will be vacant very soon.

158
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,752
Be prepared for that.

159
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,505
Are you sure?

160
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,839
Of course.

161
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,717
Soon, everything will fall into places.

162
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,803
Yes, Father.

163
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,930
I’ll be prepared.

164
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,319
It is about

165
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,906
a newborn baby that was
sneaked out of the palace recently.

166
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,409
What if that baby is still alive?

167
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,830
Would that change things?

168
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,753
Your Highness, this is Eunuch Seong.

169
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,505
Come in.

170
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,531
Byeong-yeon.

171
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,826
It's me.

172
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,502
Just when...

173
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,506
are you going to answer me?

174
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,428
How is Byeong-yeon?

175
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,805
Is he doing okay?

176
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,227
His wounds are almost healed, but...

177
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,440
Maybe he needs more rest.

178
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,194
He has been through a lot.

179
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,741
He probably needs some time
before seeing you.

180
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,539
How about Ra-on?

181
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,085
Any words from her?

182
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,296
No.

183
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,177
Are you disappointed?

184
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,097
No.

185
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,183
It’s better this way.

186
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,435
I’m having lots of fun, aren’t I?

187
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,439
Chasing tails.

188
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:23,073
I’ve been keeping track of money, land,
and all the personal connections

189
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,242
of Premier Kim's family.

190
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,452
I see.

191
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,205
However...

192
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,959
Even if you catch the tail,
that doesn’t mean it’s over.

193
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,254
They can easily cut the tail off
and run away.

194
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,506
So watch out.

195
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,510
I will. Thank you.

196
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,393
My preparations are almost done.

197
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,228
I hope that

198
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,065
you'll be prepared to take over
the new position.

199
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,496
How did it go?

200
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,958
It was...

201
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,377
Your Highness.

202
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,841
What did you find out?

203
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,468
Your Highness.

204
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,636
It seems like

205
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,805
everything the Chief of Ministry of Rites
said is true.

206
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,725
Are you sure?

207
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,979
So the baby...

208
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,983
is still alive?

209
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,693
I'm afraid so.

210
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,698
The kisaengs were really taking care of

211
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,658
a baby together.

212
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,513
Being dethroned

213
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,473
is not necessarily a bad thing.

214
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,103
There are plenty of dethroned Princes
who lived a long and happy life

215
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,480
enjoying their hobbies, such as hunting.

216
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,028
If you really think about it,
that could be a better path to choose

217
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,447
rather than becoming the King.

218
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,538
That does sound very tempting,
but there is one thing

219
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,915
stopping me from doing so.

220
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,423
That is you,

221
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,509
Premier Kim.

222
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,556
I cannot leave this court

223
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,184
while you remain here.

224
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,749
Grandfather.

225
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,255
Did anyone follow you?

226
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,467
No, I checked several times.
No one followed.

227
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,761
Good.

228
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,641
You did well.

229
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,938
My mother told me.

230
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,610
Is Chief Kim really here?

231
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,990
Is he really alive?

232
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,579
He is still unconscious,
but he is getting better.

233
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,001
What a relief.

234
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,295
Thank heavens.

235
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,716
Follow me.

236
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,522
Chief Kim.

237
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,193
It's me, Sam-nom.

238
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,365
Aren't you going to get up
and say hi to me?

239
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,040
It must have been tough

240
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,668
to live with secrets.

241
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,964
Is that why you are sleeping for so long?

242
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,348
Autumn will pass soon.

243
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,852
You must wake up

244
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,938
before all the leaves are gone.

245
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,412
Chief Kim.

246
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,873
What does the palace look like

247
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,960
when the snow falls?

248
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,590
The big garden of Jahyeondang

249
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,053
and the low rooftops
covered in white snow...

250
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,266
must be beautiful.

251
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,353
It's Beautiful.

252
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,360
Very beautiful.

253
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,239
Chief Kim.

254
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,075
Are you awake?

255
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,536
What a fuss.

256
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,040
You never stop talking.

257
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,421
Chief Kim.

258
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,257
That hurts.

259
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,053
Chief Kim.

260
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,871
JAHYEONDANG

261
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,807
Okay.

262
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,310
As the person with the biggest
heart in this region,

263
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,938
I'd like to.

264
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,440
give you my affection.

265
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,826
Do you happen to know
the Crown Prince's nickname?

266
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,036
Oh, geez.

267
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,748
What is it? "Flower Prince"?

268
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,417
Crap Prince's Palace.

269
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,504
I knew it! Everyone knows!

270
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,839
Damn it.

271
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,177
Did you laugh?

272
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,515
I just thought he had a problem
with his face.

273
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,927
Are you disappointed

274
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,888
because it's me?

275
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,848
No.

276
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,976
I was only startled.

277
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,231
I had a lot on my mind
for the past few days.

278
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,567
Is it because of the wedding?

279
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,321
I found out about the lady

280
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,532
who has captured your heart.

281
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,917
I became the Crown Princess consort
as part of an agreement.

282
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,170
Now I am asking for something beyond that.

283
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,923
It must sound ridiculous.

284
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,594
That is why

285
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,430
I decided to do what I'm supposed to do.

286
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,853
I cannot bring you comfort like she could,

287
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,232
but I can be your faithful assistant

288
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,984
to help you remain as the Crown Prince.

289
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,699
For I am the one
who will stand by your side

290
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,744
until the very end.

291
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,983
Why did you summon me?

292
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,318
Don't you already know?

293
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,990
Soon, when the Crown Prince is dethroned,

294
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,034
my prince and I will become
the ruler of this land

295
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
and you dare show such disrespect?

296
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,498
Your Majesty.

297
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,793
I mean, dear Aunt.

298
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,507
Although I hate to admit it,
the only reason

299
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,926
I looked the other way

300
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,179
was because you are my kin.

301
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,352
I thought you might ask for her
at least once.

302
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,275
The child of the King

303
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,903
you brutally abandoned for power.

304
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,199
Shut your mouth.

305
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,827
Confess to your sins.

306
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,997
This is the last chance

307
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,416
I am willing to give you.

308
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,888
Your Highness, there isn't much time.

309
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,682
You must enter the executive office.

310
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,935
Hold on.

311
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,900
Your Highness, Royal Guard Chief
Jeong Deok-ho wishes to see you.

312
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,120
So, what happened?

313
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,707
He was caught at the ferry
as he was fleeing from the capital.

314
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,376
The man who recruited the assassins

315
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,211
is him.

316
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,591
Now, I'm ready.

317
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,052
Let's go.

318
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,768
Even after all the recent scandal,
His Highness shows no sign of remorse.

319
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,770
Judging from his frequent visits

320
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,231
to the kisaeng parlor
and furthermore, gambling.

321
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,736
He abandoned his duty
and dishonored the Royal Family.

322
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,363
This has to come to a stop immediately.

323
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,085
Your Majesty,
the Crown Prince has arrived.

324
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,713
Let him in.

325
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,408
My prince,

326
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,912
did you leave the palace
in disguise again?

327
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,959
Where did you go?

329
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,672
Like Minister of Public Administration
has mentioned, I was

330
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,800
at the kisaeng parlor
and the gambling house.

331
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,479
I was told listening to the people
is the key to become a great King.

332
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,400
But I could hear nothing from this palace.

333
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,361
For that reason,

334
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,573
I stayed up all night with the people
and listened to their advice.

335
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,492
People you've mentioned.

336
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,953
Are they kisaengs and gamblers?

337
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,458
That's right.

338
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,335
Why do you ask?

339
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,003
Is there a problem?

340
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,048
Your Majesty,

341
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,510
we cannot allow this behavior.

342
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,097
Everyone from the State Council,
the Six Ministries, and the three Offices

343
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,058
are asking the Crown Prince
to be dethroned.

344
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,727
Your Majesty.

345
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,646
We all ask of you,

346
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,233
to dethrone the Crown Prince
and send him into exile.

347
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,403
Please understand us!

348
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,114
-Please understand us.
-Please understand us.

349
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,868
-Please understand us.
-Please understand us.

350
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,252
I hear what you all are saying.

351
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,421
However,

352
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,548
even if I do get sent off,

353
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,801
I would like to share some stories

354
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,678
that I’ve heard from
kisaengs and gamblers.

355
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,974
Would you be interested?

356
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,480
-That was a great meal.
-Come again.

357
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,194
How come you've lost so much weight?

358
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,696
Your mother should have been here
for your recovery...

359
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,949
"Mother"?

360
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,118
Watch your language.

361
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,872
My apologies,

362
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,624
Your Highness.

363
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,045
Where is the baby?

364
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,173
The baby?

365
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,677
The one that kisaengs are taking care of.

366
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,765
Why do you ask?
What does that baby have to do with...

367
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,853
It can't be.

368
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,066
You're not...

369
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,068
Are you?

370
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,529
So, where is the baby?

371
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,075
Someone

372
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,328
from the palace took the baby away

373
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,121
just a while ago.

374
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,499
From the palace?

375
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,475
Crown Prince, what are you doing?

376
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,938
Your Majesty,

377
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,357
will you allow me some time to explain?

378
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,028
Do as you please.

379
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,411
Look around,

380
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,080
and see if there are any familiar faces.

381
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,506
Why does everyone

382
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,634
have their eyes closed?

383
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,428
Why do you think?

384
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,180
Any ideas?

385
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,270
It's because

386
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,480
they're all dead.

387
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,198
Maybe because they said something,

388
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,659
or maybe someone thought
they would say something.

389
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,996
Either way, someone tried to shut them up.

390
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,081
But I have to say

391
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,083
I was very shocked to find out

392
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,587
how much evidence that
they have left behind.

393
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,635
By tracing the dead bodies
from the incident,

394
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,805
I have found out who have gathered,
and paid money

395
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,600
to have them ambush
the Crown Prince’s Palace.

396
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,939
We’ve already found out that it was
Baekwoon Group’s doing.

397
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,108
We will see about that.

398
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,444
Bring him in.

399
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,930
The person who asked to
gather the assassins,

400
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,807
is he here?

401
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,865
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,662
Who is it?

403
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,134
These two, here.

404
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,480
All the paddy fields and silver coins
given to these assassins,

405
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,190
where did they come from?

406
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,025
We've confirmed that

407
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,486
they were from
the Minister of Public Administration.

408
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,447
These ledgers

409
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,240
were kept in secret.

410
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,748
Your Highness.

411
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,625
This is all

412
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,878
just nonsense.

413
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,379
Answer me!

414
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,089
Who hired these assassins

415
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,049
to make them look like
a part of Baekwoon Group?

416
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,926
The Minister of Taxation,

417
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,095
and the Minister of Public Administration.

418
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,848
I have committed a mortal sin,
Your Highness!

419
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,398
Minsters!

420
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,902
Is what the Crown Prince said, all true?

421
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,195
Your Majesty!

422
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,739
He has been accompanying
with kisaengs and gamblers!

423
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,616
Why do you believe in his words?

424
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,243
I’m being falsely accused!

425
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,703
I would never do such thing!

426
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,538
Are you still going to deny it?

427
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,042
-Lieutenant!
-Yes, Your Highness.

428
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,920
Take these two to
the Royal Investigation Bureau

429
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,796
and find out everything about
what they did.

430
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,215
Yes, Your Highness!

431
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,258
Your Majesty, I’m innocent!

432
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,261
Let go of me! Who do you think you are?

433
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,889
Let go. This is false accusation!

434
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,266
Your Majesty! I am not guilty!

435
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,602
Your Majesty!

436
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,230
Let go of me! Let this go!

437
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,648
This is false accusation!

438
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,049
You said that catching the tail

439
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,843
doesn’t mean that it’s over.

440
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,515
If they’re trying to cut their tail off
and run away,

441
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,518
what can I do to stop them?

442
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,898
It is not easy to catch a huge beast
with only one shot.

443
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,235
Get rid of its right arm,

444
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,820
and then the left.

445
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,824
You should never let your guard down

446
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,494
until you finally cut off its head.

447
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,719
I have

448
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,263
another thing to show you, Premier Kim.

449
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,773
This court lady

450
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,693
was killed off recently.

451
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,947
I have heard that

452
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,074
she gave birth before dying.

453
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,454
However

454
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,956
I couldn’t find the baby anywhere.

455
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,627
I wonder what happened.

456
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,130
Don’t you

457
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,549
want to find out what happened?

458
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,828
There there.

459
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,997
Little one.

460
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,916
She must feel uncomfortable.

461
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,876
Peek-a-boo!

462
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,628
Peek-a-boo!

463
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,130
Someone

464
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,633
from the palace took the baby away

465
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,134
just a while ago.

466
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,978
The Crown Prince asked for the baby?

467
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,313
Yes.

468
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,774
He said he agreed to

469
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,567
take care of this little baby for someone.

470
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,029
He left the job to the court lady
from the Crown Prince’s Palace,

471
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,115
but when I saw the baby,
I just couldn’t resist.

472
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,784
So I asked His Highness to let me help.

473
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,787
I see.

474
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,915
Look, Your Highness.

475
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,422
So precious, don’t you think?

476
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,404
Are you feeling okay?

477
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,908
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,828
Why were you asleep for so long?

479
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,540
I guess I wasn’t ready to face you.

480
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,462
You protected me

481
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,923
and also my beloved lady.

482
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,887
But above everything,

483
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,724
I’m glad that you’re okay.

484
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,199
Sometimes...

485
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,994
Ra-on comes here

486
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,580
and takes care of me.

487
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,088
When everything is done,

488
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,966
I will bring her back to my side.

489
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,972
I will make her happy again

490
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,182
like she was before,

491
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,268
right by my side.

492
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,316
We’re almost there.

493
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,737
And when that day comes,

494
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,948
shall we all...

495
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,118
sit together in Jahyeondang

496
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,746
and have a drink again?

497
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,450
What did you say?

498
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,288
Why should the child be King?

499
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,914
After all,

500
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,834
he is not of royal blood.

501
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,674
How dare you.

502
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,929
Do not disgrace
the Royal Family of Joseon.

503
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,057
No disgrace is greater

504
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,310
than to taint the royal blood.

505
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,314
I gave birth to that child.

506
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,608
He is the rightful heir to the throne.

507
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,443
Yes.

508
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,654
You will have to give everything

509
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,407
to fool the whole nation

510
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,910
and take this to your grave.

511
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,873
Father.

512
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,542
The moment you fail

513
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,212
will be your doom.

514
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,424
Premier Kim.

515
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,263
Sit.

516
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,274
Do you think you'll be unaffected?

517
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,152
Tell me,

518
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,155
is that a threat?

519
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,492
I have no choice.

520
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,620
My life

521
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:20,582
is in your hands.

522
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,044
You took a poor girl

523
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,838
and made her Queen.

524
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,677
But for that same reason,

525
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,388
your life is in also my hands.

526
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,308
I never knew who my father was.

527
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:44,231
I was brought up by kisaengs
and you dared to make me Queen.

528
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:51,071
Is there any higher treason
to uproot the Royal Family

529
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,198
than what you have done?

530
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,367
Shut

531
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,620
your damn mouth.

532
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,791
If you want to get me,

533
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,047
you better come prepared.

534
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,811
I was jealous of you

535
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,480
when I was a child.

536
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,943
No matter how important my family is,

537
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,488
we always have to serve you.

538
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,950
I know.

539
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,119
That is why

540
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,372
I always yearned for friends.

541
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,002
We were friends on the outside.

542
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:49,921
But still...

543
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,883
We had to bow before you.

544
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:55,761
Is that

545
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,473
the reason why it turned out this way?

546
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:03,935
You,

547
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,896
Byeong-yeon

548
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,981
and I.

549
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,612
Why do we have to fight?

550
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,658
I wanted to run away

551
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,204
from my grandfather or the title

552
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,290
as the firstborn of the Kim family.

553
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,003
Believe it or not.

554
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,174
I believe you.

555
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,888
Also, I wanted to

556
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,809
run away all the time.

557
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,570
I will do

558
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,364
what I must.

559
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,327
Do what you believe is right.

560
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,288
However,

561
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,251
I am worried

562
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,295
that I might hurt you.

563
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,300
I am worried

564
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,303
that I might want to protect my family.

565
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,562
So,

566
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,314
if anything happens,

567
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,652
don't feel apologetic.

568
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,738
We both knew...

569
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,619
what was coming.

570
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,324
8 YEARS AGO

571
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:27,787
Did you see him?

572
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:28,955
Yes, sir.

573
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,043
I carefully observed
every inch of His Highness.

574
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,545
What is he like?

575
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,340
I could read the grace of the Royal Family

576
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,216
in his face.

577
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,554
However,

578
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,431
there is one thing...

579
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,184
What is it?
Don't hesitate and tell me what it is.

580
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,394
Well...

581
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,065
I'm afraid His Highness
is destined to live short.

582
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:00,236
Also, I felt this unusual energy

583
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,364
from one of the Crown Prince's friends.

584
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,451
Yun-seong.

585
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,662
Grandfather.

586
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,789
He had a warm heart,

587
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,041
an unyielding spirit,

588
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,170
and all lineaments
fit to become a great king.

589
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,548
There was a crane embroidered on his...

590
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,722
If we are to take the crown
from the Lee family,

591
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,976
we might as well hand it
to the man worthy of it.

592
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,495
Did you ask for me, Grandfather?

593
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,958
Your Highness,
Crown Princess consort wishes to see you.

594
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,628
Let her in.

595
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,570
What brings you here at this hour?

596
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,572
Your Highness.

597
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,493
The royal clinic served herbal medicine
for your fatigue,

598
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,370
but I heard you abstained
from food and drink.

599
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,618
Please, Your Highness.

600
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,038
-Crown Princess consort.
-Please,

601
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,458
help me fulfill my duties
as Crown Princess consort,

602
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,627
Your Highness.

603
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,361
Your Highness, don't drink it!

604
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,283
Your Highness.

605
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,659
Your Highness!

606
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:17,952
Your Highness!

607
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,913
Your Highness!

608
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,581
Your Highness!

609
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,041
Your Highness!

610
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,001
Your Highness!
