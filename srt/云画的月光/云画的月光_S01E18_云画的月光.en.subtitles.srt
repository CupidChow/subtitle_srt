1
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,382
It might be a long journey.

2
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,260
But I promise you.

3
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,222
I will come back for Your Highness

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,391
and for you.

5
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,468
Your Highness!

6
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,845
Your Highness!

7
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,972
Your Highness!

8
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,934
Your Highness!

9
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,936
Your Highness!

10
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,813
Your Highness.

11
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,759
Your Highness.

12
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,264
I dreamt of the day I left you.

13
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,018
It was a good dream.

14
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,857
At least I got to see your face again.

15
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,825
Hello!

16
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,578
Anyone there?

17
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,878
What is it?

18
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,255
Is it an emergency?

19
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,175
Yes. You must come to the royal palace.

20
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,093
To the palace?

21
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,221
Tell me more.

22
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,473
There has been an attempt
to poison His Highness.

23
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,687
What?

24
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,440
His Highness

25
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,776
is in critical condition.

26
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,520
Who goes there?

27
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,235
I am Jeong Yak-yong
and I've been summoned by His Highness.

28
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,238
Show your face.

29
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,951
She is a nurse from Hyemin Temple.

30
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,834
Well...

31
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,547
Master Jeong! What are you doing here?

32
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,341
Hurry. Come inside.

33
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,385
Hurry up!

34
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,602
Your Highness.

35
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,692
It's me.

36
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,030
Ra-on.

37
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,579
Are you all right?

38
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,723
Your Highness.

39
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,862
Crown Princess consort has arrived.

40
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,711
How is His Highness?

41
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,839
He just woke up.

42
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,180
Your Highness.

43
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,349
It's Ha-yeon.

44
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,149
Can you see me?

45
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,963
Look, Your Highness.

46
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,800
So precious, don’t you think?

47
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,809
Your Highness.

48
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,484
The Crown Prince was poisoned
by his medicine.

49
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,070
What?

50
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,031
Are you sure?

51
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,116
Yes, Your Highness.

52
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,170
Your medicine was not poisoned.

53
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,801
Which is why the court lady's silver spoon
showed no reaction.

54
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,346
Then, what happened?

55
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,433
The poison was applied
on the rim of your cup.

56
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,022
Hence the change of color
of the Crown Princess consort's ring.

57
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,741
Thank heavens you made it through.

58
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,579
You took only a small amount of poison

59
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,415
and Your Highness is in good health.

60
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,625
You won't have to worry.

61
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,964
All thanks to you,
for coming all this way late at night.

62
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,136
Please do not tell anyone
that I am recovered for a while.

63
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,807
I wonder how ecstatic they would be

64
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,186
when they see a someone who they thought
to be dead walking around.

65
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,857
Right.

66
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,651
As you wish, Your Highness.

67
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,501
Everyone’s trying to keep it a secret,

68
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:32,256
but there are rumors saying that
the Crown Prince is dying.

69
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,260
So it’s still not allowed to enter
the Crown Prince’s Palace?

70
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:41,265
That is right. Even the doctors cannot
get in without permission.

71
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,895
What if something happens to
the Crown Prince

72
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,271
even before the...

73
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,428
It can't be.

74
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,851
I knew it was you.

75
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,982
I heard that you were sick.

76
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,867
You have no idea

77
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:11,123
how much I wished to see you,
when I opened my eyes.

78
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,504
I hesitated for so long

79
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,882
worrying what I should do

80
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,968
if it was not you.

81
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,563
Your Highness,

82
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,693
I made a promise with my grandfather

83
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,073
that I would stay for just a few days

84
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,368
without being noticed, even by you.

85
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,498
So...

86
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,380
please, pretend like you didn’t notice.

87
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,090
I will, as long as you would like.

88
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,012
So, stay here,

89
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,185
at least until I get better.

90
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,873
I would have come sooner,
but I couldn't since

91
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,834
His Majesty ordered
to tighten the security around you.

92
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,046
I’m sorry I made you worry.

93
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,800
I’m glad you’re okay.

94
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,803
Things could have gone much worse.

95
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,056
Consort Park.

96
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,227
Remember the day I lost my mother?

97
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,564
Yes, Your Highness.

98
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,362
She took her medicine one day,
then suddenly started coughing up blood.

99
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,533
But they said there was nothing wrong
about that medicine.

100
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,122
Yes, I remember.

101
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,125
There were strange rumors about it.

102
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,169
Even some of the workers
in the Queen's Palace had died.

103
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,672
But...

104
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,758
no one ever found out why.

105
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,557
Why are you trying to bring up
such a painful memory?

106
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,020
These two incidents,
they have so much in common.

107
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,693
And I also think
it’s the same person’s doing.

108
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,157
That’s why now is the perfect timing

109
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,827
to investigate the truth of
my mother’s death.

110
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,415
What do you mean?

111
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,584
I am so certain...

112
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,670
but there’s no evidence.

113
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,771
Did you find out

114
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,231
where the baby is?

115
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,779
Yes. The Crown Prince’s Palace,
being looked after by Court lady Han.

116
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,657
Bring that baby back.

117
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,535
Now.

118
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,287
Yes, Your Highness.

119
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,602
If the same thing happens again,

120
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,064
I will be taking your life this time.

121
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,694
Stop there.

122
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,878
Did you just order him...

123
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,424
to kill the baby?

124
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,261
Crown Prince, how did you...

125
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,638
Put the baby down.

126
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,519
I said,

127
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,689
put the baby down.

128
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,200
What are you doing, Crown Prince?

129
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,495
Give the baby a chance

130
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,582
to cry for once, before it dies at least.

131
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,377
Before getting killed.

132
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,547
What did you say?

133
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,050
Even the criminals scream for their lives
in the courtyard.

134
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,761
But for this little baby,

135
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,143
all it can do is to cry.

136
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,654
At least let it cry

137
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,408
at the top of its lungs for once

138
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,834
in front of the mother
that's trying to get rid of it.

139
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,715
Do what you wish.

140
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,303
I have no ties to this baby anymore.

141
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,722
This is

142
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,391
your last chance.

143
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,396
It's the only way

144
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,192
you and that newborn baby

145
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,696
can both live.

146
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,952
Tell everyone that

147
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,164
this is the baby you gave birth to.

148
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,472
I have no idea...

149
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,435
what you mean by that.

150
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,368
It's me, Your Highness.

151
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,376
Did I startle you by being in this attire?

152
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,473
Eunuch Hong,

153
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,310
did you become a nurse
for my sick brother?

154
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,816
Yes, I'm only going to stay
until he feels better.

155
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,906
Is there something
troubling you, Your Highness?

156
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,380
Eunuch Hong, can I ask you another favor?

157
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,369
Your Highness.

158
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,498
Are you looking for something?

159
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,079
What were you trying
to give to the Crown Prince?

160
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,206
Why do you ask?

161
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,210
Do you have something you need to hide?

162
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,629
If you think killing me

163
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,007
will stop the truth from being revealed

164
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,177
then go ahead!

165
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,324
Your Highness, are you all right?

166
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,965
There...

167
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,803
Over there.

168
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,724
Your Highness?

169
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,610
Here?

170
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,319
Underneath the floorboard?

171
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,695
Yes.

172
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,115
Was it really that girl, Hong Ra-on?

173
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,453
I lost her
due to Consort Park's residence's eunuchs,

174
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,538
but it was her.

175
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,832
Should I bring her?

176
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,627
Do so, dead or alive.

177
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,130
Let me

178
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,507
bring her in.

179
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,651
I know you have feelings for her,

180
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,820
so I would be a fool to let you.

181
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,032
I want to test myself

182
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,826
and see where I stand with her.

183
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,830
Are you upset that she only let's

184
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,374
the Prince by her side?

185
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,502
Yes.

186
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,672
Having power is the only way

187
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,384
you get what you want.

188
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,554
It sure is. Bring her in then.

189
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,997
Was it really

190
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,376
Hong Ra-on who found this?

191
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,213
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,769
It's hers.

193
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,106
It really is hers.

194
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,486
This belonged to your mother.

195
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,429
My Prince,

196
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,391
by the time you are reading this,

197
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,270
I hope it is long after

198
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:36,274
you have recovered
from the sadness and hatred.

199
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,491
Your legacy which I defended with my life

200
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,452
is not my son's power,

201
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:52,165
but the hope for Joseon.

202
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,360
Hong Ra-on.

203
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,203
Sir.

204
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,664
I need you to come with me.

205
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,668
To where?

206
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,561
Sir.

207
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,825
Sir.

208
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,608
My lord, if His Lordship finds out...

209
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,777
Why? Are you shocked?

210
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,549
Sir.

211
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,007
Sir.

212
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,301
Sir.

213
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,470
Are you all right?

214
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,219
Don't cry.

215
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,517
I do not want you to remember me

216
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,355
as a man who made you cry.

217
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,448
Sir.

218
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,911
You are badly hurt.

219
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,875
How could you make a joke?

220
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,378
Do not mourn for me.

221
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,853
You always

222
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,106
made me laugh.

223
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,822
I am sorry that I always hurt you.

224
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,287
You were always

225
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,957
my muse.

226
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,959
I had a chance

227
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,964
to paint you

228
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,720
and that's all I needed.

229
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,600
So...

230
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,563
I hope

231
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,484
you'll be happy.

232
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,092
Sir.

233
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,099
Stand up.

234
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,646
It's getting cold.

235
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,400
Sir.

236
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,906
Sir.

237
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,125
Sir.

238
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,510
I wanted to have a son.

239
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,390
At least pretend like I do.

240
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,270
It is a justifiable desire
and duty as Queen.

241
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,064
Yes.

242
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,569
But there is something more.

243
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,656
I wanted recognition

244
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,743
from you.

245
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,082
I wanted to bring honor to my family

246
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,505
and dared to thieve the King's blood.

247
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,344
I told you to watch your mouth
but every single time...

248
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,430
I may not be enough for you,
but I am your daughter.

249
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,186
Did it ever occur to you?

250
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,731
The fact

251
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,735
that I am your own child.

252
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,529
You have the audacity

253
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,283
to say that after abandoning
your infant daughter to remain Queen.

254
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,504
Yes.

255
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,591
I guess we are family

256
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,428
after all.

257
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,100
We can abandon

258
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,187
or even kill anyone who gets in our way.

259
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,650
We are exactly alike.

260
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,153
You wanted my recognition.

261
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,992
That is impossible
for a daughter of a kisaeng like you.

262
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,414
Be grateful for I made you Queen

263
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,249
and stay alert.

264
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,971
Premier Kim.

265
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,099
Is this all true?

266
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,870
TEN YEARS AGO

267
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:55,791
Do you not know
how dangerous Western Learning is?

268
00:38:56,208 --> 00:39:00,129
And you dragged the Crown Prince into it.

269
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,134
It is merely a hobby an envoy brought in.

270
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,558
De Deo Verax Disputatio.

271
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,771
A dangerous book of Catholic beliefs.

272
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,232
Why are you showing me
this forbidden text?

273
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:24,195
You read this in your private residence,
have you not?

274
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,116
Only out of curiosity.

275
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,119
I am not Catholic.

276
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,039
Who knows what you really are?

277
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:40,419
I heard you lectured the Crown prince
on equal society.

278
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,422
Hong Gyeong-rae’s uprising

279
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:48,010
left an unhealable scar on
His Majesty’s heart.

280
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,516
That’s why I wish the Crown Prince

281
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,936
to look after every single one of
his people.

282
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,065
I will give you two options,
Your Highness.

283
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,652
We could take you down

284
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,905
making the Crown Prince a sinner’s son,

285
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,031
or...

286
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:15,371
you can step down yourself,
remaining spotless.

287
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,564
Premier Kim! There’s been an incident!

288
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,444
Yun-seong, I mean...

289
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,696
The Chief of Ministry of Rites has...

290
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,603
Kim Heon.

291
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,190
You deceived the royal family

292
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,400
by forging Queen Kim’s origins.

293
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,362
You tried to kill the Crown Prince

294
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,741
and tried to hide the fact

295
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,743
that you killed Queen Yun as well.

296
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:41,373
I order Kim Heon to be stepped down
from the Prime Minister.

297
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,794
The Minister of Public Administration and
the Minister of Taxation will also

298
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,757
be taken down from their positions,
and these three shall be beheaded.

299
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:56,388
And for Kim, who deceived the royal family
by lying about her origins,

300
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,225
who also tried to switch a Princess
with a Prince

301
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,977
will be taken down.

302
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,990
Lieutenant.

303
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,705
Will you let me see Yun-seong’s room
for the last time?

304
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,130
Thank you.

305
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,240
Do I become the Crown Prince by wearing
a dragon robe?

306
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:43,078
No. Such things can’t happen
by just changing clothes.

307
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,291
But it does help us understand each other,
don’t you think?

308
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,586
How did you feel when you wore my clothes?

309
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,510
I found out that you

310
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,556
feel as much pressure as I do, Yun-seong.

311
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,533
I would like you to be a king
who has a keen eye.

312
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,287
When someone is in a high position,

313
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,123
they might not be able to understand
those who are in lower positions.

314
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,878
I hope you don't become dull of hearing.

315
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,673
You should not listen only to those
who speak loudly in front of you.

316
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,177
Protect each of your people

317
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,597
as if they are your only people.

318
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,566
Can you promise me that you’ll become
a king like that?

319
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,402
Yes,

320
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,490
I will keep that promise.

321
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,743
Please, watch over me,

322
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,204
Mother.

323
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,586
This is the King’s orders for Hong Ra-on.

324
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,341
despite being a rebel’s daughter

325
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,929
she made an effort to recover the honor of
the royal family.

326
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,767
By that, I will be granting amnesty.

327
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,445
Crown Princess consort.

328
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,700
Do you really understand what that means?

329
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,287
I do, Your Majesty.

330
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,416
Even if you’re not
a Crown Princess consort anymore,

331
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,461
you'll have to spend
the rest of your life alone.

332
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,799
Yes, I am aware.

333
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,096
Is that what you really want?

334
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,723
Your Majesty.

335
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,436
I already knew the Crown Prince

336
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,565
didn’t care for me.

337
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,281
But I thought

338
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,825
if I stay by his side long enough,

339
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,828
things will change.

340
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,000
But...

341
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,504
Whenever I saw myself powerless,
not being able to do anything

342
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,382
for the Crown Prince,

343
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,886
I slowly realized that
I was being foolish.

344
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:18,020
I do not want to live as a burden to
the Crown Prince.

345
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,149
I wish to be able to live as myself,
even if I have to be alone.

346
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,445
Please allow me to leave, Your Majesty.

347
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:50,177
Excuse me, do you know where the ferry is?

348
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,971
Over there.

349
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,439
I will undo everything for you.

350
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,444
Even the royal marriage,
as if it never happened

351
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,739
I hope you will live a happy life.

352
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,159
Such wonderful weather, isn’t it?

353
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,245
-Let's go.
-Yes, My Lady.

354
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,260
His Majesty is entering!

355
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,964
Your Majesty,

356
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,675
why aren't you sitting in your throne?

357
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,596
This is how it will be from now on.

358
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,059
The distance between the people and me

359
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,146
as well as that between us...

360
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:13,028
It is my intention to
take a step closer to all of you.

361
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,146
Eunuchs play a crucial role
within the palace

362
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,358
being in charge of
the comfort and security of it.

363
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,613
As one unit, we will serve the king,

364
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,491
shine a light on his insight, and...

365
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,535
Eunuch Do-gi,

366
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,330
tell me that you are thinking
what I am thinking.

367
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:10,210
Are you talking about
the feeling of déjà vu?

368
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,504
We are a group sharing a common destiny.

369
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,242
There are 99 roses.

370
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,911
-The last one--
-Are you saying it's me?

371
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,788
That is so cheesy.

372
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,046
You are right. I cannot possibly

373
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,507
tell you apart from the roses.

374
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,012
Your Highness,

375
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,890
could I have your hand in marriage?

376
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,686
Deok-ho,

377
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,652
being my husband will
ruin your chances of a higher status.

378
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,446
Will that be all right?

379
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,662
With you,
my life will be filled with roses,

380
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,414
so I wouldn't want more.

381
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,212
You are the only one I need.

382
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,465
Myeongeun.

383
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,778
-Let's go!
-Nice!

384
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,579
Sir, do you want to give it a go?

385
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,706
-Sir...
-Sir, please do.

386
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,833
You should try it.

387
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,669
Come on now.

388
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:19,172
Do you know what hongwoon takwol means?

389
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,802
Draw clouds to help the moon shine.

390
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,054
Isn't that the meaning?

391
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,183
-Gae, gae!
-Gae, gae!

392
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,980
It's to describe a king

393
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,985
who doesn't shine solely as the sun
but shines as the moon among the people.

394
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,785
That's who our current king is.

395
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,038
Is that your way of saying

396
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,458
you'll stay a cloud
for the sake of our king?

397
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,278
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

398
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,827
You were too busy writing a masterpiece
to even show your face.

399
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,496
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

400
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,623
So what on earth is this?

401
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,961
Please don't be angry.

402
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,672
I could not help it since the cover design

403
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,549
affected the sales.

404
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,509
Gosh.

405
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,148
I will make you pay for every cover.

406
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,074
Here?

407
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,205
What on earth are you thinking?

408
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,542
You will pay one bun
for each book you sell.

409
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,132
This beauty of mine isn't cheap.

410
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,977
Ra-on.

411
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,817
Love In the Moonlight.

412
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,319
What is it about?

413
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,864
In a land far away,

414
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,951
a crown prince of great beauty lived.

415
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,704
He did not know the ways of the world

416
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,415
and was quite ill-tempered.

417
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,837
You used my portrait without permission
and now you're violating my privacy.

418
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,881
I'm not finished.

419
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,470
Anyway, the story is about that prince

420
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:17,725
living through numerous events
and becoming a wise king.

421
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,980
Is that what you wish?

422
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,568
No.

423
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,781
I only took a sneak peek

424
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,535
into the world you'll build
during your reign.

425
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,092
And who are you exactly?

426
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,598
I guess I'm one of the people

427
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,267
that will serve you as their king.

428
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,777
Am I the first woman you loved

429
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,363
who was your Eunuch?

430
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,122
If not, who am I?

431
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,630
You

432
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,091
are the one who is my whole world.

433
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,887
You are Ra-on.
