1
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,473
I cannot understand young people.

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,393
It was much tougher
to become a eunuch back in my days.

3
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,604
Gosh, isn't it frustrating?

4
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,190
He could have passed
if only he wrote something.

5
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:28,653
But he submitted a blank answer sheet,
saying that he couldn't find the answer.

6
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,989
Then, when is he leaving?

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,075
He will probably leave
the court in the morning.

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,204
-What was the question again?
-Your Highness.

9
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,794
You need to go somewhere right now.

10
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,217
Pardon?

11
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,722
The princess?

12
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,774
I have committed a mortal sin!

13
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,817
I am glad you know that.

14
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,115
Your Highness!

15
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,285
Okay.

16
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,829
I'll give you what you asked for.

17
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,502
Stop.

18
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,268
Your Highness!

19
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,209
If you hold the sword that way,
you'll hurt your hands.

20
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,336
Give it to me.

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,884
Yeong.

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,721
What are you doing?

23
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,974
Take him
to Royal Investigation Bureau now!

24
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,892
Yes, Your Highness!

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,102
Royal Investigation Bureau?

26
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,647
Most people can't walk out of there
in one piece once they are taken there.

27
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,859
You exchanged love letters
with a man outside the court.

28
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,446
How dare can he play tricks on them?

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,448
We should closely investigate his crime.

30
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,910
Then,

31
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,705
everyone will find out about this.

32
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,373
I will ask His Majesty myself

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,500
to punish him severely.

34
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,378
What? To Father?

35
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,924
-Make him stand up!
-Yes, Your Highness.

36
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,386
Please withdraw your command, Yeong!

37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,396
I do not want to make a big fuss about it.

38
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,441
Then,

39
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,360
what about him?

40
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,417
Killing him with your hands

41
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,461
wouldn't make you feel any better.

42
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,466
You are not someone
who can harm someone else.

43
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,804
Let us go now.

44
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,027
Your Highness!

45
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,866
I sincerely apologize.

46
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,204
I have not thought

47
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,793
that writing love letters for other people

48
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,587
can hurt someone's feelings this much.

49
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,840
I give…

50
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,761
my sincere apology.

51
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,910
Why do you hide it from him,
Your Highness?

52
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,704
He will find out soon anyway.

53
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,624
That's exactly why.

54
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,170
Then, he will become

55
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,589
nothing more than one
of my many subjects to me.

56
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,518
I don't think I would like it

57
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,062
if he started to look at me that way.

58
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,036
Well, each palace

59
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,496
sent the evaluation on your answer.

60
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,499
Come and receive it when I call you.

61
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,376
It is all right.

62
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,795
It is all done now.

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,012
Everything is under his feet,

64
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,598
and he can get whatever he wants.

65
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,059
However, he seems like he's feeling empty.

66
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,441
"How can I, a lowly subject,
fill the emptiness of His Highness?"

67
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,402
Maybe you've never been hungry,

68
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,488
but I bet you've been heartbroken
many times before.

69
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,239
Okay.

70
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,202
As the person with the biggest
heart in this region,

71
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,829
I'd like to…

72
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,082
give you my affection.

73
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,171
ANSWER SHEET: EUNUCH TRAINEE HONG SAM-NOM

74
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:24,467
Your Highness, I can just fail him.
There is no need for you to check it.

75
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,969
"Pass"!

76
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,098
Your Highness.

77
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,059
Why did you give him a pass
when he turned in a blank answer sheet?

78
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,644
I have already heard

79
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,854
his answer before.

80
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,982
What was his answer?

81
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,527
A drumstick?

82
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
Fail.

83
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,623
Hong Sam-nom.

84
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,126
Yes.

85
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,547
Pass.

86
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,423
Thank you! Pass…

87
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,093
Pardon?

88
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,637
Did you just say I passed?

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,805
Not fail? Pass?

90
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,598
EUNUCH TRAINEE HONG SAM-NOM, PASS

91
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,976
What? Why?

92
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,771
I submitted a blank answer sheet.
Why did I pass? Why?

93
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,814
That is what I am saying.

94
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,984
I do not understand
what His Highness has in his mind.

95
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,694
Did you just say…

96
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,864
His Highness?

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,034
Was this question for a position
at the Crown Prince's palace?

98
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,912
Hong Sam-nom, you are assigned
to Jipbokheon, Consort Park's residence.

99
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,330
Go there next morning.

100
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,503
You can pass if you hit the target
at least once.

101
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,799
However, the arrow you shoot
will have to go around me

102
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,552
or go through me.

103
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,678
-Goodness.
-My goodness.

104
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,347
-He should not get hurt.
-What if he gets hurt?

105
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,849
My goodness.

106
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,727
Shoot!

107
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,234
My goodness.

108
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,283
If all of you fail,
you cannot go home today.

109
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,619
Shoot!

110
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,255
-My heart almost stopped.
-That is nothing.

111
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,757
You must have not seen him before.

112
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,509
His nickname is "Byeong-yeon the hottie."

113
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,219
I know what you're talking about.

114
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,929
When he went out in disguise
with His Highness,

115
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,349
he was wearing a hat
and he looked so handsome.

116
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,143
Right. He looks the handsomest
when he is wearing a hat.

117
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,603
Byeong-yeon the hottie in a hat!

118
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,657
It is strange.

119
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,662
You tend to organize the training
in a way that makes you stand out,

120
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,623
Byeong-yeon the hottie.

121
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,837
That is a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

122
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,646
Your Highness!

123
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,064
Your Highness…

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,235
That was a perfect shot!

125
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,196
Your Highness!

126
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,160
Hey, Puppy.

127
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,746
You should bow when your master comes.

128
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,459
Do not come near me.
I might bite you again.

129
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,213
I am very upset now. I am dangerous.

130
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,549
Gosh, I am scared.

131
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,385
Please keep your distance.

132
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,766
Where are you going?

133
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,687
To the Crown Prince's palace.
I need to talk to His Highness myself.

134
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,400
What for?

135
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,070
To ask him why he’s doing this to me!

136
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,405
Get out of my way!

137
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,408
You can’t just meet him anytime you want.

138
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,410
He’s the Crown Prince, after all.

139
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,916
I guess you’re right.

140
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,920
A mere subject like me won't be allowed
to see the Crown Prince.

141
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,598
The Crown Prince ruined everything for me!

142
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,724
What did I…

143
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,229
What did His Highness do?

144
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,901
I don’t deserve to be a eunuch.

145
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,447
But I’m stuck here forever
because of His Highness!

146
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,535
Well, then why did His Highness pick you?

147
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,164
I think…

148
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,042
he wants to punish me forever

149
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,753
because of a terrible mistake I made.

150
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,262
I saved his life, but he's accusing me
of ruining his life.

151
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,139
What am I supposed to do
about that, Chief Kim?

152
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,394
Should I just kill him, Your Highness?

153
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
Come with me, both of you.

154
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,156
I never knew the palace was this huge.

155
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,202
Did you say you didn’t deserve to become
a eunuch?

156
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,870
Sorry?

157
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,624
Oh, right.

158
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,254
What if someone was born here,
and this palace has become their home?

159
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,133
Do you think they deserve to be here?

160
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,346
So the palace is their home?

161
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:10,271
-What I mean is…
-I have never had a place to call my own.

162
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,152
Come to think of it, I don't think
I've ever called a place "My home" before.

163
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,701
I mean, who needs one anyway?

164
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,620
As long as I can lay myself down
and rest, I’m good.

165
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,790
Nobody likes living in the palace.

166
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,918
But if you can find someone you can trust
with your heart in here,

167
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,838
it becomes much more bearable.

168
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,134
Is that so?

169
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,804
I wonder…

170
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,515
I will find someone like that, too.

171
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,847
Your Majesty!

172
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,601
Your Majesty!
We should get you somewhere safe.

173
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,019
What is going on?

174
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,813
There's an uprising!
The crowd is coming this way!

175
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,694
Wait, stop!

176
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,572
Who are you?

177
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,367
I have never seen you before.

178
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,333
Two thousand.

179
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,628
That's the number of innocent lives
that you took!

180
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,129
No, that’s wrong!

181
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,924
They deserved it! They were all rebels!

182
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,176
You took all those innocent lives.

183
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,014
This country will have to pay
for what you've done!

184
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,809
-Murderer.
-You're a murderer.

185
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,228
-No!
-Murderer.

186
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,231
-No, stop!
-Murderer.

187
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,525
-Murderer.
-Stop it!

188
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,250
JIPBOKHEON (CONSORT PARK'S RESIDENCE)

189
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,014
Your Highness.

190
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,976
I am Eunuch Hong.
I will be serving you from now on.

191
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,063
Pleasure to meet you, Eunuch Hong.

192
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,149
Likewise, Your Highness.

193
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,947
Are you okay, Your Highness?

194
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:19,001
Can you bring my child with you
and work on the garden?

195
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,546
PRINCESS YEONGEUN

196
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,133
Yes, Your Highness.

197
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,182
His Majesty’s condition is getting worse
by the day.

198
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,270
-Is he having that nightmare again?
-Yes.

199
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,106
I have not been feeling very well
recently.

200
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,818
And not being to sleep at night
does not help.

201
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,115
I am so worn out.

202
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,495
If I could sleep in another room
until my morning sickness gets better--

203
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,584
You must never leave his side

204
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,462
especially in times like this.

205
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,882
Things will calm down soon.

206
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,052
Do not be rash with your actions
or you'll ruin everything.

207
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,513
Keep yourself contained.

208
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,224
I will,

209
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,768
Father.

210
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,837
SEVEN YEARS AGO

211
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,387
Your Highness!

212
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,309
I was looking for you everywhere.

213
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,107
I'm fine.

214
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,444
Are you sure, Your Highness?

215
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,112
Yes.

216
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,950
If I can’t even endure a little wound
like this,

217
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,495
how can my mother rest in peace?

218
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
That is right, Your Highness.

219
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,292
You are very strong.

220
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,423
Your Highness,

221
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,760
I have something I must tell you.

222
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,972
It’s a message Her Majesty wanted me
to relay to you when no one's around.

223
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,183
From my mother?

224
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,310
What is it?

225
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,605
Her Majesty wanted you to know
that it also takes great courage

226
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,191
to express your true feelings.

227
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,443
Her Majesty also told me

228
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,904
to be there for Your Highness

229
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,989
on behalf of her

230
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,367
whenever you need a shoulder to cry on.

231
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,662
Did my mother…

232
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,040
really say that?

233
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,670
Then, Consort Park,

234
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,132
lend me your shoulder.

235
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,886
I am…

236
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,597
in so much pain.

237
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,643
Of course, Your Highness.

238
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,617
This one is really tough, right?

239
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,621
That’s how it survives.

240
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,082
They can grow in a harsh environment

241
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,127
with very little water or sunlight.

242
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,630
They are very different
from a delicate flower such as…

243
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,974
I was reminded of someone I know.

244
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,228
He was raised like a delicate flower.

245
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,606
No wonder he is so arrogant and picky.

246
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,490
If only he were as nice as his looks.

247
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,867
Then what?

248
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,204
If he were, I would have…

249
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,429
What are you doing here, Silver Spoon?

250
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,058
What about you?

251
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,601
What are you doing here?

252
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,771
I am working.

253
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,733
But honestly,

254
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,986
what is it that you do, Silver Spoon?

255
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,573
Do you want to know?

256
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,991
Yes, I do.

257
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,453
One day, you were a eunuch,
and the other day, you were a guard.

258
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,122
And now, look at you
doing nothing but slacking off.

259
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,002
You have to be careful, Silver Spoon.

260
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,421
Of what?

261
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,926
You might upset your masters

262
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,428
if they find out you keep going around
and doing nothing.

263
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm telling you this as your friend,
so keep that in mind.

264
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,814
Goodness.

265
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,610
My friend?

266
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,446
Since when were we friends?

267
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,993
If not friends, what are we?

268
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,956
The master and his puppy.

269
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,916
Come on!

270
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,668
Don't call me Puppy.

271
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,712
I am Hong…

272
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,966
I have a fine name called Hong Sam-nom.

273
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,844
You call "Sam-nom" a fine name?

274
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,599
Then what is your name, Silver Spoon?

275
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,106
Are you awake, Your Highness?

276
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,901
His Highness has arrived.

277
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,766
What are these doing on a man's head?

278
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,478
Everything you do is strange.

279
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,313
I don't like it.

280
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,065
What do you…

281
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,197
If you don't want to tell me, just say so.

282
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,080
Oh, dear.

283
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,585
Look who it is.

284
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,338
Long time no see, Princess Yeongeun.

285
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,981
You came all the way here yourself.

286
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,025
I would feel bad refusing.

287
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,364
Your Highness,
His Majesty is expecting you.

288
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,741
Please tell him I wasn't here.

289
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,078
I'm usually away from my palace anyway.

290
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,332
Yes, Your Highness. I am aware of that.

291
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,545
I was here with His Majesty

292
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,505
two nights ago.

293
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,049
What?

294
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,593
Did he have something to scold me for?

295
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,598
That morning,

296
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,643
His Majesty saw you

297
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,689
walking away from the executive office
without coming in.

298
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,901
Your Highness, please forgive me,

299
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,404
but The Analects of Confucius says,

300
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,615
"The father conceals
the misconduct of the son,

301
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,910
and the son conceals
the misconduct of the father."

302
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,330
Your Highness,

303
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,127
will you and His Majesty
turn away from each other forever?

304
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,435
Did you ask for me?

305
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,900
I think I am going mad.

306
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,153
The ringing in my ears never stops.

307
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,032
I can't even tell

308
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,618
what happened yesterday

309
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,369
was only a dream or not.

310
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,962
Prepare yourself.

311
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,423
Soon,

312
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,302
I will order you to succeed the throne.

313
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
I refuse.

314
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,517
This is not

315
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,062
a matter of choice.

316
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,857
You are not just my son

317
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,734
but the Crown Prince of this country.

318
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,990
Crown Prince.

319
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,408
Yes.

320
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,788
I had no choice
but to be the Crown Prince.

321
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,415
However,

322
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,293
I can choose

323
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,296
what kind of crown prince I want to be,
Your Majesty.

324
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,119
This is a letter for His Majesty.

325
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,454
Give it to the Eunuch
at His Highness' palace.

326
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,957
Yes, Your Highness.

327
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,391
Eunuch Hong,
you must give that letter to my father.

328
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,727
Of course.

329
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,611
Do not worry, Your Highness. I promise.

330
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,161
What is this, sir?

331
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,123
Can't you see? It is His Majesty's reply.
It's the royal letter.

332
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,333
I am sorry?

333
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,711
How could His Majesty write a reply

334
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,671
before he even read the letter?

335
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,132
Haven't you heard already?

336
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,634
What do you mean, sir?

337
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,309
The best way to do this job

338
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,643
is to pretend to do it.

339
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,902
All His Majesty sends back
is a blank sheet of paper,

340
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,654
so we prepared it in advance to save time.

341
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,323
Just pass it on.

342
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,992
I don't understand, sir.

343
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,912
I'll just take it back, sir.

344
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,205
How dare you?

345
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,999
Do what you are told to do.
Do you think I have time for this?

346
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,752
What is with all this noise?

347
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,890
So, how is Consort Park's health?

348
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,728
I do not know for sure,
but she suffers from frequent coughing.

349
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,940
But she still has enough energy
to write letters.

350
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,567
Pardon?

351
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,820
Come closer.

352
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,671
Pregnancy makes me feel

353
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,007
constantly tired and on edge.

354
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,887
I will not repeat this,
so you'd better listen carefully.

355
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:49,477
Shut your mouth
and take what the eunuch gave you.

356
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,402
Go.

357
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,987
Go.

358
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,631
Sir.

359
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,676
Eunuch Hong, have you got some time?

360
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,803
I'd like you to come with me.

361
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,972
To where, sir?

362
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,475
You will see. Let's go.

363
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,691
Why did you bring me here, sir?

364
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,068
Why would you…

365
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,404
There is no reason.

366
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,324
Living inside the palace can get tough.

367
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,825
When that happens,

368
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,370
take some time off here.

369
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,999
Are you telling me to shirk my duty, sir?

370
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,294
I think you need to do that right now.

371
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,348
Sir,

372
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:13,186
you always show up when I am down
or in trouble. It is strange.

373
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,231
There's a simple way to put it.

374
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,151
You can just call it fate.

375
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,991
Do you know
what I am most thankful for you, sir?

376
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,493
I know.

377
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,997
You do?

378
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,376
I pretend I do not know the truth.

379
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,170
Isn't that it?

380
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,507
You are right.

381
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,010
When a lady does not want to say
something,

382
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,304
it is a man's duty to pretend
he does not know about it.

383
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,724
Are you calling me a lady?

384
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,812
Also, keeping another man's secret

385
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,355
is a man's duty.

386
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,113
Anyway, thank you

387
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,866
for not asking me anything, sir.

388
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,744
Let us take a rest for a while.

389
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,289
Enjoy this moment

390
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,041
even if we can do this
only for a short while.

391
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,782
I can only be off my duty
after relaying this to His Majesty.

392
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,413
Shall I just do as I was told?

393
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,377
Are you all right, sir?

394
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,589
-What is wrong with you?
-I am so sorry, sir.

395
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,592
These are letters of appeal
addressed to His Majesty. Goodness.

396
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,718
I am sorry…

397
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:54,931
Your Highness, I was told that His Majesty
spent a lot of time writing his response.

398
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,603
Is that true?

399
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,314
It is, Your Highness.

400
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,444
The letter even has a pleasant scent.

401
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,630
Your Highness.

402
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,342
Now,

403
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,595
I should stop tormenting His Majesty.

404
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,225
I believe that is what His Majesty wants.

405
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,856
I think His Majesty wanted me
to acknowledge that through this letter.

406
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,774
Does that mean

407
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,985
the letter is…

408
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,824
I am sorry, Your Highness.

409
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,244
It is not your fault.

410
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,205
You can leave now.

411
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,345
Eunuch Hong.

412
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,850
Can I ask you a favor one more time?

413
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,981
I still have lingering feelings.

414
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,818
I do not think I can do it myself.

415
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,406
Can you take these

416
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,451
and burn them for me?

417
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,871
Your Highness.

418
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,819
What are these?

419
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,742
These are the letters

420
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,619
that Consort Park asked me to get rid of.

421
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,748
Are you the messenger
in Consort Park's residence?

422
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,458
MESSENGER: SOMEONE WHO CONVEYS THE LETTERS

423
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,255
It is too bad of His Majesty
to do this, isn't it?

424
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,425
His Majesty has been sending Consort Park
blank letters as his response.

425
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,104
This is not from His Majesty.

426
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,900
Consort Park's letters never get delivered
to His Majesty anyway.

427
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,738
It is different this time.

428
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,368
His Majesty directly ordered me
to convey this letter to Consort Park.

429
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,416
If he were going to send the same
blank letter anyway,

430
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,710
why did His Majesty specifically
choose me to be the messenger?

431
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,671
I really can't understand.

432
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,257
How did His Majesty get the letter?

433
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,384
Well,

434
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,180
I secretly put it
between the letters of appeal.

435
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,224
Still, she got the blank letter.

436
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,226
Is that true?

437
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,395
Yes, it is.

438
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,984
Now she has lost all hope

439
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,278
because of you.

440
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,462
Consort Park's health is not good.

441
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,673
Please visit her at her residence.

442
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,594
I will send her a royal physician.

443
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,931
I can do that myself.

444
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,227
It would not help her enough
even if I visit her.

445
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,855
She will feel much better
if she can at least see you.

446
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,316
That is what

447
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,527
only you can do.

448
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,369
The Queen is pregnant,
so she is very sensitive.

449
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,038
I will wait for the right moment

450
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,582
and consider visiting her.

451
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,839
What are you afraid of?

452
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,637
What are you so afraid of
that you cannot do anything?

453
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,805
To be exact,

454
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,516
you are not doing anything.

455
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,855
You didn't do anything

456
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,567
when Mother passed away.

457
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,784
Father!

458
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,579
Why did Mother pass away suddenly?

459
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,501
Your mother passed away
due to an unknown illness.

460
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,919
That is all.

461
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,338
I heard the court ladies talking about it.

462
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,632
They said she didn't pass away
from an illness!

463
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,511
-Who tried to harm Mother?
-Crown Prince!

464
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,223
You should never say such a thing
ever again. Do you understand?

465
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,352
Father, please uncover the truth.

466
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,855
Please find them!

467
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,900
Please get those who harmed Mother.

468
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,236
Crown Prince!

469
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,657
You could not do anything.

470
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,036
You did not do anything,
and it was right here

471
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,165
where you told me to wait.

472
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,628
It might not have been different
if you had come forward.

473
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,797
It might have been meaningless.

474
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,216
Still, you should have done something

475
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,177
instead of hiding like this,
shuddering with fear.

476
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,515
After all,

477
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,395
you are the King of Joseon.

478
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,099
Would it be wrong for me to keep it

479
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,226
since Her Highness asked me to burn it?

480
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,396
What is holding you back?
It’s not even yours.

481
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,815
I know.

482
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,904
Its pleasant scent makes it hard
for me to burn it.

483
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,698
Is the paper scented?

484
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,658
Yes.

485
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,161
It smells like sweet apples.

486
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,502
JIPBOKHEON

487
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,344
What brings you here
late at night, Your Highness?

488
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,890
I told you I would come every day
until your coughing gets better.

489
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,017
What if I am not getting better

490
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,937
because I enjoy Your Highness' company?

491
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,201
I have thrown away

492
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,203
all the blank letters.

493
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,082
Seven years have passed

494
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,419
since I have last seen His Majesty

495
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,963
and since I have started to send letters.

496
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,800
I should have stopped

497
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,011
a long time ago.

498
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,017
Seven years ago,

499
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,397
you comforted me when I was in distress
after losing my mother.

500
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,779
You have grown up so fast, Your Highness.

501
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,325
Would you allow me to stay by your side

502
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,536
like you have done so for me?

503
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,794
Oh, my!

504
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,172
I told you to just say it if you have…

505
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,653
What? How is this possible?

506
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,073
It’s written with apple vinegar.
The letters appear when it’s heated up.

507
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,911
Awesome!

508
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,039
I will think of you as my brother
from now on!

509
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,627
I will not allow that.

510
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,380
Hey, don’t be like that.

511
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,465
You are practically my brother now.

512
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,952
Silver Spoon! I figured it out!

513
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,370
The blank letters from His Majesty

514
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,664
were not actually blank!
They were secret letters!

515
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,791
-What?
-Anyway,

516
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,877
I'll talk to you later!

517
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,503
Hey!

518
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,013
Your Highness, may I come inside?

519
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,475
-Who is there?
-It’s Eunuch Hong, Your Highness!

520
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,353
Let him in.

521
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,985
Please hurry, Your Highness.
His Majesty is waiting for you.

522
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,406
What are you talking about?
Tell me what's going on.

523
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,800
Consort Park.

524
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,761
I am writing this letter
with mixed feelings.

525
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:46,183
As much as I want you to read this,
I don't want you to at the same time.

526
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,645
I am an incompetent king,

527
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,899
a helpless husband, and a cowardly father.

528
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,780
Forgive me as this is my only way
to express my feelings.

529
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:06,495
Waiting for the day
when you finally get to read this letter,

530
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,872
I go out every night

531
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,960
to the Aeryeon Garden
where we used to take a stroll together.

532
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,285
It might have been meaningless.

533
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,620
Still, you should've done something

534
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,497
instead of hiding like this,
shuddering with fear.

535
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,461
After all,

536
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,257
you are the king of Joseon.

537
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,311
I cannot do anything!

538
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,396
I should not!

539
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,987
This is the only way

540
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,448
I can protect you.

541
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,206
When I tried to do something as the King,

542
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,334
two thousand innocent people
lost their lives.

543
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,630
I lost the Queen because of my actions!

544
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,135
I lost everyone that I cared for…

545
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,846
all because I tried to be the King.

546
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,266
The only thing

547
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,520
that I can do

548
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,813
to protect my people…

549
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,860
is to do nothing.

550
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,364
Absolutely nothing!

551
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,963
Now, Consort Park will know
how His Majesty really feels.

552
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,090
I'm glad.

553
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,100
I wonder…

554
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,770
why His Majesty had to be so secretive.

555
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,150
His Majesty is an almighty king
who rules this country.

556
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,322
What is there for His Majesty
to hide and worry about?

557
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,201
I've realized it just now.

558
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,497
Despite the crown on his head,

559
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,709
he is a loving husband.

560
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:03,463
And to me, he is my one and only father.

561
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:15,017
“You cannot do that, Your Majesty!”

562
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,062
Every direction that I suggest to go,

563
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,107
you all just say
that will only lead to a dead-end.

564
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,860
All you do is sit in front of me

565
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,864
and disapprove of everything I say!

566
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,532
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

567
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,075
It is not the ideas I suggest

568
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,621
that you don’t approve of.

569
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,917
It is the very person who is speaking!
Am I wrong?

570
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,087
-That is not the case, Your Majesty.
-That is not the case, Your Majesty.

571
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,719
I think

572
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:55,349
Premier Kim, who is well-respected
by every official and people of Joseon,

573
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,685
should take the throne.

574
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,229
Your Majesty,

575
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,524
please be calm.

576
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,444
Why? Do you not approve of this either?

577
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,156
Then…

578
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,909
Minister of Taxation, how about you?

579
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,870
Your Majesty!

580
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,415
What about you,
Minister of Public Administration?

581
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,501
Your Majesty!

582
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,090
That's right!

583
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:31,385
The Crown Prince! He is smart and capable!

584
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,303
Great!

585
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,680
Chief Eunuch!

586
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

587
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,726
Bring in the Crown Prince
to the executive office immediately!

588
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,874
Oh, my Crown Prince. You're finally here.

589
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,087
As you may all know,

590
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,172
this country is suffering

591
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,842
because of my incompetence.

592
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,802
I deeply regret it.

593
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,388
I will order the Crown Prince

594
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,432
to be my regent.

595
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,357
What are your thoughts?

596
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,109
Your Majesty.

597
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:41,037
He is hurt and begging for consolation.
Let's give him what he wants.

598
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,544
You must not, Your Majesty.

599
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,506
Historically speaking,
there hasn't been any king

600
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,967
who appointed a regent in his forties.

601
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,303
Your Majesty, please revoke
your royal command.

602
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,973
-We beg of you, Your Majesty.
-We beg of you, Your Majesty.

603
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,727
What do you say, Premier Kim?

604
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,400
If His Highness is willing to,

605
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,655
this could not get any better.

606
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,332
Tell me what you think.

607
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:32,506
This is so sudden that I do not know
what to do, Your Majesty.

608
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:41,473
Although I may look like
an adult in this formal attire,

609
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,976
I am still a little child.

610
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,523
Why do you lay such a burden on me

611
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,610
when I am still afraid
to leave the nest, Your Majesty?

612
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,828
Oh, my.

613
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,498
Like father, like son.
Look at him shaking.

614
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,752
He has been acting tough all along.
I feel sorry for him.

615
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,514
However,

616
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,058
on second thought,

617
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,602
I do not think there is any reason…

618
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,231
not to obey your command, Your Majesty.

619
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,410
I will

620
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,579
happily,

621
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,415
delightfully obey

622
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,792
your royal command.

623
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,591
They are mad.

624
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,301
They are both mad.

625
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,895
I need to tell you something,
Your Majesty.

626
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,356
I will share

627
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,442
Your Majesty's burden.

628
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:21,448
Appoint me as your regent
at tomorrow's morning meeting.

629
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,995
But there is something I need.

630
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,581
Of course.

631
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,375
What is it? Go ahead and tell me.

632
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:36,129
A father to lean on…

633
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,175
when I am weak…

634
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,598
and afraid.

635
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,192
Yeong.

636
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,639
You are assigned to
the Crap Prince's palace.

637
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:32,018
You should have done better
at Consort Park's residence.

638
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,736
-Hong Sam-nom.
-Yes?

639
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,532
You beat off ghosts in Jahyeondang
where everyone runs away from.

640
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,950
Why are you so surprised?

641
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:51,246
I could not beat off all the ghosts

642
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,373
so I made friends with a few.

643
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,251
That is what I wanted to hear.

644
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,253
You're exactly the one
we have been looking for.

645
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,383
First, take these books to the library
in the backyard.

646
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:07,303
Keep quiet for His Highness is reading.

647
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,763
Yes, sir.

648
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,269
Wait, Eunuch Jang. His Highness is there?

649
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,604
I can't…

650
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,217
Silver Spoon.

651
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,596
What are you doing here?

652
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,225
What about you?

653
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,020
I'm running errands.

654
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:04,110
Have you seen His Highness?

655
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,322
-I heard he is in here.
-What?

656
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,033
No, I haven't.

657
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,410
Thank goodness.

658
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,746
I was so nervous.

659
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,084
What are you doing there?

660
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:23,296
This library is for His Highness only.

661
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,633
Get out at once if you are done.

662
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,052
Yes, sir.

663
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,895
Silver Spoon.

664
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:43,108
Did you hear that? Let's go.

665
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,902
This place is off limit
except for His Highness.

666
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,409
What are you doing?

667
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,411
We have to leave.

668
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,081
Let's go before we run into His Highness.

669
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,253
Why do you hide it from him,
Your Highness?

670
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,296
He will find out soon anyway.

671
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:16,015
I'm telling you this as your friend,
so keep that in mind.

672
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,809
My friend?

673
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,687
Since when were we friends?

674
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,690
If not friends, what are we?

675
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,994
Then what is your name, Silver Spoon?

676
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,584
Hey.

677
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,254
You asked me what my name is.

678
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,086
Lee Yeong.

679
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,880
That is my name.

680
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,710
You may treat me as your friend
whenever it's just the two of us.

681
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,254
No, I command you to do so.

682
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,965
What are we?

683
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,425
Two people who share a secret.

684
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,636
Are you suggesting that we get them
to fight each other?

685
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,264
A power tripping envoy
and the Crown Prince with a temper.

686
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,141
For the solo dance in the end…
I will leave it to Ae-sim.

687
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,851
The Royal Banquet is important
to His Highness.

688
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,395
He's probably having a hard time

689
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,063
because so many are trying
to bring him down.

690
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,277
The solo dance is supposed to start soon,
but the dancer is nowhere to be found.

691
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,236
What?

692
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,530
Isn't this Ae-sim's costume?
