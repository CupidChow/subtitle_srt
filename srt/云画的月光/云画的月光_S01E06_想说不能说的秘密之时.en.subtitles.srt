1
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,280
Why are you staring at me like that?

2
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,658
I know it's preposterous,

3
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,704
but why do I see...

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,041
someone else in you?

5
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,211
Someone else?

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,838
Another...

7
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,174
woman.

8
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,311
Eunuch Hong.

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,990
I apologize for my tardiness.

10
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,415
Your Highness. I'm sorry,
but we have plans.

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,007
Have you forgotten about it?

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,761
I'd like you to join me if you can.

13
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,311
My apologies, Your Highness.

14
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,412
I won't allow it.

15
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,333
Your Highness?

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,006
He is my person.

17
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,272
Of course. He works
at the Crown Prince's palace.

18
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,149
So, step back.

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,777
Are you not allowing it...

20
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,530
because I'm the one

21
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,157
who wants to take Eunuch Hong?

22
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,663
I didn't know you were that important.

23
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,331
Then...

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,000
what is the reason?

25
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,844
Master Yun-seong?

26
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,264
You're the young master
from Premier Kim's family, right?

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,060
I see the famous young man
from Unjongga here too, Sam-nom.

28
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,647
What are you doing by yourselves?

29
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,567
-Let's hang out together.
-Well...

30
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,986
Get away from me.

31
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,115
Are you not glad to see me?

32
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,914
Let's go.

33
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,419
Let's have some real fun tonight.

34
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,131
You look girly,

35
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,383
but you're so manly.

36
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,306
Go.

37
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,767
Pardon?

38
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,228
I'm fine, so go without me.

39
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,110
Catch that thief!

40
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,289
Let's not get the wrong idea.

41
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,126
You've seen my upright behavior,

42
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,461
so I'm not too worried.

43
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,048
Don't worry at all.

44
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,803
I only found out

45
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,056
that you often visited
the kisaeng parlor alone.

46
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,267
There's nothing to be mistaken.

47
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,939
Right.

48
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,317
By the way,

49
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,986
all the lanterns went out
because we came too late.

50
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,155
There's nothing left to watch.

51
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,532
Who said

52
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,909
that I wanted to watch
the lantern festival?

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,374
I can't walk anymore.

54
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,085
What... What's wrong?

55
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,337
My steps...

56
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,012
have never felt so precious before.

57
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,520
Is this how you usually act
at the kisaeng parlor?

58
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,318
Sir?

59
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,861
Sir.

60
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,741
He's over there!

61
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,243
Over there!

62
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,098
Are you okay?

63
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,226
Yes, I'm fine.

64
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,485
Please give it to me.

65
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,740
I've found the mask.

66
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,546
Byeong-yeon.

67
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,260
What brings you here?

68
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,929
When did you come?

69
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,598
Don't stay out too late.

70
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,561
-Were you worried about me?
-Nonsense.

71
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,148
Go to bed.

72
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,536
Last night,

73
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,163
three places were robbed.

74
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,584
Robbery isn't something new.

75
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,003
The envoys are here,

76
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,963
so let's not make a big deal out of it.

77
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,381
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

78
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,093
But I don't have a good feeling about it.

79
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,430
He robbed the storerooms
of notorious wealthy masters

80
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,307
as if he did it for a show.

81
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,602
What are you waiting for? Show it to him.

82
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,567
They all wore this mask.

83
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,280
This is...

84
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,631
It's the same mask from the festival,
isn't it?

85
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,050
Who can it be?

86
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,428
The rumor in Unjongga

87
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,430
doesn't seem so great either.

88
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,807
What is it about?

89
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,392
That Hong Gyeong-rae's men

90
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,227
have started to move again.

91
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,399
They're instigating people
by giving out what they have stolen.

92
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,442
It's very similar to the past.

93
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,694
By any chance,

94
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,739
are the robberies
and Hong Gyeong-rae's men

95
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,617
connected to each other?

96
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,931
My apology, Your Highness.

97
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,225
Do you feel uncomfortable?

98
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,436
Did you have fun at the kisaeng parlor?

99
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,355
Pardon?

100
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,236
Yes, I did...

101
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,201
I see.

102
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,287
I guess I have been forgetting

103
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,039
that you're a man.

104
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,082
No,

105
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,961
that eunuchs are men who also want to
sleep with beautiful women.

106
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,178
Don't mind what I told you
the other night.

107
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,014
I won't...

108
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,392
mistake you for someone else ever again.

109
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,272
Eunuch Jang.

110
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,191
Yes, Your Highness.

111
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,162
You may leave the room.

112
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,830
Goodness, Minister Cho.

113
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,998
Hello, Premier Kim.

114
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,253
It's been such a long time
since you last visited the palace.

115
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,380
Let me see.

116
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,674
Our last visit to the Royal Court was...

117
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,343
Three years ago, Father.

118
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,720
Three years, it seems.

119
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,306
Introduce yourself.

120
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,142
This is Premier Kim Heon.

121
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,854
Cho Ha-yeon, at your service.

122
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,400
You look exactly like you used to
when you were a friend of the princess.

123
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,194
Oh, back then?

124
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,990
She used to pick a fight with the princess
so much and get into trouble.

125
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,867
-Oh, she did?
-Yes.

126
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,288
I will be at the executive office.

127
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,083
If the princess should turn you away,
you can find me there.

128
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,877
Oh, Father.

129
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,255
Please come in.

130
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,012
Eunuch Jang.

131
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,765
The eunuch from the royal palace
wants us to send two eunuch trainees.

132
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,393
Are you talking about me?

133
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,686
Relax.

134
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,440
You should ask somewhere else.

135
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:58,861
His Highness hates eunuchs tending
matters outside the Crown Prince's palace.

136
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,279
It seems urgent.

137
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,739
You might as well ask.

138
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,325
Leave before you get in trouble. Get lost!

139
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,868
Let eunuch Hong go.

140
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,123
I just need Hun-nam.

141
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,218
Who's Hun-nam?

142
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,928
That's me.

143
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,347
Jang Hun-nam.

144
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,182
LOYALTY

145
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,984
It must be here somewhere.

146
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,153
Is it there?

147
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,170
Your Highness.

148
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,554
That was amazing.

149
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,787
Are you all right?

150
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,958
I was shocked by such an awful shot,

151
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,042
but I am all right.

152
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,753
But why would you talk down...

153
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,266
That lantern!

154
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,435
Can you get up?

155
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,023
Are you just going to stand there
and watch?

156
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,615
Your Highness.

157
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,118
Your Highness, what happened?

158
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,582
Your Highness?

159
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,292
The Crown Prince?

160
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,509
I am Cho Ha-yeon,
daughter of Minister Cho Man-hyeong.

161
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,847
I really wanted to see you again.

162
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,273
BLACK MARKET LEDGER

163
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,237
There's something suspicious
about the envoys' movement.

164
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,157
Look into the government officials and men

165
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,951
who are close to Envoy Mok.

166
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,163
You will find out how they engage
in illegal trade.

167
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,138
It is the list of the officials
who took advantage as loan sharks.

168
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,350
LOAN AT HIGH INTEREST LEDGER

169
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,268
Is this all?

170
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,396
Yes, sir.

171
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,489
It is the information of children
who became orphans

172
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,908
or slaves after the riot, ten years ago.

173
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,702
Find out

174
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,788
if any of them could be
the child of Hong Gyeong-rae.

175
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
Yes, sir.

176
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,212
Find out before someone else does.

177
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,133
It could drive the rally
of the dispersed forces.

178
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,468
I will keep that in mind.

179
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,557
Please help yourself, Your Highness.

180
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,353
Take them away.

181
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,439
Seeing them makes me want to eat them.

182
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,274
Take them all away.

183
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,360
Her Highness wants to lose a few pounds.

184
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,532
Don't say that in front of her.

185
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,452
"I'm the one who looks like
the real princess."

186
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,495
That is what she is thinking.

187
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,832
I was making a joke as a child.

188
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,377
You look even prettier
without the extra weight, Your Highness.

189
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,384
It is not like you to say that.

190
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,225
Princess.

191
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,479
I will visit the Royal Palace
more often from now on.

192
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,647
Why?

193
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,649
Please welcome me.

194
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,196
Next time, I will bring some tea
that helps weight loss.

195
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,531
What is up with you?

196
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,842
SILVER SPOON

197
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,390
SILVER SPOON

198
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,379
Why should I hold back?

199
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,095
SILVER SPOON

200
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,404
What is so important

201
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,489
that you had to wake me up?

202
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,991
Forgive me.

203
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,493
I dare interrupted your sleep

204
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,288
because I could bring...

205
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,002
Because only I could bring you
what you desire most.

206
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,173
What I desire most?

207
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,591
Yes, sir.

208
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,134
I can guarantee.

209
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,930
You will love it.

210
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,394
Your Highness.

211
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,772
This is a medicine for your insomnia.

212
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,358
I have trouble breathing,

213
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,985
feel flushed all of a sudden,

214
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,570
and see things.

215
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,072
Do you know why?

216
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,617
In my opinion,

217
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,786
you are very healthy.

218
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,000
However, if those symptoms persist,

219
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,294
that means...

220
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,509
Well...

221
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,678
It's all right. Tell me.

222
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,598
Similar symptom in Donguibogam

223
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,558
is referred as

224
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,143
the sickness of widows

225
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,563
and nuns, Your Highness.

226
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,191
The sickness of widows and nuns?

227
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,151
Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,654
Forgive me, Your Highness.

229
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,615
Well...

230
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,617
It is natural

231
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,912
for Yin and Yang to be in harmony.

232
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,749
If your heart aches for those
it should not ache for,

233
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,877
and starts to agonize you...

234
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,796
Goodness.

235
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,800
How dare you.

236
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,301
You better watch your words.

237
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,178
Get out!

238
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,138
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,193
JAHYEONDANG

240
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,280
A night shift for a eunuch trainee?

241
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,491
Yes. I was just informed.

242
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,661
I won't be in all night.
Don't wait up for me.

243
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,247
Good night.

244
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,551
Eunuch Ma, why am I on the night shift
at the Envoy Residence?

245
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,428
You will know when we get there.

246
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,138
Where?

247
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,980
Eunuch Ma.

248
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,117
Come closer.

249
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,664
I am here for the night shift
at the Envoy Residence.

250
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,376
I will go outside and do my job.

251
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,421
So, that pretty dancer

252
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,423
was you?

253
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,517
Tell me,

254
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,062
why are you dressed as a eunuch

255
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,857
inside the Royal Palace?

256
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,654
I am just curious.

257
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,157
Come and sit.

258
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,661
Please.

259
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,623
Are you a boy with a pretty face

260
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,751
or a girl pretending to be a eunuch?

261
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,796
Please stop.

262
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,719
Aren't you a eunuch of
the Crown Prince's palace?

263
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,223
Don't you know

264
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,809
that the fate of your Crown Prince lies

265
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,727
on the tip of my tongue?

266
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,606
It is duty

267
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,318
of a eunuch to give up his life
for the master.

268
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,196
Don't you dare move.

269
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,075
Please let me go!

270
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,664
Are you... Are you all right?

271
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,379
Who is it?

272
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,013
It's me.

273
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,475
Crown Prince.

274
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,869
Let's go.

275
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,163
Your Highness.

276
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,748
Is anyone outside?

277
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,252
-Will you
-Your Highness.

278
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,755
-be able to handle the consequences?
-Your Highness.

279
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,634
Damn it.

280
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,053
How should I deal with this?

281
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,973
Why on earth did he do it?

282
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,268
I was worried

283
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,439
this might happen one day.

284
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,193
Still, how could he ill-treat the envoy?

285
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,990
Your Majesty, don't worry too much.

286
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,492
I'll tell Premier Kim to come at once.

287
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,169
Your Highness.

288
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,046
Your Highness.

289
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,422
Gosh, Your Highness.

290
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,134
How could you...

291
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,266
go into his room recklessly like that?

292
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,769
Did you think about
what could've happened?

293
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,190
My apology, Your Highness.

294
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,817
I was ordered to keep a watch at--

295
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,362
You should've gotten out of there
if you thought something was strange.

296
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:37,118
A mere eunuch like me
can't disobey any order.

297
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,871
What's more, he's the envoy
representing the Qing Dynasty.

298
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,166
I was worried you might be
put in trouble because of me.

299
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,834
Who are you to worry about that?

300
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,340
What's the big deal about the envoy?

301
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,759
Who are you to...

302
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,645
Who are you to make me so angry?

303
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,324
What are you doing?

304
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,414
Your Highness, my apology.

305
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,500
We were ordered to arrest
Eunuch Hong Sam-nom.

306
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,460
Free him right this instant.

307
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,671
I'll talk to my father myself.

308
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,301
Please step back.

309
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,136
If you do this,

310
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,556
I'll have to kill him to take him.

311
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,936
How dare you threaten me?

312
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,939
My apology, Your Highness.

313
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,829
Your Majesty.

314
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,207
Please make the Envoy Mok take
responsibility for what he has done.

315
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,170
And punish me for
showing discourtesy with the law.

316
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,343
You can't put the blame
only on the weak eunuch.

317
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,555
If he is at fault,

318
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,974
it is being loyal to you

319
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,143
as your servant.

320
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,604
Please revoke your command.

321
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,107
Listen.

322
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,860
Lock the Crown Prince in his palace.

323
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,945
Keep strict guard on him.

324
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,036
Your Majesty!

325
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,462
JAHYEONDANG

326
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,224
I told you
there are ups and downs in life.

327
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,060
Because the Crown Prince took
the throne in the interim,

328
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,231
you acted so proudly
as if you became a chief eunuch.

329
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,068
-When did I?
-What should you do now?

330
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,363
What if he gets dethroned?

331
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,032
You can't say as you please
just because you have a mouth.

332
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,285
Dethronement? How dare you!

333
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,411
You startled me.

334
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,580
Why are you yelling at me?

335
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,498
Your superior is the one
who caused the trouble.

336
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,334
What's the big deal about
that mere eunuch after all?

337
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,295
Oh, dear.

338
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,921
By any chance,

339
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,048
is the rumor true then?

340
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,926
What rumor?

341
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,219
That the Crown Prince...

342
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,639
-is gay.
-How dare you!

343
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,350
I won't stay still

344
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:33,021
-if you spread such a rumor.
-Hey!

345
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,899
Even people in Unjongga might hear this

346
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,234
not because of me,
but because of your loud voice.

347
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,320
I know

348
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,239
that he isn't gay.

349
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,826
What?

350
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,579
Whom he likes

351
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,248
might not be a man.

352
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,834
-What?
-Goodness.

353
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,004
I wasn't going to say this...

354
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,547
Eunuch Ma.

355
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,883
Master Kim.

356
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,595
I need to talk to you.

357
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,016
Did you take

358
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,685
Eunuch Hong to the Envoy Residence

359
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,063
that night?

360
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,815
Pardon?

361
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,650
Yes, sir.

362
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,486
The eunuch who was originally on duty

363
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,112
had an urgent matter to attend.

364
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,745
What is that?

365
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,708
I came to have this gun by chance

366
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,585
when I was in the Qing Dynasty.

367
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,506
I got my hands on a few bullets

368
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,716
out of curiosity as well.

369
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,884
I see.

370
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,345
Why are you showing this to me?

371
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,265
It doesn't need any gunpowder to be fired.

372
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,064
It gets fired...

373
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,322
if I pull the trigger like this.

374
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,491
Why are you doing this to me?

375
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,327
Don't mess with...

376
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,580
Eunuch Hong.

377
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,626
Why are you so concerned
about Eunuch Hong's business?

378
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:19,919
By any chance,

379
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,672
do you also know the secret I know?

380
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,728
Don't be curious.

381
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,771
Don't speak of it.

382
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,902
If anyone speaks about
Eunuch Hong's secret from this moment on,

383
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,403
I plan to...

384
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,780
kill you

385
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,991
no matter what.

386
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,914
I only have one last bullet now.

387
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,626
I will

388
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,128
save this for you

389
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,226
Goodness.

390
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,771
You look horrible.

391
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,065
Well...

392
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,151
Is the Crown Prince all right?

393
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,196
You're not in the place
to worry about him now.

394
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,119
It's chaotic in the Crown Prince's palace.

395
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,872
Even Japanese invasions
seems to look better.

396
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,792
His Highness...

397
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,836
might be dethroned.

398
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:54,973
Dethroned?

399
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,645
Stay on your toes.

400
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,564
Don't skip meals.

401
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,859
Eunuch Hong.

402
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,529
Are you listening to me?

403
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,155
Who are you?

404
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,740
Catch them.

405
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,158
Catch them.

406
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,785
Catch them!

407
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,828
-Stop there.
-Run.

408
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,787
Hurry.

409
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,926
The envoys will depart

410
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,804
at eight o'clock in the morning
after two days from now.

411
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,098
Did you hear anything from the official

412
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,307
who promised us to come?

413
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,977
No, I don't think he has arrived yet.

414
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,981
We must secure

415
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,693
the evidence to take down Envoy Mok.

416
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,912
No one in the palace
should find out about us.

417
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,208
What are you thinking so hard about?

418
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,585
Pardon?

419
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,129
What did you say?

420
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,382
I asked you how many men are
guarding in front of my palace

421
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,634
and whether we could sneak outside.

422
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,310
Your Highness. Please no.

423
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,855
Your Highness. You might injure yourself.

424
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,982
-Your Highness.
-Catch the Crown Prince.

425
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,942
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

426
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,775
Your Highness.

427
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,276
It's okay.

428
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,112
Stay seated.

429
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,787
How did you come here?

430
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,710
I'll be staying here...

431
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,588
only for a short time.

432
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,861
You must return.

433
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,071
No one is allowed here

434
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,698
except for the soldiers.

435
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,867
Did you forget?

436
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,619
I am the Crown Prince.

437
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,498
I know.

438
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,834
You should not abuse your powers

439
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,587
for a mere eunuch trainee.

440
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,422
It's okay...

441
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,926
when you're the Crown Prince.

442
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,395
Finally, you're smiling.

443
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,585
Your Highness.

444
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,715
Are you still...

445
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,927
angry because of me?

446
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,222
It's not because of you.

447
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,852
It's because of me.
Because I can't control my anger...

448
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,899
when I look at you.

449
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,365
Promise me one thing.

450
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,202
No matter what happens,

451
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,080
do not hold back for someone else.

452
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,833
Especially for me.

453
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,212
Your Highness.

454
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,588
Promise.

455
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,925
That you will never do it again.

456
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,648
I promise, Your Highness.

457
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,505
To disrespect an envoy

458
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,758
is to disrespect the emperor himself.

459
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,678
I cannot go back

460
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,139
to the emperor after such disgrace.

461
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,141
If it were up to me,

462
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,268
I'd take the Crown Prince...

463
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,311
What?

464
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,687
That is...

465
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,108
I understand, but the Crown Prince?

466
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,818
I am only saying.

467
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,404
At least I should take that eunuch

468
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,407
to be punished by the law
of the Qing Dynasty.

469
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,325
Never.

470
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,536
He is only a trainee who doesn't--

471
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,330
What do you think you're doing?

472
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,041
Who do you think you are talking to?
Sit down.

473
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,755
Well.

474
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,424
Would that be all?

475
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,653
What brings you here?

476
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,323
I came as a friend.

477
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,325
Is this necessary?

478
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,082
What is it?

479
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,752
I was wondering if I could help you.

480
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:42,838
No.

481
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,925
I need your help.

482
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,771
What's the big deal about the envoy?

483
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,773
Who are you to...

484
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,194
Who are you to make me so angry?

485
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,493
His Highness...

486
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,663
might be dethroned.

487
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,586
Promise me one thing.

488
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,590
No matter what happens,

489
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,385
do not hold back for someone else.

490
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,389
Especially for me.

491
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,416
Please.

492
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,002
I need to talk to this boy.

493
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,211
Yes, sir.

494
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,594
Although

495
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,681
it is a eunuch's duty to give up
his life for his master,

496
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,142
I am sorry.

497
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,937
I am sending away an innocent boy.

498
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,983
His Highness

499
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,154
cried and begged on cold ground all night

500
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,781
to save you.

501
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,912
His Highness?

502
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,794
Do you have family?

503
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,547
I will visit them.

504
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,512
There is a man who rescued and raised me
during the panic.

505
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,472
But now,

506
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,183
I don't know where he is.

507
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,684
The panic?

508
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,688
Did you lose your parents
during the riot, ten years ago?

509
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,315
Yes.

510
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,776
I lost my mother then.

511
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,488
How old are you?

512
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,573
You should go now.

513
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:17,952
Let's go.

514
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,286
I...

515
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,121
I am 18 years old.

516
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,725
Keep an eye on him.

517
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,978
We need to keep him alive

518
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,063
until we get to Qing Dynasty.

519
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,740
Let's go.

520
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,713
Stop.

521
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,527
What an honor to have His Highness

522
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,779
send us off, I must say.

523
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,948
I am grateful for your welcome.

524
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,582
That is enough.

525
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,209
Leave this eunuch behind.

526
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,215
What do you think you are doing?

527
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,809
We are sending off an envoy of a nation.

528
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,606
How could you draw your sword
only for a mere eunuch?

529
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,649
You are right.

530
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,277
I have never had something
taken away from me.

531
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,696
Therefore, I am deeply upset.

532
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
Let him go right now!

533
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,624
Are you concerned
about only one of your subjects?

534
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,168
Think about the countless subjects

535
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,004
trembling in fear because of
an immature tyrant.

536
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,135
Subjects trembling in fear.

537
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,430
That is your greatest weapon.

538
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,976
They are a tool to get what you want

539
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,854
and an excuse to hide when in trouble.

540
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,357
Am I wrong?

541
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,277
When will you stop complaining
like a child?

542
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,988
Put that sword away at once.

543
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,242
I will go.

544
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,168
I will

545
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,587
leave.

546
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,134
Did you forget the promise you made?

547
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,681
You told me not to hold back.

548
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,642
Especially for you.

549
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,645
So,

550
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,440
I won't hold back.

551
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,569
Your Highness.

552
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,905
You should hold back.

553
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,994
Not for me, but for the subjects.

554
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,290
You are the Crown Prince of this country.

555
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,681
Out of my way.

556
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,850
It's an order from His Majesty.

557
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,518
Give me your sword.

558
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,630
Let's go.

559
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,178
Your Highness.

560
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,648
Stay strong.

561
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,191
Your Highness.

562
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,890
Stop, everyone. We'll take a break here.

563
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,517
Stop.

564
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,733
Follow me quietly with only a few men.

565
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,193
Yes, sir.

566
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,572
Take him and tie him up.

567
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,540
Taking the Crown Prince's temper
into consideration,

568
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:01,044
there might be a lot of trouble
at the Royal Court in the future.

569
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,881
He's looking at the world
with overflowing ambition,

570
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,175
so everything might be
unsatisfying for him.

571
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,179
The King was the same
when he was at the Crown Prince's age.

572
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,890
He desired for change and reformation.

573
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,561
However, think about its result.

574
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,232
The result is tragic,

575
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,987
but you need to take the risk
if you want to change things.

576
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,864
Joseon

577
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,074
is the country of officials.

578
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,328
It's most dangerous

579
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,872
when the king considers himself

580
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,166
in power.

581
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,087
Oh, dear.

582
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,132
Oh, well.

583
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,597
I keep wondering about
what you wish to say to me.

584
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,515
I'm quite distracted.

585
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,685
I can't focus on fishing.

586
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,485
For the safety of the country
and the Royal Court,

587
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,989
I need you to support me.

588
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,367
I am

589
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,787
asking you to be my in-laws now.

590
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,532
Who is it?

591
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,837
I prepared a gift for you,

592
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,839
but I forgot to give it to you.

593
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,180
I can fight them alone.
Please step behind.

594
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,934
You should've said that
before I drew my sword.

595
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,084
Step aside.

596
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,420
He's the investigation censor

597
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,005
of the Qing Dynasty.

598
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,513
My apologies for the ignorance.

599
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,482
Do you like my farewell gift?

600
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,277
What are you doing?

601
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,740
Pocketing the tributes wasn't enough,

602
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,742
and you tried to smuggle them too.

603
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,038
As far as I know, in the Qing Dynasty,
people get exiled at the least

604
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,873
for smuggling sulfur and bull's horns.

605
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,167
Am I wrong?

606
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,586
They get executed for smuggling sulfur.

607
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,255
I...

608
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,091
I will tell the Emperor
that this is a conspiracy.

609
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,469
Whose words do you think
the Emperor will believe in?

610
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,097
Right.

611
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,349
He won't believe in my words.

612
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,854
So, I invited another guest.

613
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,136
I heard that they changed
their return route to the Qing Dynasty.

614
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,513
It's a long way with rough roads,

615
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,932
but they might do it there
if they're making a deal.

616
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,148
I marked it on the map.

617
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,444
Will you...

618
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,448
be all right?

619
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,285
We'll save Eunuch Hong by doing this,

620
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,203
so I'm all right.

621
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,421
It's the list of merchants
who made trafficking deals with Envoy Mok.

622
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,932
The last deal will take place
on their way back.

623
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,770
We must find which merchant
he's making a deal with.

624
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,730
Can you find it out?

625
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,231
Yes, Your Highness.

626
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,900
But we don't have enough time.

627
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,485
I'll stop Envoy Mok from departing somehow

628
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,946
until you arrive tomorrow.

629
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,056
How dare you disgrace the country

630
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,101
using your position!

631
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,353
You're mistaken.

632
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,105
I will

633
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,316
explain everything to you.

634
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,442
There's no need.

635
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,780
You'll pay the price only with your life.

636
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,707
Your Highness.

637
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,336
You shouldn't be doing this.

638
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,171
Let's go back.

639
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,884
You can go now.

640
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,013
Are you sure about that?

641
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,230
Everything is all right now.

642
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,449
I was afraid
that I might be taken away like this.

643
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,245
I was afraid as well...

644
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,291
that I might be late.

645
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,798
How dare you break the promise with me?

646
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,218
I'll make you pay for it
once we return to the palace.

647
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,307
Can I return to the palace?

648
00:57:58,766 --> 00:57:59,601
Of course.

649
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,024
You said you get angry when I am around
that you can't stand it.

650
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,319
It's still the same.

651
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,156
I get angry when I see you.

652
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,453
But I can't help it.

653
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,081
Without you around,

654
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,502
I was even angrier. It drove me crazy.

655
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,136
So,

656
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,014
stay by my side.

657
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:48,900
Let's go.
