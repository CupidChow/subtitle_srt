1
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,570
Daughter's Friend

2
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,460
Ten years later

3
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,780
Who is it?

4
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,100
Who is this?

5
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,140
Who is this?

6
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,140
- Who...
- Dad!

7
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Dad!

8
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,246
Eun-ji, what brings you here so early?

9
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:52,233
Didn't I tell you that
I'll be visiting today?

10
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,050
Are you upset that I'm here?

11
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,839
Of course not!

12
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,539
I'm so happy to see you.

13
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,910
Me too, dad!

14
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,260
- You're always welcome.
- I missed you so much.

15
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,090
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

16
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,090
I'm sure it wasn't easy
coming all the way here.

17
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,740
Did you have breakfast yet?

18
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,195
If not, should I prepare breakfast?

19
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,760
Take your time eating.

20
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,920
So, your summer break just started?

21
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:18,173
That's right.

22
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,108
Then why don't you go on an
overseas trip with your friends?

23
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,786
- Speaking of that.
- Yes?

24
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:29,239
I have something to tell you.

25
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,650
What is it?

26
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,486
I have this friend...

27
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,516
Who's planning to
write a novel during the break.

28
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,499
So I told her she could
stay here during the break.

29
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,792
What?

30
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,023
At my resort?

31
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,553
For the whole summer break?

32
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,297
Is it not possible?

33
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:50,572
She can't afford to stay anywhere else.

34
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,806
But she promised one thing.

35
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,790
She said she'd clean the rooms
and handle customer service.

36
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,890
But there's no vacant rooms.

37
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,990
Come on, I know there’s
plenty on the second floor.

38
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:06,706
But those rooms
are for the customers.

39
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,220
Dad, please help me out.

40
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:12,213
I already told my friend
that it's possible.

41
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,320
Dad, just this once.

42
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,712
Please, dad.

43
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,183
Oh my...

44
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:23,733
Alright then.

45
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,273
Tell her to come over.

46
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,250
- Really?
- Yeah.

47
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,100
- Promise?
- Alright.

48
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,660
Thanks, I'll tell her to come right now.

49
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:36,026
Finish eating before calling your friend.

50
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,960
My goodness.

51
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:40,516
Are you that happy?

52
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,193
Dad, come down stairs.

53
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,378
Alright, I'll be right there.

54
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,690
Se-young!

55
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,410
Welcome!

56
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,870
Wasn't it a long way to come?

57
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,670
Not at all.

58
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,830
I'm glad you're here.

59
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,730
Dad, this is Se-young.

60
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,030
Hello.

61
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,220
Nice to meet you.

62
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,158
It's been a while.

63
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,910
You little cutie.

64
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,686
Dad, what are you doing?

65
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,283
Nothing.

66
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:46,686
Come on out.

67
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,660
Alright.

68
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,640
Here, I'll do it for you.

69
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,120
I prepared barbecue
since Se-young came today.

70
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,277
Good job.

71
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,473
Sorry for dropping by unannounced.

72
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,050
Please don't be.

73
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,206
You're my daughter's friend.

74
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,670
I was also in the mood
for barbecue today anyway.

75
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,790
So don't worry,
and feel free to eat.

76
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,310
Let's all cheers together.

77
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,460
Shall we?

78
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,570
A toast to the completion
of Se-young's novel!

79
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,260
No, let me do it again.

80
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,480
Thanks to Mr. Won-ki
for providing me a room.

81
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,653
Cheers for Mr. Won-ki!

82
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:53,235
Alright, cheers for my dad!

83
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,370
You're making me blush!

84
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,060
Come on dad, let's cheers.

85
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Alright then.

86
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,160
Cheers!

87
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,153
I love beer, but the downside is

88
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,860
that it makes me
go to the bathroom often.

89
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,240
Then just pee on your pants.

90
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,040
Are you serious?

91
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,780
I'll go to the bathroom.

92
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,630
Mr. Won-ki, you're not
as good at drinking as I thought.

93
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,550
It's just the way my body works.

94
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,400
You don’t need to
speak to me so formally.

95
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,380
Really?

96
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,720
Excuse me?

97
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,790
Is she drunk already?

98
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,210
No, I'm not.

99
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm totally fine.

100
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,810
Yeah right.

101
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,540
You look totally drunk.

102
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,080
Dad, don't you think so?

103
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,520
I think we should stop drinking.

104
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,160
No.

105
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,240
I saw that you're a good drinker.

106
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,570
What are you saying?

107
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,340
My dad can barely handle a can of beer.

108
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,830
No.

109
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,490
I saw Mr. Won-ki
drinking more than that.

110
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,140
You're wrong.

111
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,930
Eun-ji.

112
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,860
I think you should take her
back to the room.

113
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,440
Let's go to your room.

114
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,699
Have a good night.

115
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,340
What am I thinking?

116
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,047
Pull yourself together!

117
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:21,970
- Did you just wake up?
- Yeah

118
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,450
I prepared hangover soup for you.

119
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:26,955
Isn't this bean sprout hangover soup?

120
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,470
Dad, why did you
drink so much yesterday?

121
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,859
I didn't drink that much.

122
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,660
Let me try the soup first.

123
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,820
It's really good.

124
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,420
What about Se-young?

125
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,049
She's sleeping off the hangover.

126
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,670
She has no appetite for breakfast.

127
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Really?

128
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,700
By the way, Eun-ji...

129
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yes?

130
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,010
Well...

131
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,130
Se-young...

132
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,160
Doesn’t she look like your mom?

133
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,616
I know, that's why we got close.

134
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,651
I knew it.

135
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:19,797
When I first saw her,

136
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:23,039
it felt like your mom
came back to life.

137
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,211
Are you happy to see mom again?

138
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,712
What are you saying?

139
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,443
I'm just joking.

140
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,138
Why get so startled?

141
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,433
Dad, do you still miss mom a lot?

142
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,960
I want you to meet someone new.

143
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,969
I'm sure that's what mom wants too.

144
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:10,939
Mr. Won-ki, did you have a good sleep?

145
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:14,247
Of course I did.

146
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:15,956
Did you have a hangover?

147
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:17,339
No.

148
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,376
I'm feeling fine.

149
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:24,680
Eun-ji made bean sprout
hangover soup for you.

150
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,090
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

151
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:29,195
I don't usually eat breakfast.

152
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,474
I see.

153
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,660
Mr. Won-ki.

154
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,587
Let me do it for you.

155
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:45,447
Don't worry about it.

156
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:47,932
Come on, I can't
just stay here for free.

157
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,786
Lift your legs.

158
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,500
If you're not going to help,
then don't get in my way.

159
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,300
Alright.

160
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,290
I'll do the vacuuming
after the baseball game.

161
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,449
Is it me, or the baseball game?

162
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,620
Why ask something so obvious?

163
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,470
Of course, it's the baseball game.

164
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,150
Stop watching it.

165
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:08,270
I can't see.

166
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,480
Come on, get out of my way.

167
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,270
Stop it.

168
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,510
I can't see.

169
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,440
- Stop watching it.
- Please!

170
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,610
That's it!

171
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,500
I had enough of you.

172
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:25,306
Let me go.

173
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,130
Mr. Won-ki.

174
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:48,505
Could you lift your legs?

175
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,010
Oh, I'm sorry.

176
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,410
I think I'll get some fresh air outside.

177
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,800
I'll be right back.

178
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,280
It's cold outside.

179
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,340
Are you angry that I came late?

180
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,503
Se-young!

181
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:45,482
Hi Se-young.

182
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:48,805
When did you come here?

183
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:50,066
Isn't it cold outside?

184
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,246
Let's go inside.

185
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,513
It's really cold.

186
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,919
This place is really nice!

187
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,710
I'm sure this place will
help you write your novel.

188
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,920
But I haven't written much yet.

189
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,820
Really?

190
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,210
Eun-ji, I didn't know you were this rich.

191
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,210
My dad is the owner, not me.

192
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:23,446
Well, since your mom passed away.

193
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:26,383
I'm sure you'll be the next owner.

194
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,530
Or maybe...

195
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,080
I should just date Eun-ji
and become the next owner of this place.

196
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,620
Are you insane?

197
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,450
Be careful with your words.

198
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,860
Who said I'll date you?

199
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,695
I was just joking.

200
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,818
- Who is he?
- Se-young's boyfriend.

201
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,540
Nice to meet you, sir.

202
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,540
My name is Hwan,
and I'm Se-young's boyfriend.

203
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,820
I see.

204
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,190
I’m not sure if it’s a bother
that I came all the way here.

205
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:03,186
Not at all.

206
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:04,401
Enjoy yourself.

207
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,666
Thank you very much.

208
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,770
Let's go.

209
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,220
This place is really nice.

210
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,620
I really like this place.

211
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,140
But I like you more.

212
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:29,873
That's cringy.

213
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,350
No, it's not.

214
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,940
It means I like you a lot.

215
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,590
Didn't you miss me?

216
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,500
Of course, I missed you a lot.

217
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,780
You're lying.

218
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,970
Why are you so calm
if you missed me a lot?

219
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,310
Lift your arms.

220
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,520
It's been so long since we had sex.

221
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,410
- I'm melting.
- You smell really good.

222
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,900
I think your breast got bigger.

223
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,820
Stop joking.

224
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,180
I really mean it.

225
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,830
Is it because
you feel aroused right now?

226
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,860
Are you turned on already?

227
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,350
Do you want to do it?

228
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,300
- Should I start?
- Yeah.

229
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,390
Really?

230
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,630
Are you sure you never
slept with anyone else?

231
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,140
It feels so tight.

232
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,940
Hold my hands.

233
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,160
It feels so good.

234
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,100
- How about you?
- Me too.

235
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,350
It feels like we're
doing it the first time.

236
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,980
Because it's been so long.

237
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,620
I'm almost there.

238
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,360
It's coming now.

239
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,720
Can I finish it inside?

240
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,580
- Yes, please.
- Are you sure?

241
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,620
Why aren't you sleeping?

242
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,540
Well...

243
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,920
I'm not sleepy yet.

244
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,720
What's the matter?

245
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,790
It's nothing.

246
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,370
I'll go to sleep now.

247
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,440
Good night.

248
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,010
Why are you drinking alone?

249
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,060
Because I couldn't sleep.

250
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,910
You could have invited
us to drink together.

251
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,100
I'm not the one who should be
hanging out with you guys.

252
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,750
Why not?

253
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm too old.

254
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,230
Age is just a number.

255
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,060
It seems like you’ve been
dating your boyfriend for a while.

256
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,340
We've been together for almost four years.

257
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,360
Then are you considering marrying him?

258
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,190
I haven't thought about that yet.

259
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,540
But fours years is...

260
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,380
Didn't you say you're going to smoke?

261
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,080
What are you doing here?

262
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,200
I was keeping Mr. Won-ki company.

263
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,740
Do you want to join?

264
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,240
Actually, I'm done drinking.

265
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,790
Why already?

266
00:46:17,606 --> 00:46:18,766
I'm feeling tired.

267
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,500
I'll go to bed now.

268
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,710
Oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,580
I think I drank too much.

270
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,010
I'm sorry.

271
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,480
What the hell?

272
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,520
What was that bump for?

273
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,099
Stop it, he's a nice person to me.

274
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,080
Are you siding that old man
just because he's taking care of you?

275
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:47,713
He's my friend's dad.

276
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,298
What can I do?

277
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,510
It seems like a lot happened...

278
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,250
While I wasn't here.

279
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:01,723
Forget it, we should stop talking.

280
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:09,986
Let go of me.

281
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:11,546
What's wrong with you?

282
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,180
I said let go!

283
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,260
Are you alright?

284
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,230
Cut it off.

285
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,210
Why did you suddenly get mad at me?

286
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:03,209
Are you sure you're alright?

287
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:06,056
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

288
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:07,753
I'm fine.

289
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,803
She'll be fine with a light massage.

290
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,180
How did you get hurt?

291
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,533
Then I guess you can't go
to take photos today.

292
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:20,629
What photos?

293
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,020
Photos for her assignment.

294
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,803
She was going to go to
the memorial hall today.

295
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,970
Hwan also came for that.

296
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,780
Well, there's nothing she can do.

297
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,370
She can't go anywhere like this.

298
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,140
But I need a partner.

299
00:48:39,163 --> 00:48:40,213
Eun-ji.

300
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:43,986
Why don't you go
since you know the area well?

301
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:46,157
That's right, do me a favor, Eun-ji.

302
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,170
Well, that's not a big deal for me.

303
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:52,393
I'll take care of Se-young.

304
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,243
You two can go.

305
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:57,316
Alright, see you later.

306
00:48:57,346 --> 00:48:58,446
Alright.

307
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,580
Bye.

308
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,990
Why don't we go to your room?

309
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,056
- Okay.
- Let's go.

310
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,506
Be careful.

311
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,090
That's it.

312
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,060
Watch your step.

313
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,870
You should've been more careful.

314
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,530
Be careful.

315
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,860
Sit down here.

316
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,980
That's it.

317
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,670
Call me if you need anything.

318
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,580
Mr. Won-ki.

319
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,510
Yes?

320
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:40,290
Could you stay here with me?

321
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:42,210
What?

322
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:46,333
I think it would be boring
to be here alone.

323
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,460
Let's have a chat.

324
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,660
'A chat'?

325
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,890
Fine.

326
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,910
Didn't we agree not to do this?

327
00:50:24,293 --> 00:50:25,293
Hey.

328
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:27,973
Do you still not know my feelings?

329
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:29,919
Am I some kind of a mistress?

330
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:32,476
What's wrong with you?

331
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:36,826
You're the one that I truly love.

332
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,300
Then break up with Se-young first.

333
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:44,297
That's not as easy as you think.

334
00:50:45,183 --> 00:50:47,263
I can't just dump her like that.

335
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,773
But we can't continue this relationship.

336
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:55,656
I really mean it.

337
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,810
I only have you.

338
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,293
Eun-ji.

339
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:03,960
You know how I feel.

340
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,330
Don't you?

341
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,270
I heard that I look like your wife.

342
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
What?

343
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,200
Eun-ji was surprised
when she first saw me.

344
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,600
So she told me everything.

345
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,660
Actually.

346
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,800
I was also really surprised
when I first saw you.

347
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,210
Your wife was a lucky woman.

348
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,000
What do you mean?

349
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,860
Your wife was lucky
to have a nice person like you.

350
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,590
Receiving all your love.

351
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,820
I'm not that nice of a person.

352
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,680
Yes, you are.

353
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,650
You seem...

354
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,310
Like a really nice person.

355
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,190
I like someone like you.

356
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,300
I'm sorry.

357
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,410
I didn't mean to...

358
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,970
I'm totally fine with it.

359
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,870
No.

360
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,300
I'm so sorry.

361
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,140
This isn't right.

362
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,940
I'm really sorry.

363
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,630
What have I done?

364
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,100
I'm totally crazy.

365
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,380
I'm completely out of my mind.

366
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,450
How could I do such thing
to my daughter's friend?

367
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,680
Why did you come here?

368
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,460
What if your injury gets worse?

369
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,340
It's fine.

370
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,880
You've done nothing wrong.

371
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,170
I'm the one that likes you.

372
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,140
So it's not your fault.

373
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,180
But this still isn't right.

374
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:21,616
I have a daughter to me.

375
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,730
And you have a boyfriend.

376
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,320
Don't worry, I will break up soon.

377
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,380
Even so, this isn't right.

378
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,590
How could we...

379
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,370
Look at me.

380
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,230
What the heck?

381
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,590
- Oh, really?
- Stop it.

382
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,980
How dare you touch my private parts.

383
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,630
Dad?

384
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,200
Dad?

385
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,610
Se-young?

386
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,893
Were you in the bathroom alone?

387
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,420
Of course, who else
would be in the bathroom with me?

388
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,980
How is your injury?

389
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:10,300
It got better after
taking a shower with hot water.

390
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,940
You're back.

391
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,590
Did you know how many times I called you?

392
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,500
I was taking a nap.

393
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,390
I'm so tired no matter
how much I sleep.

394
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,140
I feel so tired.

395
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,700
No way.

396
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,490
It can't be.

397
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,980
Dad.

398
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,100
Yes?

399
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,660
Hwan is leaving now.

400
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,870
Alright.

401
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,980
I'll come by again.

402
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:05,460
Up to you.

403
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,040
You little cutie

404
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,800
I'll come again next time.

405
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,430
Bye, sir.

406
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:26,800
Alright.

407
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,830
See you again when you
come to pick up Se-young.

408
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,520
Yes, sir.

409
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:49,850
You two seem to be much closer
after going out together.

410
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:51,227
What do you mean?

411
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,190
Hwan and I have
always been close.

412
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,820
Fine.

413
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,650
You're done eating already?

414
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,030
I don't feel like eating.

415
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,450
Why don't you eat more?

416
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,630
Forget it.

417
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,860
As I sat on the bed
and touched his thigh,

418
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,350
he couldn't hold it
and began kissing me.

419
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,860
I willingly accepted his kiss,

420
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,490
and his warm lips
started to caress me.

421
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,090
It's so relieving.

422
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,090
- Dad.
- Yes?

423
01:12:10,115 --> 01:12:11,855
I'm going to Seoul today.

424
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,720
Why suddenly?

425
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,470
I have someone to meet.

426
01:12:15,992 --> 01:12:18,242
- Who is it?
- If I tell you who it is.

427
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,643
Would you know them?

428
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,980
Then when are you coming back?

429
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,465
Probably tomorrow.

430
01:12:24,513 --> 01:12:27,373
So don't wait for me tonight.

431
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,280
Alright, do you need some money?

432
01:12:30,386 --> 01:12:31,616
No.

433
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:47,230
It's so relieving.

434
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,940
Do you like me
more than your boyfriend?

435
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:51,210
Yes, that's it.

436
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,660
Se-young.

437
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:27,450
Se-young.

438
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,130
How could you...

439
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,460
Eun-ji, I'll explain everything.

440
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,420
How could you do this to me?

441
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,020
Eun-ji, please.

442
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,600
Hurry up and put your clothes on.

443
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,810
Even so, this is not right.

444
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Eun-ji.

445
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,460
I know that this isn't right.

446
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,900
But it somehow ended up like this.

447
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,980
Did you really think that she's mom?

448
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,060
Have you gone mad?

449
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,350
Damn it.

450
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,650
You're the one at fault.

451
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,930
Stop it!

452
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,580
What do you think you're doing?

453
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,140
Dad.

454
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,940
Is it me, or Se-young?

455
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,360
Answer me!

456
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,740
- But Ji-young...
- It's not his fault.

457
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,310
You still don't get it?

458
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,200
- Shut up, you whore.
- 'Whore'?

459
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:20,180
Let's find out who the real whore is.

460
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,350
What do you mean?

461
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:26,740
Did you think I wouldn't know
what you and Hwan were doing?

462
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,300
Three years ago

463
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:30,440
Eun-ji.

464
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,460
Don't you have anything to say to me?

465
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:34,940
To you?

466
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,610
About what?

467
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,200
No, I don't.

468
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,060
Really?

469
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:43,950
Alright.

470
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,720
You're so boring.

471
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:47,850
By the way...

472
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:52,920
Is there anyone
you wouldn't want to lose?

473
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,380
- My dad.
- Why?

474
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,740
As you know, my mom
passed away when I was young.

475
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,740
So, I don't want to lose my dad as well.

476
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,310
What about you?

477
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,720
Me?

478
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:11,730
Well, I did have one person.

479
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,940
Does that mean 'not anymore'?

480
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:16,790
I think...

481
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,260
I lost that person yesterday.

482
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,630
Is it because of Hwan?

483
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,820
That's right.

484
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,050
Hwan meant everything to me.

485
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,710
Is that why you
purposely approached my dad?

486
01:17:30,735 --> 01:17:31,765
Yeah.

487
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:34,660
Now, it's your turn to lose everything.

488
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,180
Se-young.

489
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:20,770
Se-young.

490
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,420
Se-young.

491
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:26,800
Se-young!

492
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,880
Five years ago
You look like my mom.

493
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,540
Really?

494
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,510
Was your mom that pretty?

495
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,720
Yeah, just like you.

496
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,540
So, I want to thank you.

497
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,660
For what?

498
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,660
For looking like my mom.

499
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,860
Having you by my side forever,

500
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,070
it's like I'm always with my mom.

501
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,180
Dear, dear, my sweetheart.

502
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,860
I will never lose you.

503
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,570
Alright, I won't lose you too.

504
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,940
From now on, we both
have to cherish each other.

505
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,090
Do you get it?

506
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,260
Alright.

507
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,880
Promise me.
