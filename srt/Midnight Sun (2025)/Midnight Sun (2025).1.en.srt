00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,708
XP syndrome is a rare disease
in which skin cancer develops

2
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,627
when exposed to ultraviolet rays.

3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,505
Also, various complications
such as eye contraction

4
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,383
and cranial nerve disease develop.

5
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:56,389
No clear cure has been found
for this disease yet.

6
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,801
UNTITLED

7
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,532
5 MINUTES TO SUNRISE

8
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,669
ALARM

9
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,579
Fruit truck guy!

10
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,624
Morning. What can I get you?

11
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,878
Ten dollars' worth of apples, please.

12
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,921
Apples, ten dollars.

13
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,839
These are lovely.

14
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,676
-Thank you.
-Good luck today.

15
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,761
Bye.

16
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:57,362
Hey, don't sneak up on others like that.

17
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:02,367
Others? You talk like
I'm a stranger to you.

18
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,369
What are you…

19
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:10,250
You're spying on him again, creep.

20
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,586
Why don't you go talk to him?

21
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,880
Don't you see the sun?

22
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:21,261
You can always wear that.

23
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,346
Are you serious right now?

24
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,307
I'm only venting.

25
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,061
What if he stops coming here?

26
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,648
You don't even know his name or number.

27
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,697
Go and at least try having a word.

28
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,241
Like how?

29
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,674
She's coming.

30
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,226
Mi-sol!

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,979
How did it go?
What's his name? His number?

32
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,941
Oh, I forgot to ask that.

33
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,568
Seriously?

34
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,405
I'm really sorry to tell you

35
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,493
but he seems be
into the cute types like me.

36
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,537
What innovative bullshit is that?

37
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,081
Look.

38
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,833
I was watching him,

39
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,503
pretending to look at the fruits.

40
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,630
Then he suddenly talked to me.

41
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,466
What's your favorite fruit?

42
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,425
So?

43
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,468
So, I said…

44
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,013
"I like plums," and he said…

45
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,850
You like pretty fruits like yourself.

46
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,934
He said that?

47
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,312
I know!

48
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,355
Look, I'm really sorry.

49
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,859
Mi-sol, come and have some fruit.

50
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,861
Your mom must be here.

51
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,158
Yes, we are coming.

52
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,161
Hi, Mrs. Lee.

53
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,913
You're here, too.

54
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,831
Here, have some peaches.

55
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,459
Why did you get so many?

56
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,921
There was a fruit truck out front.

57
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,801
The vendor is such a sweetheart.

58
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,262
He asked me what my favorite fruit was.

59
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,433
So, I said peaches, and he said…

60
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,311
"You like pretty fruits like yourself."
Right?

61
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,190
Yeah! How do you know that?

62
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:47,031
You're so gullible.
You should've at least bought some fruits.

63
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,035
But his tone was different with me.

64
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,038
I'll go and wash these.

65
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,458
I guess he didn't just say it to me then.

66
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,127
What fruit did you say?

67
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,045
-Plums.
-Plums?

68
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,773
Hey.

69
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,027
I need you to give a breath sample.

70
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,821
What? A breath sample?

71
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,455
You did drink, didn't you?

72
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,583
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,502
Then, breathe into this.

74
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,468
Are you kidding me?
Breathe out properly.

75
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,553
Harder!

76
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,680
There.

77
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,059
It's 0.05.

78
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,102
Give me 30,000 won.

79
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,904
Where's my change?

80
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,033
Sorry, I don't have any.

81
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,701
Come on.

82
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,911
I really don't.

83
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,790
Well then, sing a song for me.

84
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,543
No, I'm not singing.

85
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,087
If you sing,
I'll give you an extra 10,000 won.

86
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,050
Please?

87
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,802
Please?

88
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,806
Well, just one song, then.

89
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,310
You're such a tease.
Honey, come and hear this.

90
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,813
A round of applause.

91
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:54,283
We're far away from each other like this

92
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:09,257
But I can picture you in my mind

93
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:23,604
Your image drifts across the night sky

94
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,286
It soaks into my heart, then fades away

95
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:52,133
When I was with you

96
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,346
I didn't know

97
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:06,647
What had become precious to me

98
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:19,994
All this time with you

99
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:26,584
I didn't realize

100
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:35,092
I put my hands together tonight
To pray again

101
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:50,024
I put my hands together tonight
To pray again

102
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,915
Damn.

103
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,041
Are you crying?

104
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,838
The song reminds me of
when I was dating your mom.

105
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,716
Anyway, darling.

106
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,429
It's a waste of talent to sing
only to yourself at home.

107
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,015
You've got to let people hear it.

108
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,851
Oh, come on.
There are tons of good singers out there.

109
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,854
No, listen to your dad.

110
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,899
If you want, I'll fully support--

111
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,983
I said I'm fine.

112
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,111
I'm going to bed.

113
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,822
Mi-sol, why don't we talk--

114
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,739
Leave her alone.

115
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,366
Mi-sol.

116
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,742
Stop it.

117
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,746
LIVE CHAT

118
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,592
What are you doing, honey?

119
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,719
I'm in bed.

120
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,013
Good night.

121
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,141
Thanks, you too.

122
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,641
Hi, fruit truck guy!

123
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,725
Hello.

124
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,393
I haven't seen you in a while.

125
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,812
I've been busy at home.
What can I get you?

126
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,481
-Some peaches?
-Peaches.

127
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,734
-Ten dollars' worth.
-Coming right up.

128
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,448
Here.

129
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,659
-Have a good one.
-You too, ma'am.

130
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,496
BACHELOR'S FRUITS AND VEGGIES

131
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,789
Wait. Hey!

132
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,541
Fruit truck man!

133
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,612
Are you okay?

134
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,035
Can I get

135
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,412
some apples, please?

136
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
Here you go.

137
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,546
You must really like apples.

138
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:29,762
People say your apples are the best.

139
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,223
You didn't have to run like that.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

140
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,434
I can't during the day.

141
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,355
Because of work.

142
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,856
I see.

143
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,943
I'm sorry to ask

144
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,196
but I really want to buy fruits from you.

145
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,448
Can you come during the night at all?

146
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,119
I'm afraid I have other rounds to do
in the evening.

147
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,664
I'm sorry. I'll see you around.

148
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,768
Give me a call if you need something.

149
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,895
I'll try to come when I can.

150
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,855
Thank you.

151
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,995
FRESH FRUITS
ORDER AND DELIVERY AVAILABLE

152
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,668
You got his number?

153
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,128
Yes.

154
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,340
I didn't know you had it in you, girl.

155
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,678
What do I do now?
Should I just confess my feelings?

156
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,183
Nonsense. To scare him away
with your forever alone aura?

157
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,938
This is when you need to play hard to get.

158
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,440
What?

159
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:12,197
Drive him crazy with your charms.

160
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,241
My charms…

161
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,327
Let me see.

162
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,041
All right.

163
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,501
Let's start with your hair style.

164
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,628
Are you doing it yourself?

165
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,382
Leave it to me.
I'll give you the coolest makeover.

166
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,508
Come here.

167
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,468
Hey.

168
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
Here we go.

169
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,698
Close your eyes,
or the hair will get in them.

170
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,086
Are you done? Can I open them now?

171
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,879
One second.

172
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,173
This is a historical moment.

173
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,676
So count to three, then open them, okay?

174
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,470
Okay.

175
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,806
One.

176
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,475
Two.

177
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,981
Bye, Mrs. Lee.
I won't be coming for a while.

178
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,941
What?

179
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,443
Three.

180
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,415
Cho Ok-kyung!

181
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,310
Thank you for waiting. Here.

182
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,396
Thank you.

183
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,192
This is for the apples.

184
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,069
Enjoy your apples.

185
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,195
Wait.

186
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,408
Have this…

187
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,492
I mean…

188
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,786
Would you like to have some?

189
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,497
You've been working hard,
so I made this for you.

190
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,335
That wasn't necessary.

191
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,505
But thank you.

192
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,851
You must be a big fan.

193
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,562
Excuse me?

194
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,689
The apples.

195
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,441
You bought a lot the other day.

196
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:59,489
Oh, yes. They're so good.

197
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,742
Organic and all.

198
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,285
They're not organic.

199
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,623
Who cares? As long as they taste good.

200
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,218
Not bad at all.

201
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:25,515
When did you start with the fruit truck?

202
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,976
Why do you ask?

203
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,563
There was another truck before
in this neighborhood.

204
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,107
You mean, my dad?

205
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,611
My dad was doing it before he got sick.

206
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,363
I'm just filling in for now.

207
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,908
This isn't what I do normally.

208
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,786
Then, what do you do?

209
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,746
What do you think?

210
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,126
It should be pretty obvious
if you look at my face.

211
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,254
I'm not sure.

212
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,547
It's a giveaway.

213
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
Take a good look.

214
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,677
An athlete?

215
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,428
No. Try again.

216
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,400
Are you, by any chance,

217
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,318
a thug?

218
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,154
You're not a good judge of character.

219
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,491
I'm sorry.

220
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,535
No need to apologize.

221
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,745
You'll find out soon enough.

222
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,334
What do you do for a living?

223
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,796
Me? I…

224
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,006
Let me guess.

225
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,967
First, give me your hand.

226
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,176
My hand?

227
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,638
Your hands say a lot about who you are.

228
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,528
You have soft hands, so no tough work…

229
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,741
Can I touch it? Just very slightly?

230
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,465
Is that Mi-sol?

231
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,510
Who's that jerk
holding my daughter's hand?

232
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,847
What are you doing here?

233
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,267
Mr. Lee, trust me.
You don't want to interrupt her now.

234
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,020
Or it'll be a bloodbath.

235
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,230
-What are you talking about?
-Come on, Mr. Lee.

236
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,273
Come with me.

237
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:43,612
You have calluses
on the tips of your left fingers,

238
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,947
and long nails on your right fingers.

239
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,117
This can only mean you play the guitar.

240
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,285
Yes.

241
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,916
And you can project your voice
far enough to stop my truck.

242
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,543
So you're a singer who plays the guitar.

243
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,045
-Correct.
-Right?

244
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,717
Didn't you say you had a day job?

245
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,014
At a talent agency.

246
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,391
Are you really preparing
to launch your career?

247
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,103
What genre? A singer-songwriter?

248
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,395
Something like that.

249
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,065
Wow, I love that kind of music.

250
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,316
Kim Gwang-suk, Kim Hyun-chul,

251
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,069
Jason Mraz, Nora Jones, and…

252
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,654
Right, Ed Sheeran.

253
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,489
They're my favorite singers, too.

254
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,448
Really?

255
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,366
Yes.

256
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,662
That's really admirable.

257
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,579
What is?

258
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,873
People don't do
that kind of music anymore.

259
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,834
Not if you want to get rich.

260
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,255
It's not for money.
You do what you like.

261
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:48,260
That's what I believe in, too.
Doing what I love till I die.

262
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,971
We're like-minded, you and I.

263
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,936
We haven't even exchanged names yet.

264
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,857
I'm Kim Min-jun.

265
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,695
I'm Lee Mi-sol.

266
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,865
Good to meet you, Mi-sol.

267
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,705
Mi-sol.

268
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,043
Are you there?

269
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,631
Or not?

270
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,803
Where did she go?

271
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm dying to hear about last night.

272
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,227
You are?

273
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,396
But first things first.

274
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,525
We have a score to settle.

275
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,326
You're ruthless.

276
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,912
Move on. Just tell me what to do.

277
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:02,167
You already know the answer.

278
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,212
He said he likes singer-songwriters.

279
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,590
So sing for him. Simple.

280
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,926
Sing for him?

281
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,678
But how?
I can't just start singing randomly.

282
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:20,185
Use your head and somehow set the mood

283
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,730
where it's natural to sing.

284
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,524
Like a natural atmosphere?

285
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,526
Yes.

286
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,956
Mi-sol?

287
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,042
Hey you.

288
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,423
What are you doing here?

289
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:57,764
Sometimes, I come outside to sing
and get some fresh air.

290
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,975
I see.

291
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,813
Why? Is it weird?

292
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,399
No. I suppose you can do that.

293
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,319
Here.

294
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,238
Thank you.

295
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,575
Here.

296
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,786
Thanks.

297
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,913
You know…

298
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,711
Why don't you sit with me?
You came all the way here.

299
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,798
Okay.

300
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,970
-Take a seat here.
-Thanks.

301
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,206
Can you sing something?
Since we're here, maybe?

302
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,048
Right now?

303
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,137
I didn't expect that at all.

304
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,682
Is there any specific song you'd like?

305
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,683
What?

306
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,062
Whatever you sing well.

307
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,273
I can sing most songs quite well.

308
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,401
What should I sing?

309
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,822
You're a singer-songwriter.
Do you have your own songs?

310
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,075
Singing your own songs is the best.

311
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,580
I do have my own songs

312
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,666
but I've never sung it to anyone before.

313
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,794
Even better. Let me hear it.

314
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,754
I'll tell you how it is.

315
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,887
You can't laugh, though.

316
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,277
As the day ends, begins my dark morning

317
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,907
With no one to meet
I wander the empty street

318
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,829
Wishing on a miracle every night

319
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,838
No reason to feel lonely

320
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:39,092
Because I had nothing

321
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:43,304
To miss being with

322
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:52,105
Yellow day
Please wash me down with your warm rays

323
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,195
Help me get closer to where I can't reach

324
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:06,244
Yellow day
Please tell me the scent of sunshine

325
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,375
With your eyes that resemble the sun

326
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:38,151
Yellow day
Please wash me down with your warm rays

327
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:44,532
Help me get closer to where I can't reach

328
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:51,581
Yellow day
Please tell me the scent of sunshine

329
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:58,713
With your eyes that resemble the sun

330
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,812
What do you think?

331
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,775
I love it.

332
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,111
Really?

333
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,280
You're actually very talented.

334
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,912
No, I'm more of the visual type.

335
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,748
Do you have another song?
Let me hear more.

336
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,416
-Shall I?
-Yes.

337
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,716
But…

338
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,427
Isn't it a little unfair?

339
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,595
What is?

340
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:53,351
I'm singing all these songs
and you're just listening.

341
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,938
Oh, am I being selfish?

342
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,566
No, that's not it.

343
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,487
But it'd be nice
if there was giving and taking.

344
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,575
Fine. I'll treat you to a movie.

345
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,994
-A movie?
-Sure.

346
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,246
Are you free the day after tomorrow
in the evening?

347
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,250
I'm quite busy

348
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,378
but I'd like that.

349
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,673
So can you sing me another song?

350
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,883
-Shall I?
-Yes.

351
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,387
Let's see.

352
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,977
He must be a player.

353
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,395
You think?

354
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,688
Of course!

355
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:43,151
He got you to fall head over heels
for him in just three days.

356
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,362
And he's taking you out
to a drive-in theater.

357
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:51,576
It can only mean one thing.
Taking it to the next level.

358
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,496
No, it can't be…

359
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,500
Oh, yes.
Tomorrow, you'll have your first kiss.

360
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,046
Oh, no! What should I do?

361
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,380
What do you mean?

362
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,840
The kiss.

363
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,846
You know how to do it.

364
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,390
You've done it before.

365
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:20,605
Of course. Until my lips got ragged.

366
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,942
Even my front tooth is loose.

367
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,236
How is it done? Tell me everything.

368
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,448
You can't really explain how it's done.

369
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,577
You'll know what to do when it happens.

370
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,124
What if I make a mistake?

371
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,295
I need to practice.

372
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,798
Practice?

373
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,636
Come here.

374
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,888
Hey, come to your senses.

375
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,307
It's me, Ok-kyung!

376
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,767
Girls, have some…

377
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,270
Mom.

378
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,730
Mrs. Lee, I can explain.

379
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,566
It's okay. I understand.

380
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,027
-Mom!
-I'm sorry.

381
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,279
Mom, wait!

382
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,364
It's not like that.

383
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,284
Mom!

384
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,038
I almost had my first kiss with her.

385
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,168
DRIVE-IN THEATER

386
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,137
-Here's your Coke.
-Thanks.

387
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,075
Go where?

388
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,453
To the drive-in theater.

389
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,080
On a date with the fruit truck boy.

390
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,708
Jeez.

391
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,880
Should I call the police?

392
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,593
How can you be sitting around like this?

393
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,929
What can I do about our 20-year-old
daughter going on a date?

394
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,348
Come on.

395
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:24,562
You can't be so lenient with her
even if she's unwell.

396
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,939
Honey.

397
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:33,654
Mi-sol is in her most beautiful
and passionate time of her life.

398
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,365
Don't you see?

399
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,955
You've grown balls, boy.

400
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,834
To think about stabbing me in the back.

401
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,378
You've really grown.

402
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,174
I think it's you who's grown old.

403
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,260
Too old to notice
a knife coming from behind.

404
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,766
Are you willing to take it this far?

405
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,438
That's for you to decide, not me.

406
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,485
Because it's you standing
on the edge of the cliff now.

407
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,322
It'll take just a nudge from a finger
to tip you over.

408
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,782
You piece of shit.

409
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,701
Look over there!

410
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,245
Look, there!

411
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,748
Behind the main guy.
It's a bit blurry, but you can see it.

412
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,210
Better not take too long.

413
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,588
My boys are quite impatient.

414
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,589
Did you see that?

415
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,845
Now you know what I do.

416
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,442
Do I feel like a different person now?

417
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,656
I'll be a household name soon. Watch me.

418
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:07,915
Doesn't it feel like fate, the way we met?

419
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,334
Fate?

420
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:15,506
An aspiring singer meets
an aspiring actor by mere chance.

421
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,551
If you put it that way.

422
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,178
Think about it.

423
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,807
Imagine how cool it'd be
if we're still best friends

424
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,768
when we are big stars
10 to 20 years from now.

425
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,404
Oh, what's the matter?

426
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,782
What?

427
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,117
What is it?

428
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,411
Not so sure about yourself?

429
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,164
It's not that.

430
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,584
Have confidence that
you'll make your dream come true.

431
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,380
I'm sorry

432
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,633
but can we not talk about the future?

433
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,887
I can barely think about the present.

434
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,307
But you've got to look to the future.

435
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,018
I think it'll be great. Imagine--

436
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,938
I should go.

437
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,564
What?

438
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,358
Just like that? Why?

439
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,912
You're home.

440
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,831
What are you doing out?

441
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,917
Getting some air.

442
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,505
You don't look like someone
coming back from a date.

443
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,091
How do you know about that?

444
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,426
Your mom told me.

445
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,095
Did she?

446
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,350
You're a big girl,
so I won't lecture you about dating.

447
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:54,146
But did you tell him?

448
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:02,863
I understand how you feel
but you still have to tell him.

449
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,743
Or it'll weigh down
on both you and him.

450
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,247
I'll handle it.

BACHELOR'S FRUITS AND VEGGIES

452
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,305
Did I say something wrong?

453
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
I don't get it.

454
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,361
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?

455
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,868
Allow me.

456
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,249
You suddenly wanted a drink?

457
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,048
That's what you do when you have
something important to say.

458
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,343
I have something to tell you.

459
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,136
What would that be?

460
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,690
So, I…

461
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,875
What I want to say is that…

462
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:53,599
Have a drink, Min-jun.

463
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,351
Come on.

464
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,936
Wait.

465
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,449
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me.

466
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:15,454
You're right.
I had something important to say.

467
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
What was it?

468
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,422
Oh, I remember.

469
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,176
Why didn't you say that to me?

470
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,429
What?

471
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,764
When I bought apples for the first time.

472
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,227
"You like pretty fruits like yourself."

473
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,398
Why didn't you say that to me?

474
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,530
Oh, that's because…

475
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,158
Actually, that's a sales pitch.

480
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,130
Wake up, Min-jun.
Min-jun!

481
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,175
Hey, are you up? What's wrong?

482
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,176
I need to go home now.

483
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,137
-Give me a minute to sober up--
-I need to go home now!

484
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,722
What's wrong?

BACHELOR'S FRUITS AND VEGGIES

486
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,289
Mi-sol! Get back in.

487
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,427
Mi-sol, wait!

488
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,264
Mi-sol!

489
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,129
Hey, are you okay?

490
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,716
Mi-sol, answer me.

491
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,348
Hey! Where is she?

492
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,142
She just went inside.

493
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,772
You punk, are you trying
to kill my daughter?

494
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,649
No, sir. I just…

495
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,736
Mi-sol.

496
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,780
Mi-sol, are you okay?

497
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:45,164
I don't see any other symptoms
that may trigger the condition.

498
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:54,048
But you must be very careful, okay?

499
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,175
Yes, doctor.

500
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,107
The person you're calling
is not available…

501
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,546
Mr. Lee, someone's here for you.

502
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,942
Stop fidgeting with your food.

503
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,404
Here. Eat up.

504
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,699
Darling, please eat something
for your medicine,

505
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,661
even if you don't feel like it.

506
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,663
Here you go.

507
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,084
It must be dad.

508
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,379
-Is that you, honey?
-Yes.

509
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,173
Did you drink again?

510
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:22,636
I got a good drinking buddy,
so of course.

511
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,763
-A drinking buddy?
-Yes.

512
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,518
And I brought him home
to introduce him to you.

513
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,770
Come on in.

514
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,690
Here.

515
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,442
This is Mi-sol's mom.

516
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,609
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

517
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,154
Where are you going?
Your friend is here.

518
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,660
Dig in.

519
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:47,703
Yes, sir.

520
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,665
Where is Mi-sol?

521
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,586
She won't open her door.

522
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,214
She has a cold heart.

523
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,302
I should get back now.

524
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,805
I'm sorry for troubling you.

525
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,141
Don't say that. I'm sorry.

526
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,227
Come again for dinner next time.

527
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,896
Thank you.

528
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,321
Good night then.

529
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,238
Good night.

530
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,658
Hey, wait.

531
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,759
I guess Dad told you everything.

532
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,731
That's right.
I lied to you about everything.

533
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,860
But it wasn't on purpose.

534
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,695
It just happened.

535
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,830
I'm sorry, anyway. I really am.

536
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,709
I've made my apology.

537
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,712
So I'll get going then.

538
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,470
You can't just say what you want
and walk away.

539
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:36,937
There's something I kept from you.

540
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,648
Really?

541
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,360
What is it?

542
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,662
I'm sorry.

543
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,276
I've been wanting to get that.

544
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,193
That?

545
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,529
Open up.

546
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,241
It's good.

547
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,159
Here.

548
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,703
Good, right?

549
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,954
It's so good.

550
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,041
Are you okay?

551
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,878
I'm okay. It won't kill me.

552
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,052
That's an electric guitar.

553
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,428
So cool.

554
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,641
It's beautiful.

555
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,113
-Let's get out of here.
-Why?

556
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,657
-Come on.
-Why?

557
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,116
Come on.

558
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,668
So you're getting back to college
next spring?

559
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:28,215
Yes, I want to save up money
and take auditions this year.

560
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,093
And look after Dad, too.

561
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,679
That's amazing.

562
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,931
Nothing amazing about that.

563
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,894
There are kids like me
who are always a burden.

564
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:44,314
Don't be stupid.

565
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,149
Stop it.

566
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,986
We'll be late. Come on.

567
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,085
Let's sit here.

568
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,433
It's cool, right?

569
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,479
You'll get really popular too
if you perform like them.

570
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,274
I'm not that good.

571
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:31,361
After a few shows, I bet you'll be
all the rage on YouTube and Instagram.

572
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:36,742
That sounds dreamy
but the idea scares me, too.

573
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,619
It scares you? Why?

574
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:45,167
If people take interest in my music,
they'll find out about me.

575
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,588
Then, it'll be a matter of time before
they find out about my condition.

576
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,131
Then at some point,

577
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:56,553
that will be all they care about.
My disease, not my music.

578
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,348
It's always been like that.

579
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,150
Then how about this?

580
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,447
CREATE YOUR OWN CHANNEL

581
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,949
CHANNEL NAME

582
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:25,040
Sunflower's Attic.

583
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,382
Done.

584
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:43,767
Hi, I'm an absolute music lover
and passionate about singing…

585
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,896
Passionate? Seriously?

586
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,190
Again.

587
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:57,489
Hi, I'm a singer-songwriter
who loves to write and sing…

588
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,077
So cringy. Singer-songwriter?

589
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,042
Don't worry about anything else.

590
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,585
Just focus on the song.

591
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:14,214
If you sing from the heart,
people will love it too.

592
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:49,374
If I were your eyes, I would blur out

593
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:53,920
Everything you see except for me

594
00:52:54,004 --> 00:53:00,385
If I were your ears
I would filter out any mean words

595
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,804
That pass around you

596
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,975
If I were your lips
I would make me your first kiss

597
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:11,605
Not that other girl

598
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:16,109
If I were your heart
I would run at my fastest

599
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:20,280
To make myself become your first love

600
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,243
I'm going to click it now.

601
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,957
Mi-sol, check this out.

602
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,794
I JUST DISCOVERED YOUR MUSIC
AND I LOVE IT!

603
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,296
THIS REMINDS ME OF MY FIRST LOVE

604
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,384
I told you. I knew they'd love it.

605
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,353
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOUR SONG

606
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,772
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.
THE SONG IS SO GOOD!

607
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,484
YOU MUST'VE GOTTEN
THIS AMAZING TALENT FROM YOUR FATHER.

608
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,821
NO, SHE GOT IT FROM HER MOTHER!

609
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,162
Wow, nice.

610
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:12,165
SUNFLOWER'S ATTIC

611
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,583
Bye.

612
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,007
TODAY'S NEW SONG
LOVE

613
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,607
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
STAY TUNED FOR THE UPCOMING SONGS!

614
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,121
Yes! 100,000 subscribers!

615
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,747
-It's 100,000!
-It's 100,000!

616
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,666
Let me join!

617
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,176
CONGRATS! 100,000!

618
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,264
Congratulations, congratulations

619
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,850
On getting 100,000 subscribers

620
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,230
-I'm really happy for you.
-Thank you.

621
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,398
I owe it all to you.

622
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,234
Don't say that. I didn't do anything.

623
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:26,239
Without you,
I wouldn't have had the courage to try.

624
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,700
You're flattering me.

625
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,327
To keep the good vibe going…

626
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,122
Wait here.

627
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:46,760
Here.

628
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,263
What's this?

629
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,598
Open it.

630
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,862
This is…

631
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,363
Do you like it?

632
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,865
Of course.

633
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,535
But this must've cost a fortune.

634
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,915
I am the top fruit seller around here.

635
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,501
But still…

636
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,378
If you're so grateful,
please play a song for me.

637
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,631
What do you want?

638
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,634
The new song. I love that song.

639
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,053
That one? Okay.

640
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,245
I don't know

641
00:56:55,328 --> 00:57:02,293
How in a blink of an eye

642
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,638
It suddenly felt like

643
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:18,393
We were alone in a tiny room

644
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,693
I don't know

645
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:33,741
Why I love this feeling

646
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:46,254
That everything is watching us

647
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:52,302
Shall we now

648
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,641
Fall

649
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:08,818
In love

650
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,372
Let me check it.

651
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,839
I ADORE HER ENCHANTING VOICE
AND EMOTIONS.

652
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,550
THIS IS LEGENDARY. CAN'T STOP LISTENING!

653
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,388
I THINK I KNOW WHO SUNFLOWER IS!

654
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,183
FINALLY REVEALING HER FACE?

655
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:28,982
CHURCH

656
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,609
THAT CHURCH OUTSIDE HER WINDOW
IS IN DANGJIN.

657
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,111
I CAN SEE THE CHURCH
FROM MY SCHOOL!

658
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,323
THERE IS A HOUSE
WITH BLUE-TINTED WINDOWS LIKE HERS.

659
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,076
I HEARD THE GIRL WHO LIVES THERE
WILL DIE IF SHE SEES SUNLIGHT.

660
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,744
LIKE DRACULA?

661
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,746
BURN IN THE SUNLIGHT? LOL

662
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,757
OMG. IS SHE DYING? LOL
A REAL-LIFE VAMPIRE.

663
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,761
SUCH A CLICHÉ.

664
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,805
I'll kill them all!

665
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,565
Where are you going, Mi-sol?

666
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,650
To see Min-jun.

667
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,696
It's late. Why don't you stay?

668
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,489
I'll be right back.

669
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,576
Mi-sol.

670
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,660
Yes?

671
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,455
Are you okay?

672
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,626
What are you talking about?
I'll be right back.

673
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,676
Are you okay?

674
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,682
I'm sorry.

675
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,270
Why are you sorry?

676
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,732
Feels like it's all my fault.

677
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,984
Don't worry about it.

678
01:00:55,777 --> 01:01:00,031
Still, those trolls…
Maybe I should report them to the police.

679
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:04,369
Are you worried I might kill myself?

680
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,333
Don't worry.

681
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,419
I've got something worse,
which hasn't killed me yet.

682
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,676
I want to live quietly for now.

683
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,204
YOU RECEIVED AN EMAIL

684
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,418
HELLO, SUNFLOWER
FROM MIN JI-YOUNG

685
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,073
Hi, I'm Sunflower…

686
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,075
No.

687
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,913
My name is Lee Mi-sol. I'm a singer.

688
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,127
You've shown a lot of interest in me
over the past few days.

689
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,839
As you speculated,

690
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:44,093
I'm suffering from a rare condition
called XP syndrome.

691
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:48,097
But I didn't start this channel
as a patient.

692
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:53,311
As a music lover, I wanted
to share and enjoy my music

693
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:57,231
and that will never change
because…

694
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:05,031
Hi! My name is Min Ji-young.

695
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,742
I'm a huge fan of your music.

696
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:13,831
And I also have XP syndrome.

697
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:20,296
I read that you might have
the same condition as me,

698
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,840
which I hope isn't true,

699
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,051
but if it is,

700
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,223
I would like to thank you.

701
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:36,145
I thought you couldn't do anything
if you have this condition.

702
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:42,318
But now, I have hope
that maybe I can do something.

703
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,029
From now on,

704
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:49,158
I want to find
what I want to do and what I can do.

705
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,119
Because…

706
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:59,001
people who have difficulties like me
can have hope through my music.

707
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,798
So from now, I'm going to
stand tall and sing in front of you.

708
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,343
Please show me your support
and encouragement.

709
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,765
Is this it? It's so cool.

710
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,895
Will people show up?

711
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,606
You put up the notice properly, right?

712
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,524
Yes.

713
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,818
Let's wait a bit. We still have time.

714
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,070
-Let's start setting up.
-Okay.

715
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,531
-Let's go.
-Okay.

716
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,121
All done?

717
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,457
What else do we need?

718
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,710
Music stand and speakers. Let's go.

719
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,592
-Hi, Mi-sol.
-Hi.

720
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,096
Do you know me?

721
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,223
Of course. We're huge fans.

722
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,392
We even covered some of your songs.

723
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,727
What?

724
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,937
We play music, too, as a band.

725
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,652
So, we thought

726
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:12,241
maybe we can back you up
for today's busking.

727
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,452
Wow, I would really love that.

728
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,536
Really?

729
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,710
Can you do this?

730
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,670
Go get them!

731
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,090
Don't be nervous. Just be yourself.

732
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:29,800
You got this.

733
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:47,026
Hello, I'm Lee Mi-sol, a singer.

734
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,872
Thank you for being here
at my first busking gig.

735
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:06,963
I'll start off with my song, "Yellow Day."

736
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:40,079
As the day ends, begins my dark morning

737
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,375
With no one to meet
I wander the empty street

738
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:48,087
Wishing on a miracle every night

739
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:56,220
No reason to feel lonely

740
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:03,269
Because I had nothing to miss being with

741
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:11,736
Yellow day
Please wash me down with your warm rays

742
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:18,451
Help me get closer to where I can't reach

743
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:24,957
Yellow day
Please tell me the scent of sunshine

744
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,210
GO, MI-SOL!

745
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,254
With your eyes that resemble the sun

746
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:44,935
On my heart shrouded within clouds

747
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:49,231
On my heart that knows
No spring, no warmth, no wind

748
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,444
Green shoots have sprouted

749
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:02,828
So maybe it's a world

750
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:08,834
You can live without the sun

751
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:16,467
Yellow day
Please wash me down with your warm rays

752
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:23,140
Help me get closer to where I can't reach

753
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:29,355
Yellow day
Please tell me the scent of sunshine

754
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:35,611
With your eyes that resemble the sun

755
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,158
My heart's still pounding.

756
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,786
Feel it.

757
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,373
Hey! Don't do that suddenly.

758
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,250
It doesn't matter. Feel it.

759
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,168
Gosh, it matters.

760
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,086
Jeez.

761
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,568
It's 64,000 won, right?

762
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,652
Yes, ma'am.

763
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,655
-Here.
-Thank you.

764
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:23,159
What's going on?
You're beaming these days.

765
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,453
Are you dating someone?

766
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,539
It's not like that.

767
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:39,967
MI-SOL: ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW NIGHT?

768
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,844
WANT TO DO SOMETHING?

769
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,847
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GO HERE.

770
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,810
MIN-JUN: GOT IT!
I'LL MAKE THE RESERVATION.

771
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,607
Look at you, smiling from ear to ear.

772
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,027
You should give some attention
to your channel, too.

773
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,029
Why do you say that?

774
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,239
Look.

775
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:06,118
Fans are moaning about
when a new song will be released.

776
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,163
A new song?

777
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,497
Yes.

778
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,707
Wait.

779
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,091
Listen to this.

780
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,635
What is it?

781
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:26,972
I was stuck on it for so long
until I started again recently.

782
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,850
What's it called?

783
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,393
"Star Bits."

784
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,812
"Star Bits."

785
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,482
All right, I'm feeling it.

786
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,692
Go on, let me hear it.

787
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,294
Why did you stop? I was getting into it.

788
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,172
You don't make mistakes like that.

789
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:02,758
I'll start again.

790
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:16,021
What's the matter with you?

791
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,190
Something wrong with the guitar?

792
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,238
I need the bathroom.

793
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,938
Everything's fine, right?

794
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,733
Well…

795
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,863
Will you give us the room, Mi-sol?

796
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,074
No. I'll stay.

797
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,244
Come on, darling. Come with Mom.

798
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,164
No, Mom. I wanna hear it, too.

799
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,674
Doctor, please continue.

800
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:32,097
Mi-sol, come out and talk to me.

801
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,018
Mi-sol.

802
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,566
It seems that
the disease has started progressing.

803
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:47,488
Paralysis will set in
as your brain starts shrinking.

804
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:51,492
starting at the tips of your limbs and
spreading through the rest of your body.

805
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,744
Until I eventually die?

806
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:58,665
We'll delay it as much
as possible with medication

807
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:02,669
but it's untreatable at this moment.

808
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,997
MI-SOL

809
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:44,169
The person you're calling is not
responding. Please try again later.

810
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:46,839
MI-SOL'S MOM

811
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,092
Hi, Mrs. Lee. It's Min-jun.

812
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,885
I can't reach Mi-sol.

813
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,555
What?

814
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,676
Are you okay?

815
01:15:57,594 --> 01:15:59,012
I'm fine.

816
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,141
I'm gonna die soon anyway.

817
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,068
Is it so easy for you to say?

818
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,617
Do you know how I feel
every time you say that?

819
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,336
Don't cry.

820
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,507
Don't you cry.

821
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,226
You're acting like
you're the one dying.

822
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,061
I said stop saying that.

823
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,773
Okay. So stop crying.

824
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,281
Guys, dinner's ready.

825
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:17,424
Did you two fight? Why so quiet?

826
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,137
Fine. Here.

827
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,307
-Eat up and cheer up…
-Dad.

828
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,350
Yeah?

829
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,393
Can we stop cheering up?

830
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,400
Okay.

831
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,987
Just chew well.

832
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:53,085
Min-jun, are you not auditioning?

833
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,713
Why do you ask?

834
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:59,549
It's been a while since I saw you on TV.

835
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:03,595
Well, I did a series recently…

836
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,555
Oh, good!

837
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,767
When is it airing?

838
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,018
A little later.

839
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:10,936
Later tonight?

840
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,356
That's fantastic.
We can all watch it together.

841
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:15,524
Good.

842
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:18,819
You really don't need to do that.

843
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:22,280
Come on. The more, the merrier.

844
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,991
He's a real actor now.

845
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:29,162
We must end this before it blows over.

846
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,874
If the King hears about this,
we won't escape trouble.

847
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:37,337
So what you do say?

848
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,423
When are you coming on?

849
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,508
Any moment now.

850
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:47,639
Question the man that stole the document.

851
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:51,059
Bring in the slave for questioning!

852
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:51,977
Yes, sir.

853
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,024
I'll get my phone from Mi-sol's room.

854
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,109
Sure.

855
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,281
There he is!

856
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,032
-Mi-sol, Min-jun's on.
-Min-jun!

857
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,451
You're on.

858
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,913
Darn it. This is so embarrassing.

859
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,925
Mr. Lee, Mrs. Lee. Are you crying?

860
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,471
It's not really a sad scene.

861
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:36,021
Oh, man. What's with your acting?

862
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:40,567
What about it?

863
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:45,655
Do you really not know?

864
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:51,411
You have such thick skin, don't you?

865
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,459
How dare you!

866
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,252
How dare you

867
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:04,508
betray your master as a slave

868
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,427
and steal my family's secrets.

869
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,471
If you want to save yourself,

870
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:13,099
tell me who put you up to this!

871
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,979
I can't have a leech that sucks on
the good people as my master.

872
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,191
Although I was born
a lowly slave in this life,

873
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,902
in the afterlife,
I shall wield a big sword to punish you.

874
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,654
You shall all see!

875
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:26,738
How dare he!

876
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,537
I'm not used to doing period dramas.

877
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,288
I'm usually quite good.

878
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,378
I can't believe they decided to air it.

879
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:44,130
"Blood-sucking leech!"

880
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,386
That's terrible acting.

881
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:05,819
Everyone will make fun of me
on the internet, right?

882
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,530
They'll make memes and everything.

883
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,205
And you still want to continue acting?

884
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,334
You may never make it.

885
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,504
You're right.

886
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,093
I'm afraid I might end up a failure.

887
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:36,641
But once I start looking for reasons
not to do it, there is no end.

888
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:42,981
You know everyone was against it
when I said I'd become an actor.

889
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,526
"Your face is too ugly.
Shoulders, too narrow."

890
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,029
"You can never get rid of your accent."

891
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:51,823
My grandma even said
it was written in my destiny.

892
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,744
So I tried so much harder.

893
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,247
I joined a theater company,

894
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,167
started working out,
and worked on my accent.

895
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:08,548
Then when I finally went on the stage
with a one-line part,

896
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:14,387
at the curtain call,
it felt like I had conquered the world.

897
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,601
I really felt alive then.

898
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,605
Me, too.

899
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,527
I felt that too, a long time ago.

900
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,532
Guess what Daddy got for you?

901
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,784
A present.

902
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:40,747
The day I got my first guitar from my dad,

903
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,749
I took it to my ear,

904
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:48,088
and I could hear my heart beat.

905
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:49,798
I loved the sound of it.

906
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:54,177
Since then, I played the guitar
and sang everyday.

907
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,847
At least when I'm singing

908
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:01,685
I can forget that I'm sick.

909
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:05,105
It made me so happy.

910
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:12,195
I felt alive, like you said.

911
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,282
I could feel that
I was living and breathing.

912
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,885
Min-jun.

913
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,178
I want to sing.

914
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,893
I want to sing as long as I can.

915
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,940
I don't want to live as if I'm dead.

916
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,901
I want to be alive as long as I live.

917
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:59,200
I want to try until the end.
Just like you.

918
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:06,082
I want you to promise me, though,

919
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,378
that you will stay by my side.

920
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:15,258
Okay. I'll be by your side.

921
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:40,158
Hi, guys! How have you been?

922
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,328
We've been good.

923
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,497
What about you, Mi-sol? Are you okay?

924
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:48,500
I'm good, thanks to you.

925
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,586
Thank you all for coming on.

926
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:52,879
No need to thank us.

927
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:55,632
It's an honor to be part
of such an amazing song.

928
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,929
Did you check out the music I sent you?

929
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:03,223
Yes, it's really good.

930
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:06,226
With a few minor tweaks,
it'll be a huge hit.

931
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:07,352
Thank you.

932
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:11,606
Can we go around and hear each part?

933
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:16,861
I'm here.

934
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,863
Hi. Give me a second.

935
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,991
See you at the next rehearsal.

936
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:23,868
Bye.

937
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,915
You're early. What about the truck?

938
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:34,212
Right. It's all sold out.
I had many customers earlier.

939
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,380
I see.

940
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:39,634
How's the preparation going?

941
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:43,930
We'll practice again next week,
and we're ready to record.

942
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:46,933
Is there anything I can help with?
I'd be happy to help.

943
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,270
You have helped already.

944
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:53,398
But I haven't done anything.

945
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,525
You'll see.

946
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:02,991
What is it? Tell me.

947
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:03,908
Don't.

948
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,118
-Don't do what?
-Hey.

949
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:06,369
-You've got to tell me.
-Hey.

950
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:07,662
-What is it?
-Stop it.

951
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:08,830
-Tell me what it is.
-Stop.

952
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,999
-What is it? Come on.
-I said, stop it.

953
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,208
Stop it.

954
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,221
Is Min-jun here?

955
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,433
Oh, boy.

956
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:31,895
Keep going.

957
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:39,903
What am I saying? How dare you!

958
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:41,738
What are you doing to my daughter?

959
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:44,407
-You little punk!
-It's not what it looks like. Mr. Lee!

960
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,783
-Dad!
-Come back!

961
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,827
It was an accident!

962
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,371
Hi! I'm…

963
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:57,086
I'm Mi-sol's stylist, Cho Ok-kyung.

964
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:03,259
I know you are all curious
about what Mi-sol's up to.

965
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:09,057
Mi-sol is gearing up with the band
in preparation for the new song.

966
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,476
Mi-sol, say hello.

967
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:13,353
Hi, everyone.

968
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:14,687
Hello.

969
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,357
I'll be right back with good music.

970
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,608
Wish us luck!

971
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:24,280
Mi-sol's manager,
Min-jun, has just arrived.

972
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,406
Min-jun, come and say hi.

973
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,033
No, I'm good.

974
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:32,163
We'll be back soon with more updates.

975
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,834
Hey, will the lyrics be ready
by end of this week?

976
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,254
Yes, I just need to finish the chorus.

977
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:40,630
Okay.

978
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:45,593
How about adding strings
or orchestra starting from here

979
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,929
to build up the sound?

980
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:51,891
Then we'll need an arranger,
session players and a lot of money.

981
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,275
That'd be nice,

982
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,235
but given the circumstances,

983
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:05,280
let's keep it minimal among us.

984
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,198
Okay.

985
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:09,534
Sure.

986
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:17,166
So, Min-jun, you made this happen?

987
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,167
Yes.

988
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:22,672
I truly didn't expect that
you would make this happen.

989
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:26,217
Surely there's something
you're good at too!

990
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,969
Eyes on the road.

991
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:31,139
So, all the band members are
already there?

992
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:33,141
The band members can go this way.

993
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:34,142
Thanks.

994
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:43,735
This is so cool.

995
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:46,279
You really did a nice job, Min-jun!

996
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:48,323
Nice to meet you, Mi-sol.

997
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,159
-Hello.
-Hi!

998
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:52,994
Thank you for coming.

999
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:56,247
Thank you for doing this favor.

1000
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,334
I'm happy to help. I'm a big fan of yours.

1001
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,128
You have your boyfriend to thank for that.

1002
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:04,339
He worked hard to set you up.

1003
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:08,384
Now, shall we get started?

1004
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:09,886
-Of course.
-All right.

1005
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:15,099
I'll settle down here.

1006
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,517
Then, I'll sit here.

1007
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,812
No. Get out, all of you.

1008
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,481
But I want to hear it.

1009
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:24,025
If you don't want your dad,
then at least, I should be here.

1010
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,026
I said, get out.

1011
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:27,195
-Come on. Now.
-Wait.

1012
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:28,613
-Out you go.
-Wait.

1013
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:30,281
You too, Dad. Come on.

1014
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:33,618
You can hear it later.

1015
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:35,703
-But I'm your dad.
-Listen.

1016
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:40,750
Don't be nervous. Just be yourself.

1017
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:41,834
Okay.

1018
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,589
I think she's starting.

1019
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:48,174
Oh, my gosh.

1020
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:54,972
Why are you nervous?

1021
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,433
I'm worried she might make a mistake.

1022
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:02,230
She'll be fine.
She worked so hard for this.

1023
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:07,235
But she's never sung
in front of a famous artist before.

1024
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:10,822
Come on. What if she messes up?

1025
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,824
It's not like she's professional.

1026
01:30:13,866 --> 01:30:17,286
An amateur can make mistakes.

1027
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:22,083
Don't worry. She's no amateur.

1028
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:26,587
Not when she sings.

1029
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:33,678
She's more serious than anyone
when she sings.

1030
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,516
Like she's telling her story to the world,

1031
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,852
she is happiest when she sings.

1032
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,773
She'll be as good as ever.

1033
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:14,594
Good girl.

1034
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,435
-Okay.
-Are you okay?

1035
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,813
It's windy today.

1036
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:30,735
I was outside earlier.
The wind was really biting.

1037
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:33,946
It'll be winter soon.

1038
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:45,499
Here.

1039
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,084
What's that?

1040
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,961
Tickets to Hawaii.

1041
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,927
You've never been to the beach
because of me.

1042
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:58,638
Go bathe in the sun.

1043
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,642
Where did you get the money for that?

1044
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:07,063
No, I don't need this.

1045
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:15,196
You deserve it more than anyone.

1046
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,114
Take it.

1047
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,411
Come on.

1048
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:49,647
This is the real deal.

1049
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,440
How did you…

1050
01:32:52,024 --> 01:32:54,902
You'd better pass your test.

1051
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:02,493
Thanks so much. You're the best.

1052
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,663
I trust that you'll take good care of her.

1053
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,999
You've got nothing to worry about.

1054
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,834
Be careful, darling.

1055
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,046
Don't worry, Mom.

1056
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,892
Is this what you've been
wanting to do all along?

1057
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:30,730
Yes, I've always wished for a date

1058
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:34,567
with my boyfriend in broad daylight.

1059
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,777
Anything else?

1060
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:39,947
Anything else…

1061
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,869
For you to be healthy and happy.

1062
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:47,830
Can you do that for me?

1063
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,084
Of course.

1064
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:56,464
-Keep working on your acting.
-Okay.

1065
01:33:57,173 --> 01:34:00,384
-And find a new girlfriend.
-Okay.

1066
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:02,345
What?

1067
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,264
No, that's not what I meant.

1068
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:06,974
I'm just messing with you.

1069
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,436
Are you okay?

1070
01:34:10,519 --> 01:34:12,188
I told you not to push yourself too hard.

1071
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,106
Let's go.

1072
01:34:14,648 --> 01:34:16,609
Excuse me.
Are you Mi-sol by any chance?

1073
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:18,736
Yes.

1074
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:20,404
We're your fans.

1075
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,323
Can I ask for a picture together?

1076
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:24,450
Just one?

1077
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:26,535
-Let me take it for you.
-Thank you!

1078
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:31,415
One, two, three.

1079
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,794
-Here.
-Thank you so much.

1080
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:36,837
-We love you.
-Love you!

1081
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,339
I can't believe this.

1082
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,806
We're your fans, too.
Can we get a picture?

1083
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,308
Of course.

1084
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:51,894
Let me take it for you.

1085
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:53,896
All right.

1086
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,441
One, two, three.

1087
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,421
So, how am I doing these days?

1088
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:21,215
I've been at my happiest.

1089
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:23,509
To describe the feeling…

1090
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:25,636
It's like floating over the clouds.

1091
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:28,222
Like a hungry baby
feeding on its mom's breast.

1092
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:32,184
Or a deaf man hearing
Beethoven for the first time?

1093
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,980
I'm so over the moon
that I can't help but smile.

1094
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:40,234
But while I'm smiling,

1095
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:47,032
I get so overwhelmingly happy
that it brings tears to my eyes.

1096
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:53,539
I'm so very happy,

1097
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,376
yet I can't help crying.

1098
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,049
Mr. Kim Min-jun.

1099
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:05,342
Yes.

1100
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,761
Director loves your acting.
He wants to see you again.

1101
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:09,221
Really?

1102
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:10,723
I'll get in touch soon.

1103
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:12,016
Thank you!

1104
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:23,360
Did you call Min-jun?

1105
01:36:24,361 --> 01:36:26,113
I left him a message.

1106
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:31,160
Mi-sol said he has an important audition.
She doesn't want to interrupt.

1107
01:36:32,077 --> 01:36:33,412
Good.

1108
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,373
How thoughtful of my girl.

1109
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,551
-That was "Sweet Kiss" by Upboys.
-Sir, can you go a little faster?

1110
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,719
Got it.

1111
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:49,929
Thank you.

1112
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:54,558
Now, we're ready to announce the winner.

1113
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,727
The finalists are

1114
01:36:56,810 --> 01:37:01,690
"One &amp; Only" by T.O.X., the band
that was loved for their strong melody,

1115
01:37:01,774 --> 01:37:08,531
and "Star Bits" by Lee Mi-sol
whose story touched many people.

1116
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:12,535
They are both equally worthy of
being number one.

1117
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:16,413
And the winner of
Most Requested Track is…

1118
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:20,376
We'll announce it after a break.

1119
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:28,425
Does anyone know what Mi-sol's been up to?

1120
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:34,223
Following the patient's refusal
of life-sustaining procedures

1121
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:38,686
and in consideration for the organ donees,

1122
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:47,027
as of 3:49 p.m., December 29, 2022,

1123
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:53,242
we'll stop all life-supporting activities
on the patient.

1124
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,625
Please say your last goodbyes.

1125
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:08,382
Hello?

1126
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,759
Hello? Who's calling?

1127
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:14,013
Mi-sol.

1128
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:34,783
Thank you for being my daughter.

1129
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,662
I love you so much, baby.

1130
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:45,294
Ok-kyung, say your goodbye.

1131
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:06,690
I'll remove the life support devices now.

1132
01:39:22,956 --> 01:39:24,124
Mi-sol.

1133
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:30,089
I nailed the audition as I promised.

1134
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:32,883
So don't worry, okay?

1135
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:41,058
And listen to this.

1136
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:48,565
Thank you for staying tuned.
Before we announce the winner,

1137
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:52,069
I have news to deliver.

1138
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:56,448
We just had an update
that Mi-sol is saying

1139
01:39:56,532 --> 01:40:00,119
her final goodbyes
with her loved ones.

1140
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:06,750
As her big fan, I would like to pass on
my heartfelt condolences.

1141
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:12,172
Many fans are leaving comments
in the live chat.

1142
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:15,384
I will read out one of them.

1143
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:18,345
Parting always leaves us with pain

1144
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:21,890
but with beautiful memories, too.

1145
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,561
Although we'll part ways for now,

1146
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:30,315
the music you gave us
will stay in our hearts

1147
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:35,279
as will you, Mi-sol,
live in our memories forever.

1148
01:40:36,488 --> 01:40:42,161
We'll listen
to the Most Requested Track of the Year.

1149
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:45,497
"Star Bits" by Lee Mi-sol.

1150
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:05,476
A flame just born

1151
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:13,692
Swallows the dark of the night

1152
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:22,284
"Grow fast into a star bit"

1153
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:29,333
Every night, the stars whisper to me

1154
01:41:31,084 --> 01:41:35,297
When morning comes

1155
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:44,097
No one will know me

1156
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:55,818
But remember always

1157
01:41:57,194 --> 01:42:03,158
That I've been watching you

1158
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:08,038
Hidden in bright light

1159
01:42:08,121 --> 01:42:15,087
If you hear my breath

1160
01:42:16,129 --> 01:42:18,882
Lift your head

1161
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:26,390
Because I'm there like always

1162
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,952
Let's eat.

1163
01:42:47,035 --> 01:42:51,748
When I look up to the sky

1164
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:56,211
Honey. Come on.

1165
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,630
Let's eat.

1166
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:08,432
Drawing a line across the night sky

1167
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:15,480
I remember that night like it's yesterday

1168
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,861
I'll become a star

1169
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:23,322
Bye! Please come again.

1170
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:29,828
And find you maybe

1171
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:41,506
But remember always

1172
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:49,264
That I've been watching you

1173
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:54,144
Hidden in bright light

1174
01:43:54,227 --> 01:44:01,193
If you hear my breath

1175
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:06,198
Lift your head

1176
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:12,454
Because I'm there like always

1177
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:37,938
I wish my voice will melt

1178
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:42,901
Into everyone's sky

1179
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:47,906
Remember the bits of me

1180
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,826
Always

1181
01:44:54,204 --> 01:45:01,169
I've been watching you
Hidden in bright light

1182
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:12,055
If you hear my breath

1183
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:17,060
Lift your head

1184
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:23,483
Because I'm there like always
