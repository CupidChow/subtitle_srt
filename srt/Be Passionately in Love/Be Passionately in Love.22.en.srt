(Your Dad's Strong Alcohol)

00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:52,806
Who is it?

19
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:58,966
Hurry, Xingqi, come in.

20
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,446
- Luzhou.
- Ms. Mei.

21
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,766
Give it to me.

22
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:04,485
Come on.

23
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,485
When you finish your homework,

24
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,085
I'll take you to the park.

25
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:10,366
Keep your word.

26
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:12,806
Don't run off.

27
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,645
Your dad is waiting for you.

28
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:15,965
Not now.

29
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:17,045
You brat.

30
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,605
Ms. Mei, here you are.

31
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:21,926
I'll be going now.

32
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,605
Where are you going, Luzhou?

33
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:25,125
You haven't been back for long.

34
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,886
I'll pour you a glass of water.

35
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:28,045
Come on.

36
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:30,726
Come on.

37
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:35,286
I'll go get some fruit.

38
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:43,525
I have brought him here.

39
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,645
I'll be going now.

40
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,125
Aren't you going to sit?

41
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,286
No.

42
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:52,966
Luzhou,

43
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:05,565
I know,

44
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,446
it's too late to say anything now.

45
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,926
But I still want to tell you,

46
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,685
being your dad,

47
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:15,565
I am very honored.

48
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,286
From a young age till now,

49
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:23,766
you have been smarter
and more understanding

50
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:25,085
than your peers.

51
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,565
You've never made me worry.

52
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,446
The fact that you're
growing up day by day,

53
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:32,926
excelling in your schoolwork,

54
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:35,766
has made me

55
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:37,766
the envy of other parents.

56
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,525
I am truly proud of you.

57
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:47,406
In contrast,

58
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,525
I have really been a terrible father.

59
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,605
I didn't manage the relationship
with your mom well,

60
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:58,966
and I insisted

61
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,726
on sending you abroad.

62
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,565
Now even Xingqi won't talk to me.

63
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,366
It was me who destroyed this family.

64
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:21,326
Let's not mention the past anymore.

65
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:27,726
Xingqi

66
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,926
is just in a rebellious phase.

67
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,045
Show him more care.

68
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,286
Luzhou,

69
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,565
no matter what,

70
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,005
this will always be your home.

71
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,446
Come back

72
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:58,565
whenever you want.

73
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,605
I can't accept it.

74
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:17,806
Take care

75
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,246
of your health.

76
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:23,205
When I have time,
I'll visit you and Xingqi.

77
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:28,645
Bye, Dad.

78
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:46,966
(My boyfriend,)

79
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:49,085
(Xu has me visit my grandma.)

80
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,645
(I'm afraid I won't be back today.)

81
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,525
(Then what should I do?)

82
00:05:57,246 --> 00:05:58,286
(Just bear with it.)

83
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,645
(I'll be back soon.)

84
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,766
(Bear with what? I mean my suitcase.)

85
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,726
(Don't you miss me?)

86
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:10,205
(I miss you too.)

87
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:11,605
(But right now,)

88
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:13,726
(I miss my suitcase more.)

89
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,446
(Is there something valuable inside?)

90
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,205
(My underwear.)

91
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,565
(So can you come back tomorrow?)

92
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,326
(It's up to my dad.)

93
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,367
(If he stays,)

94
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,326
(I can't just run back
by myself, right?)

95
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,766
(I see that.)

96
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,645
(Your dad did it on purpose.)

97
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,565
Hey, hey, hey.

98
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:50,645
I have already wiped dry over there.

99
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,246
What's wrong?

100
00:06:58,406 --> 00:06:59,766
Xu,

101
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,966
you do this on purpose?

102
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:04,485
I just think that brat is dumb.

103
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,165
He said that
because he's afraid you can't accept it.

104
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,446
I can't accept it?

105
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,005
I'm not against you dating.

106
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,726
Be it a boyfriend or a husband,

107
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,366
it must be built on

108
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,886
the foundation of mutual attraction.

109
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:20,485
Right?

110
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,686
But such a foundation
is with conditions.

111
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,766
You need to understand.

112
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,205
I roughly understand.

113
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,726
You guys are young now,

114
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:30,647
but over time,

115
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,485
this attraction will change.

116
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,886
If this guy
has a sense of responsibility,

117
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,205
that's good.

118
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:37,565
If not,

119
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:38,645
he may cheat

120
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,605
or refuse to marry you.

121
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,565
Isn't it just wasting your time?

122
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,045
Chen Luzhou wouldn't do that.

123
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:46,326
I know he wouldn't.

124
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:47,685
On the contrary,

125
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,846
I actually think highly of him.

126
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,205
I feel

127
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:53,766
he's more mature than your peers.

128
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,605
But you're my daughter.

129
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,806
If I don't take this opportunity
to point out his flaws to establish

130
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:01,766
my authority,

131
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:02,605
in the future,

132
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:03,926
what if he treats you bad?

133
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:06,085
Break his leg.

134
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:09,886
A thumbs up to you.

135
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,406
Dad,

136
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:13,925
Chen Luzhou is already subdued

137
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,446
by your authority.

138
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,606
He really said that.

139
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,245
It worked.

140
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,526
So,

141
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,365
when do you plan to return his suitcase?

142
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:24,486
Don't worry.

143
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:27,726
I never planned
to make things difficult for him.

144
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,526
Dry the area you wet yourself.

145
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,886
Got it.

146
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:46,165
Who is it?

147
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:53,486
Mr. Fu.

148
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,846
I heard you don't have underwear.

149
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:00,686
Xu Zhi told you, right?

150
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,165
Thank you.

151
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,285
Won't you invite me in for a cup of tea?

152
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,205
Please.

153
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,165
Um...

154
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,005
There's no... no tea at home.

155
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:30,646
Is water okay?

156
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,045
No problem.

157
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,085
That table...

158
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,045
Sorry about that.

159
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:01,966
Your table...

160
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:10,526
Why are there mechanisms

161
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:11,726
everywhere?

162
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,445
This is for you.

163
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,245
Well,

164
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,245
I heard from Xu Zhi

165
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:24,486
that you two are dating.

166
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:29,285
Yes, is there a problem with that?

167
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:33,526
There's no big problem.

168
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,125
But

169
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,245
there are indeed a few small problems.

170
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:49,085
Have you ever

171
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,405
been in love before?

172
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,445
No.

173
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:58,445
Impossible.

174
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,846
Really, you're not fooling me?

175
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:04,926
Forget it.

176
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:07,326
After asking this,

177
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:08,726
shouldn't you ask about family?

178
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,045
I don't care about family issues.

179
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,045
Everyone has family issues.

180
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,566
And it doesn't change anything.

181
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:18,205
If someone asks
about your family background,

182
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,686
it's just to see if you have money.

183
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:23,445
But,

184
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,966
even if you don't have money now,

185
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:27,566
you and Xu Zhi are both top students.

186
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,606
After graduation,

187
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,085
I believe

188
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,806
you'll live better.

189
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,365
What I care about

190
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,606
is the issue concerning men.

191
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,966
With conditions as good as yours,

192
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:52,445
it's normal if you go out and have fun.

193
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,606
I can understand.

194
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:55,766
But,

195
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,966
if you go out and have fun,

196
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,486
don't hold Xu Zhi back.

197
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,365
I don't want to see

198
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:06,886
the prodigal return with you two.

199
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,646
Mr. Fu, do I look like a prodigal?

200
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:14,205
A little.

201
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:17,886
Want me to say you're handsome?

202
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:19,045
Not really.

203
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,566
Mr. Fu, when you were young,

204
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,125
you must have been quite handsome.

205
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:25,966
Are you a prodigal?

206
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:32,966
You're quite smart.

207
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:37,646
I won't say much more.

208
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:39,045
You know what I mean.

209
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,445
I'll take my leave first.

210
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,045
Won't drink the water, Mr. Fu?

211
00:12:58,005 --> 00:12:59,005
No.

212
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:01,445
I'm afraid you'll poison me.

213
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,085
Take care, I won't see you off.

214
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,285
Dad, have some water.

215
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,205
And you?

216
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,325
Not thirsty.

217
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:51,686
Xu,

218
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:53,846
about Ms. Wei,

219
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,165
does my grandma know?

220
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:56,646
Yes, she knows.

221
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:57,966
I told her before New Year.

222
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,766
Well, you kept it from me.

223
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,045
Didn't you keep your secret too?

224
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,526
In a couple of days,

225
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,526
let's invite Ms. Wei

226
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:11,846
and Luzhou.

227
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:14,325
If we are busy,

228
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:15,727
we won't meet much.

229
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,846
Since we are all home now,

230
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,526
let's have a meal and meet up.

231
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,526
Okay, I'll tell him.

232
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,165
Ms. Wei.

233
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,486
I just happened to bump into him.

234
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:42,886
Great, come in please.

235
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:44,846
- After you.
- Okay.

236
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,925
Slippers.

237
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:46,846
Happy New Year.

238
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:47,926
Thank you.

239
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:49,926
Thank you.

240
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,806
Xu is cooking inside, right?

241
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:53,446
Yes, yes.

242
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,526
I'll go help.

243
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,486
- Here you are.
- Come in.

244
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,646
Is there anything I can help with?

245
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:02,245
The slippers are a bit small.

246
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:03,125
I'll do it.

247
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,205
It's okay.

248
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,405
For me?

249
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,526
No, it's for your dad.

250
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,245
So thoughtful.

251
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:12,766
Are you nervous?

252
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:13,887
Of course not.

253
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,205
I've been through much.

254
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,405
Stop messing around, let's go.

255
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,365
Just put it up there.

256
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:25,085
- Come on.
- Thank you.

257
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,766
Luzhou, try this one.

258
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:30,686
Okay.

259
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:34,886
Is it bland?

260
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:36,445
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

261
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,005
- Delicious.
- Try that one.

262
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,325
Salty herb chicken.

263
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,045
See if it's salty.

264
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:46,846
How is it?

265
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:50,325
Salty. No, it's just right.

266
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:51,966
It is fine.

267
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,446
I worried it'll be too salty.

268
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:54,526
The ribs are here.

269
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,285
The dishes are all here.

270
00:15:57,646 --> 00:15:59,806
Come on, try this.

271
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,165
Are these ribs sweet?

272
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:02,766
Alright.

273
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,245
Are you here to taste the dishes?

274
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:09,566
I just want to see

275
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:10,886
if you and Zhi get along

276
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,085
when it comes to food.

277
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,005
Absolutely.

278
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,726
I love everything she loves to eat.

279
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:15,926
That's good then.

280
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:16,886
Cheers.

281
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:18,926
Cheers, Mr. Xu.

282
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,125
Can you drink?

283
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:21,566
Of course.

284
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,445
Good.

285
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,405
Xu Zhi,

286
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:31,486
open the gift I give you
and take a look.

287
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:32,566
Okay.

288
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,085
There's a gift?

289
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,165
I didn't even know.

290
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,646
What did you buy?

291
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,045
- It's a secret.
- You'll see.

292
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:42,406
What is it?

293
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,486
It's not a cake, is it?

294
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,365
It's so beautiful.

295
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,445
Really?

296
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,886
Xu showed me pictures of you
when you were little.

297
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:54,526
I see you like motorcycles.

298
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:57,005
And you had many pictures
of riding motorcycles.

299
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,205
I think you must like it.

300
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,085
Take a look.

301
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,886
- Good.
- Look at it from all angles.

302
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,245
Indeed, you are
much more considerate than me.

303
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:06,965
That's good.

304
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:08,205
- Looks good.
- I like it.

305
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,365
Try it.

306
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:10,646
Extra large.

307
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,646
I wear an extra small.

308
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,205
Um...

309
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,325
I didn't know

310
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,445
and bought a wrong size.

311
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:17,766
I'll go buy a new one.

312
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:18,846
No need, no need.

313
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:20,165
I quite like this one.

314
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,445
And if I can't wear it,

315
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:24,806
he can wear it instead.

316
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:27,085
It suits him.

317
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:27,807
- Yes.
- Good.

318
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,165
I like pink.

319
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,285
Then I'll go buy another one
in a smaller size.

320
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:32,365
No need to spend more.

321
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:33,445
This one is just fine.

322
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:35,606
Come on, it's a good occasion.

323
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,125
Come on, cheers.

324
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:38,365
I must buy it, come on.

325
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:40,566
Cheers.

326
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:41,686
Happy New Year.

327
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:42,966
Happy New Year.

328
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:55,846
- Chen Luzhou.
- Here.

329
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,245
Do you know how to tie ponytails?

330
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:00,606
No, I don't.

331
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:02,846
Zhi,

332
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:06,205
bring over that vase.

333
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,566
What vase?

334
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,925
The one that you put

335
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,365
those colorful hair ties in.

336
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:13,806
Where did you put it?

337
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,205
There, there.

338
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,285
Here.

339
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,405
This is it.

340
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,005
They are really pretty.

341
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:31,005
Today, I'll share our family's

342
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:33,926
traditional ponytail tying technique

343
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:36,486
with you.

344
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,245
Don't be nervous.

345
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,445
Sometimes,
you just have to endure things.

346
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:46,165
Do it on me?

347
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,245
Of course.

348
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,005
You should experience it.

349
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,365
This ponytail should be placed

350
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:52,325
at the best position, right?

351
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,205
It cannot

352
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,445
be tied too low.

353
00:18:57,806 --> 00:18:59,806
Also, it can't be too high.

354
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,205
Just at this height,

355
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,686
it is the best.

356
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,606
But the hair must be smooth.

357
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,726
Smooth it down along the hair.

358
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:11,325
Luzhou, your hair is a bit short.

359
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:15,846
Don't move.

360
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,446
Okay, almost done.

361
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,205
Luzhou, want me to help you?

362
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:19,847
It's okay.

363
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,526
I actually also want to learn.

364
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:22,726
No, that's not right.

365
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,566
You've got to be quick.

366
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,325
If you're slow, she'll feel pain.

367
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,205
This time it worked.

368
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:44,926
You remember all these, right?

369
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,886
It looks good at certain positions.

370
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,566
While it looks less appealing

371
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:51,846
- somewhere.
- Got it.

372
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:54,686
Good.

373
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,486
I am satisfied.

374
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,846
He's usually like this when he's drunk?

375
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,365
I'll help him in.

376
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,606
I remembered another one.

377
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:09,405
It's faster.

378
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:10,886
In case in the future,

379
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,245
she is late for work

380
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,806
or school,

381
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,045
remember

382
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:17,646
this method.

383
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,646
You'll be able to leave quickly.

384
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:22,766
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

385
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,606
Take it slow.

386
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:26,686
Xu Zhi, it's okay.

387
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:27,846
You go see Luzhou off.

388
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,005
I'll take care of Xu.

389
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,085
Thank you, Ms. Wei.

390
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,646
Goodbye, Ms. Wei.

391
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:33,405
Goodbye.

392
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,566
Hold this for me.

393
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,646
I can also help you put on your shoes.

394
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:40,886
I put on shoes for you, okay?

395
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,365
They're already on.

396
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,365
Be careful on your way back.

397
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:48,365
Bye-bye.

398
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:49,766
I'm leaving.

399
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:53,886
- I'll carry you.
- Come on.

400
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:55,766
I was just kidding.

401
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,795
Zhi,

402
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:07,566
help me charge it.

403
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:11,926
- Thank you.
- Can I take a look?

404
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,005
Check on me?

405
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,205
I can't?

406
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,526
Go ahead. The password's your birthday.

407
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,405
Then forget it.

408
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:24,726
If you use my birthday as the password,

409
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,846
you have no shady secrets.

410
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:30,646
If you want to check, go ahead.

411
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:32,846
All my passwords
are your birthday anyway,

412
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:37,686
except for the house
and bank card passwords.

413
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,766
I'm most concerned about
the bank card password.

414
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:48,766
Alright, money-grubber.

415
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:50,686
The same as 903.

416
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:53,486
Keep it safe.

417
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,925
Zhi,

418
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:25,325
do you have any wishes?

419
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,165
I hope my boyfriend

420
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,126
can transfer to

421
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,486
his favorite major.

422
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,365
That's an easy wish.

423
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:39,766
What do you want to do in the future?

424
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:42,445
What do you want me to do?

425
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,566
Don't you have your own ideas?

426
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,846
Yes, but I want to hear what you say.

427
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:51,606
You're doing well in your studies.

428
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,886
I think you could stay at school
as a professor after graduation.

429
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:56,205
That would be great.

430
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,085
However, I believe

431
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,365
in the all-capable Chen Luzhou.

432
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,365
No matter what you do,
you'll do it well.

433
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:06,966
Why does this sound so familiar?

434
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:10,405
You are quick.

435
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:11,806
Why do you always

436
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,806
want to pinch my cheek?

437
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:17,285
What about your wishes?

438
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,005
You guessed it all.

439
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:30,966
I thought you
prepared gifts only for Xu.

440
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:32,886
Spare you this time.

441
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,005
Open it.

442
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:39,846
What is this?

443
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:48,498
♪Like a cloud drifting away♪

444
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:50,606

♪Freely crossing the vast sky♪

446
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:56,886
Do you like it?

447
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,606
You're quite resourceful and skillful.

448
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:07,926
I found out,

449
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:11,325
your dad's alcohol is really strong.

450
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:14,726
It's so strong
I almost want to bow to my mom.

451
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:17,886
If she hadn't attracted you,

452
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:20,606
you wouldn't have gone
to great lengths to approach me.

453
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:23,045
Then you also have to bow to Tan Xu.

454
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,486
Without him,

455
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,325
we wouldn't have met.

456
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,125
Stop giving me trouble, alright?

457
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,325
Just kidding.

458
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:34,566
So petty.

459
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,526
Shy Boy Chen,

460
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:43,886
I love you.

461
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:47,005
Me too.

♪Falling into you♪

470
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,045
Dad, last night, you...

471
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,606
Doesn't Chen Luzhou live nearby?

472
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:33,766
Call him here for breakfast.

473
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:34,966
He isn't up yet.

474
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:39,405
A top student from Huaguang University,
sleeping in like this.

475
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:41,085
How will he take care of you?

476
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,325
He isn't late every day.

477
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,405
He works hard at school.

478
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:47,527
Do you remember

479
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,245
what you did last night?

480
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,245
Ms. Wei told me.

481
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:55,165
Chen Luzhou won't be mad, will he?

482
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:56,806
I tied so many ponytails.

483
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:58,766
No, he has a great temper.

484
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,165
Having a good temper is good.

485
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,966
Ms. Wei also praised him

486
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:05,886
for his politeness.

487
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:07,646
She said she noticed

488
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:09,606
whenever she talked to Chen Luzhou,

489
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:11,086
he would

490
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,245
put down his chopsticks

491
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:13,526
and listen carefully to her.

492
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:16,045
Ms. Wei is so attentive.

493
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:17,405
If she hadn't told me,

494
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:18,686
I wouldn't have known.

495
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:20,806
Are you praising Luzhou

496
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,245
or Ms. Wei?

497
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:25,526
What do you think of Ms. Wei?

498
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,646
She's nice, very gentle.

499
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,766
She seems very caring.

500
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:34,726
Yes, I think Chen Luzhou is good too.

501
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,926
He'll definitely be a good husband
in the future.

502
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:41,486
Once you've

503
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:42,567
finished eating,

504
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:43,886
deliver it while it's hot.

505
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:52,325
What's wrong?

506
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:55,125
You care more about him than me.

507
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,005
Are you even jealous of this?

508
00:26:58,806 --> 00:27:00,966
Of course, I'd be jealous of this.

509
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:04,325
Have you finished eating?

510
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:05,806
If you're done, go deliver it.

511
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:08,846
Otherwise, my sincerity
would have cooled down.

512
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:11,486
We have everything.

513
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:13,446
Anything else?

514
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:14,486
Do you want jelly?

515
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,566
Yes.

516
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:16,726
Yellow peach jelly?

517
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:17,965
Okay.

518
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:19,405
Just take one packet, this one.

519
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,365
Mixed flavors.

520
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:26,486
I want to buy a gift for Ms. Wei.

521
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:27,966
But I don't know what to buy.

522
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:29,806
Figured it out so quickly?

523
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:32,165
I think Xu has had a hard time.

524
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:37,245
Do you know?

525
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,245
When I first got my period,

526
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,365
I couldn't get pads.

527
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:41,966
It was hard to tell Xu.

528
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,886
When I asked Cai Yingying for help,

529
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:44,486
I found out

530
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,566
Xu had already prepared it for me.

531
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:49,285
and placed it in the drawer
of our bathroom.

532
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,365
These years, he's worked so hard.

533
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:55,486
It's indeed not easy.

534
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,846
It's actually quite nice
to have Ms. Wei.

535
00:27:58,085 --> 00:27:59,125
When I'm not around,

536
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,125
she can help take care of my dad.

537
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,205
Don't worry.

538
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,766
From now on,
this honorable task is mine.

539
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,486
Which one do you want?

540
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:11,486
Are you stupid?

541
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:12,766
Let's go, let's go.

542
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:15,245
Then I'll pay the bill.

543
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,806
Why did you come back so soon?

544
00:28:29,886 --> 00:28:30,886
Forgot something?

545
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,886
X-Xu.

546
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:38,686
Lian Hui.

547
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:40,205
How...

548
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:41,365
How did you...

549
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,806
How did you find this place?

550
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:44,526
Well.

551
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,325
This is your home?

552
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:02,405
The house is small.

553
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:03,966
Not at all.

554
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,365
Xu, I really didn't expect

555
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:08,365
Xu Zhi is your daughter.

556
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,285
I never thought of it.

557
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:12,486
She really does resemble you
in some ways.

558
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:15,606
I'm still stunned

559
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:17,846
that Luzhou is your child.

560
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:20,926
- Sit down.
- Okay, okay.

561
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,205
Come on.

562
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:23,245
I don't have much.

563
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:24,205
No, it's quite fine.

564
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:25,285
Have a glass of water.

565
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,766
Actually, I heard from my youngest son

566
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:30,005
Luzhou spent this New Year at your home.

567
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,125
I just came by to say thank you

568
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,205
and bring some gifts.

569
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:35,966
I didn't expect it's such a coincidence.

570
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,325
Yes.

571
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:40,045
Thanks to your youngest son, too.

572
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:41,486
We haven't

573
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:43,365
seen each other for so many years.

574
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:49,526
Well, Luzhou...

575
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:51,445
Xu,

576
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:53,766
let's not mention the past.

577
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:56,325
I also don't want him to know.

578
00:29:58,846 --> 00:29:59,846
Alright.

579
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:09,526
All these years,

580
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:12,285
you've raised a kid alone.

581
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:14,085
It must've been tough for you.

582
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:15,486
You must be exhausted.

583
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:16,566
I've managed.

584
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:18,726
Your mom is at my house.

585
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:19,926
She's looking for you?

586
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:20,926
She shouldn't be.

587
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,285
She doesn't know I'm here.

588
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:24,566
Chen Xingqi told her?

589
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:26,726
No way.

590
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,365
I'll say the same.

591
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:31,526
I just hope

592
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:33,726
the mistakes I made

593
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:35,325
won't affect the kids.

594
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:37,926
These

595
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:40,045
are best kept from them.

596
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:40,726
Okay.

597
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:43,165
Rest assured, I promise you.

598
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:46,846
What's going on?

599
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:03,646
Have you ever thought

600
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:05,245
your mom is definitely not my mom,

601
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,886
but your dad might be my dad?

602
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:30,365
Why not break up first?

603
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:33,566
Alright.

604
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:34,846
Let's break up, then.

605
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,125
Give up so easily?

606
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:39,205
Lame.

607
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:40,405
Don't worry.

608
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:42,045
I won't fall in love with others.

609
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,205
Alright, since we've broken up already,

610
00:31:45,726 --> 00:31:46,726
I have to go.

611
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,325
Seriously.

612
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:51,646
What's there to break up over?

613
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,205
We break up

614
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,125
for only one reason.

615
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:57,365
What?

616
00:31:57,486 --> 00:31:58,486
That you don't love me.

617
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:02,005
What if it really is that dramatic?

618
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:05,486
Just endure it.

619
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,085
But you don't

620
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:10,405
really look like my dad.

621
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,045
What about personality?

622
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,045
No, not that either. Nothing is alike.

623
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:17,566
Why don't I go back first

624
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:19,606
and ask my dad subtly?

625
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:27,085
Leaving already?

626
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:29,726
Give me a kiss.

627
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:35,487
No, I can't

628
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:36,606
bring myself to kiss you.

629
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:44,606
Dad, I'm back.

630
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,125
You're back.

631
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,165
Wash your hands.

632
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,085
We can eat soon.

633
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,005
Dad.

634
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,606
Wait a moment.

635
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,205
What's up?

636
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:13,566
Tell me,

637
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,526
is there a possibility

638
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:17,205
that I was adopted?

639
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:20,966
How did you know?

640
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:24,846
Stop joking around.

641
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:26,806
You started it.

642
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,526
Go ahead, what's up?

643
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:30,526
I saw news today.

644
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:32,766
A person had a love child

645
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,045
and no one knew.

646
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:35,726
Later that person suddenly died,

647
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:38,005
and the child inherited the legacy.

648
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:40,405
Don't worry,

649
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,726
I have no legacy,

650
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:43,325
only a mortgage,

651
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:44,566
and a ton of debts.

652
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:45,886
Which one do you want?

653
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:17,766
How is it?

654
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,846
I only found out

655
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:21,405
my dad is pretty tight-lipped today.

656
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,846
I can't get anything out of him.

657
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:25,846
I think it's impossible.

658
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,486
That guy was a playboy.

659
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:29,846
I heard he chased girls
and played with cars,

660
00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:31,045
and was in a coma for long.

661
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:33,205
If so, my dad

662
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:34,846
wouldn't do such a thing.

663
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:38,446
But someone was a racer

664
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:39,846
when he was young,

665
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:42,325
and he was in a coma
for a couple of years.

666
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:43,925
Really?

667
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:45,005
Who is it?

668
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,526
Fu Yuqing.

669
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:51,526
It's time to eat.

670
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,405
I have to go.

671
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:07,726
Chen Luzhou

672
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,365
sent you to ask me, right?

673
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:12,726
You know everything, huh?

674
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:14,806
How could I not know?

675
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:17,926
When you were in middle school,

676
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,405
you disliked the clothes
I paired for you

677
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:22,966
and changed clothes
on the way to school.

678
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,526
Before returning home,

679
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:26,045
you changed back.

680
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:27,405
Is that what happened?

681
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:31,285
I thought I hid it pretty well.

682
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,245
So is Mr. Fu actually

683
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:38,526
Chen Luzhou's father?

684
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:46,005
Is he?

685
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,045
Let me tell you a story.

686
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:04,686
Why are you here?

687
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:08,606
Do you want to have dinner
with me tonight?

688
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,405
Is there something?

689
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:19,846
It's Fu Yuqing, right?

690
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,125
Was it Xu Zhi's dad who told you?

691
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:32,726
No.

692
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,686
When I took Xu Zhi home this afternoon,

693
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:39,365
I heard you talking to Mr. Xu.

694
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,445
Xu Zhi said his dad's
social circle is simple.

695
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:46,125
Along with some clues
you mentioned earlier,

696
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:47,886
it's not hard to guess.

697
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:52,365
I never expected

698
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:54,526
it's such a coincidence.

699
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:57,926
Xu Zhi's father is Xu Guangji.

700
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,966
Did you know Mr. Xu a long time ago?

701
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:04,125
Yes.

702
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:05,926
He's Fu Yuqing's friend.

703
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:07,806
When we were young,

704
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:10,405
we had a pretty good relationship.

705
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:13,766
Later, I broke up with Fu Yuqing.

706
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,005
And then I lost contact with him.

707
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:17,085
Why did you break up?

708
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,886
I was with him for several years.

709
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:24,365
The relationship
was quite stable all along.

710
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,325
So I suggested we get married.

711
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:35,846
He refused?

712
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,005
Yes, he said he was still young

713
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:45,966
and didn't want to

714
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:47,726
get married so soon.

715
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:53,245
Since he refused,

716
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:55,325
why kept her waiting for so many years?

717
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:56,447
I thought,

718
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,245
in this materialistic world,

719
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:00,646
Mr. Fu was like an unpretentious jade.

720
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,766
I didn't expect him to be so bad.

721
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,005
The word "unpretentious"

722
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:10,125
has nothing to do with him at all.

723
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:12,566
Then what happened?

724
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,205
Later, he broke up with Lian Hui.

725
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:18,526
After they broke up,

726
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:19,966
he had a car accident.

727
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,285
He stayed in the hospital
for four years.

728
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:25,165
In between, quite a few things happened
in his family.

729
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,646
But he wouldn't talk about it.

730
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:30,325
He even had a child with Lian Hui,

731
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:31,766
and he didn't tell me.

732
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,566
Chen Luzhou
is Ms. Lian Hui's biological child?

733
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:38,045
Yes.

734
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:40,606
It's so heartbreaking, even for me,

735
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:42,045
let alone Chen Luzhou.

736
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:45,165
Fate plays tricks on people.

737
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:49,045
Mr. Fu, after taking the child back,

738
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:50,526
had a car accident.

739
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,165
Luzhou's grandma

740
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,886
was unable to take care of him,

741
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,085
so she had to send him to an orphanage.

742
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:02,406
After Mr. Fu was discharged,

743
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,085
did he try to find Chen Luzhou?

744
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:05,165
He did.

745
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,486
But when he went to the orphanage,

746
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:09,766
the child had grown up,

747
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,285
and couldn't recognize him.

748
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,925
In the end, he even had to beg Lian Hui

749
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:15,566
to help them reunite.

750
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:17,606
Only then did Lian Hui find out

751
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:19,405
Luzhou was sent to an orphanage.

752
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:23,686
Mr. Fu took quite a few slaps that day.

753
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:37,686
Later, he had the nerve to ask me

754
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,686
to take him to the orphanage
to reunite with you.

755
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:42,966
You know, at that moment, I clearly knew

756
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:45,325
he could never be a good father.

757
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:49,325
So I went to the orphanage

758
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,005
and brought you back home.

759
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:53,406
I lied to Fu Yuqing

760
00:39:53,486 --> 00:39:55,325
you had already been adopted
by someone else

761
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:57,445
and told him to never approach me again.

762
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,526
What's my exact birthdate?

763
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:09,766
March 17.

764
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:12,285
That's the birthday on your ID card.

765
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:13,886
Then what is November 11?

766
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:15,726
Um...

767
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:21,325
The director casually picked a date

768
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,045
when you entered

769
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:25,686
the orphanage.

770
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,005
What's wrong?

771
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:32,566
It's nothing.

772
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:40,686
Do you plan to acknowledge him?

773
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:46,566
No need.

774
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:57,766
I'm leaving.

775
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,766
(How are you?)

776
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:20,726
(Are you okay?)

777
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:22,205
(You know, right?)

778
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,606
(Where are you?)

779
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:27,045
(Chen Luzhou, where are you?)

780
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:31,325
(You still haven't gone home this late?)

781
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:57,806
Hello, Zhi, what's up?

782
00:41:57,966 --> 00:41:59,886
Do you know where Chen Luzhou went?

783
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:02,005
I just called him, but he didn't answer.

784
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:03,245
Talk later.

785
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:08,285
Hello, Li Ke.

786
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:09,846
Is Chen Luzhou with you?

787
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,325
Stop it.

788
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:12,965
I'm not close with Chen Luzhou.

789
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:14,045
He's your boyfriend.

790
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,125
Why ask me?

791
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:16,526
Stop messing around.

792
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:18,646
I need to talk to him.

793
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:20,205
Is he with you or not?

794
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:22,006
He really isn't here.

795
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:23,125
I'm at my hometown.

796
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,045
Then give me Jiang Cheng's phone number.

797
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,005
Okay, wait a moment.

798
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,085
Alright.

799
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,005
Is Chen Luzhou with you?

800
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:43,116
Yes.

801
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:44,005
Put him on the phone.

802
00:42:44,085 --> 00:42:45,085
I must talk to him.

803
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:46,325
Chen Luzhou.

804
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:48,726
He's in the bathroom.

805
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:51,285
Bye.

Dad is out.

825
00:44:50,206 --> 00:44:51,325
Do you want to come over?

826
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,125
Why should I go over?

827
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:55,245
Let's study together.

828
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,165
Aren't you switching majors?

829
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:00,125
So I'm not attractive to you anymore?

830
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:01,205
Is that so?

831
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,045
It's not that you aren't attractive.

832
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,005
It's just that studying
is more cost-effective.

833
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:06,646
The new semester is starting.

834
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:08,445
We need to focus on that.

835
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,606
Let's improve together.

836
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:14,606
I'll take a call.

837
00:45:20,405 --> 00:45:21,405
Hello.

838
00:45:26,886 --> 00:45:28,085
Okay, I'll be right there.

839
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:31,806
Here, have an orange.

840
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,285
You go ahead.

841
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:34,405
Have an orange.

842
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:35,365
It is quite sweet.

843
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:36,445
Is it comfortable?

844
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:38,365
Sitting up is better.

845
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:41,486
Xu Zhi.

846
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:43,285
Why did you fall again?

847
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:46,566
Could it be a sequela
from the previous concussion?

848
00:45:46,646 --> 00:45:47,646
No.

849
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:48,806
No, no.

850
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,405
He was hit by an electric bike.

851
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:52,646
Where's person at fault?

852
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:55,526
He left. It was a delivery guy.

853
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,445
Your dad didn't want
to complicate things.

854
00:45:57,686 --> 00:45:58,726
He looked quite anxious.

855
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:00,005
So he let him go.

856
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:01,607
Are you okay?

857
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:03,886
Yeah, this happened on my way to work.

858
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:05,005
I'll ask Cai to count it

859
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:05,886
as a work injury.

860
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:07,125
- Right.
- What was that?

861
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:08,445
I've checked this.

862
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:09,646
It can't be compensated.

863
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:11,486
This morning, you did say

864
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:12,407
it could.

865
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:13,526
Why not now?

866
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:14,606
Yeah.

867
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:17,486
If you get hurt from home to work,

868
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,566
it can be compensated.

869
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:20,686
But you've gone to Songbai Road.

870
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:21,527
It's so far.

871
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:22,766
How do I compensate that?

872
00:46:22,886 --> 00:46:24,486
What's wrong with Songbai Road?

873
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,005
I was afraid of traffic jams.

874
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:27,886
I took a little detour, right?

875
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,165
Why not go

876
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:29,926
around Guangzhou

877
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,245
or Shanghai?

878
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:34,205
Mr. Cai,

879
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:35,246
you are the Director.

880
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:36,365
You can't be so stingy.

881
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:37,526
Besides,

882
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:38,206
considering

883
00:46:38,286 --> 00:46:40,526
I acted bravely for a just cause

884
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:42,045
for our hospital last time,

885
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,486
reimburse half of this?

886
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:48,165
These are two different matters.

887
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:50,325
Xu.

888
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:53,405
Did you go to the bookstore
over on Songbai Road

889
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:55,285
to buy comic books for Wei Lin?

890
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,125
So it is.

891
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:58,886
Running personal errands,

892
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:00,486
right?

893
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:01,966
Even more unacceptable.

894
00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:02,886
Why...

895
00:47:03,205 --> 00:47:04,205
What?

896
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:05,365
What?

897
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:06,886
Mr. Xu.

898
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:08,325
- Luzhou.
- Luzhou.

899
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,365
How's it?

900
00:47:09,445 --> 00:47:10,445
Is it serious?

901
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:11,646
It's fine, see?

902
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:12,686
Don't worry.

903
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:13,567
You guys chat.

904
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:14,886
I'll go fetch some hot water.

905
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:16,045
Okay.

906
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,566
Why fetch water with...

907
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:21,486
- I'll go too.
- Yes, go quickly.

908
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:22,606
You're fine?

909
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:23,245
Yeah.

910
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:24,184
Just go.

911
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:28,405
And you, back to work. It's work time.

912
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,445
I haven't asked for overtime pay.

913
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:31,566
You stingy.

914
00:47:32,526 --> 00:47:33,526
Ungrateful.

915
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:34,686
Exactly.

916
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:05,926
Why are you here?

917
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:09,085
I felt like you needed me, so I came.

918
00:48:11,606 --> 00:48:12,606
What's wrong?

919
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:18,686
My dad used to go to Songbai Road

920
00:48:18,766 --> 00:48:19,846
only to buy me

921
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:21,886
sugar pancakes.

922
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,325
Because I was
quite a glutton as a child.

923
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:26,806
My mom didn't want me
to eat too many sweets.

924
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:29,245
But my dad spoiled me a lot.

925
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:30,686
After work on Fridays,

926
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:32,846
he would go there
to buy me sugar pancakes.

927
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:34,966
And I could finish eating them

928
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:36,486
before my mom returned.

929
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,125
Come on.

930
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:41,365
Have some water.

931
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:47,646
Is it tasty?

932
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:48,687
Yes.

933
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,526
Dad, will you buy more for me next time?

934
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:51,365
Yes, I will.

935
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:52,606
Every week,

936
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,125
I'll go to Songbai Road
to buy you sugar pancakes.

937
00:48:55,205 --> 00:48:56,205
Okay?

938
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:02,486
Counting down two minutes, get ready.

939
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:03,646
Mom is coming back soon.

940
00:49:04,205 --> 00:49:05,205
Hurry up and eat.

941
00:49:06,205 --> 00:49:07,886
Brush your teeth after eating.

942
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,245
If your teeth go bad,

943
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:10,526
your mom will scold you again.

944
00:49:16,285 --> 00:49:18,165
But I later found out

945
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:21,646
actually Songbai Road

946
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,085
is far from here.

947
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:29,566
About half the Qingyi City away.

948
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:31,285
But now,

949
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:35,085
he goes there
to buy comic books for Wei Lin.

950
00:49:35,966 --> 00:49:38,045
I guess I've got

951
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:43,405
mixed feelings.

952
00:49:46,005 --> 00:49:47,005
Be careful.

953
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:53,686
Suddenly there are two strangers
at home.

954
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:56,486
Living habits will all change.

955
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:00,045
It takes time to adapt. It's normal.

956
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:05,926
Look.

957
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:08,646
What's wrong?

958
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,446
I still have

959
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:12,606
two functional legs for now.

960
00:50:13,285 --> 00:50:14,846
They should still work for long, right?

961
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:17,165
And then,

962
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:20,526
whether it's Songbai Road or whatnot,

963
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:22,285
I can go in the future.

964
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:24,285
Okay?

965
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:53,134
(Shy Boy Chen, I love you.)

966
00:50:53,214 --> 00:51:03,448
