If you have the need,

00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:50,485
you can use my computer.

20
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:51,804
Thank you.

21
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:53,336
Go ahead.

23
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:01,965
Let me do it.

24
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:17,404
You can still play the violin?

25
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,724
I learned a bit as a child.

26
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,045
My grandfather has a violin too.

27
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,204
He doesn't know how to play it.

28
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,404
When my grandma was sick,

29
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,804
he was playing the violin

30
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,324
for her every day in the yard,

31
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,045
very disturbing, you know?

32
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,844
I couldn't understand

33
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:34,525
why

34
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,125
he played so badly,

35
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,525
yet my grandma wanted him to play.

36
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,045
Why?

37
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:40,204
When

38
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,724
we are both old,

00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,165
if we are still around,

40
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,884
you play a piece for me

41
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:48,324
and I'll tell you the answer.

42
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,045
I won't play it for you at that time.

43
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:52,404
Who will you play it for?

44
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,045
Who knows if I'll be single

45
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,005
or have a partner.

46
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,165
If I have a partner,
I'll play it for her.

47
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,284
If I don't,
I'll play it for someone else's partner.

48
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:04,364
I'm moving to right.

49
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,844
Press this button.

50
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:07,764
Yes, and then...

51
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:13,645
Why can't I do anything right?

52
00:03:13,884 --> 00:03:15,085
Even in a game, I'm so bad.

53
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:16,925
Because you surnamed Cai.

54
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:17,965
Let me do it.

55
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,724
I'm just kidding. I didn't mean it.

56
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:25,884
Don't take it to heart.

57
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,565
Actually, you...

58
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,884
I'm pretty bad.

59
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,605
That day, Zhai Xiao said

60
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:33,764
I just idle my days away

61
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,445
with no goals or plans.

62
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,085
I don't dare to estimate my scores.

63
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:39,445
Yeah.

64
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,324
I'm pretty bad.

65
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:44,404
You all
can go to the universities you want.

66
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:45,684
But what about me?

67
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,404
If you don't do well, just try again.

68
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,565
Some people didn't perform well.

69
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,085
Another year might be okay.

70
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,724
I'm just not cut out for studying.

71
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,085
One more year won't make a difference.

72
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,925
Unless I could defy fate.

73
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,296
Aren't you envious I got admitted to

74
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:11,965
a first-tier university
with a score just over 400?

75
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:13,284
Why not try an art examination?

76
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:14,884
Art examination?

77
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:15,724
Me?

78
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:19,684
I can't draw, and I'm tone-deaf.

79
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:20,684
I'm not coordinated.

80
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,165
At most,
I've hosted a school celebration.

81
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,525
I can't do anything else.

82
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,064
How do I qualify for that?

83
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:30,404
Honestly,

84
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,844
I think your eloquence is good.

85
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,005
Especially when you're arguing,

86
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:38,684
you have clear thinking and articulate.

87
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,925
You can study broadcasting.

88
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:41,724
Give it a try.

89
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,684
Are you praising me or insulting me?

90
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,764
Really.

91
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,324
Being idle in the summer is still idle.

92
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:50,804
Why not enroll in a tutoring class
and try?

93
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,045

96
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,605
I wanted to study this
and architectural engineering.

97
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:08,884
I think garden design

98
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:09,844
should be interesting.

99
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:11,565

100
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:12,724
I want to buy a big villa

101
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:13,724
with a garden.

102
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:15,005
Then I'll design it myself.

103
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:16,724
Have you decided?

104
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:19,804
Since it's a major I like,

105
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:21,364
I should definitely go for it.

106
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:23,324
And I'm confident I can get accepted.

107
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,445
This is truly you.

108
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:35,364

112
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,485
you can use these drafting tools.

00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:00,284
Thank you.

114
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,324
What about you?

115
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:05,445
Can I not go abroad?

116
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:08,152
I could skip Hua University,

117
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:10,724
and attend any local university.

118
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:12,525
An unpopular major is fine.

119
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:15,045
If you're worried,

120
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,125
I can sign a guarantee.

121
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,965
I promise not to take anything
from Chen Jishen.

122
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,364

Even if your dad changes his mind,

125
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,364
I still don't agree.

126
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:30,364
I'm going abroad.

127
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:33,724
The admission score line
hasn't come out yet.

128
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,645
With your grades,

129
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,085
you can get into a top university.

130
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:39,565
Are you not considering studying
in the country?

131
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:41,804
Everything is arranged.

132
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,284
What a pity.

133
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,724
I was thinking about studying
in the same city.

134
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,085
In that case,

135
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:53,364
if we're free on the weekends,

136
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:54,844
I could visit your school.

137

138
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,485
and make new friends,

139
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:03,724
you'll soon

forget me.

142
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,085
I might also go to Shanghai,

143
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:12,804
or,

144
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:14,565
Hangzhou.

145
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,485
Fine, I'll forget you anyway.

146
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:21,464
When results

147
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,165
are out,

148
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:25,925
I won't reveal my university.

149
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,324
Don't tell me where you'll go.

150
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,165
Why vent your anger with the ball?

151
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,844
Xu Zhi must go to Hua University.

152
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,125
Maybe she'll stay in Beijing.

153
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,005
Please watch her for me.

154
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,404
Watch her,

155
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,284
and see if she has a boyfriend?

156
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,565
I can't control that.

157
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,204
Girls, you know, fall in love.

158
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:10,005
Who can control it?

159
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,445
It doesn't matter.

160
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:14,965
Just don't let her get bullied.

161
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:18,324
She can date anyone she wants?

162
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,005
Okay, I'll send it to you then.

163
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,045
They are holding hands

164
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:24,444
and sweetly kissing by the sea.

165
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,524
Fine, send it if you want to die.

166
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:34,765
Why did you suddenly want

167
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,765
to go shopping today?

168
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:37,885
The TV station
will do an interview special,

169
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,005
interviewing the top thirty in the exam.

170
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:42,204
Xu asks me to buy new clothes.

171
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,204
When the interview is out,

172
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,524
won't it be played on loop
in the entire hospital?

173
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,244
I'll go buy a drink first.

174
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:50,005
I'll wait here.

175
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:50,520
Okay.

176
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:55,324
Welcome,
please feel free to look around.

177
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,125
Hello.

178
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:20,845
Hello.

179
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,404
Can you help me pack and send this?

180
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,085
Out of city?

181
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:24,644
In the city.

182
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:25,925
No problem.

183
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,484
But we have to

184
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:28,484
send it tomorrow.

185
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:29,404
Alright.

186
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,284
Please pay over here first.

187
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,085
Okay.

188
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:34,765
How much?

189
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:35,685
238.

190
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:39,284
I'll wrap it up.

191
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:40,280
All done.

192
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,324
Xu Zhi.

193
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,885
You're pretending
not to know me so soon.

194
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,444
No, I just didn't recognize you
immediately.

195
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,564
In a couple of days, I'll take you know

196
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,765
art training institutions.

197
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:08,925
So you have an idea.

198
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,125
If you get in the future,

199
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:12,444
treat me to a big meal.

200
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:13,204
Did you hear me?

201
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:28,885
Let me tell you some gossip.

202
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:35,925
What's up?

203
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:38,965
This soda is so good.

204
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:39,685
Do you want it?

205
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:40,204
Right there.

206
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,644
What's going on?

207
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,404
I've explained it to my parents.

208
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,765
That I messed up the exam

209
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:06,484
has nothing to do with you.

210
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,685
They won't give you trouble.

211
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:12,845
Congratulations!

212
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,005
You did so well.

213
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,364
Even if I hadn't underperformed,

214
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,524
I still wouldn't match your score.

215
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:23,725
What do you plan to do?

216
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,885
Are you planning to try again next year?

217
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:29,765
Do you feel like

218
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:31,484
I'm overestimating myself?

219
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,845
Tan Xu, with your abilities,

220
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:38,524
if you adjust your mindset,

221
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:39,564
you can make it.

222
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,885
(What's going on?)

223
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,925
(Seems like they're discussing
volunteer matters.)

224
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:10,265
(What?)

225
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:12,805
(Tan Xu wants to apply to
the same school with her?)

226
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:15,805
(I didn't hear clearly.)

227
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,564
You just asked

228
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:27,805
me to keep an eye on Xu Zhi
in Beijing, right?

229
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:33,885
You just said
she could have any boyfriend she wants,

230
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,484
is it really anyone she wants?

231
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:38,484
What if it's Tan Xu?

232
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:40,604
What if he also
gets into Hua University?

233
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,204
Do you think it is a market?

234
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:44,644
Anyone can get in.

235
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:48,484
What if Tan Xu knows Xu Zhi
is going to Beijing,

236
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,725
he also applies to a school in Beijing?

237
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:51,765
What will you do then?

238
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:53,244
Get to the point.

239
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:56,564
Here.

240
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,725
If you dare, make this your screensaver.

241
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,165
Okay, send it to me.

242
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:13,644
Okay.

243
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:14,524
Send it to you, right?

244
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:18,712
(You are not Chen Luzhou's friend yet.)
You still...

245
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,404
Lucy, you don't care?

246
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:22,324
Why delete me?

247
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:29,658
(Happy Valley)

248
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,125
Luzhou, I want to play that one.

249
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:47,644
Go ahead.

250
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:49,464
Go on.

251
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:51,085
Me?

252
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:53,016
Afraid of heights.

253
00:13:56,404 --> 00:13:57,484
Coward.

254
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:58,805
If you don't go up, I'll go.

255
00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:00,165
Go ahead.

256
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:09,925
I'll wait for you ahead.

257
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:34,725
We are both old,

258
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,165
if we are still around,

259
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,005
play a tune for me,

260
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,284
and I'll tell you the answer.

261
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:02,924
(What)

262
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,165
(notebooks are recommended
for college students?)

263
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,404
(Oh, who did you hang out with?)

264
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,165
No wonder he didn't reply to me.

265
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:37,444
So happy.

Moments.

291
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,040
I saw it.

292
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,280
I thought you were too busy

293
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,801
to check Moments.

294
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,721

295

but pretended not to see it, right?

296
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,001
You said the retracted message

297
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,092
had nothing to do with me.

298
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:04,561

How is it?

322
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,360
Let me check.

323
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,681
It feels like

324
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,320
the body is still a bit restricted.

325
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:57,561

326
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,400
there was a little slip-up.

327
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,001
I feel that you're not as free-spirited

328
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,440
as when you were young.

329
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:04,841
When you were young,

330
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,841
"my beauty was on full display,

331
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,801
you all can see."

332
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,681
Xu,

333
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,761
let's leave it at that.

334
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,801
Why get discouraged?

335
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,160
Let me tell you.

336
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,721
One

337
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:20,961
only cares about his appearance
when he has

338
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,521
something he cares about.

339
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,641
Do you know why you were invincible
when you were young?

340
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,320
Because you were carefree.

341
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,160
No, it won't.

342
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:32,881
When I was young,
I also cared about you and mom.

343
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,040
And my little goldfish.

344
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,961
How could that be the same?

345
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,240
Our attitude towards
all your performances

346
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,801
are always liking,
caring, and appreciating.

347
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,761
But there's a kind of feeling.

348
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,120
That might be a bit different.

349
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,561
Once you don't do well,

350
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:50,240
that person might not like you anymore.

351
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,561
I sense there's more
to what you're saying?

352
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
I feel like you have something
on your mind?

353
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,601
Tongue twister?

354
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:58,400
No.

355
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,320
No matter what,

356
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,480
It's actually already very perfect.

357
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:03,681
You look beautiful

358
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,160
and have good grades.

359
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,160
Just by standing on the stage,

360
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,921
all the lights and cameras

361
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
will focus on you.

362
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:12,001
As long as you

363
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,761
don't pick your nose or make faces,

364
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:14,601
that's fine.

365
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:15,681
When did I ever do that?

366
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:16,601
Yes, you did.

367
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,440
It's in this phone.

368
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,561
When you have a boyfriend in the future,

369
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:25,761
I must show him this photo.

370
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,761
If he only accepts the glamorous you,

371
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,521
we can't have such a person.

372
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:34,320
Because feelings eventually
fade to blandness,

373
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,721
returning to mundane daily life.

374
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,521
It's the most important part.

375
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,200
Of course.

376
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,921
If you want to spend a lot of money

377
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,681
to destroy this photo,

378
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:45,200
we can still discuss it.

379
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,761
Take care.

380
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:49,160
What do you want to eat?

381
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,480
Eat braised mobile phone.

382
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,240
Braised mobile phone is expensive.

383
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,721
Where are you going?

384
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:01,280
I'll go to

385
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Hua University.

386
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:03,921
Where are you going?

387
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:05,120
Hua University, definitely.

388
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
That's right, isn't that just fine?

389
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,360
See you at university.

390
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,948
How about you?

391
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:11,240
Stanford.

392
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:14,200
My mom asked me to go.

393
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
I have to go.

394
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,881
I have to go.

395
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,961
Alright.

396
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:18,200
Bro,

397
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,040
stop shaking.

398
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:21,841
You've shaken my hairpin off.

399
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:26,480
Uh, sorry about that.

400
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:27,721
I didn't mean to.

401
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:30,561
I'm just a bit too nervous.

402
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,160
The recording hasn't started.

403
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,160
Relax.

404
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,521
Hello, Yang Yijing
from Affiliated Middle School.

405
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,200
Xu Zhi, from Ruijun School.

406
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,908
No wonder you're unfamiliar with them.

407
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:43,220
They are from No. 1 High School.

408
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:51,120
I've heard he's the top scorer
in our province,

409
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,681
Li Ke.

410
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,320
Including competition points,

411
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,080
he scored over 750 points.

412
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,881
Really?

413
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:58,160
He's not the most impressive.

414
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,200
There's a genius,

415
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,921
who scored 700 points.

416
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,040
Without extra points?

417
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,601
Without optional subjects,

418
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:04,561
he scored 700 points.

419
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:07,360
It's a pity he didn't come today.

420
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:09,040
He's not on the list.

421
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,480
I wanted to see

422
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,681
what someone who scores

423
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,841
so high looks like.

424
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,801
Also,

425
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,921
our teacher specifically
calculated his score.

426
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,440
Including 60 points
from optional subjects,

427
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,921
he definitely broke 750 points.

428
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,400
That's really impressive.

429
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,561
By the way, later,

430
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:26,641
after it ends,

431
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:27,521
let's dine together?

432
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,961
With them?

433
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,761
Well,

434
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,400
we're not familiar with them.

435
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
It'll be awkward.

436
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,160
But a girl just now

437
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,280
specially came to inform us

438
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,521
the station is giving out funds

439
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,400
for dining together.

440
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:41,440
How much?

441
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:42,240
Three thousand.

442
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,641
We must go.

443
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:44,601
Not eating is foolish.

444
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:45,761
Yes.

445
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,761
What to eat with 3000?

446
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,080
Raise hand for hotpot.

447
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:50,961
Oily.

448
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:51,480
Grilled meat.

449
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,841
I want seafood.

450
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,348
No, seafood, I disagree.

451
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:55,881
I'm allergic

452
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,436
to seafood.

453
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:57,400
(Interview with outstanding graduates)

454
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
In the program,

455
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,080
I'd like to ask Li Ke one more question.

456
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,561
With such great results,

457
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,681
do you have suggestions

458
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,200
for the future juniors?

459
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:05,801
First of all,

460
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,921
you must have

461
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,440
a god-like opponent.

462
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,160
With such an opponent,

463
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
you are halfway to success.

464
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,480
Because
this god-like competitor of yours,

465
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,601
can always, in exams,

466
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:19,200
achieve god-like scores.

467
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,561
In this way,

468
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,400
he will motivate you to move forward.

469
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,521
It's the raw score master I mentioned.

470
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,841
It seems you have a good relationship
with this master.

471
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,480
Yes, we are good friends.

472
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,200
Actually, he's very interesting.

473
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,801
When I was in senior year,

474
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,280
I seldom outperform him.

475
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,721
Once, I outperformed him.

476
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,120
I complained to him,

477
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,440
where he shouldn't be wrong.

478
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,521
If it were another student,

479
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:43,240
he would complain about me.

480
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:44,601
But he

481
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,841
would not feel I am showing off to him.

482
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
It's the benefit of being friends
with someone

483
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,561
who is strong inside.

484
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:51,601
Being opponents,

485
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:53,240
but also friends and mentors.

486
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,400
I learned a lot from him.

487
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:59,360
But those two often mess around.

488
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:00,561
Once,

489
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,120
on the night before an exam,

490
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,561
they skipped evening study hall,

491
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,040
and sneaked out to watch a movie.

492
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,961
They ran into our dean and his wife,

493
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,801
celebrating
the tenth wedding anniversary outside.

494
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Mr. Gas Tank is so angry.

495
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:16,200
Uh, our dean's nickname

496
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,921
is Mr. Gas Tank.

497
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:17,556
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,400
Later, this master
was particularly calm.

499
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,160
He said to the Mr. Gas Tank.

500
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,040
On your tenth anniversary,

501
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,641
you just take your wife to a movie?

502
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,801
Or should I take

503
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,561
a wedding anniversary photo for you two?

504
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,601
After his wife saw the photo,

505
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,400
she felt it was extremely beautiful.

506
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,280
She's elated,

507
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:42,521
so she really liked the master a lot.

508
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,080
Then Mr. Gas Tank

509
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,320
didn't blame us,

510
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,721
and even bought

511
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:48,721
our movie tickets.

512
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,160
Okay, thank you very much

513
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,561
for the wonderful sharing
and valuable suggestions from you.

514
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:55,921
I hope their experiences

515
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,001
can help those

516
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:58,400
preparing for College Entrance

517
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,120
Examination.

518
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,280
This master is interesting?

519
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,521
Thanks for coming here.

520
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:02,841
The way he talks

521
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,521
is quite like a friend of mine.

522
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,561
(Knowledge points for broadcasting and hosting)
How are the materials I prepared for you?

523
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:13,480
Not bad.

524
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,320
Jiang Cheng invited you
to internet cafe, but you didn't go.

525
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:18,521
Instead, you're here instructing me.

526
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
So nice.

527
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:22,046
There's a price to pay for success.

528
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,320
Besides,

529
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,440
if you really get into a top university,

530
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,921
you'll have to repay me properly.

531
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,801
Hello.

532
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:29,320
Cold coffee.

533
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,240
Okay, wait a moment.

534
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,200
Repay you?

535
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,440
No more waits.

536
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,280
I'll properly repay you today.

537
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,240
Puns will get you fined.

538
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,360
Quite a coincidence.

539
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,280
Look who's talking. Cai Yingying.

540
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,044
You've found the next one so early.

541
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:50,400
How dare you call me a playboy?

542
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:51,801
Are you insane?

543
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:56,761
Feeling guilty?

544
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,681
Move aside.

545
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,280
Out of my way! Dog.

546
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,881
A dog?

547
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,921
I think you two are dogs.

548
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,440
You've overthought it.

549
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:06,641
She doesn't like me.

550
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,240
It's my one-sided crush on her.

551
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,080
What?

552
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,561
Is having a crush illegal?

553
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,480
Or after being the playboy
for so many years,

554
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,796
you take everyone as a playboy?

555
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,681
I heard you like collecting stars.

556
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,040
How about this?

557
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,681
I'll do you a favor.

558
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:23,521
I'll

559
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,400
pull you into
No.1 High School's big group.

560
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:26,601
Other girls

561
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:27,881
named ABB

562
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,681
may have a chance to be with you.

563
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,721
How about it?

564
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,360
Is my coffee ready?

565
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:38,601
Yes.

566
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,956
Thank you.

567
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,841
You're welcome.

568
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,921
Hope your crush succeeds.

569
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:46,200
See you.

570
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,681
It's fine.

571
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:52,440
Ignore him, sit down.

572
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,761
Not bad, Stylish Zhu.

573
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,561
Having a crush on me?

574
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,641
I almost believed it.

575
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,320
Your acting is pretty good.

576
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:03,961
Of course.

577
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:05,360
Listen to me.

578
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,681
These actors

579
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,240
must be secretly laughing.

580
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,681
If it weren't
for my heart not being here,

581
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:13,240
and wanting to be a painter,

582
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,440
all

583
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:17,521
those Awards

584
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,921
would all be mine.

585
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,120
Truly shameless.

586
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,480
This is the most important.

587
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
There you go.

588
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
Everyone is waiting for you now.

589
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,160
If he's late,
have him drink three cups, okay?

590
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,480
Yes, he must drink three cups.

591
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,040
Alright.

592
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,280
Let's leave it.

593
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:36,160
Bye.

594
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,641
How's it going?

595
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,040
No problem.

596
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:42,961
Great, great.

597
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,280
Sorry about just now.

598
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,360
We're classmates.

599
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:49,428
The chat was too lively.

600
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:50,400
During recording,

601
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,601
we may ignore your feelings.

602
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:52,521
It's okay.

603
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:53,961
I didn't know what to say

604
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:54,961
in front of the camera.

605
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
Watching you chat was fun.

606
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,200
I thought you

607
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,521
had an intense atmosphere.

608
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:01,521
But your class has
such a good atmosphere.

609
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:02,761
Right, Xu Zhi?

610
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:05,400
By the way,

611
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,440
I just mentioned that

612
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:07,881
god-like opponent.

613
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:09,360
He will come over for dinner later.

614
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:10,360
Do you mind?

615
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:11,480
Not at all.

616
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,280
I want to meet more talents.

617
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,681
If I minded, would you not let him come?

618
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,641
That won't do.

619
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,961
Without him,

620
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,921
our round would lose its meaning, right?

621
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:20,564
- Yeah
- Exactly.

622
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:21,761
Or let's put it this way,

623
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Xu Zhi,

624
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,160
if I'm not mistaken,

625
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,280
you ranked 30th
in the province this time.

626
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,601
If that master I mentioned

627
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,480
didn't miss elective,

628
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:31,601
tonight,

629
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,440
you wouldn't be here.

630
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,708
And you wouldn't be provincial champ.

631
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,400
Mr. Li, we'll go.

632
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,521
Come on, come on, let's go.

633
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:11,881
Stop scolding, everyone.

634
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,561
This is my limit.

635
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:17,881
This place is so good.

636
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:19,280
Academic elites'

637
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:20,961
relationships may be more romantic.

638
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,440
Does anyone want some beers?

639
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:23,440
Here, here.

640
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:24,160
Coming.

641
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,200
Give me one.

642
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:26,240
I want one.

643
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,240
Here.

644
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:28,480
Drink it.

645
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,721
Are you going to drink, Li Ke?

646
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,921
I'll get something.

647
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,440
If you have guts, drink up.

648
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,360
If you drink too much,
no one will carry you.

649
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:36,160
Really.

650
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,841
No need.

651
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,801
I took a plate for you.

652
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:42,440
Stop eating.

00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:17,881
Pretty Lu is here.

659
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,320
Bros, drink with him!

660
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:22,921
Why are you so late?

661
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,200
You're so late.

662
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:26,801
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Excuse me, more beers here.

663
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,521
Come on.

664
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,561
Three drinks.

665
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:30,480
Come on.

666
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,841
Sorry, everyone.

667
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:32,961
I delayed a bit.

668
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,440
Come on, let's drink.

669
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,240
I'm here, come on.

670
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
Cheers, cheers.

671
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:38,561
Happy graduation.

672
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:40,521
Happy graduation.

673
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:45,921
Hey, look at each of you.

674
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,721
He drinks a bit and you get mesmerized.

675
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:49,160
If you're drunk, you're fine.

676
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Of course, I'm okay.

677
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,080
Drink it.

678
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,801
Come on.

679
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:52,721
Come on, drink it.

680
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:55,320
Am I handsome?

681
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,881
So which university is good?

682
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,280
Hua University and Jing University
are both fine.

683
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,120
(So cocky.
Hua University and Jing University?)

684
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,601
(Failed and still thinking this?)

685
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:19,761
(College Entrance Examination Results Inquiry:
Chen Luzhou 713)

686
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:20,681
713.

687
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,480
Well done.

688
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,641
Not bad, huh?

689
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,200
But for me,

690
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,641
if it's not 750, it's a fail.

691
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,961
You people from No.1 High School
are crazy.

692
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,080
Chen Luzhou, are you messing with me?

693
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,280
What about in Shanghai?

694
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,601
In rainy season,

695
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,480
you hang clothes and they don't dry.

696
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
All the sheets are wet.

697
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,721
You'll feel sticky all over every day.

698
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,881
Not comfortable at all.

699
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,921
I still prefer the weather in the north.

700
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,521
It is drier.

701
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:58,561
Yes.

702
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,040
The south is too humid.

703
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,240
Uncomfortable.

704
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
It is like that in the south.

705
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,681
(If you don't come over, I'll go over.)

706
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:12,961
(I'll count down.)

707
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,801
(10)

708
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,801
(9)

709
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,001
(8)

710
00:33:18,641 --> 00:33:19,240
(7)

711
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,761
(3)

712
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,881
(2)

713
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,921
(1)

714
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,040
What if I'm not used to eating
those things?

715
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,080
You'll get used to it.

716
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
(You skipped six, five, four)

717
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,440
(I have been counting
like this since childhood.)

718
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,641
(Are you coming?)

719
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,601
(I wasn't someone)

720
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,721
(who would go over)

721
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:42,964
(at the mere call of others.)

722
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,200
Here I come.

723
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,601
There's quite a lot to eat.

724
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:52,601
But no staple food.

725
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:53,601
It's all desserts.

726
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:54,921
How can I feel full?

727
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,681
With so many people and 3000.

728
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,921
Pretty Lu.

729
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:03,521
Pretty Lu.

730
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,120
You might not know.

731
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,280
That one, over there,

732
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,812
isn't from No.1 High School,

733
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:10,721
but Ruijun School.

734
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,921
She looks

735
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:13,561
like the girls
in our school's art class.

736
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,921
She's super pretty

737
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,801
with a slim waist and long legs.

738
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,040
You looked at her.

739
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:22,881
Didn't look closely.

740
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,080
Just glanced twice.

741
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,601
Hey, why did you kick me?

742
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,320
I just saw a mouse

743
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,200
scurried by.

744
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:33,761
Mouse? Where?

745
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,881
No mouse.

746
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,961
Barbecue there.

747
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
Xu Zhi, I'm going there.

748
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:38,561
Okay.

749
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:41,080
I brought a Polaroid.
How about we take a picture?

750
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,124
Sure, come on.

751
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:45,120
Students from No.1 High School,
come take a photo.

752
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,120
Come on.

753
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,881
Take a picture.

754
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,280
Take a picture.

755
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,801
Come on.

756
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:49,681
Find a better place.

757
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:50,360
Stop drinking.

758
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:51,721
Come here, here.

759
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,881
Let's go.

760
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:54,360
Let's go.

761
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,440
Let's take a picture.

762
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:57,681
Waiter, help us take a group photo.

763
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,196
Okay.

764
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:00,001
Pretty Lu, come on.

765
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,801
- Go to center position.
- Center position.

766
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,200
Hurry up, Yu.

767
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,280
Come on, three,

768
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,200
two,

769
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,761
one.

770
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,641
Cheese.

771
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:09,841
Come on, one more picture?

772
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:10,440
Another one.

773
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,280
One more.

774
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,601
You guys take the picture first.

775
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,521
Okay, okay.

776
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,601
Okay, okay.

777
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,921
A vertical one.

778
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,681
Take it vertically. Let's smile.

779
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,200
Smile.

780
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,881
Okay, okay.

781
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:20,440
Come on.

782
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,320
Two, three.

783
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:23,360
Cheese.

784
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,160
(What are you looking at?
Come over here.)

785
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,681
(Busy admiring young couples.)

786
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,561
(I found the first impression)

787
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:33,601
(is so important.)

788
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:36,320
(Since the first time we met,)

789
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:37,721
(have you engraved)

790
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,001
(what my mom said into your heart?)

791
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:43,360
(Indeed, it's unforgettable.)

792
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,320
(Covered in romantic debts?)

793
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:46,961
(Everyone here is my classmate.)

794
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,001
(If you can ask anything,)

795
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:50,132
(I'll take your last name.)

796
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,440
(So confident.)

797
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,921
(Does it count if others like you?)

798
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,921
(The ones who took photos with you)

799
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,521
(are quite suspicious.)

800
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:59,120
(Your standards are strict.)

801
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
(I can control the fact of being liked?)

802
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,708
(Moreover,)

803
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,961
(can you guarantee
that no one has liked you?)

804
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,561
(No, but I never hide it.)

805
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,160
No more beers, right?

806
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,240
I'll go get some.

807
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Come on, this one.

808
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:20,080
I'll take it away.

809
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:21,556
What?

810
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,200
It's not for me to drink,

811
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,601
but the girls have nothing to drink.

812
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
That's your problem.

813
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,841
Figure it out.

814
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,320
This is reserved for her.
Don't touch it.

815
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,200
Who?

816
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,561
Are you siding with outsiders?

817
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,841
Fine, fine, I won't compete with you.

818
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,721
Waiter,

819
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,120
get me a bottle of beer.

820
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
Is there any beer?

821
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,801
Thank you.

822
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,801
Thank you.

823
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,240
You've been ignoring me.

824
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:07,841
But my beer attracts you here.

825
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,040
Am I not even worth beer?

826
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,001
Miss Xu?

827
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,160
I went to see if the barbecue is ready.

828
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,721
Why don't you

829
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,040
lock yourself in the chair?

830
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,761
Naked man 713.

831
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,040
Try it.

832
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,200
I just grilled lamb skewers.

833
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,480
They're so tender.

834
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:29,921
Do you want to try?

835
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:31,280
I don't eat cumin.

836
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,001
Alrighty, why don't you give it a taste?

837
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,721
Later.

838
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:34,360
I finish this.

839
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,561
Alright. By the way,

840
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:37,400
I wonder to know

841
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:39,480
if many girls are secretly in love

842
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,276
with Chen Luzhou?

843
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:41,761
Not really.

844
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:44,001
I think there are more
from other classes.

845
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,120
Once class is over,

846
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,961
our class's corridor
is the most crowded.

847
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,320
They're all to see him.

848
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,001
Is it because he's handsome?

849
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,280
I think it's not entirely because that.

850
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:55,040
Then why is it?

851
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,961
Because he's excellent.

852
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,761
At first, no one knew he entered
via guaranteed admission.

853
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,721
We just heard his dad is very rich.

854
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,761
Everyone thought he bought his way in.

855
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,040
And then?

856
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,761
Then,

857
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:07,881
in our class's first midterm exam,

858
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,280
he was the absolute first.

859
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
He was nearly twenty points higher
than the second place,

860
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,961
who's Li Ke.

861
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:17,881
This really excited Ke.

862
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,801
After many years,

863
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:20,801
he encountered a real opponent.

864
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,601
Chen Luzhou was the first,

865
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:23,440
and the only one.

866
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
I really wonder,

867
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,160
after he goes to university,

868
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,561
what kind of girl he will love.

869
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,360
How would I know!

870
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:34,841
You go ask him yourself.

871
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,160
Yeah, true.

872
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,036
I'll try another one.

873
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:39,561
They are all delicious.

874
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,080
I just grilled that myself.

875
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,001
I'll try yours.

876
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,676
Go ahead.

877
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,400
(We'll settle our bill later)

878
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:47,761
(I'll introduce you.)

879
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:49,521
(Many people here
will go to Hua University.)

880
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:50,561
(They'll be your classmates.)

881
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,601
I combined the knowledge,
including physics,

882
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:54,961
and chemistry to grill this.

883
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,160
Hello.

884
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,561
Hello, hello.

885
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:00,641
Come on, sit down.

886
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,652
Hello.

887
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,921
I'll do it myself.

888
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:05,921
Would you like to try some?

889
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,721
Sure, sure.

890
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,761
This smells great.

891
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,240
I'll grill some mushrooms.

892
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,160
I want to eat mushrooms, too.

893
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:16,681
I'll leave it to you.

894
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,580
Okay.

895
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:22,676
The mushrooms are good.

896
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,881
Pretty Lu,

897
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,841
you're strange.

898
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:36,280
What?

899
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,004
Smells good.

900
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,961
Yang Yijing, right?

901
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,480
It's him.

902
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,160
I found on your Moments,

903
00:39:43,521 --> 00:39:44,881
you are interested in

904
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:45,841
quantum mechanics.

905
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,921
You also love quantum mechanics?

906
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:49,440
Let's chat.

907
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:50,580
Sure.

908
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:51,412
Let's go.

909
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,561
Done, want some?

910
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,120
I don't eat cumin.

911
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:37,592
Potatoes?

912
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,144
Thank you, Pretty Lu.

913
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,001
Eat slowly.

914
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:55,841
Why follow me?

915
00:40:59,001 --> 00:40:59,761
Why hide from me?

916
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,001
You stepped on my shadow.

917
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,761
Alright, I'll walk behind.

918
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:10,601
Step on mine.

919
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:14,881
What exactly do you want?

920
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,961
At 8.30 PM,

921
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,561
there are fireworks.

922
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,001
See it?

923
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,120
No.

924
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:27,440
Alright, I'll go see it myself.

925
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:32,856
Really not going?

926
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,088
Let's go.

927
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:38,881
You still stepped on mine!
No stepping allowed.

928
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:43,921
So childish.

929
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:45,588
Not as childish as you.
