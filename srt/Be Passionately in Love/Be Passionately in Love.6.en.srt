(What Does It Take To Be Familiar?)

18
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:52,312
(Andrology, Treatment Room One)

19
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:59,631
(1034. Chen Luzhou,
consultation room 7.)

20
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:01,952
It's your turn.

21
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,271
Hello, over here.

22
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:14,392
Doctor.

23
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:17,952
Where's the discomfort?

24
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,912
I bumped into someone
while playing ball.

25
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:25,299
(Chen Luzhou)

26
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,711
Are you Chen Luzhou?

27
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:36,071
I am Chen Luzhou.

28
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:37,751
Your family does what?

29
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,312
We do business.

30
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:41,912
Do you have any siblings?

31
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:42,992
A younger brother.

32
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,952
Do these have anything to do
with my consultation?

33
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,512
Well,

34
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:51,711
let's do an exam.

35
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,071
An exam?

36
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:54,512
Alright, follow me.

37
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:18,739
(Patient being checked. Wait outside.)

38
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,352
Are you usually like this?

39
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:37,912
It looks normal like this.

40
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:38,551
Right?

41
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,512
How is it? What did the doctor say?

42
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:49,992
Slow down.

43
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,631
What exactly did he say?

44
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:54,512
I don't know.

45
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,032
He just gave me this.

46
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,551
What's this for?

47
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,832
Could it be...?

48
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:08,992
Did the doctor say anything else?

49
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,792
He asked about my family

50
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,671
and if I have any siblings.

51
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:17,111
He must want a red packet from you.

52
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,792
My dad once said

53
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,631
some doctors have poor personal ethics.

54
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:22,832
They ask for red packets.

55
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,751
But this doctor seems

56
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:27,512
quite upright.

57
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,551
Have you ever seen

58
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,992
anyone corrupt
with 'corrupt' written on their face?

59
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:35,512
But nothing else matters.

60
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:36,751
Just get well.

61
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,432
It's about your happiness
for the rest of your life.

62
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,952
How about I go buy you
an empty red packet?

63
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:43,792
No need.

64
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,231
Save it.

65
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:47,792
Pay my fees.

66
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,591
I'll repay you.

67
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:49,352
Okay.

68
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:50,551
And you?

69
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:03,872
1034.

70
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:06,271
Come in.

71
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,071
Dr. Xu.

72
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,104
You are...

73
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:18,751
I...

74
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,448
Couldn't do it?

75
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:20,032
I...

76
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,191
I am in pain as soon as I touch it.

77
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,191
Is the exam absolutely necessary?

78
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,792
Actually, it's not.

79
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:27,671
I'll switch it.

80
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:28,751
No need, Doctor.

81
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,511
I just felt it.

82
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,512
I think it doesn't hurt that much now.

83
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,591
How about I go back and rest first?

84
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,671
I'll be back next week.

85
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:38,512
Listen to me.

86
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,312
You had an external injury.

87
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,432
It may be better after a day or two.

88
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:44,511
But if you still don't feel well

89
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,551
after a week,

90
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,151
I suggest you come for a follow-up.

91
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,111
Okay.

92
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,259
(Dr. Xu Guangji, Chief Physician)

93
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:51,992
I have some advice for you.

94
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:54,751
Got a girlfriend?

95
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:56,352
No.

96
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:57,711
I suggest you

97
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,071
not get a girlfriend for now.

98
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,191
Focus on getting better.

99
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:06,512
Observe for a while before getting one.

100
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:08,512
Okay.

101
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:10,111
Thank you.

102
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,191
Go.

103
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:18,671
Call the next.

104
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:19,952
1035.

105
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:22,711
Hello, Dean.

106
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,352
Go ahead.

107
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,071
Okay.

108
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:27,872
Did you see?

109
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,071
That boy...

110
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,591
He's left.

111
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:31,671
Is he Chen...

112
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,712
Yes, I'll show you.

113
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:34,512
Chen Luzhou?

114
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:37,671
Let's compare. Look.

115
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:38,792
The one next.

116
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,631
Right?

117
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,272
Right.

118
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,191
This brat.

119
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:44,551
He's quite handsome.

120
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,751
He's 19 years old.

121
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:48,071
It...

122
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:50,751
Well...

123
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:51,312
Well...

124
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:52,591
Let me see.

125
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,631
I haven't left my table.

126
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,071
You saw it too. He just left.

127
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,071
"Dr. Xu,

128
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,952
I'd appreciate your help."

129
00:06:58,312 --> 00:06:58,912
What's this?

130
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,352
Got it.

131
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:01,392
The 5th floor, huh?

132
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:02,551
- Disciplinary Office.
- Let's go.

133
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:03,231
Come on.

134
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,151
I don't get the kids nowadays.

135
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,792
Why do they always act worldly-wise?

136
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:09,591
Is this photographer reliable?

137
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:10,711
He is so late.

138
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,671
If not for the fact that he's cute,

139
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:13,671
I would have gone mad.

140
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:19,671
Is it him?

141
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,111
How could it be?
You must have been mistaken.

142
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,472
It can't be the same person.

143
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:28,792
Give him a call.

144
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,512
Okay.

145
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,071
(Feng Jin)

146
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:37,832
Hello?

147
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:40,432
Hello?

148
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:42,432
Hello?

149
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:44,751
You...

150
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:51,792
Hello.

151
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:52,912
- Hello.
- Sorry.

152
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,271
I am Feng Jin.

153
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,271
F-E-N-G, Feng, and J-I-N, Jin.

154
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:57,912
Hello, I am Xu Zhi.

155
00:07:58,952 --> 00:07:59,792
Cai Yingying.

156
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:00,711
Hello.

157
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:01,712
Get in the car.

158
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:02,872
- Our ride is here.
- Okay.

159
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:03,711
Give me your luggage.

160
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:04,992
- No need.
- Thank you.

161
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:09,111
Let me do it.

162
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:10,671
Thank you.

163
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,792
Let me show you the photos I took.

164
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,151
Okay.

165
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,592
This was taken in Yunnan.

166
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,832
This, in Guilin.

167
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:34,992
This is Mount Everest.

168
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:37,351
You have even been to Mount Everest?

169
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,792
Of course, it wasn't like
in the movies where people

170
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:42,672
climbed up on foot.

171
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:43,792
I went by car

172
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:45,271
and breathed oxygen all night.

173
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:46,792
But it's impressive

174
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,991
to have been to so many places.

175
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:49,712
Right, Zhi?

176
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:51,311
This is nothing.

177
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:52,592
My buddy's friend is

178
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:53,472
into photography too.

179
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:54,912
He is truly impressive.

180
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,712
Magazine used his work
in his first year in high school.

181
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,311
National Geographic used a set too.

182
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:01,071
He then shot a documentary

183
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:03,071
on Hoh Xil
on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.

184
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,592
It was broadcast unchanged
on the city's TV station.

185
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,151
Is he handsome?

186
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:08,872
If he's not,

187
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,191
(Photography)
then no one is.

188
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:11,672
I heard

189
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,231
that since he was a kid,

190
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,471
the girls who liked him

191
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,071
were like grapes under a trellis,

192
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,471
all in bunches.

193
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,271
So exaggerated?

194
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:20,991
The key is,

195
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:23,552
being handsome
is his least noteworthy strength.

196
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:28,431
Tell me.

197
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,592
Did you hope
it was Chen Luzhou who came?

198
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:32,952
Well, I'm more familiar with him.

199
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,471
Since you're so familiar,

200
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:35,752
why not invite him?

201
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,151
Four people will be more fun.

202
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,151
This isn't mahjong.

203
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:39,111
Alright?

204
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:41,271
Right.

205
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,191
I can eat more with fewer people.

206
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:48,872
Why can't I find it?

207
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:19,872
Is this really butter tea?

208
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,912
If I hadn't been to Xizang,

209
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,792
I would've thought it was truly bad.

210
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:26,632
Isn't this an internet-famous street?

211
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:28,792
Why do things look so good,

212
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,792
yet taste so bad?

213
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:37,712
Guys, does the butter tea taste good?

214
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:38,992
Pretty good.

215
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,471
This is our shop's signature dish.

216
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:45,391
On this entire trendy street,
only we have it.

217
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:46,792
All of you, have a taste.

218
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:47,391
Okay.

219
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:48,431
Young ladies,

220
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:49,992
write some good reviews for us.

221
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,552
The impressive ones.

222
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,832
Later, I'll give you
some snacks for free.

223
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,832
Thank you. You're too kind.

224
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,952
That's it. Call me if you need anything.

225
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,512
Okay.

226
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:59,071
Enjoy.

227
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,351
Didn't you just say the tea was bad?

228
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,552
I'm getting soft

229
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:09,752
because I took her stuff.

230
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,872
But I think this should be okay.

231
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:16,752
Then I'll dig in.

232
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,832
Dip it a little.

233
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:35,431
It's awful.

234
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:42,552
What do we do now?

235
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,832
How about we endure this for money?

236
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:49,752
Do we really
have to sacrifice like that?

237
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:52,592
Are we going to the next shop or not?

238
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,391
Let's take photos.

239
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,235
(Chat Fee, Chen Luzhou:?)

240
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:15,231
(The chat fee.)

241
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:18,992
(Let's meet and talk.)

242
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,643
(Address)

243
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,391
How about some drinks?

244
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,191
I thought you'd last.

245
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:45,912
Neither of us said a word.

246
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,471
Then why didn't you speak?

247
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,912
I'm here to serve. You're the patron.

248
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,752
I didn't dare speak
since you didn't speak.

249
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,832
The chat fee...

250
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:57,511
Collect it now.

251
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:00,431
Cut the suspense next time.

252
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:04,792
Why are you also in Linshi?

253
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:07,712
Mr. Fu asked me to shoot

254
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:08,832
the motorcycle team.

255
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:10,912
So you have time for Mr. Fu's job

256
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,351
but not for my job, right?

257
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,231
He pays more than you do.

258
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:17,992
What should we talk about, Ms. Patron?

259
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,632
I can't earn the money
with the shop visit.

260
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,071
You don't want to say
what you don't mean?

261
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:24,632
Right.

262
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,992
It doesn't matter
whether you can earn the money.

263
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,992
It depends on whether you want it.

264
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,552
If you feel it's against your will,
just go back.

265
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,311
And you have to believe

266
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,391
with your abilities,

267
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:36,992
you'll have plenty of chances later.

268
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:39,672
To be honest,

269
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,271
before I came to see you today,

270
00:13:41,632 --> 00:13:43,032
I already planned to go back.

271
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:44,992
But I've changed my mind now.

272
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,071
About your motorcycle job,

273
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:49,592
can I go take a look?

274
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:50,752
(No.)

275
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,231
(You'll distract me.)

276
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,952
You probably aren't free.

277
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:56,672
I am. I have plenty of time.

278
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:58,471
Really?

279
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:12,672
Chen Luzhou.

280
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:15,592
Chen Luzhou.

281
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:19,231
Is it nice to watch others kiss?

282
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:20,752
I paid to have you chat with me.

283
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:21,992
And you're adrift.

284
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,351
Are you really going?

285
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:27,391
Only if you're willing,

286
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,832
I want to see
what kind of job you've taken.

287
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,672
Remember to wear pants if you go.

288
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:36,351
When have you seen me not wearing pants?

289
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,832
I mean, don't wear a skirt.

290
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,311
Let's order.

291
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:56,431
I ordered something more for you.

292
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,271
If you're hungry,

293
00:14:58,351 --> 00:14:59,351
take it back to eat.

294
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,552
Did I eat a lot just now?

295
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:04,992
Like him.

296
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:13,391
How about I have
another serving of rice noodles to go?

297
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,632
Did you go coal mining?

298
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,351
Your appetite has grown in days.

299
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,672
Cai Yingying and I went on

300
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,231
a foodie adventure the whole day.

301
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,351
I didn't get to eat properly at all.

302
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:23,752
A photographer is with us.

303
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,592
As a boy, he has bigger appetites.

304
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,752
He must be exhausted, carrying equipment

305
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:28,672
all day long.

306
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:38,992
I've given you the money.

307
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,111
Okay, let's go.

308
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,792
Why are you so absent-minded?

309
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:36,471
If a girl splits the bill

310
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:38,271
with you, what does that mean?

311
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,592
What else could it mean?

312
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,712
She doesn't want
to connect with you again.

313
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:43,712
Listen to me.

314
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:46,391
If a girl is interested in you,

315
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:47,712
either you pay the bill

316
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:48,992
or she pays.

317
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,271
So there will be a reason
for the next meeting.

318
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,151
Really?

319
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:55,471
Wait.

320
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,311
There is a girl
who's not interested in you?

321
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,111
She is not an ordinary girl.

322
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:02,231
Wait.

323
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,391
In what way?

324
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:07,752
She won't get angry

325
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:08,912
however you tease her.

326
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:10,111
She's fun.

327
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,712
It's all an illusion
of the talking stage.

328
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:15,672
Before you two date,

329
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,311
the girl's heart

330
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,151
is as big as the universe.

331
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:20,912
No matter how you tease her,

332
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,151
she can tolerate it.

333
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:23,752
But once you start dating,

334
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:25,151
the girl's heart

335
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,552
becomes as small as the eye of a needle.

336
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,632
Then how about reflecting on yourself?

337
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,191
Reflect on myself?

338
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,431
What do you mean?

339
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,752
She sees you as her universe.

340
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:42,992
If you fill her universe,

341
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,071
her heart naturally becomes small.

342
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:49,872
Awesome, bro.

343
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,391
You're so good at this.

344
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,832
Teach me more, will you?

345
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,912
Letong, the captain wants to see you.

346
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:01,032
See you.

347
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:13,912
Chen Luzhou,

348
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,311
I was just interrogated by Yingying.

349
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,552
She knows I'll see you tomorrow,

350
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,712
and she wants to go too.

351
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:21,032
Can I bring her along?

352
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:30,471
Up to you.

353
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,952
Can our photographer go too?

354
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,351
(Already 'our', huh?)

355
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:40,471
Up to you.

356
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:42,032
I've told you.

357
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:47,151
Given his tone,

358
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:48,792
he doesn't seem to welcome us.

359
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:51,231
He's probably busy.

360
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,191
How many times have I said it?

361
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:07,151
Keep distance.
Don't disturb my training.

362
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,351
Can't you understand?

363
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:09,151
Sorry, Yang.

364
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,311
If you damage my bike...

365
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:12,391
Lv Yang, my teammate.

366
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:14,271
He drives quite well.

367
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,632
But he's famous
for being hard to deal with.

368
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:18,151
- Nobody can handle him.
- Y-Yang,

369
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,351
I'm truly sorry.

370
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:20,231
- Sorry.
- I'll smash your junk

371
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:20,832
into pieces.

372
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,471
Don't, Yang, I... You...

373
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,672
- Y-You are...
- You what?

374
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,071
You value your bike.

375
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,672
He values his camera too.

376
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:28,912
Don't be so mean.

377
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:29,632
Who are you?

378
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:31,592
Thanks.

379
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:34,032
Finish line shot, huh?

380
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:34,952
I can do it.

381
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:37,351
You?

382
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,032
This angle is amazing.

383
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:50,832
The shot is incredible.

384
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:53,071
Impressive.

385
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,071
How did he do this?

386
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,271
Lv, come quickly and take a look.

387
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:57,351
Look at what?

388
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:00,672
Look, so cool.

389
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:01,592
Yeah, exactly.

390
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:02,191
Cool, huh?

391
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,471
It looks great.

392
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,311
Not some ordinary work.

393
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:08,271
It's amazing.

394
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:08,952
It's great.

395
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:10,672
Well done.

396
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:11,992
Look at the apexing.

397
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:14,992
This kid is quite cool.

398
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:23,672
If it's not convenient,

399
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,912
let's skip tomorrow.
Focus on what you're doing.

400
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,992
(Ready For a New Ride)
You're quite cool too.

401
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:34,912
Doing what?

402
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:39,992
Checking your Moments.

403
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:46,231
Didn't you say you never look?

404
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:51,952
I'm preparing to post

405
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:54,712
a travel vlog

406
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:56,632
but don't know what to write.

407
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,752
So I want to find some inspiration

408
00:20:58,832 --> 00:20:59,992
from your Moments.

409
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:06,592
Xu Zhi,

410
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,792
not everything needs to be explained.

411
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,151
When there's a gale,

412
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,872
who can the plants reason with?

413
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:17,992
But people aren't plants.

414
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,191
We can speak to avoid

415
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:21,391
misunderstanding.

416
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:26,672
Go to bed early.

417
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,071
If you come tomorrow,

418
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:28,912
I'll pick you up.

419
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,391
Good night.

420
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:55,271
Photographer Chen,

421
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:56,471
long time no see.

422
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:57,992
I said I'd fetch you.

423
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,191
Why just came?

424
00:21:59,592 --> 00:22:01,071
We've already disturbed you enough.

425
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,271
Besides, we've given up
on the foodie adventure.

426
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:04,992
We have plenty of time, right?

427
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,552
So we came over by ourselves.

428
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:07,391
Just you two?

429
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:09,712
- And...
- I'm here.

430
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:11,351
I've bought you all milk tea.

431
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:12,992
Thank you.

432
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,431
I don't drink milk tea. Thanks.

433
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:19,872
Chen Luzhou?

434
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:21,032
Feng Jin?

435
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:23,032
It's me.

436
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:24,391
I'm Zhu Yangqi's classmate.

437
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,672
He often mentions you to me.

438
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,952
He's the person I mentioned to you.

439
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:31,552
The award-winning photographer.

440
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,391
I didn't expect your friend was him.

441
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:35,191
That's enough.

442
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,832
I wasn't so excited when I saw my idol.

443
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:37,712
Wait.

444
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:39,032
I think I'm going to faint.

445
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:41,471
You're exaggerating.

446
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:42,712
How do I feel

447
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,311
he doesn't seem to want to know you?

448
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:46,071
He recognized me at a glance.

449
00:22:46,752 --> 00:22:48,632
Clearly, he has admired me
for a long time too.

450
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:51,151
They're testing shots.

451
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,431
I'll take you to the lounge.

452
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:53,511
Okay.

453
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:55,872
You are here.

454
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,351
Lv Yang is mad again.

455
00:22:57,552 --> 00:22:58,391
He's unmanageable.

456
00:22:58,952 --> 00:22:59,952
We need you.

457
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,351
I'm taking my friends to the lounge.

458
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:03,511
It's okay. You go ahead.

459
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:06,552
Okay.

460
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:09,872
Is she the one you mentioned...?

461
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:12,992
It's on the way.

462
00:23:13,712 --> 00:23:14,311
Come too.

463
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:14,832
Okay.

464
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,619
(Ready For a New Ride)

465
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,431
Itching to try?

466
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:29,511
Want to race too?

467
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:32,111
I quit a long time ago.

468
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:35,311
Let's eat.

469
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:37,032
Finally.

470
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:38,032
I'm starving.

471
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,071
It smells so good.

472
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:42,792
Won't Chen Luzhou join us?

473
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:44,111
He should still be shooting.

474
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,752
Do you know what major he applied for?

475
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,271
You are so familiar with him.

476
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,832
I'm actually not that familiar with him.

477
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:10,391
Thanks.

478
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,151
Chen Luzhou,

479
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,231
well,

480
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,271
we've admired each other for so long.

481
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:18,752
Let's exchange WeChat

482
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,351
to become real friends.

483
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:23,912
Feng Jin is really not reserved.

484
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:25,991
He doesn't care
if people will feel awkward

485
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,231
as long as he doesn't.

486
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:30,632
In the future, we...

487
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:33,792
Now that you are WeChat friends,

488
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,111
you can chat anytime later.

489
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,071
Come on, let's go buy drinks.

490
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,231
I need you, muscle boy.

491
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:49,552
Come and eat.

492
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:15,431
Thanks.

493
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:21,231
Is there a shoot tonight?

494
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:23,111
No.

495
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:25,231
Then go back with us tomorrow.

496
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:27,712
You?

497
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:32,271
You can go back now.

498
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:34,311
I need to do post-production
for a few days.

499
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:53,712
Are you familiar with Feng Jin?

500
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:57,752
Not as familiar as with Zhu Yangqi.

501
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:00,952
Then why didn't you guys split the bill?

502
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:04,592
I get it.

503
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:07,511
You're familiar with everyone but me.

504
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:10,792
Even if we watched meteor shower

505
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:13,311
and drank together.

506
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,752
I even brought you to where I work.

507
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:17,912
What does it take to be familiar?

508
00:26:21,552 --> 00:26:23,832
Isn't it possible
that Feng Jin and I didn't split

509
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:26,872
because today's expenses

510
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,952
can all be reimbursed?

511
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:34,271
You said nothing.

512
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,431
Were you mad about this just now?

513
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:45,032
I wasn't mad.

514
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:46,752
You were pretty mad.

515
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,151
You tore chopsticks

516
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,471
like they were my bones.

517
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:53,311
I just feel

518
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:55,271
I've really opened up to you.

519
00:26:55,952 --> 00:26:57,952
I gave you a tour and chatted with you.

520
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:00,592
And you told people we're not familiar?

521
00:27:00,672 --> 00:27:01,792
Is it normal to be so?

522
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,111
I didn't mean anything else

523
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:05,191
when I told them that.

524
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:06,471
I just feel that

525
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:08,792
I don't know you very well yet.

526
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:10,672
For example?

527
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:13,271
For example, Feng Jin said

528
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:15,231
your work was featured in a magazine.

529
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:17,111
And the work you filmed in Hoh Xil

530
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:18,992
was broadcast by the TV station.

531
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:19,592
Also...

532
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,592
These are the things

533
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:21,872
he finds awesome,

534
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:23,351
yet you think you don't know about?

535
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:32,391
Being on a magazine is no big deal.

536
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,712
Chen Xingqi ran away from home at eight

537
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:35,832
and was in the newspapers.

538
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:38,031
My work was broadcast on TV

539
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:39,672
because my mom worked at the network.

540
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,512
Back then, their footage went wrong,

541
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:43,792
so they replaced it with mine.

542
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:46,511
By the way,

543
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:49,231
I filmed antelope mating.

544
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:51,071
You'd like to hear it?

545
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:59,151
How about I tell you a joke?

546
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:02,231
To coax me?

547
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,191
I guess so.

548
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:08,391
Zhi,

549
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:09,912
come with me.

550
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,351
We can make some money.

551
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:12,271
Let's go.

552
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:13,032
Wait for me.

553
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:15,031
Where?

554
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,111
This way. Here.

555
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:24,872
Is this how you coax me?

556
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:36,191
(Yan Letong: Are you free? I need help.)

557
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:38,032
(Please fetch my sister at the door.)

558
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:39,351
(Please.)

559
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:48,472
A 5,000-yuan bonus?

560
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,151
Hurry up.

561
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:50,912
Or the opportunity
will go to someone else.

562
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:51,912
We want to sign up.

563
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:57,592
Have you ever raced before?

564
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:58,552
Sure.

565
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:01,592
Sign your name.

566
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:05,032
It's my first time racing a girl.

567
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:06,592
What's with a girl?

568
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:07,832
Pat Moss has beaten

569
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,431
men for five years in a row

570
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,032
and won the championship.

571
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:14,592
If Zhi wins the bonus, it's more money

572
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:16,632
than we can make
with a foodie adventure.

573
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:18,752
Let's remind you in advance.

574
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,632
Everyone can participate.

575
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,552
But there'll be no prize
for non-official members

576
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:24,952
even if they win.

577
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,712
Well, it's all about participation.

578
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:28,752
What's all about participation?

579
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:30,311
Then I won't do it.

580
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,432
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it.

581
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:42,712
Yan Lelin?

582
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:46,912
A-Are you the one
my brother sent to pick me up,

583
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:47,952
Chen Luzhou?

584
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:51,391
I heard you on the phone
with your brother.

585
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:52,471
I thought you were ten.

586
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:54,191
I-I'm 17 now.

587
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,511
So, just a bit over ten.

588
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:56,952
Let's go.

589
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:01,552
Brother Luzhou,

590
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,071
can you help me with my bag?

591
00:30:05,712 --> 00:30:06,672
I charge 500.

592
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,391
500?

593
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:10,351
Let's go.

594
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,311
Money-grubber.

595
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:14,872
It's so hot.

596
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,672
Can you buy me an ice cream,

597
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:17,471
Brother Luzhou?

598
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,231
I'm not your brother.

599
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:20,431
Your brother is racing now.

600
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,952
You're my brother's friend.

601
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:23,071
So you're my brother too.

602
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:24,912
No, we're not that familiar.

603
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:28,592
There's ice cream here.

604
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:33,971
(Four-Leaf Clover Ice Cream)

605
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:39,952
Indeed, nothing ever just falls
into one's lap.

606
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:42,032
Why is it so hard to make money?

607
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:44,752
I haven't liked Chen Luzhou

608
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:45,952
for a long time.

609
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,511
He's brought two girls to work.

610
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:49,231
Is he here to work

611
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:50,351
or to pick up on girls?

612
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:52,752
I despise these privileged brats.

613
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:54,032
And his photos too.

614
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,592
Totally unwatchable
and not professional at all.

615
00:30:57,032 --> 00:30:57,912
And he's arrogant

616
00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,151
just because he's a rich kid.

617
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:00,912
I touched his lousy drone earlier.

618
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:01,832
And he was dramatic.

619
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:02,912
What a joke.

620
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,632
Say that again if you dare.

621
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:12,111
What?

622
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:13,391
You want to fight?

623
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:18,264
(Lv Yang, Racer)

624
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:19,792
Lv Yang, right?

625
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:22,912
Let's race.

626
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:25,992
You?

627
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:29,992
If you lose, I won't want much.

628
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,151
What do you want?

629
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:35,191
You won't ask for my kiss, will you?

630
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:35,992
I can kiss you.

631
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:38,552
(Lounge)
No need.

632
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:40,151
Didn't you win first place?

633
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:42,111
Give me the prize money.

634
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:48,952
Are you sure you can win?

635
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:51,832
Let's race and see.

636
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:52,712
What if I win?

637
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,271
Then this trip wasn't in vain.

638
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,111
Win against me first.

639
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:57,792
Okay.

640
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,311
I have one more condition.

641
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:01,351
What condition?

642
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:02,952
If you lose,

643
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,952
apologize to Chen Luzhou in person.

644
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:12,471
Excuse me, a four-leaf clover ice cream.

645
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:13,271
- Thanks.
- Okay.

646
00:32:13,952 --> 00:32:14,391
Luzhou,

647
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:16,832
should I have the chocolate-flavored one

648
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:18,952
or the strawberry-flavored one?

649
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:20,191
It's up to you.

650
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:21,992
What's with the attitude?

651
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:24,712
You're a tough talker
with a tender heart.

652
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:26,712
You said no, but here we are.

653
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:27,592
I paid.

654
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:29,311
Okay.

655
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,712
Sir, you overpaid by eight yuan.

656
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:33,592
Let her choose what she wants.

657
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:35,311
Okay.

658
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:37,992
Eight yuan?

659
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:39,431
What can I get?

660
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:39,952
Hello?

661
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:41,832
Hello, where are you?

662
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,151
I've picked her up. We're heading back.

663
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:46,031
Xu Zhi is about to race.

664
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:47,031
Hurry back.

665
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:48,032
Why is she racing?

666
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:49,031
I don't know why

667
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:50,592
she got into a rivalry with Lv Yang.

668
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:52,071
They insist on competing.

669
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:01,688
(Full Throttle Racing,
Enjoy the Passion)

670
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:09,431
Brother.

671
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,151
There is a female rider.

672
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:18,832
She is so cool.

673
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,632
This girl is indeed extraordinary.

674
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,128
(Passion)

675
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:25,672
Go for it!

676
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:26,832
Did Xu Zhi start off?

677
00:34:26,912 --> 00:34:28,151
Can she ride?

678
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:29,632
Did her bike move?

679
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:31,431
See for yourself.

680
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:32,592
No, I don't dare.

681
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:33,672
I've had a bad heart.

682
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:34,471
I'll faint.

683
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:35,712
Nice!

684
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,111
Xu Zhi is ahead of that Lv guy?

685
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:41,992
You saw wrong. She's the one behind.

686
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:44,151
Why "nice", then?

687
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:01,511
Mr. Fu said

688
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:03,832
pros never brake when apexing.

689
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,472
Turns are a dividing line.

690
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:07,632
People who can't conquer turns
can't go further.

691
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:10,231
Xu Zhi's apexing
was taught hand-in-hand by Mr. Fu.

692
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:12,511
And she did very well back then already.

693
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,792
That's why Mr. Fu put her

694
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:14,872
on the team for training.

695
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:17,391
Who is Mr. Fu?

696
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:19,592
Are you talking about Fu Yuqing?

697
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:20,391
Yes.

698
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:22,752
No wonder.

699
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,511
He was the best driver
in our province back then.

700
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:28,083
(2nd, Xu Zhi +0.763)

701
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:29,391
See that?

702
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,151
Lv Yang took the outer path.

703
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:32,792
Xu Zhi took the inner path.

704
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,792
Her lane changing
on the straight is mature.

705
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:36,231
She's now behind because

706
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:38,032
she is acting cautiously

707
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,632
for being new on this track.

708
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:41,552
If she speeds up later,

709
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:43,592
her chance to beat Lv Yang is high.

710
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,552
I found Xu Zhi to be quite smart.

711
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,231
When she agreed to race,

712
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:05,672
Lv Yang was arrogant,

713
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,872
fearing people would say he bullies her.

714
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:09,752
So he let her make a request.

715
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:11,391
But she only made one:

716
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:12,632
a long-distance race.

717
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:14,032
In this way,

718
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:15,391
she has enough time

719
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:16,712
to observe Lv Yang's habits

720
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:18,511
and seize his weaknesses.

721
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:27,752
Lv Yang seems to have realized it too.

722
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,231
His mindset is clearly a bit off.

723
00:36:30,712 --> 00:36:33,032
He won't start
apexing without braking, will he?

724
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:36,672
A sudden change of habits on the track

725
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:38,231
is the biggest taboo for a driver.

726
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:39,552
I doubt he'll do that.

727
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:49,672
Zhi,

728
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,191
- go!
- Go!

729
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:11,792
Look.

730
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:13,111
Xu Zhi is speeding.

731
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:28,632
She'll overtake Lv Yang
at the next turn.

732
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:44,271
Alright.

733
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,311
Lv Yang is sure to lose.

734
00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:22,712
Zhi!

735
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,632
Go!

736
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,032
Zhi!

737
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,071
- Hurry.
- What's wrong?

738
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:41,672
Let's go.

739
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:42,552
Hurry.

740
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:06,592
Xu Zhi!

741
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:13,471
Are you okay?

742
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:15,512
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

743
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:16,511
- Nothing.
- Go away.

744
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:18,032
Go!

745
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:23,832
Give me.

746
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:25,992
Hop up.

747
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,960
(Xu Zhi, not everything
needs to be explained.)

748
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,032
(When there's a gale,)

749
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:25,235
