(Every Step He Takes Is Towards You)

18
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:53,366
What will you do later?

19
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:58,005
Homework?

20
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:00,646
You stay up late every day

21
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:01,806
for homework?

22
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:05,966
Every time I tell others
I am from Qingyi,

23
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,646
someone always asks me a question.

24
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:08,846
Do you know what it is?

25
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:10,926
"Are you from No.1 High School?"

26
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,565
No.1 High School produces brainiacs.

27
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:16,165
No.1 High School's students
always emphasize where they're from,

28
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:17,806
as if

29
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,446
no other school can represent Qingyi.

30
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:23,605
They easily erase the efforts of others.

31
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,886
So you want to work harder

32
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,446
to let those people realize

33
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,125
their superiority is ridiculous.

34
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:30,166
Of course.

35
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:31,406
Capability counts more.

36
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,766
How about we make a bet?

37
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:35,525
Bet on what?

38
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,085
On who does better in the midterms.

39
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:40,286
You represent No.1 High School,
and I represent Ruijun School.

40
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:42,846
I see.

41
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,605
Without getting a result,

42
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:46,806
you don't plan to date.

43
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,005
Alright.

44
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,125
Dating and kissing are both boring.

45
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:56,886
Kissing while dating is boring.

46
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,405
Only kissing without dating is fun.

47
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,485
Right?

48
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:01,406
We have already kissed just now.

49
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:02,605
I feel

50
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:04,485
it's just like that.

51
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:06,645
What do you mean?

52
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,886
What do you think?

53
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:10,846
It means that kissing without dating

54
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:11,926
is also boring.

55
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,326
Not dating but doing something else

56
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:15,645
might be fun.

57
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:18,485
Don't push it, alright?

58
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,485
Would you like to

59
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:28,125
plan the next investment fair with me?

60
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,366
Sorry.

61
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:30,645
I may not be able to.

62
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,565
I have too much homework recently.

63
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,247
With me,

64
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,685
chatting to another boy on WeChat?

65
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,205
You are quite bold.

66
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:37,525
Come on.

67
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,485
You didn't take him seriously at all.

68
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:43,326
What are you snorting at?

69
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:44,846
You little sourpickle.

70
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,085
Yeah, he's a pickle.

71
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:49,246
And he's boring.

72
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,246
He wanted a proper relationship.

73
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,165
And what happened?

74
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:54,246
He found out the girl likes excitement.

75
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,525
Right?

76
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:56,687
He feared

77
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,045
they may break up soon.

78
00:03:58,726 --> 00:03:59,846
Even sending that girl

79
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,326
a WeChat message would take ages.

80
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,165
He feared she'd get bored
if he talked too much

81
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,886
or feel ignored if he talked too little.

82
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:07,647
All his attention

83
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,125
was put on that girl.

84
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:09,806
And then?

85
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,406
That girl simply said

86
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,246
he's a sourpickle.

87
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:15,286
Wouldn't you say he's unlucky?

88
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:19,366
Do you really think so?

89
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:22,806
What a poor guy.

90
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,125
If we were like this our whole lives,

91
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,152
wouldn't it be nice?

92
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:29,806
What's nice about it?

93
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:31,926
Of course not.
Don't even think about it.

94
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,605
You think a lot, don't you?

95
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,366
But even if we got together

96
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,685
and then broke up, as you said,

97
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:40,926
you'll get something.

98
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,886
Being the first love ex-boyfriend

99
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,206
to me, Xu Zhi,

100
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:45,966
would sound cool.

101
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,125
It does sound better than school hunk

102
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,205
or class hunk.

103
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:51,846
After all, you are

104
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,685
the famously beautiful Xu Zhi

105
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,766
from kindergarten onwards.

106
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:58,406
Look at you.

107
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,926
If you spoke without snark,

108
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:01,605
you would have a girlfriend.

109
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,966
I can change now.

110
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:04,525
It's too late.

111
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,085
Wait to be summoned.

112
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:07,605
Bye.

113
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:11,886
Good night.

114
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:03,416
(Chen Luzhou

115
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,406
You look happy.

116
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,926
Got back together with Xu Zhi?

117
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:40,184
(Timetable for Huaguang University's
School of Architecture's Courses)

118
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:42,485
(Zhu Yangqi will come soon.)

119
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:44,406
(Let's go eat pork chop together.)

120
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:57,005
Long time no see.

121
00:06:58,886 --> 00:06:59,366
Let's go.

122
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:00,726
Let's go.

123
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,085
What are you doing?

124
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,165
You didn't reply to me.

125
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:13,085
What are you looking at?

126
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:18,525
Why are you so slow today?

127
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,165
Did you get hurt, huh?

128
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,326
Tan Xu?

129
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,525
Should we call him over then?

130
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,966
We four can make a table.

131
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,565
Don't look for trouble.

132
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,207
Wait.

133
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,766
How is this looking for trouble?

134
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,726
An old classmate has come to Beijing.

135
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,726
Inviting him for a meal is quite normal.

136
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:44,806
No, not normal at all.

137
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:47,806
Shouldn't Tan Xu
be repeating the course now?

138
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,085
Why did he come to Beijing?

139
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:51,446
Why did he come to Huaguang University?

140
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,005
What is the reason?

141
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:55,846
Isn't the answer obvious?

142
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:58,846
That is,

143
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,565
he specifically came for Xu Zhi.

144
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:04,726
Will you order or not?

145
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,366
Yes.

146
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,246
Sorry.

147
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,165
It was abrupt
to suddenly come to see you.

148
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:19,165
But you're the only friend

149
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,486
I know in Beijing now.

150
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:23,125
Why did you suddenly come to Beijing?

151
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:27,686
Retaking the course is harder
than I thought.

152
00:08:28,646 --> 00:08:30,005
So I wanted

153
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,445
to come see my ideal university

154
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,165
to find some motivation.

155
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,405
Your mock exam results aren't good?

156
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:41,365
Not just that.

157
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,045
They're getting worse and worse.

158
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,045
And I can't focus.

159
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:49,005
I feel I'm getting further
from my parents' expectations.

160
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,646
It's like I've hit a dead end.

161
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,285
Have you thought about

162
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,766
what you are studying for?

163
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,806
Are you doing it for yourself

164
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,245
or for your parents?

165
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:01,726
Sometimes, you don't

166
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,486
have to care about what people think.

167
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,085
Just do what you want to do.

168
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:16,445
He can dream on.

169
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:18,486
Whether he can get

170
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,405
into Huaguang University
is still uncertain.

171
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,045
Why did he come to Xu Zhi?

172
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,325
To talk big game.

173
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,486
If he really came
to talk big game to Xu Zhi,

174
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,005
I would donate some cilantro to him.

175
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:31,766
Xu Zhi loves to eat it.

176
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:35,766
Excuse me, gentlemen.

177
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:36,846
Here is your cold dish.

178
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:37,926
Thank you.

179
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:40,405
Where's the vinegar?

180
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:41,726
Sorry, I'll get it now.

181
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,405
No worries, I'll just dip it in him.

182
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,526
Just joking.

183
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:48,886
You go get it. Thanks.

184
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,125
Eat.

185
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,005
Thank you.

186
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:57,486
This trip wasn't in vain.

187
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,125
Keep it up.

188
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:01,806
By the way,

189
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,726
is Chen Luzhou here too?

190
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,566
Yes, and you know about it too?

191
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,405
After all, he's Chen Luzhou.

192
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:12,405
(De Sica)
Chen Luzhou,

193
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,245
at a time like this,

194
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:16,325
you skipped class for a movie?

195
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:17,846
The exams are coming up.

196
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,606
And this... De Sica?

197
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,205
Can De Sica teach you trigonometry

198
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,285
or solid geometry?

199
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:26,886
Can De Sica take the exams for you?

200
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:29,526
Let's make a bet, sir.

201
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:31,566
Bet on what?

202
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:33,085
If I get first place

203
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,045
in next month's IMO,

204
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:36,165
you need to give me

205
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,245
a movie leave next time.

206
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:38,766
Deal.

207
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,165
First place for a movie leave.

208
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,245
Keep your word.

209
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,045
Alright, I'm off.

210
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,165
See you, Mr. Zhang.

211
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,005
Is it really a deal?

212
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,966
(Actually,
I've always envied Chen Luzhou.)

213
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:56,445
In him,

214
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,606
you can always see that kind
of relaxed determination.

215
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:02,165
It's like he can accomplish

216
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,686
everything without effort.

217
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,205
But I can't do that.

218
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,606
I can't

219
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,245
view gains and losses so lightly.

220
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,886
Many people think of Chen Luzhou

221
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,125
as a talented player

222
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,566
who can win first place easily.

223
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:18,165
But everyone ignores his efforts.

224
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:19,686
In his senior year,

225
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,365
he would sleep at 3 or 4 AM

226
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,165
and get up at eight for school.

227
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:24,647
And in senior year,

228
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,606
he solved about 8,000 problems
in science alone.

229
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,886
He got in here by add-on admission.

230
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,486
I know about that.

231
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:31,846
In many people's eyes,

232
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,285
he could go abroad

233
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:36,245
and get into Huaguang University
as he wanted.

234
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,445
But they don't know

235
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:39,766
he switched to his dream major
in his sophomore year.

236
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,445
To catch up with the courses,

237
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,566
he put in a lot of effort.

238
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:44,125
It's just that he never mentions it.

239
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,686
In this way,

240
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,405
you two are quite similar.

241
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,005
Sir, here is your vinegar.

242
00:11:58,846 --> 00:11:59,846
Thank you.

243
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:10,646
This vinegar is really strong.

244
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:12,606
You talk a lot.

245
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:14,646
You've been
looking handsome lately, Lucy.

246
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,045
Stop flattering me.

247
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:20,886
Lucy, the truth is,

248
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,846
ever since you came back from Europe,

249
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,165
your fashion sense

250
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,405
has become so debatable.

251
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,526
Can you wear a white shirt,

252
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:30,606
dude?

253
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,526
You dress so casually every day.

254
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,285
With such a good shape,

255
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,245
not wearing a white shirt
is a total waste.

256
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,486
Why wear a white shirt?

257
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,766
To imitate Tan Xu?

258
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:43,445
Wearing a shirt alone
is not imitating Tan Xu.

259
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,285
Suits and shirts

260
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:47,846
are the standard for a cool man.

261
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,205
Right, Mr. Cool?

262
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:53,285
I wonder if my sense of aesthetics

263
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,325
has been spoiled by you

264
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:56,125
since I was young.

265
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,526
Now I find the campus hunk

266
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:58,726
of my school quite average.

267
00:12:58,806 --> 00:12:59,806
I mean it.

268
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:03,445
Do you know what Luo Dan said?

269
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:04,886
Luo Dan?

270
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,445
My high school classmate

271
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,045
who got into your art academy.

272
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:11,886
He said,

273
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:15,486
"Back in high school,
the campus hunk was Chen Luzhou.

274
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:18,045
Now in college, the campus hunk
is still Chen Luzhou.

275
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:19,766
Even my dad has remarried twice.

276
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,285
But the campus hunk hasn't changed."

277
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:24,405
Then I'll go.

278
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,526
That's more like it.

279
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,445
Don't bottle it up

280
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,445
next time.

281
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,726
Just speak out.

282
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:31,966
At least,

283
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,125
we can drink it away.

284
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,526
We can drink until morning.

285
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,365
Until morning?

286
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:38,726
You're that free?

287
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:39,487
Nothing

288
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,005
is more important than consoling

289
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:42,846
my lovesick bro,

290
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:44,045
right?

291
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,325
I really don't want
to go back to my dorm room.

292
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,406
Can I go to your place

293
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,125
and squeeze in?

294
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,005
My dorm bed? Forget it.

295
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:57,646
I can barely fit myself.

296
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,365
I'll get you a hotel room.

297
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:00,445
You can stay there.

298
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:01,566
Sure.

299
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:03,566
A presidential suite, please.

300
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:04,846
You're dreaming.

301
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:06,925
Given my current situation,

302
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,005
if you're really my bro,

303
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:09,926
you should sleep in a park.

304
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,486
You heartless man.

305
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,245
Fill it up, Chen Luzhou.

306
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:24,606
Alright.

307
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,526
Fill it up.

308
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:28,686
Fill it up.

309
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,085
Wait,

310
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,526
aren't you my bro?

311
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,125
Of course, I am.

312
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:36,686
You can't hold your liquor,

313
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:37,806
weakling.

314
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,005
Yeah, I'm a weakling.

315
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,325
Pour some more.

316
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,886
I'm not even drunk.

317
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,245
Okay, we'll drink next time, alright?

318
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,766
If you're my bro, just sleep well.

319
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:12,824
(Conman's Quote:
I will always be by your side.)

320
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:00,925
Chen Luzhou,

321
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,526
can't you see what time it is now?

322
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,045
Why are you still studying?

323
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,085
Is it necessary to be so competitive?

324
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,165
Fine, go ahead and study.

325
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,886
Study to death.

326
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,486
You have class to attend to now?

327
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:39,686
Today...

328
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,686
Wait, it's Saturday today.

329
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:43,045
I'm going back to school

330
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,245
to have breakfast with Xu Zhi.

331
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:47,766
Wait.

332
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:00,846
Feeling sulky,
yet going to have breakfast with her.

333
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,806
Chen Luzhou, you are hopeless.

I must change my major next year.

I really can't stand
staying up late every day.

353
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,446
I couldn't help dozing off yesterday

354
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,405
and dreamt that Mr. Hu told me,

show my friend around for me.

I want to watch hot guys
play basketball.

- Boyfriend?

377
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:33,806
Are you two really together?

378
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:34,886
Xu Zhi?

379
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,606
Go, go!

380
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,005
Come on!

381
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:43,085
Zhao Tianqi, go!

382
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,165
Come on!

383
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,285
So cool.

384
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:03,566
Xu Zhi.

385
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:07,566
Go, go!

386
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:08,807
You good? It's hot.

387
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,245
It's boiling hot.

388
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:12,566
Let's eat ice cream later.

389
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:15,005
But you were really cool just now.

390
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:15,846
- Right?
- Yes.

391
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:16,926
I found it cool too.

392
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:18,486
Super cool.

393
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:19,245
Right?

394
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:20,365
One more game?

395
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:20,966
Sure.

396
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,125
You're up quite early.

397
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,846
Where is your phone?

398
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:27,846
In the dorm, charging.

399
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:30,806
You didn't bring your phone?

400
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:33,566
You can search.

401
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:39,526
What time is it?

402
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:40,726
4:30 PM.

403
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,165
Tell Zhu Yangqi

404
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,526
that we're together

405
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,085
and he can get to me through you.

406
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:51,045
When Zhu Yangqi contacts you,
you want your phone.

407
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,566
When I contact you,
your phone is charging.

408
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:55,205
Are you tired of me?

409
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:58,766
You actually asked that?

410
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,045
You would tire first if we were to.

411
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:13,806
What's with your mouth?

412
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:16,606
Got hit while playing.

413
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:26,085
Can you play basketball?

414
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,205
Not really.

415
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,365
What about shooting?

416
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:29,766
Not really either.

417
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:33,005
Let's have a shootout of ten.

418
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:34,406
If you win,

419
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,486
I'll grant you a request.

420
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:41,926
Do you want to lose or win?

421
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:44,886
Of course, I want to win.

422
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:46,766
I'll spot you four goals.

423
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,446
Ten for me, and six for you.

424
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:50,285
I advise you to give up.

425
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:53,325
I won't.

426
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,486
At least make an effort.

427
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:03,526
Otherwise, it'd make me look easy.

428
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:05,886
Are you serious?

429
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:11,446
(Would you like to grab a meal?)

430
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:13,165
(To thank you in person before I go.)

431
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:19,325
If you are going to him,

432
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,566
don't come to me again anymore.

433
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:28,766
I'm done wasting time.

434
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:29,846
That's it for us.

435
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,405
You saw him yesterday?

436
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,365
Do you really think that way?

437
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,325
I thought you knew me.

438
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:57,405
Come on.

439
00:23:58,686 --> 00:23:59,766
I admit defeat.

440
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,926
If someone really pursues me,

441
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:04,045
wouldn't you just cheer them on?

442
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,925
If you truly care about me,

443
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:09,045
would you do that,

444
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,125
Xu Zhi?

445
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:14,165
It's okay that you gave him a tour
of the campus.

446
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,686
But you should have told me.

447
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:17,966
What am I to you?

448
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:21,005
What do you think you're to me?

449
00:24:24,285 --> 00:24:26,085
Don't you know
I have no feelings for him?

450
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:28,486
But he cares about you.

451
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:29,926
He has feelings for you.

452
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:31,886
Do you know what I would do

453
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:33,005
if Gu Yan came today?

454
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:36,005
I would never meet her
without telling you.

455
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:55,686
Xu Zhi, you're not someone
who can't say no.

456
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,846
You just don't care about my feelings.

457
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:10,552
If that's the case, forget it.

Xu Zhi.

482
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:44,205
Here, milk tea.

483
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:46,646
I can't drink anymore.

484
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:48,445
Chen Luzhou asked me to bring it to you.

485
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:50,245
Chen Luzhou?

486
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,365
His captain was handing out milk tea
to the team

487
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,886
and asked him if he wanted some.

488
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:57,045
He said no at first

489
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,245
but took one in the end.

490
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:03,766
I have to go.

491
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:19,445
Finally got through.

492
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:21,526
I called Chen Luzhou all afternoon.

493
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,125
I almost thought
you two vanished into thin air.

494
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:26,486
He is playing basketball
and didn't bring his phone.

495
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:29,205
Okay. I'm glad he's still alive.

496
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,606
Are you busy now?

497
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:32,365
I'm right beside your school.

498
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:34,325
If you're free, let's have a meal.

499
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:45,606
Zhi, let's start eating first

500
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:46,686
and not wait for him.

501
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:47,926
I'm starving.

502
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,325
Are you sure?

503
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,806
Who knows when he'll be done?

504
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:54,445
I'm telling you.

505
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,726
Guys take forever
after playing basketball.

506
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:59,486
They need to shower, fix their hair,
and get changed.

507
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:01,445
It takes hours at least.

508
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:02,966
Let's eat first.

509
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:03,807
You're here.

510
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:05,325
So he'll definitely come.

511
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:06,526
No, he won't.

512
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:08,886
Is he still being jealous?

513
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,085
Did he tell you?

514
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:11,205
Yes.

515
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,926
Last night, I drank with him until dawn.

516
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,686
Didn't he go at around 4 AM

517
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,085
to have breakfast with you?

518
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:19,445
I thought he figured it out himself.

519
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,005
I didn't know.

520
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:23,646
I didn't know he came to see me.

521
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:25,285
I stayed up late last night.

522
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:26,606
So I overslept in the morning.

523
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:29,365
That's bad.

524
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:33,566
He was upset
and went to have breakfast with you.

525
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:36,085
But in the end, he waited all morning

526
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:37,886
and never saw you.

527
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:39,325
He must be more upset now.

528
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,005
What should I do?

529
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,085
Zhi, I...

530
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:55,085
I'm just telling you this.

531
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:57,245
Don't mention it to him later.

532
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:58,487
Because I...

533
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,165
I haven't shared these thoughts
with him.

534
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,245
Go ahead.

535
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,526
Chen Luzhou

536
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:04,766
appears to be carefree,

537
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:05,886
caring about nothing.

538
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:07,686
But when it comes to you,

539
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,245
he cares a lot.

540
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,646
He knows
you have no feelings for Tan Xu.

541
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,085
But Tan Xu

542
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:17,285
spent two years with you.

543
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,566
You studied and progressed together.

544
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,205
While Chen Luzhou

545
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:23,245
has only known you for a few months.

546
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:26,526
And most of the time you were apart.

547
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,045
I know.

548
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,806
He has

549
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,566
very high standards for himself.

550
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:35,365
Whatever it is, he forces himself

551
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:36,445
to do his best.

552
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:38,566
Sometimes I even think

553
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:41,205
he's quite stubborn.

554
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:45,045
But I know he does that
because he doesn't have

555
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,526
much sense of security.

556
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,005
Actually, as his friends,
we often tease him,

557
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,486
saying he's a mama's boy

558
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:54,566
or something like that.

559
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,445
But actually

560
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:58,966
he's never spoiled enough
to act wishfully.

561
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:02,325
In elementary school,

562
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:03,606
he ranked top in the class.

563
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:05,245
But his mom believed

564
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:06,766
it was nothing to be top in class.

565
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:10,125
In the middle school entrance exam,
he topped the city.

566
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:13,445
He listened to his parents

567
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:15,085
to transfer schools or go abroad.

568
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:17,405
(He keeps adapting to new environments.)

569
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:20,285
(Although he went through all this,)

570
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,245
(he never told us.)

571
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:23,806
(He digested)

572
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:25,125
(all the bad emotions alone.)

573
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:28,926
(Actually, in these few months
he disappeared,)

574
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:30,966
(a lot happened.)

575
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,846
(In Ruicheng, he nearly died.)

576
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:37,405
(Upon his return,
his parents got a divorce.)

577
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:39,926
(Although he's said nothing,)

578
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:42,566
(every step he takes)

579
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:44,806
(is an effort toward you.)

580
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:47,806
(I only found out recently as well)

581
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:49,646
(that the night we had a gathering,)

582
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,846
(he secretly took your black hair tie)

583
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:54,405

No, I don't have the experience.

646
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,125
Lucy said he wants you to feed him.

00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,205

have a curfew?

652
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:01,405
I remember it's 0:00.

653
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:02,205
It does?

654
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:03,285

656
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,285
The school gate is closed at 0:00.

657
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,926

00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:17,846

this room's available till 6 AM.

00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:49,205
Luzhou is so hard to deal with.

666
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:50,566
I've known Zhi for years.

667
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:52,806
I've never seen her
be so humble to anyone.

668
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:54,045
If you put it that way,

669
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,965
Lucy has never been so upset before.

670
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:56,766
Alright?

671
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:57,326
He's

672
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,085
been so stifled these past few months.

673
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:00,646
He can let it out a bit.

674
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:02,085
Lucy blah blah.

675
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:08,005
Letting it out is fine,
but there should be a limit.

676
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,085
Right?

677
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:10,006
I think this time,

678
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,365
Lucy has indeed been a bit dramatic.

679
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:18,526
When I called you that day
after getting drunk,

680
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:20,085
did I say anything wrong?

681
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,806
What do you think?

682
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,205
- Water, Lucy.
- I'll go buy some.

683
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:36,726

00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:52,405
Hello?

Is this the host, the lovely Ms. Cai?

690
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:59,405
Are you drunk?

691
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:00,366
Yingying,

692
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:03,566
do you prefer muscular or skinny men?

693
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:07,005
Can you at least give me a goal?

694
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,365
Gaining muscle is hard enough.

695
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:10,766
I also need to lose fat.

696
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:13,245
I really can't take it anymore.

697
00:37:14,486 --> 00:37:15,606
Stylish Zhu,

698
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:17,205
you don't need to change.

699
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:19,205
You're fine as you are now.

700
00:37:20,886 --> 00:37:21,886
Wait.

701
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:24,445
I can also beatbox. Do you like it?

702
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:41,846
I'm really sorry

703
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,926

704
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,125
That's it?

705
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:45,846
Also, I promise

706
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:47,285
I'll control myself.

707
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,566

00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,447

711
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:03,606
