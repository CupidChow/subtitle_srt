(Send Waitlist Admission File)

19
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:27,913
It's a confession.

20
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:29,153
Look.

21
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:30,793
A guy is confessing downstairs.

22
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,433
He's so brave.

23
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:38,233
Come on. I can't believe

24
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,793
he will confess with flowers

25
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,913
and a loudspeaker.

26
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:42,032
So corny.

27
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:42,992
What?

28
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,833
Xu Zhi.

29
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:44,472
Look.

30
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,793
A guy is confessing, holding flowers.

31
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,072
It's so outdated.

32
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,152
What's worse, it's a moral abduction.

33
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:53,433
It's fine
if the boy and girl like each other.

34
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,793
If the girl doesn't like the boy,

35
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:56,152
she'll be put on the spot.

36
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:57,192
It's so awkward.

37
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:59,233
If I were the girl,

38
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,592
I'd be so embarrassed.

39
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:03,672
I can't stand it.

40
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:08,793
Xu Zhi, the Architecture freshman,

41
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:11,353
I'm a Humanities student.

42
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:12,152
Xu Zhi.

43
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:12,953
Let me see.

44
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,192
Turns out the girl
he's confessing to is you.

45
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:15,913
Right now,

46
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,472
I want to use a poem

47
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:18,873
to express my feelings for you.

48
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,672
A poem.

49
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,192
I am

50
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,472
a desperate person.

51
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:30,753
Come back.

52
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,833
Alright, stop looking.

53
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,472
Get inside.

54
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:34,472
Wait a moment.

55
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:35,552
I'm grabbing my clothes.

56
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,112
I remember what you looked last fall.

57
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:39,673
Sorry.

58
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:40,793
A gray beret.

59
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:42,233
Si, I'm going down.

60
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:45,152
Hello, Dad.

61
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:46,592
Hello, Zhi.

62
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:48,873
How's your leg?

63
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:50,192
Much better.

64
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:51,353
It doesn't hurt anymore.

65
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:54,793
If it hurts again, don't ignore it.

66
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:57,032
You must go to the hospital
for a check-up.

67
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:59,313
On the barren land of mine,

68
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:04,273
you are my last rose.

69
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:09,632
Whose voice is that?

70
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:12,353
Pretty loud, huh?

71
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:15,713
A new suitor?

72
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,472
Is he handsome?

73
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,833
Which department?

74
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,353
I don't know or care.

75
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,992
Besides, can he be
as handsome as Chen Luzhou?

76
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:25,353
Why compare the new guy with him?

77
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:26,953
Get a new one.

78
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:28,873
No, I don't.

79
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,273
As a student of the Chinese department,
he's reciting

80
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,472
someone else's poems.

81
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,713
Not every place has romantic poets.

82
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,032
That's right.

83
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,913
Young people now
can't write better poetry

84
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,472
than those in my day.

85
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,833
You know what?

86
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:44,273
Mr. Fu was once a renowned poet

87
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:45,833
in our city.

88
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,033
Although I don't know

89
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,512
whether he wrote those poems

90
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:49,992
or copied someone else's,

91
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:53,032
he certainly enchanted

92
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,512
a lot of artistic young women.

93
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:57,632
You mean after Chen Luzhou gets old,

94
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,313
he will be like Mr. Fu?

95
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:01,953
It's possible.

96
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:04,353
Then I should seriously
find a new boyfriend here.

97
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,913
I'll keep my options open.

98
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:07,592
Here you go.

99
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:08,992
If you think that way,

100
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,512
I'll feel relieved.

101
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:12,713
Alright, I'm hanging up.

102
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:13,816
Okay then.

103
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:14,472
For you,

104
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:19,072
I sing.

105
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:20,753
Enough.

106
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,753
Stop shouting.

107
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,152
I am Xu Zhi's roommate.

108
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,192
You like Xu Zhi?

109
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:31,713
So far,

110
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,632
there have been some guys
pursuing Xu Zhi.

111
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:34,512
Listen.

112
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:35,753
You go back.

113
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,833
I'll get you in line.

114
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:37,873
How about No. 8?

115
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:38,873
Waiting in line?

116
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,072
Wait, it depends on feelings.

117
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,393
It's all about fate,

118
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:43,913
not who comes first.

119
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,992
You are quite confident.

120
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,672
Have you heard of Jiang Yu?

121
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,953
The sophomore
from the philosophy department...

122
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,672
The hottest guy
in the Humanities Academy.

123
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,353
He's in line too.

124
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,632
Alright.

125
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,873
Stop it and go.

126
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:01,512
Get out of here.

127
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:02,793
Get out of here.

128
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:03,793
He's leaving?

129
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:05,953
In our school,

130
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,753
there are three boys to one girl.

131
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:09,032
It's out of proportion.

132
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:11,433
Girls like you are definitely

133
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:12,992
in high demand.

134
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:14,072
Please.

135
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:16,273
But don't think of

136
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:17,273
that loudspeaker guy.

137
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,112
What about Jiang Yu?

138
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,112
Do you like him?

139
00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:21,833
No, absolutely not.

140
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,913
I don't have any feelings for him.

141
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,273
Besides, I don't want to date now.

142
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:27,632
What did I miss?

143
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:28,833
Hey.

144
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:29,673
Don't you think

145
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,753
Jiang Yu and Xu Zhi make a great couple?

146
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:33,433
- And he's so handsome.
- Yes.

147
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:35,953
I really have no feelings for him.

148
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:37,672
Besides, I don't want to date now.

149
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:38,592
Tell me.

150
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,471
Do you already like someone

151
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,472
secretly?

152
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,833
I dated someone
after high school graduation.

153
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,753
But we broke up some time ago.

154
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:51,192
Now, I'm focused on my studies

155
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,433
to serve my country.

156
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,953
These are my boyfriends
for the next four years.

157
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:58,192
What?

158
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,753
You dated before?

159
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:02,112
Oh my, what kind of guy was he?

160
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,192
Tell us about him.

161
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:04,552
I'm so curious.

162
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:05,913
What kind of person can

163
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,472
win you over?

164
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,512
A super hot guy.

165
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:12,713
- A hot guy?
- A hot guy?

166
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:15,632
That's it?

167
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:19,072
It's actually very subjective

168
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,112
to judge a person's looks.

169
00:07:20,393 --> 00:07:21,433
For example,

170
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:22,672
I really think

171
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:24,072
Jiang Yu is handsome.

172
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,953
But you don't think so.

173
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,233
Moreover,
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

174
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,632
Maybe her ex-boyfriend

175
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:31,632
isn't handsome at all.

176
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,353
Then, there's nothing I can say.

177
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,032
It could be my personal problem.

178
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,793
In my opinion, in today's world,

179
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,873
bad guys are everywhere.

180
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:43,112
Especially handsome guys.

181
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:44,632
But I think

182
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,273
Jiang Yu is very reliable.

183
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,353
- I know.
- Yeah.

184
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,353
Really.

185
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,112
You should try hanging out with him.

186
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,472
He's a good singer.

187
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:52,992
How romantic.

188
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:53,713
I know!

189
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:54,992
How romantic is he?

190
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:56,552
Like swinging on a toilet seat?

191
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:00,433
I didn't expect this from you, Xu Zhi.

192
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,913
(Free this Sunday, Artist?)

193
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:10,833
I asked for you,

194
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,833
and he said yes.

195
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:13,992
Swinging on a toilet seat.

196
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,112
Jiang Yu's free this weekend.

197
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:18,072
Let's not.

198
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,553
It's quite difficult.

199
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,593
I think it's okay.

200
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,473
Alright, let's wash up.

201
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:37,992
These past two months,

202
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,833
I've eaten with you guys quite a lot.

203
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:42,593
Both you and Lucy aren't here now,

204
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:45,913
so it's my first time
having a meal alone with Zhi.

205
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,553
It feels a bit strange.

206
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,432
Don't overthink it.

207
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,072
Zhi must miss Chen Luzhou a lot.

208
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,312
But she doesn't

209
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,992
want to contact him actively.

210
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:57,673
That's why she asked you out
to catch up.

211
00:08:58,553 --> 00:08:59,553
That's it.

212
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:00,992
True.

213
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,032
However, in my opinion,

214
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,152
they'll make up eventually.

215
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:06,992
Although both Zhi and Lucy

216
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,432
look carefree on the surface,

217
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,352
actually

218
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,392
they haven't let go at all.

219
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:20,352
Look, I've worked out quite well, right?

220
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:21,753
Look at my biceps.

221
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:23,953
Stylish Zhu, move aside a bit.

222
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:26,392
Let me see the one behind you.

223
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:28,953
Right.

224
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,112
Fine.

225
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,713
Not bad.

226
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,312
Bye, I need to train.

227
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,072
- Bye.
- Why hang up?

228
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:52,112
Hey.

229
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:53,112
Zhi.

230
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:54,352
Let's go.

231
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,032
This place is really good.

232
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:57,392
I booked a private room.

233
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:57,992
Here.

234
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,953
Hello, this way please.

235
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:04,673
I'm starving.

236
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:09,673
Let me see the menu.

237
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:10,312
Here.

238
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,312
Okay.

239
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:13,873
Thank you.

240
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:16,232
Trust me.

241
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,112
One sashimi platter, please.

242
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,992
And then two eel rice bowls, please.

243
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:22,793
Alright.

244
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:23,873
Please wait a moment.

245
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,192
You've been working out?

246
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,793
Isn't it obvious?

247
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:31,432
I'm not bragging.

248
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,192
Others work out for a year

249
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,432
and still can't reach my level.

250
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:35,673
It took me only a month

251
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:37,673
to undergo a new transformation.

252
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:38,513
See that?

253
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:39,593
Yes.

254
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,112
Well...

255
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:42,873
Can you change back?

256
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:45,593
The way you are now is a bit

257
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:46,873
too much.

258
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:48,793
Too...

259
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:50,432
Why is that?

260
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,473
Even Cai Yingying said

261
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,272
that guys with pecs

262
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,272
make her feel secure.

263
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:57,513
Here's the thing.

264
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,032
The standard

265
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,633
for guys and girls about muscles

266
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:01,633
are different.

267
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,673
We like the kind
that looks slim in clothes

268
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:04,673
yet defined naked.

269
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,513
It seems most girls don't like it when

270
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,992
a guy's chest is bigger than theirs.

271
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,272
They find it quite unattractive.

272
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:15,553
Then I

273
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:16,953
shouldn't bulk up.

274
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:17,953
I need to lost weight.

275
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:19,713
Waiter,

276
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:20,913
cancel the eel rice.

277
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:21,713
Alright.

278
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,833
Thank you.

279
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,352
Do you miss him?

280
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:36,593
I got your message yesterday,

281
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,873
and knew you somewhat missed him.

282
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,352
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have reached out to me.

283
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,152
Thank you.

284
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:03,992
This is quite strong.

285
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:18,593
Come quickly!

286
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,833
Why?

287
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:22,112
Try it.

288
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,992
Try what?

289
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:27,232
Here you go.

290
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:29,673
What's this?

291
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,072
This is my grandma's
homemade liquor, look.

292
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:33,834
It's very tasty.

293
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,072
Drinking in broad daylight?

294
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:37,513
You know what?

295
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:38,473
Dad won't even let

296
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,474
Mr. Cai have a sip.

297
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:41,112
I stole it, so give it a try.

298
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:49,953
Is it good?

299
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:54,264
You...

300
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:55,753
Are you messing with me?

301
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,992
Don't pinch my face.

302
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,513
If it swells up, then it's your fault.

303
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,152
Fine, my fault.

304
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:02,593
You dare talk about responsibility.

305
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,072
You take responsibility
for kissing me that much?

306
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:06,833
I don't have to.

307
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,232
Why not?

308
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:09,953
Because I said so.

309
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:11,392
You take a sip. It's not good.

310
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:16,072
Actually,

311
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:20,072
I've been in Beijing this long,

312
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,553
but I'm hesitant to contact you.

313
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:23,152
Mainly, I'm afraid

314
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,152
you'll think of him when you see me.

315
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:31,593
Why are you staring at me like that?

316
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:33,392
See if I can remember him.

317
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:40,593
I heard there's a handsome guy

318
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:41,593
named Jiang Yu.

319
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:43,553
Is he as handsome as me?

320
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,992
How do you know Jiang Yu?

321
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:47,513
I have informants.

322
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,312
How many informants

323
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:56,192
did Chen Luzhou deploy around me?

324
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:57,793
Did he ask you to spy on me?

325
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:58,793
Your dishes.

326
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:09,312
No.

327
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:12,633
When your grades came out,
he knew you'd go to Huaguang.

328
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:13,794
So, he asked me

329
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,713
to keep an eye on you,

330
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,112
lest you be bullied.

331
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,833
It's not spying.

332
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:20,953
So, how exactly is Jiang Yu?

333
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,553
Is he as handsome as Lucy?

334
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,112
What exactly does he mean?

335
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,032
Xu Zhi, don't take me wrong.

336
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:32,232
He doesn't mean anything.

337
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,392
He really just wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

338
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,112
He's just afraid you'll be bullied.

339
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:37,992
He also said

340
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,873
you could even date other people.

341
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:51,272
Xu Zhi,

342
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:52,673
let me tell you.

343
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,192
I think,

344
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:57,032
constantly looking
for his shadow in others

345
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:58,152
really isn't good.

346
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,112
Why not

347
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,112
try getting into a relationship?

348
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:07,953
After all, Lucy is abroad,

349
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,513
and won't be back soon.

350
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,232
I think you

351
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,432
can't keep dragging it out like this.

352
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:22,473
You're right.

353
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:38,433
Where's Mr. Handsome?

354
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:39,553
Where?

355
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:40,192
There.

356
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:40,753
Which one?

357
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:41,313
Over there.

358
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:42,873
- He's really handsome.
- Cute.

359
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:44,633
He's so handsome.

360
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,634
If models were like this,

361
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,432
then I'd come to art class every day.

362
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:49,793
When did he arrive?

363
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,072
Really handsome.

364
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:54,992
You're finally here.

365
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:57,833
You're back this soon.

366
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:01,833
Are you back as a model?

367
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:02,633
No.

368
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:04,232
They said this is your spot.

369
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,352
So, I was waiting here.

370
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:08,473
So handsome.

371
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,673
He isn't a model.

372
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,112
This is my bro, Lucy.

373
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:15,713
He finally came back
from Europe to see me.

374
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,432
Since you're here, let's go eat.

375
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:20,673
But you have class.

376
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,152
You're more important.

377
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:23,553
He left.

378
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:24,432
Better at drawing?

379
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:25,673
Tell me about it.

380
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,312
Not a model?

381
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,833
I haven't seen enough yet.

382
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:35,032
Aren't you working out?

383
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:36,032
Have some meat

384
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:37,032
to gain weight.

385
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,312
I don't need to gain weight.

386
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:39,312
I need to lose weight.

387
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:40,473
I have to eat greens.

388
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,352
You're losing weight eating skewers?

389
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,793
What else then?

390
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:44,793
Eat salad every day?

391
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:46,032
How bland that is.

392
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:48,553
Just like today's lunch.

393
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,753
The Japanese food Xu Zhi and I ate was

394
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:53,232
so expensive and yet tasteless.

395
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,192
You haven't seen Xu Zhi yet, have you?

396
00:16:59,713 --> 00:17:01,192
She didn't mention you earlier.

397
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,192
I went to Huaguang University.

398
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,833
But I didn't tell her.

399
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,473
Why not?

400
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,473
I took the waitlist admission test.

401
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:13,473
But the results are not out yet.

402
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,513
Before the results are confirmed,

403
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:16,793
I don't want her to know.

404
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:18,633
Waitlist admission?

405
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,593
You don't have to leave then?

406
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:22,992
Nice.

407
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,392
Hold on.

408
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,593
Did your family agree?

409
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:30,432
Didn't you always say
I was a mama's boy?

410
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,793
From today on, I'll listen to no one

411
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,432
but myself.

412
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,192
Nice.

413
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,713
Good for you.

414
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:40,192
Right now,

415
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,633
you dare to say no to your mom.

416
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:44,072
That's how it should be.

417
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:45,553
Bro, give me a hug.

418
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:47,032
You're crazy.

419
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,272
Come on.

420
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,272
Get off.

421
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,072
Wait a minute, you...

422
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:57,992
Got some girl stuff after going abroad?

423
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:58,992
What's this?

424
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:00,072
Why do you care?

425
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,272
Is it Xu Zhi's?

426
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,793
Lucy.

427
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:05,833
You're not a mama's boy now.

428
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,473
You're lovesick.

429
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:08,754
Anyway,

430
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,152
my return must be kept a secret.

431
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,392
Don't let it slip to Cai Yingying.

432
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,473
Lucy.

433
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:29,793
As for Xu Zhi, I can keep it secret.

434
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:30,953
However,

435
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,833
I think you living alone

436
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,833
is a bit too lonely.

437
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:34,913
Here.

438
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:36,392
I'll stay with you.

439
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:39,072
We can chat

440
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,072
like we used to.

441
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:47,873
Alright, it's just that...

442
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:48,794
My roommate

443
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,032
really drives me crazy.

444
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:53,593
He doesn't shower
or wash his feet every day.

445
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:54,713
He has smelly feet,

446
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:55,713
and puts it near my head.

447
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,633
I can't stand it.

448
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:57,713
I'm almost breaking down.

449
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:00,312
We split the utility bills.

450
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:03,753
Come on, eat up.

451
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,112
It's on me, alright?

452
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:06,633
Waiter,

453
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,352
more dishes.

454
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,473
Alright.

455
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:10,473
Come on.

456
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,232
See what more you'd like to eat.

457
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,633
Xu Zhi, how is it?

458
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:27,753
Isn't it just a class?

459
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:29,953
This is Professor Wang's class.

460
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:31,873
Many people fail calculus each year.

461
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:33,033
You never know.

462
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,312
This might

463
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,553
hold me back from graduating.

464
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,392
I want to give him a good impression.

465
00:19:37,513 --> 00:19:38,633
I think it's unlikely.

466
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,312
You look like you're selling insurance.

467
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,513
Xu Zhi.

468
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,713
I'm going to be angry.

469
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,072
It's Professor Wang's class.

470
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,513
You two still dare to be late?

471
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,112
In our freshman year,

472
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,473
we wouldn't even eat lunch.

473
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,553
We'd go straight
to the classroom and wait.

474
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,432
Professor Wang is that harsh?

475
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,312
Wang is a man of character.

476
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,953
Unless you are really capable,

477
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:04,673
you don't need him for
the key points for the final exam.

478
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,352
Otherwise, watch your attitude.

479
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,833
He might just fail you directly.

480
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,832
Let's hurry up, don't be late.

481
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:12,633
Go, quickly!

482
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,232
Run faster.

483
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,352
If Xu Zhi is asked
for WeChat on the way,

484
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:17,352
you'll be late for sure.

485
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,392
Go.

486
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:34,953
Jiang Yu asked me to save seats for you.

487
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:35,593
Thank you.

488
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:36,953
You're welcome.

489
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:42,992
Senior Jiang Yu?

490
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,392
When were you guys a thing?

491
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:45,392
You didn't even tell me.

492
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:46,794
Tell your boyfriend

493
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,112
to save a seat in the front row.

494
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,992
Impression points, you know.

495
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,032
He's not my boyfriend.

496
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,072
Next time, let's come earlier.

497
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,352
Sorry, I couldn't save seats.

498
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,152
It's okay.

499
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:57,352
Class begin.

500
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:58,553
Hello, guys.

501
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:01,833
Hello, sir.

502
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,032
Please open to page 27 of the book.

503
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:07,793
This question...

504
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:11,112
Xu Gongzhu,

505
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,272
please answer this question.

506
00:21:22,152 --> 00:21:24,152
Same order but not equivalent,
infinitesimal.

507
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,432
That's right.

508
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:29,473
This is the topic

509
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,352
we need to learn this class.

510
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,312
It seems some students

511
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,112
have done their preparation carefully.

512
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:36,673
In my class,

513
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,192
I hope everyone will prepare diligently.

514
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,032
Please sit down.

515
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,192
I'll definitely fail.

516
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:45,992
Will I not be able to graduate?

517
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,432
It's okay if you
don't know the prep material.

518
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:49,873
Do you know it then?

519
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,272
Figures.

520
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:58,072
I heard other departments
have additional enrollment slots.

521
00:21:58,232 --> 00:21:59,992
They've missed
a month's worth of classes.

522
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:01,953
I'm afraid everyone will pass,
except me.

523
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,072
That won't do.

524
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:03,953
No.

525
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,392
I must pass.

526
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:06,432
I can't fail.

527
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:07,273
I'm begging.

528
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:08,553
I can't fail.

529
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,152
You can do it.

530
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:13,192
He definitely remembers me.

531
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:14,913
What should I do?

532
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,432
Lift your foot.

533
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:18,793
No, your butt.

534
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:19,992
You might as well get up.

535
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:24,593
Alright.

536
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,593
What's this?

537
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:26,953
Lucky color.

538
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:29,432
You'll definitely make it.

539
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:45,752
(College Entrance Examination Results)

540
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:51,553
Wait.

541
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:52,873
There's something.

542
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,112
Everything goes well.

543
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,633
Hold on a moment.

544
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,192
There's another thing.

545
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,913
May all your wishes come true.

546
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:11,768
Is there more?

547
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:13,232
If not, I'm going to check.

548
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:14,673
Go ahead.

549
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:24,032
How is it?

550
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:27,953
How is it? Tell me!

551
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:31,633
Say something!

552
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:35,793
No good?

553
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:37,793
Impossible.

554
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,224
(Successful)

555
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:44,793
You made it.

556
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,992
I'm more nervous
checking your grades than my own.

557
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,633
Stop with this in the future, Lucy.

558
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,232
My heart can't take it.

559
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,753
You can finally tell Zhi now.

560
00:23:57,953 --> 00:23:58,953
No rush.

561
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:01,112
Let me finish my current work first.

562
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:03,593
You got into Huaguang University, bro.

563
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:05,312
Why are you still working?

564
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,112
Let's go have a good meal to celebrate.

565
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:08,793
I got into Huaguang University.

566
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,432
Will you pay my tuition?

567
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:12,793
Oh, right.

568
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:14,192
I won't be back this noon.

569
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,312
You handle lunch yourself.

570
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:16,713
Alright.

571
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:18,112
Then take care, bye.

572
00:24:18,713 --> 00:24:19,713
Okay.

573
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:24,953
To challenge Her Majesty,

574
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,553
you're actually supporting yourself.

575
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,913
Even paying your college fee.

576
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:29,913
Lucy, oh Lucy,

577
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,953
you're simply too impressive.

578
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:36,593
Hurry.

579
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:37,593
Be careful.

580
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:38,593
Go.

581
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,152
Oh, my gosh,

582
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:40,873
raining this hard?

583
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:41,754
This weather changes.

584
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:42,793
Such terrible weather.

585
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:43,992
I'm all wet.

586
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:48,593
Where's my phone?

587
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:50,793
Good that it's raining.

588
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,072
The client wants a shot
of the mountain lodge.

589
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:54,272
Who'll go for it?

590
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:55,913
A 500 bonus for one shot.

591
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:57,954
Only 500?

592
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,032
500 for a shot?

593
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:00,392
Must go to the mountain top.

594
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:01,273
It's slippery.

595
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:02,713
It won't cover the medical expenses.

596
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,914
- Should be 5,000.
- Yeah.

597
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:05,112
500 for one shot.

598
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:06,593
That's too cheap.

599
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:08,553
I'll go.

600
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,032
Eager to show off this young.

601
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,513
- Exactly.
- Can you believe it?

602
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:15,392
What's he after?

603
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:16,793
He looks like a rich kid.

604
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:17,553
See his clothes?

605
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,553
Exactly.

606
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:21,392
They're all designer brands.

607
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:24,192
He even competes for 500.

608
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:25,473
He's here for the thrill.

609
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:26,753
500 can't cover dry-cleaning.

610
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:27,953
Yeah.

611
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,793
Interested in joining
the student council?

612
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,833
With a personality like yours,

613
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,272
you'd be perfect for the presidency.

614
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:42,392
When departments start to fight,

615
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:44,032
someone needs to oversee the situation.

616
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:45,272
You can definitely

617
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:46,272
handle it.

618
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:47,593
Forget it.

619
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:49,753
We've been having late night meetings.

620
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:50,753
My head hurts.

621
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:52,232
There isn't any important work.

622
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,793
I still have to report daily.

623
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:54,873
Too formalistic.

624
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:57,152
I wouldn't have joined any department.

625
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:00,873
Alright.

626
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:02,793
What's up?

627
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:03,793
Not doing anything.

628
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:04,992
Snatching people for you.

629
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:12,312
Why are you avoiding me?

630
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,392
You stepped on my shadow.

631
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,992
Okay.

632
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,232
I'll walk behind you.

633
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,713
Now you step on me.

634
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,152
I have something to do, bye.

635
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:47,593
Are you going home

636
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:48,913
for National Day?

637
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:51,072
Do you need me for any work?

638
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:53,513
There's something.

639
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:54,713
It's fine if you go home.

640
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:57,913
It's just after the holiday,

641
00:26:57,913 --> 00:27:00,432
the competition arrangements
haven't been settled yet.

642
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,633
Basketball and photography contests.

643
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,633
Art exhibitions and more.

644
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,032
Our posters are outdated.

645
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:10,513
There are some edits

646
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,953
that are not yet completed.

647
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:13,873
If you're not going home,

648
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,392
I'd like you to work overtime.

649
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:17,513
Is that okay?

650
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,473
Then leave the key with me.

651
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:21,713
I'll join you.

652
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:22,353
After that,

653
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:23,833
I'll take you to a concert.

654
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:26,593
No.

655
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:28,152
My bestie is visiting.

656
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:29,192
I have to stay with her.

657
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:30,432
Probably can't work.

658
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:33,392
What about the concert then?

659
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:37,873
Actually, Senior,

660
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:39,192
I added you on WeChat

661
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:41,473
because your profile picture
looks like a friend of mine.

662
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:42,913
I thought it was him.

663
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,312
Also, I don't intend to date.

664
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,312
Profile picture?

665
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,473
Is it your ex-boyfriend
from high school?

666
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,473
Yes.

667
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,553
What kind of person is he?

668
00:27:58,192 --> 00:27:59,753
You still haven't blacklisted him.

669
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:01,913
He's a punk.

670
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:22,272
Your new Beijing number.

671
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:23,272
Where did you buy it?

672
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,392
There's a business office
next to No.2 canteen.

673
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:39,953
How much left?

674
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,112
Gonna finish it tonight?

675
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:43,513
I have to pull an all-nighter
and finish it.

676
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:46,432
Our department has a lot of chores.

677
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:48,072
I can't even study.

678
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:50,192
No worries, I'm with you.

679
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,753
We'll fight till dawn.

680
00:29:57,152 --> 00:29:58,953
It shouldn't be that serious.

681
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,232
You're spreading anxiety.

682
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:03,072
What do you know?

683
00:30:03,432 --> 00:30:06,473
Late-night snacks are the best.

684
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:08,753
Come on, cheers.

685
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:09,753
Cheers!

686
00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:15,753
Keep it up!

687
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:27,713
(Today's Media)
Send this to Finance.

688
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,152
Hello, boss.

689
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:47,072
Not bad.

690
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,513
Caught on quickly.

691
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:50,473
Thanks to you for this shoot.

692
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,633
Everyone, take a look.

693
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:56,673
Chen is already leaving

694
00:30:57,032 --> 00:30:58,713
but still works diligently.

695
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:01,152
If everyone could be like him,

696
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,432
then our company

697
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,352
would grow strong.

698
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:06,232
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

699
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:09,232
Chen.

700
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:11,753
The company lacks talents like you.

701
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:13,793
You're welcome to come back.

702
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:15,793
For future outsourcing gigs,

703
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:17,192
you'll be my No.1 option.

704
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:18,513
Thank you, boss.

705
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,073
You need to pay me

706
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:21,232
for this project.

707
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:22,713
And my bonus, 500.

708
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:25,873
Absolutely.

709
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:26,873

Disturbing people this early.

I'll call the police to arrest you.

752
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,112

753
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:10,272

00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:16,793
Wait.

758
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,593
How did you know about here?

759
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,473
Did you forget the admission brochure
you sent me?

760
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:26,152
Zhu, this is not bad.

761
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,473
This time I came to Beijing
for training.

762
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,112
I deliberately didn't tell you.

763
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:33,513
It's a surprise.

764
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:35,793
It is quite a surprise.

765
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:37,992
Quickly call Xu Zhi over.

766
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:39,152
I'll pretend to do delivery

767
00:34:39,152 --> 00:34:39,833
and surprise her.

768
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,833
Call her here?

769
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,232
No.

770
00:34:42,392 --> 00:34:43,473
Why not?

771
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:44,913
I said no.

772
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:46,953
What's wrong?

773
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:48,633
Drink some water, come on.

774
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:53,312
Two cups of instant noodles.

775
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:55,553
Come on.

776
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:00,032
You're in a relationship?

777
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:02,272
You!

778
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:04,192
No, this...

779
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:05,713
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

780
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:05,914
No.

781
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:07,513
It's inappropriate for me to be here.

782
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:08,513
Not at all.

783
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:10,593
Your girlfriend is back.

784
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:12,873
Not my...

785
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,232
Hurry up.

786
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,633
Why not lock the door, Zhu Yangqi?

787
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,473
Up so early today?

788
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:26,593
Chen Luzhou.

789
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:28,432
Cai Yingying?

790
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:32,913
Aren't you supposed to be abroad?

791
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,593
Don't tell Xu Zhi

792
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:40,873
that Lucy came back to Beijing.

793
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:42,953
How could that be possible?

794
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:44,392
Sisterhood comes before anything.

795
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,673
There are no secrets between us.

796
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:46,793
Cai Yingying.

797
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:47,793
Don't call her yet.

798
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:49,673
I'll tell her when the time is right.

799
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,072
Fine.

800
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:58,392
Then you better hurry up.

801
00:35:58,392 --> 00:35:59,392
I can't hold it in long.

802
00:36:00,312 --> 00:36:01,312
Thanks.

803
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:05,152
Since I did you a favor,

804
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:06,793
you help me with one too.

805
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:08,553
Me?

806
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:09,873
Sure.

807
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:11,713
I...

808
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,753
Thanks.

809
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:20,833
So you ask me out for no reason?

810
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:22,072
Of course.

811
00:36:22,072 --> 00:36:23,073
You treated me last time.

812
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:24,112
It's my turn now.

813
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,192
Can I have a hug?

814
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:28,953
Give a hug.

815
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:29,633
Just give a hug.

816
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:30,633
You hug.

817
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:31,713
I'll hug.

818
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:36,833
Are you okay?

819
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:38,032
You okay?

820
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:39,513
Zhi.

821
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:40,633
Yingying.

822
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:48,992
That hurts.

823
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:49,754
Stop it.

824
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,432
Went all this way to surprise a friend,

825
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:52,593
only to be horribly rejected.

826
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:53,753
Tell me, can I not feel hurt?

827
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:54,673
Let's go eat.

828
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:55,673
Let's go.

829
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,713
Wait for me.

830
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:00,232
I'm still here.

831
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:08,152
Zhi, you have no idea.

832
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,673
Repeating these classes
is simply unbearable.

833
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,032
It's harder than senior year.

834
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,432
Really?

835
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:16,192
Weren't you quite happy in senior year?

836
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,913
You really know how to chat.

837
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:21,873
Did I ever tell you

838
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,272
that Tan Xu and I are classmates?

839
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:25,713
How's he doing?

840
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:27,112
Not so well.

841
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:29,032
He didn't do well in the last mock exam.

842
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:31,112
His parents hurried to school
and scolded him,

843
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,352
saying he's worthless.

844
00:37:35,392 --> 00:37:37,072
So, his gaslighting

845
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,473
runs in the family?

846
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,192
So, you know,

847
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,833
people who are hateful are pathetic.

848
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:48,272
Does it still hurt?

849
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:50,392
It's much better now.

850
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:53,392
I twisted my ankle the other day.

851
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:55,473
My roommate brought me
a large bag of medicine.

852
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,633
She didn't know who sent it.

853
00:37:57,112 --> 00:37:58,992
There were a lot
of arthritis medicines inside.

854
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:00,473
I was thinking,

855
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:03,713
besides you and Dad, the only person

856
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,232
who knows about this is Chen Luzhou.

857
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,392
I thought he had gone back to Beijing.

858
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:12,312
I went looking in the rain.

859
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,192
Zhi, actually...

860
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,992
(Snitch.)

861
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:27,593
Actually, what?

862
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,272
Actually, I saw a saying online.

863
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:32,513
No matter

864
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:34,152
how far apart we are,

865
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,312
we'll meet as we expected.

866
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:37,633
So, you and Chen Luzhou

867
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:38,793
will definitely meet again.

868
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:40,312
I never said I wanted to see him.

869
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,720
By the way,

870
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:43,673
I'll text you my new number.

871
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,112
You've changed your number?

872
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:47,834
Didn't you say that you

873
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,432
were worried Luzhou would call you?

874
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:51,232
That's why
you never changed your number.

875
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:53,473
Done.

876
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:56,353
Nowadays,

877
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:58,112
it's easy to contact someone
if you want to.

878
00:38:58,272 --> 00:38:59,272
What do you mean?

879
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:01,432
You didn't give Chen Luzhou
your new number?

880
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,473
No.

881
00:39:04,232 --> 00:39:05,232
There's no need, right?

882
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:07,593
It's okay.

883
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:19,873
(Tell Chen Luzhou to hurry up.)

884
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,432
(Zhi is ready to move on.)

885
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:48,713
Zhao Tianqi.

886
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:49,793
Tianqi, let's go eat.

887
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:51,673
He's not here.

888
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,032
Hey, you...

889
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:59,192
Chen Luzhou!

890
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:00,753
Ke.

891
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:01,432
You...

892
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,513
What are you doing here?

893
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:04,992
I live here.

894
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,152
You, I...

895
00:40:06,432 --> 00:40:07,593
- I...
- You also live here?

896
00:40:12,992 --> 00:40:14,112
What's going on?

897
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,753
I didn't expect to see you this soon.

898
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:18,112
What do you mean?

899
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:20,033
Nothing.

900
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:22,112
I participated
in the waitlist admission test.

901
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:23,513
Public Administration.

902
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:25,953
Doesn't matter.

903
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:27,633
With your brain, you'll do great.

904
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:30,432
Wait a minute.

905
00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:33,873
You.

906
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,673
You came here without telling me?

907
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,352
Unbelievable.

908
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:40,112
My bad.

909
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:42,793
Have you eaten?

910
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:45,432
I need to tidy up first.

911
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,112
Tidy up for what? Let's go.

912
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,432
Soon there'll be nothing.

913
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:49,432
Let's go.

914
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:50,633
Hurry up.

915
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:53,833
(Reporting to Zhi,
here at the training school.)

916
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:56,673
Okay, we'll meet
during the National Day holiday.

917
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,513
On the way to the No.2 canteen,

918
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:00,793
many people were sizing him up.

919
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,793
Super handsome.

920
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,152
- Xu Zhi.
- Xu Zhi.

921
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:03,833
Come quick.

922
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,754
Me and Liu Yisi

923
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,833
saw a handsome guy.

924
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:06,953
Huh?

925
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:08,272
How handsome is he?

926
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,793
- Very.
- Extremely handsome.

927
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:11,432
All the girls outside the canteen

928
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:12,833
were secretly checking him up.

929
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:14,392
That Foreign Languages girl

930
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,713
even asked for his number.

931
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:17,992
I heard he's from Public Administration.

932
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:19,673
We'll be attending

933
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:21,152
Professor Wang's class together!

934
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:22,873
The class will be a big hit.

935
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:25,072
You two are so infatuated.

936
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:26,432
Don't forget to study,

937
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:27,553
or you won't graduate.

938
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:29,513
Einstein once said

939
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,793
admiring handsome guys is good for you.

940
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,753
That is very good for studying.

941
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,392
Really.

942
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:36,553
You haven't eaten yet?

943
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:38,633
Have a meeting later.

944
00:41:39,673 --> 00:41:40,753
Go to No.2 canteen.

945
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:42,553
He should be eating there.

946
