(Happy Birthday, Architect Xu)

18
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,616
Stop worrying about me.
Worry about yourself.

19
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:51,216
There is an emergency.

20
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:52,296
Over.

21
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,296
Put it down.

22
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,096
Gu Yan.

23
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:16,017
You're close to Chen Luzhou.

24
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:18,817
Is the thing between
her and Luzhou true or not?

25
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:19,817
What thing?

26
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,096
Of course, it's not true.

27
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:23,656
Rumors, don't believe that.

28
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:25,616
Don't believe that.

29
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:26,736
Stop being stubborn, Zhu.

30
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,256
It's spread at the WeChat group.

31
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:30,096
Besides,

32
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,136
if they're not dating,

33
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:33,417
then it's Gu Yan
having a crush on Chen Luzhou.

34
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,417
Is it possible?

35
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,216
A beauty is throwing herself at him.

36
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:37,216
Is it possible?

37
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,176
What's so good about Gu Yan?

38
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,017
She's in showbiz.

39
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,576
I heard most
of their private lives are...

40
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:46,377
I admit

41
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:47,616
she is good-looking.

42
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,937
But it's of no use.
She just has a pretty face.

43
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:52,576
Who likes a dumb woman, right?

44
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:53,857
Yingying,

45
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,857
do you know how to choose a man?

46
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:57,616
How?

47
00:02:58,337 --> 00:02:59,457
When choosing a man,

48
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:00,657
just see

49
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:01,977
if his bottom is perky.

50
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,377
People with perky bottom run fast.

51
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,897
If there's a discount
in the supermarket when they're old,

52
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:10,417
he will run ahead when grabbing eggs.

53
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:25,937
I disagree.

54
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:27,817
The men you just mentioned

55
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:28,817
are poor guys.

56
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:30,216
When wealthy men grow old,

57
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:31,656
do they need to run for eggs?

58
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,576
I usually assess a man by his chest.

59
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:37,296
Hugging a man
with a broad and solid chest

60
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,736
feels secure.

61
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,176
There's one more thing.

62
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,776
What other benefits
does a man with a big chest have?

63
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,457
I don't know.

64
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:47,457
I never hugged one.

65
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:50,576
Let me tell you.

66
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:54,256
He is especially attractive
while wearing a vacuum suit.

67
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,817
Being in a relationship

68
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:01,017
means facing the same face every day.

69
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:02,057
You will become tiresome.

70
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,696
If he doesn't find new ways
to please you,

71
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:06,377
then who would go home?

72
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,656
Lucy, your future looks bleak.

73
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,377
You have to wear a vacuum suit

74
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,776
and head to the store for eggs.

75
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:20,616
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:25,256
So,

77
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:27,377
a good-looking man is useless

78
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:28,817
without intelligence.

79
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:31,296
My mom said you can tell if a man

80
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,057
is smart

81
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:33,897
by looking at his forehead.

82
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:35,377
If it's broad,

83
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,017
then he is smart.

84
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,256
If it's short and narrow,

85
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:44,337
then he's a foolish man.

86
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,256
Who would like a foolish man?

87
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:47,576
Anything else to say?

88
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:48,897
No.

89
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,096
Get up and apologize.

90
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:55,857
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

91
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:57,136
- Sorry.
- We were wrong.

92
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:58,537
No need to tell me.

93
00:04:58,817 --> 00:04:59,817
Apologize to her.

94
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:04,616
Sorry, we were wrong.

95
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:05,978
Sorry.

96
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,576
We were all just hearing rumors.

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,176
Do you know how Luzhou and I
got to know each other?

98
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,977
We had to write papers
for a practice in high school.

99
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,296
I had to film,
and I didn't have time to write,

100
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:41,696
nor did I know how.

101
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:44,817
No one wanted to team up with me,
being afraid I'd hold them back.

102
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,096
Only he was willing.

103
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,656
I initially thought he liked me.

104
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:53,017
But later, I found out

105
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,736
he didn't like being disturbed.

106
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:56,817
By grouping with me,

107
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,497
he could finish the tasks

108
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,817
on his own as he hopes.

109
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:01,897
It's something he would do.

110
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,417
Actually, what I want to say is

111
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,057
Chen Luzhou is boundary-conscious.

112
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:09,897
Especially with girls,

113
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,776
he always keeps a distance.

114
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:12,937
I understand.

115
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:14,417
He's a role model for men.

116
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,457
Some nearly strip
when playing basketball.

117
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:19,017
He wears a white T-shirt
under his basketball uniform,

118
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,656
for fear of exposure.

119
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,296
So, what they just said are all rumors.

120
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:26,296
Don't take it to heart.

121
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:28,176
I know.

122
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:29,857
But you don't know.

123
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,457
Such a proud person like him

124
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:33,776
actually has a crush on you.

125
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,497
Even if he's not sure
about your feelings.

126
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:41,377
So, you like her?

127
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:46,377
Does she like you?

128
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,017
That's none of your business.

129
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,457
Xu Zhi.

130
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,696
I admire few people.

00:06:58,497 --> 00:06:59,497
You're one of them.

for another boy?

184
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:43,897
You buy this stall,

185
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:44,937
and ask him yourself.

186
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:46,857

Thanks.

189
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:58,136
Wait.

190
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,817
Something is off.

191
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,376
Do you need a favor?

192
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,857
Then you've done something wrong,
and seek to compensate me.

193
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:06,937
Do you still want to eat?

194
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,256
Yes.

195
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:14,336
Is it hot?

196
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:15,617
Is it good?

197
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:17,456
As expected from your top pick.

198
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:18,897
Delicious.

199
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,456
Why aren't you eating?

200
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,136
Isn't this plate of buns for you?

201
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:25,898
It's yours.

202
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:27,416
I had two plates of them earlier.

203
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:28,697
Such a big appetite.

204
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,376
The restaurant Feng Jin picked

205
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:32,376
isn't that great either.

206
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:33,817
True.

207
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,737
Those male guests chosen

208
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,977
aren't anything good.

209
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:41,536
You didn't come,
yet you know so much gossip.

210
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,336
You had to take action there.

211
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:47,216
But those guys do need to be dealt with.

212
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:54,857
What did Gu Yan ask?

213
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,416
Don't ask much about girls' issues.

214
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:59,777
My birthday is on the 8th. Coming?

215
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:01,456
The 8th...

216
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,136
I have other things to do

217
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:06,737
and might not go.

218
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,416
Alright.

219
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,216
I haven't told you, right?

220
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:15,296
Before my College Entrance Exam,
my dad was scammed 100,000 yuan.

221
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,376
Although we've filed a case,

222
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,416
that money is probably unrecoverable.

223
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,697
I told him before.

224
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,017
I told him

225
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,376
to sell his old car,

226
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,256
and add 100,000 yuan to buy a new car.

227
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,057
He couldn't bear to.

228
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:30,057
Now he really regrets it.

229
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:30,937
Because why?

230
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,216
This car

231
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:32,697
is gone,

232
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:33,977
along with the money.

233
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:35,657
He lost both people and money.

234
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,937
So, I told you before

235
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:40,296
thinking too much is useless.

236
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:42,057
You should enjoy the moment.

237
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,256
I really can't go.

238
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:47,577
It's not that I'm angry.

239
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:49,697
Thank you.

240
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:50,937
What's wrong?

241
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:56,737
I have some good news.
Your admission letter has arrived.

242
00:11:59,057 --> 00:11:59,618
Next Friday,

243
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,336
your grandma is planning to celebrate.

244
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,456
Next Friday?

245
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:07,040
(Xu Zhi's birthday)

246
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:10,577
Can it be on another day?

247
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,456
Another day?

248
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,256
What urgent matter is it

249
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,416
requires an elder to change the date?

250
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:19,537
Next time this happens,

251
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:20,737
just inform me directly.

252
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:22,577
Don't call me back

253
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,136
as if you can discuss with me.

254
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:29,977
Chen Luzhou.

255
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,657
What's your attitude?

256
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,737
It's okay, family matters are important.

257
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,457
And who told you

258
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:40,617
I can't enjoy the moment?

259
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,256
Xu Zhi.

260
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,296

I'm from the next room.

270
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,257
I was lost in a game,

271
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:49,096
looking for a girl
to sing a love song duet.

272
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:52,577
Happy birthday.

273
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:56,096
You're the birthday girl.

274
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,296
Would you like to sing

275
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,376
a love song duet with me?

276
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,057
- Me?
- I'll sing with you.

277
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:04,456
I'm best at love songs.

278
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,136
- What do you want to sing?
- No.

279
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,097
Yingying is tone-deaf.

280
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,256
I'm not tone-deaf.

281
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,496
I'll sing with you.

282
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:12,897
Two guys singing a love song duet

283
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:14,658
isn't very suitable.

284
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:16,216
No one is more suitable than me.

285
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,496
He's overdoing it, isn't he?

286
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:38,817
Bear with it.

287
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:40,256
It's better than you singing.

288
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,256
What do you mean?

289
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,536
If you sing a love song duet
with someone else,

290
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:44,977
Chen Luzhou might...

291
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,057
I've completed my task.

292
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,256
You guys have fun. I'm off.

293
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:54,657
Don't go.

294
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,057
Welcome everyone.

295
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:56,977
Welcome.

296
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:58,017
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

297
00:14:58,017 --> 00:14:59,057
Great news.

298
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:00,857
Luzhou is such an outstanding child

299
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,456
because of your good teaching.

300
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:03,697
Right.

301
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,017
Come, sit down, let's eat.

302
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:11,017
Sit.

303
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:12,057
Alright.

304
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:13,296
Come, eat.

305
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:16,496
Speaking of my grandson,

306
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,176
he's been well-behaved, sensible

307
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,577
and articulate since childhood.

308
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:20,216
Right?

309
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:23,017
He really hasn't worried us, has he?

310
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,937
It's all because of his own efforts.

311
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:25,336
Right.

312
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:26,496
Zhou.

313
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,456
You're about to go abroad.

314
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,817
You'll be alone there.

315
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,216
You'll definitely miss us, won't you?

316
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:34,376
You'll miss the home-cooked dish.

317
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:37,136
I made you

318
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,136
a home-cooked dish.

319
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:39,376
How nice.

320
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:40,376
Mei.

321
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,096
Serve the dish.

322
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,336
Coming.

323
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,096
Luzhou.

324
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:46,698
Your grandma made this

325
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,057
home-cooked dish today.

326
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,657
Try it.

327
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:50,297
Try it.

328
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,617
Yes, eat some.

329
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,617
Eat some.

330
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,496
You won't get to eat this abroad.

331
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:57,496
Right.

332
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:01,136
Luzhou can't eat peanuts,
doesn't she know?

333
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:05,737
Come on.

334
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,617
Luzhou, why aren't you eating?

335
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,657
Do you think my cooking isn't good?

336
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,096
Grandma.

337
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,456
Did you forget

338
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,136
he is allergic to peanuts?

339
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,697
You're so picky.

340
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:24,977
It's okay, grandma.

341
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,057
I...

342
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,456
I'll have chicken.

343
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,617
Come on.

344
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,096
I haven't prepared much either.

345
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,057
Just a red envelope.

346
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:36,456
Don't.

347
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:37,096
Ours too.

348
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,096
It's for the child.

349
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,096
You are so kind.

350
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:40,657
Thank you, Auntie,

351
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,618
- Take it.
- and Uncle. Thanks.

352
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,657
No need for bringing a red envelope.

353
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:45,737
Luzhou.

354
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:47,058
- Hurry.
- Propose a toast.

355
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:48,296
- Propose a toast.
- Propose a toast.

356

You're an adult now.

359
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,096
It's rare for the family to gather.

360
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:56,977
Drink some.

361
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,617
It's okay to drink some.

362
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,296
He's still a kid.

363
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,296
It's okay to drink some.

364
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:04,057
Uncle, Aunt, and Auntie.

365
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:05,296
I've something to do later.

366
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:06,897
I'll drink tea instead.

367
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:07,697
Okay.

368
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:08,176
Thank you.

369
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:08,817
Come on.

Thanks.

371
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:10,416
- Come on.
- Have a safe journey.

372
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,577
Thank you. Thanks, Auntie.

373
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:12,577

00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,096
Elders,

403
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,216
I have to leave.

404
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,017

412
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,496
Chen Luzhou, that scoundrel.

413
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:11,456
I thought he loved you so much,

414
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,057
but he didn't even show up.

415
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:14,937
I announce

416
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:16,617
he's out.

417
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:17,697
- Okay, out.
- Out.

418
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:18,697
Out.

00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:24,336
- Bye.
- Bye.

420
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,577
I ordered a ride-hailing car.

421
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:27,496
Almost here.

422
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:28,657
I'll send you two back.

423
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:30,737
No need, my dad is coming to pick me up.

424

You take Yingying back.

425
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:33,456
No, I want to go with you.

Slow down.

You guys go back first.

432
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,017
My heart hurts.

433
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:50,456
Is it that time for depression again?

434
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:52,216
How do you know?

435
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:53,296
Can you read minds?

436
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,416
That's so scary.

437
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:56,336
We're off.

438
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:56,857
Okay.

439
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:57,912
Alright.

440
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:59,416
- Text me when you're home.
- Okay.

441
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:00,296
Bye.

442
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:01,937

455
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,096
Do you want me to pick you up?

456
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,577
No need.

457
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:05,096
I'm going for a late-night snack.

458
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:08,456
Alright then.

459
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,057
Then you guys have fun.

555
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:11,737

556
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:13,857
He said if I become a tutor,

557
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:14,977
and things go smooth,

558
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:16,096

00:29:16,096 --> 00:29:17,897

00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,536
commission fee be paid to me?

565
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:27,256
Alright.

566
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:28,897
If he gives himself to you,

567
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:29,897
it might work.

568
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,336
Will you give me more?

569
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:34,536
You can tell Li Ke to pay me

570
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:35,857
the commission fee,

571
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:38,057
or perhaps you give yourself to me,

572
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,136
otherwise I'll go with Wang Quan.

573
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,977
You really know your stuff.

574
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:43,978
Your mind...

575
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:45,017
Don't become an architect,

576
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:46,496
and do public relations.

577
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:47,617
You'll be unstoppable.

578
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,897
But I can't handle scandals.

579
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:52,536
You should become an artist.

580
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:53,777
I'll team up with Zhu Yangqi

581
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,336
to make money by selling your scandals,

582
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:57,336
and then benefit all of us.

583
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:58,416
Just sacrifice yourself.

584
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:00,817
Don't worry, I'll support you.

585
00:30:01,937 --> 00:30:02,937
You'll support me?

586
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:05,296
Once you have the money, you'll be gone.

587
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:05,938
I know for sure.

588
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,136
Impressive indeed.

589
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:14,296
No need.

590
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:16,536
Please rise.

591
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:17,216
Oh, my.

592
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:18,697
Come here.

593
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,336
Isn't it inappropriate in public?

594
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:27,376
My dad is waiting for me.

595
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:28,817
Did you see that?

596
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,296
Xu.

597
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:47,577
You've come back at last.

598
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,496
Didn't I tell you not to wait for me?

599
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:50,577
Why are you still waiting?

600
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:52,416
What did you eat for dinner?

601
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:53,577
Barbecue.

602
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:54,697
Barbecue?

603
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:57,256
Why is there no smoke smell at all?

604
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,257
What kind of barbecue?

605
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,136
Smokeless barbecue is trendy now.

606
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,817
And there's the deodorizing spray.

607
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:02,817
It's peach-scented.

608
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:05,496
I'm allergic to peach, remember?

609
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,617
You're allergic to peaches?

610
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:08,376
Hurry back and make the call.

611
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:10,296
Your grandma wants
to wish you a happy birthday.

612
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:11,697
Okay.

613
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:55,897
(Shy Boy Chen, good night.)

614
00:31:59,136 --> 00:32:02,057
(Are you sure Shy Boy suits me?)

615
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:05,416
(It means tsundere one.)

616
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,176
(Did your dad say anything?)

617
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:15,256
(He said he's got his eye on you.)

618
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,857
(Shy Boy Chen, fend for yourself.)

619
00:32:24,657 --> 00:32:26,096
(I'll come find you tomorrow.)

620
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:28,657
(Seeing me every day, aren't you tired?)

621
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:32,057
(Yes.)

622
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:34,657
(Just kidding with you.)

623
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:37,136
(Lend me your computer
to check admission results.)

624
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:39,777
(After all, it's a bit lucky for me.)

625
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,296
(Okay, see you tomorrow.)

626
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:55,256
Stylish Zhu, just tell me what to do.

627
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:57,416
Now even unfamiliar classmates

628
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,256
are all asking about our relationship.

629
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:01,336
How am I supposed
to find a boyfriend now?

630
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:02,817
What are you afraid of?

631
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:04,657
Even if you can't marry later,

632
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:05,937
you still have me.

633
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:07,336
Stop it.

634
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:08,777
I'd rather become a nun.

635
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:10,936
You're overthinking it, okay?

636
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:12,568
The nunnery might not even want you.

637
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:14,296
Without master's degree,
you can't join it.

638
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,216
I...

639
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:19,017
What's going on?

640
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:20,857
You start to like Yingying?

641
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:21,897
Well...

642
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:23,657
That's absolutely impossible.

643
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:26,216
I have such high standards.
You know that.

644
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:30,897
Like Cai Yingying?

645
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,336
Absolutely impossible.

646
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,096
- Nice shot.
- Nice shot.

647
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:39,536
Nice.

648
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:40,536
Nice shot.

649
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:42,496
Nice shot.

650
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:50,002
(Okay, see you tomorrow.)

651
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,136
Hey.

652
00:33:57,737 --> 00:33:58,376
I...

653
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,737
I'm off, you guys play.

654
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:00,817
Play next time.

655
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:02,136
- Bye.
- You are leaving?

656
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:08,536
Zhu.

657
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:09,857
Luzhou is acting weird.

658
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:11,096
How's that?

659
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:12,857
He just smiled at the phone.

660
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:14,897
Really?

661
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:16,617
Yes.

662
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:18,336
When doesn't he smile at his phone?

663
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,136
But today, his smile

664
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:21,617
is extra bright.

665
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:22,937
Yes, I saw it too.

666
00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:24,657
Really?

667
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:26,697
If I'm not mistaken,

668
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:29,057
he's like you now,

669
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,897
secretly dating behind my back.

670
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:33,737
Who's dating?

671
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:38,256
Right, I'm dating now.

672
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:42,977
I think Lucy

673
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:45,057
should be looking at his photos.

674
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:47,536
He's still single.

675
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:58,377
If you're curious,

676
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:02,136
you can check my search history
and see what I'm usually searching.

677
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:03,657
Can I?

678
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,416
Go ahead.

679
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:10,136
(Xu Zhi,)

680
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:13,057
(please keep up this keen curiosity.)

681
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:15,697
(Perhaps the next Nobel Prize winner
from China)

682
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,697
(is you.)

683
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:19,977
Chen Luzhou, you are a dog.

684
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:21,857
Reward me with a bone?

685
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:23,617
Alright, wait at the door.

686
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:25,697
I'll give you a big bone, Doggy Chen.

687
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,096
Thank you.

688
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,376
Hurry up and check.

689
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:40,577
Okay.

690
00:35:40,777 --> 00:35:41,777
I'll do it.

691
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:53,657
Wait.

692
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,456
I only told you once, right?

693
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:56,456
And you remembered.

694
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:57,577
Your memory is excellent.

695
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:59,617
Was 713 guy called for nothing?

696
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:04,857
Why is it closed?

697
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,136
Keep it a mystery.

698
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:11,577
Not in a hurry at all.

699
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:13,376
I'll find out sooner or later.

700
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:16,456
Buy the ticket.

701
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:17,897
680 yuan.

702
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:21,256
School of Architecture.

703
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:24,777
Not happy?

704
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:27,817
I heard

705
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:31,017
the winter in Beijing is very dry.

706
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,057
Will I have a nosebleed if I go there?

707
00:36:35,617 --> 00:36:37,176
Not the time to think about this now.

708
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:39,096
Let's go.

709
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:40,456
I'll get you a big bone.

710
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,296
I'll get out to get changed.

711
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:43,536
Wait a moment.

712
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:45,057
Why not let me see?

713
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:47,336
You have a glib tongue.

714
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:50,336
Well...

715
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,657
How about tomorrow

716
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:54,096
we go swimming?

717
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:56,777
You wish.

718
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,937
I can't even take a look at abs.

719
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,256
So petty.

720
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:13,416
Boys should be reserved.

721
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:15,216
What do you mean?

722
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:16,216
You don't want to see?

723
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:21,017
Fine, I am not reserved.
I'm worthless, okay?

724
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:23,496
Sure, no more teasing.

725
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,857
I'll be a tutor tomorrow.

726
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:25,937
I have to go back.

727
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,057
In the coming days,

728
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:32,096
I might be very busy.

729
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:34,336
We might not often see each other.

730
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:35,777
I'll come to see Li Ke

731
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:37,897
and let him fire you, okay?

732
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:38,977
That won't do.

733
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:40,456
We've signed a contract.

734
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,136
I'm leaving.

735
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,216
Don't miss me too much.

736
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:47,496
You...

737
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:48,577
Bye.

738
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:55,136
(Flirting and then running right away?)

739
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:05,136
Focus on reading.

740
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:06,737
Don't get distracted.

741
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:18,296
(Still busy, Zhi?)

742
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:27,057
(So busy, on a break.)

743
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:32,803
(Liu Tongqian)

744
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:41,136
Liu Tongqian.

745
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:43,296
You know her?

746
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:45,216
Xu Zhi is teaching her.

747
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,536
Is this girl you like?

748
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:51,216
Her name is Liu Tongqian.

749
00:38:51,817 --> 00:38:52,937
Don't call her Qian.

750
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,737
Lots of people have this name.

751
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:56,817
