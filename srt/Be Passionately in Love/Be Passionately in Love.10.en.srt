(Because the Puppy Is Wagging Its Tail)

18
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,376
Similar to the day
we watched the meteor shower?

19
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:24,975
A little.

20
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:26,896
But that night was prettier than now.

21
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,736
I should suggest to Mr. Fu
to set up more stargazing spots.

22
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:32,135
It will profit.

23
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:34,256
You're great at math.

24
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,135
You might as well major in Finance.

25
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:38,336
I suppose it's possible.

26
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:41,015
Why not try

27
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,656
Defense Electronics Tech?

28
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,495
You're so good at keeping secrets.

29
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,776
If I hadn't come
to record the show today,

30
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,256
when were you going to tell me?

31
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:51,896
My mom used to say I was

32
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,216
the master of being snide,

33
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,216
but I think now it's you.

34
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:57,736
No.

35
00:02:58,015 --> 00:02:58,817
My dad said

36
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,776
I've always been the best
at being insincere.

37
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:02,495
Okay.

38
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:04,656
Five more minutes.

39
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,415
Do you want
to hear my explanation first,

40
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:09,856
or watch the fireworks first?

41
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:11,015
No need for explanations.

42
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,575
But I'm really curious,

43
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,896
how did you score 713
just on raw scores?

44
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:17,336
Just performed normally.

45
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,256
Alright.

46
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:23,696
Chen Luzhou,

47
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:25,415
I understand now

48
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,415
why you're always so confident.

49
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:32,095
Now it's your turn.

50
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:34,376
You explain.

51
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:35,935
Explain what?

52
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:39,856
Why are you avoiding me?

53
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,455
Am I that unsightly?

54
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,297
I just don't want

55
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:44,935
our relationship to be so complicated.

56
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,495
What do you mean by that?

57
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:48,495
You want to let me
know your friends, right?

58
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:51,055
Then what?

59
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:52,856
Then I realized,

60
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,256
even if you don't come today,

61
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:55,896
they'd still always talk about you.

62
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:57,736
If I go to college

63
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,095
and they become my classmates,

64
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:00,656
they're bound to chat a lot.

65
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,896
Talk about your

66
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:03,336

67
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:04,736
glorious deeds.

68
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,575
And your romantic affairs abroad.

69
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,015
Don't want to hear about me?

70
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:11,415

We are clocks walking alone.

79

But we have to be clocks

80

Hey, you, watch the copyright.

00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,336

82

Be careful not to spoil the fun.

83
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:05,975
Fine.

84
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:08,776

88
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:19,176

So?

98
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,256
Why exactly?

99
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,776
Because the puppy is wagging its tail.

100
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,495
What? Because...

101
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,776
Because the school trustee is my mom?

I've been guarding it all night.

00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:36,415
First, tell me what you just said.

107
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:39,575
I said,

108
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,415
"Chen Luzhou, you're a dog."

109
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,736
Seven words.

110
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:45,376
You just spoke eight words.

111
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:46,896
Can calculate mentally?

112
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,816
A little. Compete?

113
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:49,575
Okay.

114
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,975
I was an abacus mental arithmetic
champion as a child.

115
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:53,256
Okay.

116
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:54,656
I'll say a sentence.

117
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:56,216
Don't count with your fingers.

118
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:57,656
Just say a few words.

119
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,217
Best of five.

120
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,696
If you lose, give me the wine.

121
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,055
Alright.

122
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,455
Can I have a sip first?

123
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,575
Might as well finish it.

124

125
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:18,376
Sure.

126
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:19,696
Tastes good.

127
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,095
When you go to Beijing,

128
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:26,656
will you go drinking with others?

129
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:29,816
Probably.

130
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:30,975
Or it'll be boring.

131
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,256
Be safe.

132
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:37,336
Okay.

133
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:39,176
Try not to drink with guys.

134
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:42,415
It's for

135
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:43,736
your own good.

136
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:45,736
Can I drink with you?

137
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,095
Still want to play?

138
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:51,455
Yes.

139
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:52,535

00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,296

141

Wishing you a bright future.

142

Remember not to lie casually
to girls in the future.

143
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:07,015
You'll repay eventually.

144
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,135
How many words?

145
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:09,896
Thirty-five words.

146
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,736
You told me not to drink with guys.

147
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,615
What about yourself?

148
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,576
Will you drink with girls
when you go abroad?

149
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,576
How many words?

150
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:19,576
I won't.

151
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,135
Twenty-six words.

152
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:29,175
Some people owe a lot of love debts.

153
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,175
They even dare to suspect I'm a player.

154
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:33,856
You can ask directly in the future.

155
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,375
Don't search on Baidu.

156
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:36,776
How many words?

157
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:40,736
Your eyes are sharp.

158

159
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,335
I need to keep my eyes open.

160
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,015
I didn't catch it clearly.

161
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,015
Consider it your win.

162
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:49,135

♪The splendid, sunny memories♪

196
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:43,616
(Because...)

197
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,015
(Because the puppy is wagging its tail.)

198
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:51,496
(The cheers for you will never stop.)

199
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,616
(The rain in Qingyi
may continue to fall all year round.)

200
00:10:56,776 --> 00:11:00,576
(I tell you I like you
in the bustling crowd.)

201
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:34,856
(I am very happy
to have met so many friends today.)

202
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:36,456
(Also thank the staff girls)

203
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:37,496
(and the guy's care.)

204
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:39,536
(The recording process was delightful.)

205
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,816
(Watching top students chat
is fascinating.)

206
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:55,935
(In addition,)

207
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,135
(I also met a nice expert,)

208
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,135
(Chen Luzhou.)

209
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:00,736
(He scored 713 without extra credits.)

210
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:03,656
(Lu from No.1 High School
is the real deal.)

211
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:06,736
(Still offended someone.)

212
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:14,656
(Are you home yet?)

213
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:14,295
(Because the puppy is wagging its tail.)

214
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:35,376
(Hi, everyone.)

215
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,255
(I am Xu Zhi from Ruijun High School.)

216
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,016
(Ranked 30th.)

217
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,416
Dad, you've been watching all morning.

218
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,776
I just want to pick a good part.

219
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:45,856
But it's so long.

220
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:46,935
Cut which part?

221
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,335
I just want to take it to work.

222
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:50,856
Let my colleagues see

223
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:51,856
that my daughter

224
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,416
is not only excellent,

225
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,416
but also photogenic.

226
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:57,896
Keep it for yourself to enjoy.

227
00:13:58,335 --> 00:13:59,935
Please don't spread it.

228
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,416
What's wrong?

229
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:03,896
Did anyone bully you

230
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:04,935
at the TV station?

231
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:06,896
Do I seem like someone who was bullied?

232
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,536
I'm the one bullying others.

233
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,055
That's true.

234
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,616
Come.

235
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,055
What?

236
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:15,776
Look.

237
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:17,496
Ocean Adventure.

238
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,856
You signed me up?

239
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:27,975
I don't want anything else

240
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:29,095
besides a computer.

241
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,135
In your room,

242
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,536
a small paper lists ten wishes.

243
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:36,055
One of them is a spontaneous trip.

244
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:40,416
Cai and I have already discussed it,

245
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,055
and specially chose this for you.

246
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,496
The Gold Coastline.

247
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,375
Written randomly by Cai Yingying.

248
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:46,816
Besides,

249
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,816
why not save the money to clear debts?

250
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,055
If you want to spoil the fun,

251
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:53,536
call Yingying yourself and tell her

252
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:54,536
you've decided not to go.

253
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:55,696
I'll tell her.

254
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:56,776
This is too expensive.

255
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:00,335
Hello, Yingying.

256
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:01,295
- You...
- Zhi.

257
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,015
We can go to the sea now.

258
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,616
Oh my,
I bought my swimsuit two years ago.

259
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:07,295
Finally, it can be used.

260
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,175
Okay.

261
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,416
Thanks, Dad.

262
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,135
(Feng Jin: Who took such a good photo?)

263
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:25,656
(Could it be me?)

264
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:29,696
Hey.

265
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:31,295
Here so early.

266
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,055
Yeah, warm-up.

267
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,215
Cai Yingying and Xu Zhi
are inconsiderate.

268
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,496
Left without a word to play.

269
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,255
What do you mean?

270
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,375
Look. Feng Jin went too.

271
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,375
What is he doing there?

272
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,215
Seems like a one-stop photoshoot.

273
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,496
Maybe Cai Yingying
asked him to take photos.

274
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:54,335
Photographers are in high demand.

275
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:57,935
Why didn't Xu Zhi ask you?

276
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,536
Do you think this is a good job?

277
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,616
I need to compete with him for the job?

278
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,576
Lucy, why do I smell a sour odor?

279
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:07,255
Get lost.

280
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:12,456
Lucy.

281
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:14,375
Why do you look like a duck?

282
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:15,975
Stubborn mouth.

283
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:28,975
If your vision is poor, get glasses.

284
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,135
The third time. You're hooked, huh?

285
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,135
What's wrong?

286
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,135
Zhu.

287
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:49,055
What's his deal?

288
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:50,055
Eat something bad?

289
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,704
Like eating instant noodles

290
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:52,696
with no noodles,

291
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,696
and only the seasoning.

292
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:54,817
Go on.

293
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:55,975
That's really unlucky.

294
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,055
Come on, continue.

295
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:05,696
Good shot.

296
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,536
Good shot.

297
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:19,935
Good shot.

298
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:20,536
Nice.

299
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:21,335
Let's play again.

300
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:21,816
Bye-bye.

301
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:22,536
Play again.

302
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:24,656
- Next time, buddy.
- Next time.

303
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:25,656
Bye.

304
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:26,856
It's him.

305
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,215
The one in the middle?

306
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:34,857
You're saying

307
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:36,896
you'll take my buddy
to the eye doctor, right?

308
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,375
Right.

309
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,416
Better hurry up.

310
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:41,616
If not, you'll go to ER.

311
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:43,255
Why did you hit me?

312
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:44,504
Why did you step on my shoe?

313
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:46,335
What if I hit you while playing?

314
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,856
I did the same, so what?

315
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:52,375
Quite delicate.

316
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,696
Dressed up like a big shot.

317
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,616
Has a wealthy family.

318
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,255
Do you truly think I won't hit you?

319
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:02,696
I'm not that rich.

320
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,255
Just my luck,

321
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,135
there's a news producer in the family.

322
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:08,496
Go ahead if you want to make headlines.

323
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:11,496
Forget it.

324
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:12,496
Scared, aren't you?

325
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:13,697
If you think you can,

326
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:14,896
go ahead and try.

327
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:21,536
Beat him.

328
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:37,862
(Doctor: Cai Binhong)
(Title: Chief Physician)

329
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:43,816
Alright.

330
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,335
It's done, Doctor?

331
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,215
Is my injury a problem?

332
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,816
Your eyes are fine.

333
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:51,817
Just a minor wound.

334
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,335
Visit the surgery for treatment.

335
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:55,696
I told you,

336
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:56,976
it would've healed

337
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,015
in half an hour.

338
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,255
Thank you, Doctor.

339
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:02,456
Thank you.

340
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:02,856
Bye.

341
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:03,856
Okay.

342
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:05,576
Medical records.

343
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:06,736
Alright.

344
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:17,736
What?

345
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:18,576
You idiot.

346
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:19,576
A man's badge of honor.

347
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:25,576
Crazy.

348
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,015
Guess who I saw?

349
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:44,536
So rashly.

350
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:45,536
Who did you see?

351
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,896
Chen Luzhou came to our hospital again.

352
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:49,055
No.

353
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,255
It's the guy
who sent the red envelope last time.

354
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:53,816
Got his eye hurt playing basketball.

355
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:54,816
I took a look for him.

356
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:55,896
No.

357
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:57,656
What's the matter?

358
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:00,656
If I'm not mistaken,

359
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,015
it's this person.

360
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:05,776
Come on.

361
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:06,776
See for yourself.

362
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:09,816
Do you remember you said

363
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,736
that if anyone
takes a liking to Yingying,

364
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:14,776
you'd be the first
to take him to your eye doctor.

365
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,095
Take a look.

366
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:19,015
Here he comes.

367
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:20,255
This...

368
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:21,696
This is impossible.

369
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:22,295
Just a joke.

370
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:23,295
How is it impossible?

371
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:24,536
Here.

372
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,295
S-Send this photo

373
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:27,295
to me.

374
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:28,175
No need.

375
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:28,975
See for yourself.

376
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:29,936
- Just in Moments.
- I can't.

377
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,255
I can't see her Moments.

378
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:33,776
She blocked you?

379
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,295
Wouldn't call it that.

380
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:39,295
I'd call it...

381
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,015
giving her enough space.

382
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,215
What space?

383
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:45,215
That's a black hole.

384
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:54,175
(Congrats, Chen,
on taking the first step to growing up)

385
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:56,175
(with your first fight.)

386
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,055
Zhu Yangqi and Chen Luzhou
got into a fight with someone!

387
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,055
Look.

388
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,696
(Looks much better this way.)

389
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:10,295
(Don't idolize me too much.)

390
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:13,015
The two of you aren't that strong.

391
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:16,616
Zhi,

392
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:18,255
do you know why they fought?

393
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:19,416
Don't want to know.

394
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,416
I'm insisting you know.

395
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:23,055
Zhu Yangqi said Chen Luzhou

396
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,816
was upset
when he saw Feng Jin hanging out

397
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,135
with us in Moments.

398
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,656
He went into a rage
on the basketball court,

399
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,576
and started a fight over a dispute.

400
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:33,255
I want to ask,

401
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:36,015
as the catalyst of this incident,

402
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:37,416
what are your thoughts?

403
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:39,175
Childish.

404
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,616
(Can you post your own hand?)

405
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:43,776
(Back off.)

406
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:46,736
(Why the hurry?
I haven't posted your abs yet.)

407
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,536
(Anything less than an eight-pack
doesn't count as abs.)

408
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:55,536
What did you reply?

409
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:56,375
Let me see.

410
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:57,816
(Eight-pack abs.)

411
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,856
(500 if you want)

412
00:21:59,015 --> 00:21:59,537
(a photo.)

413
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:02,175
Naked Score Guy 713.

414
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:04,416
Zhi, what kind of people are you adding?

415
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,416
Look at you.

416
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:06,935
There really is abs?

417
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:08,736
I want to see too.

418
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:09,975
Not this one.

419
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:11,616
This one is quite delicate.

420
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:12,896
No touching allowed.

421
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:14,456
So delicate.

422
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:20,856
Love this trip.

423
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,375
Cheers.

424
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,015
Alright, stop drinking.

425
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:42,295
This is for hitting me.

426
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,255
I paid.

427
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,295
Thank you, boss.

428
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,416
Take care.

429
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,616
What do you think it means
when a puppy wags its tail?

430
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,456
Coming.

431
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,536
You don't invite me to play games?

432
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:43,255
Do you know how to play this?

433
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,616
Come, I'll teach you.

434
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:56,710
(Xu Zhi's Moments)

435
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,335
Why is it her?

436
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,015
What do you mean why?

437
00:24:11,135 --> 00:24:12,496
Are you pretending to be stupid?

438
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:16,616
Over the years, many people liked you.

439
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:18,576
Good-looking ones.

440
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:19,975
Smart ones.

441
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:21,656
So why her?

442
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:25,295
Do you remember the four of us

443
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:27,015
having supper together
for the first time?

444
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:30,616
Why are you staring?

445
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:32,135
My dad works in a hospital.

446
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:33,656
He's seen a lot of troublemakers.

447
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:36,055
Told me to develop good habits
from a young age.

448
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:38,055
If I encounter a troublemaker,

449
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:39,255
I must keep evidence.

450
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,135
So friendly on our second meeting?

451
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:44,295
I thought exchanging names

452
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:45,335
made us friends.

453
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:52,975
Really?

454
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,536
Over something so minor.

455
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,175
She was the first one to stand by me

456
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,856
no matter what.

457
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,135
(Fighting alone for so many years.)

458
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,255
(What I want might be a bit greedier.)

459
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:15,776
(It's passionate and unfaltering love.)

460
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:17,576
(It's one of a kind.)

461
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,255
(It must be me.)

462
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:21,175
Speak up.

463
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,295
How deep are you in?

464
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:27,055
Will going abroad help?

465
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:29,215
Like her when you back?

466
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:38,335
Really hopeless.

467
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:39,975
How about this?

468
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,295
Discuss it with your parents.

469
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,295
Why not just stay here?

470
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:45,896
Even the underwear I wear now

471
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,536
is chosen by my mom.

472
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:49,816
What right do I have to say no?

473
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,015
When will you return?

474
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,015
Two years, I guess.

475
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:00,055
I checked the courses there.

476
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,255
I aim to earn all credits in two years.

477
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,015
See if there's a chance to get a job,

478
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:06,335
or a part-time job.

479
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,095
I'll return once I'm set.

480
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,536
Two years?

481
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:13,135
It's too late.

482
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,416
Then let it be.

483
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,776
Anyway, I'm going abroad.

484
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:20,215
No contact for years.

485
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:22,736
She'll forget about me.

486
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:42,656
What's up?

487
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,896
De Sica's film
is going to be re-released.

488
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:46,536
You free tonight?

489
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:47,576
We'll go watch it.

490
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:48,576
Sure.

491
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:49,896
Let me see.

492
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:54,215
There's no schedule.

493
00:26:56,736 --> 00:26:57,577
No problem.

494
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,255
Art film doesn't have special effects.

495
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:02,055
Watching it later on WeTV is also okay.

496
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:03,576
Alright.

497
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:09,175
I'm back.

498
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:14,055
Come over here.

499
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:17,255
What's up?

500
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,135
Can't I just talk with you?

501
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:21,616
Come.

502
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:23,335
Sit here.

503
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:25,736
Sit closer.

504
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:29,335
Let me ask you.

505
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:31,696
Am I your best friend

506
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:33,135
in the world?

507
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,696
Yes.

508
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,295
Then, can we

509
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,015
talk about everything without secrets?

510
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:43,015
Yes, maybe.

511
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:46,015
Who's this?

512
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:49,015
I was wondering who it was.

513
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,135
A friend.

514
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:51,215
What kind of friend?

515
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:53,776
Just met him, an art student.

516
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:56,175
He's a bit mouthy

517
00:27:56,496 --> 00:27:57,496
and loves to brag,

518
00:27:57,896 --> 00:27:59,175
but he's a good person.

519
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:00,975
He recommended I take the art exam.

520
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:05,015
You're not doing retaking that art exam
because of him,

521
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:05,617
right?

522
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,975
Of course not.

523
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,616
I'm retaking a year just to get

524
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:10,255
into a top-tier art college.

525
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:12,175
Are we the best friends

526
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:13,215
in the world?

527
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:13,936
Yes.

528
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:15,095
Then tell me the truth.

529
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,015
Are you in a relationship
with that "pig"?

530
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:17,976
I...

531
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:19,776
We are just good buddies.

532
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:21,616
W-Who do you think you're grossing out?

533
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:23,295
Besides, in this world,

534
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,416
only I can call him "pig".

535
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:25,496
You can't call him that.

536
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:26,537
You are single.

537
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:27,776
T-Then why block me

538
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,935
from the group photo?

539
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,295
Mr. Cai Binhong.

540
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:32,696
I've blocked you from everything.

541
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,375
True.

542
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:35,457
Then,

543
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:36,935
I'm your best friend in the world.

544
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:38,015
I can know

545
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:38,777
your everything.

546
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:40,015
Why are you blocking me?

547
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:41,256
Let's discuss.

548
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:43,175
Can you not block me?

549
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:45,776
Performance-based.

550
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:48,975
How else can I perform?

551
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,816
I'm your best friend in the world.

552
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:52,856
We talk about everything.

553
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,215
There are no secrets, right?

554
00:28:58,552 --> 00:28:59,265
(Cai Yingying, you win.
Click below to get your prize.)

555
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:02,975
Who are you fooling?

556
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:06,327
(Win)

557
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:12,896
Zhi.

558
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:14,095
Zhi.

559
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,456
Let me show you.

560
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:17,416
What is it?

561
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,935
Restored Sunflower.

562
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:19,975
Your beloved De Sica.

563
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,256
None in Qingyi.

564
00:29:21,256 --> 00:29:22,416
I've checked it all.

565
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,417
This must be fake.

566
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,496
It's true.

567
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,055
At first, I thought it was fake.

568
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:27,255
Then I clicked in.

569
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:28,576
It was successfully redeemed.

570
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,095
The schedule and seat number
are clearly written.

571
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:32,175
If you doubt me, look.

572
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,456
(Sunflower, Movie ticket)

573
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:36,536
Which cinema?

574
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:38,416
Bohui Cinema, Hall No. 3.

575
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:50,896
Zhi, this hall.

576
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:55,736
Which row?

577
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:57,335
Third row.

578
00:29:58,335 --> 00:29:59,335
It's starting.

579
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,335
Seat 4, Row 3.

580
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,215
Hurry up, Zhi.

Chen Luzhou.

595
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,975
Come here.

596
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:01,816
(I've got to run. Something urgent.
Have fun watching.)

597
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,616
You planned it?

598
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:38,904
(Chen Jishen)

599
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:44,736
Dad.

600
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:46,696
Can you do me a favor?

601
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:48,896
How did you know?

602
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:52,416
Hardly anyone in Qingyi
knows about De Sica.

603
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,095
Who else could it be?

604
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:57,776
And also, your scam message.

605
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:58,935
Could it be any faker?

606
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,736
Only Yingying is willing to play along.

607
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,536
Is your movie invitation still valid?

608
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,175
Didn't you refuse?

609
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,616
Besides,
you're an heir to Bohui Studios.

610
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,896
You want me to take you?

611
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,175
You're such a bad man.

612
00:33:38,255 --> 00:33:39,255
I am.

613
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:40,576
Boring.

614
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,656
Then what counts as exciting?

615
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:47,656
If being fun is based on your criteria,

616
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:48,656
you're pretty boring too.

617
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:51,576
Alright, we're both boring.

618
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:54,095
Watching a boring movie
with boring person

619
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,375
is completely boring.

620
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:57,255
I'm going home.

621
00:34:07,576 --> 00:34:08,656
Is there anything else?

622
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:12,975
What counts as exciting?

623
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,416
Is dating exciting?

624
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:19,255
You think everyone wants to date you?

625
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:24,295
Dating is also boring.

626
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:26,975
What about kissing then?

627
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:28,255
Is kissing exciting?

628
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:33,215
Chen Luzhou, you can't handle it.

629
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:36,456
Do you just want to play with me?

630
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,656
Who can't handle it?

631
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,335
Don't you ignore my WeChat?

632
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:02,295
I can answer your previous question now.

633
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,656
Dating is boring.

634
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,375
Kissing is also boring.

635
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,536
Dating and kissing are both boring.

636
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:12,335
Not dating but kissing

637
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:13,935
is really exciting.

638
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:16,095
Look at those two.

639
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,456
So, some things

640
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,255
are completely useless
to care about too much.

641
00:35:40,656 --> 00:35:42,095
That's why you can't handle it.

642
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:47,095
You want to play?

643
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:49,135
Okay.

644
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:50,616
Just don't cry.

645
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,335
Don't worry.

646
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:58,416
I'll happily see you off on your flight.

647
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,055
Yingying, I'm back.

648
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,055
Zhi.

649
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,375
Come here quickly.

650
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:22,497
What's wrong?

651
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:23,536
Let me ask you.

652
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:25,576
How are you feeling?

653
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:29,375
You keep saying you're my 007,

654
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:30,256
but what now?

655
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,416
You betrayed me.

656
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,576
Chen Luzhou sold me out?

657
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:34,936
When he came to me,

658
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,375
he promised to keep it a secret.

659
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,616
A man's words are truly deceitful.

660
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:40,335
And you still helped him?

661
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:42,375
I was helping you, okay?

662
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,295
Because you have a stubborn temper.

663
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,856
A cold war feels good first,

664
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:48,015
but it'll end in flames.

665
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:49,776
And then someone will say

666
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:50,897
they regret it.

667
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:52,576
Once, there was a sincere relationship

668
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:53,696
right in front of me.

669
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,816
I didn't cherish it at the beginning.

670
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:59,696
You should worry about yourself.

671
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:00,776
Have you decided?

672
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:01,776
Want to retake the class?

673
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,175
I've decided.

674
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,656
I'll take art exam next year.

675
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,015
Meet you in Beijing.

676
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:08,896
This time it won't just be
a passing fad, right?

677
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:09,935
Absolutely not.

678
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:10,935
I swear.

679
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:12,816
That's not right.

680
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:14,215
Really.

681
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,935
Refine my will.

682
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:24,496
Nail the second try.

683
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:28,816
Today's task is complete.

684
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:30,696
Thanks for joining my morning workout.

685
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:32,656
Alright, I'm going back to study.

686
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:33,816
You have to work hard.

687
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:34,936
Don't study all summer

688
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:36,015
and still be at "abandon."

689
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:37,335
Don't worry.

690
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:38,416
Bye-bye.

691
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,656
Bye-bye.

692
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:03,295
Secretly filming me?

693
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,776
I did it openly.

694
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:06,175
That's still not okay.

695
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,736
I went to beach with Zhu Yangqi.

696
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,576
I fell asleep on the beach for a while.

697
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,816
He secretly took over 300 photos of me.

698
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:15,856
He blackmailed me to pay.

699
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:18,856
Or he'll send them
to my future girlfriend.

700
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:20,335
Really?

701
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:21,576
Does he still have them?

702
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:23,416
Could it be cheaper for a friend?

703
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:24,896
You can't figure this out?

704
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:26,657
Free for my girlfriend.

705
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:27,935
Once I'm asleep, she can look.

706
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:31,095
Were the photos really ugly?

707
00:38:31,295 --> 00:38:33,175
Why would he use those photos

708
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:34,896
to get rich?

709
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:36,456
Very handsome.

710
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,295
Anyway,
you probably won't get to see them.

711
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:43,277
(Tattoo, 20 percent off for pairs)

712
00:38:44,215 --> 00:38:45,215
20 percent off.

713
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:47,856
Do you want a tattoo?

714
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,375
Can't I just think?

715
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:53,776
What would it be if you got one?

716
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:56,416
Three letters.

717
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:58,215
C, L, Z.

718
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,375
I suggest

719
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:04,656
don't tattoo names.

720
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,736
Don't use abbreviations.

721
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:06,975
Why not?

722
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:08,656
I want to tattoo a cherry.

723
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:10,175
What do you think I meant?

724
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:11,456
Chen Luzhou?

725
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:15,816
I had a goal when I was a kid.

726
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:18,576
It was to achieve cherry freedom.

727
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,215
It means earning lots of money.

728
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:22,456
Then why not tattoo money?

729
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:23,536
Because it's illegal.

730
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,576
(Feng Jin is going abroad next week.)

731
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:32,776
(Dinner tonight.)

732
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:34,015
(See you at 6 PM.)

733
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,215
So soon?

734
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,255
I thought it would be the end of August.

735
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:42,456
Have you decided when to go abroad?

736
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:44,975
Not yet.

737
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:50,175
I can't go tonight.

738
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:52,095
Need to do the hospital's promo video.

739
00:39:55,456 --> 00:39:56,616
I've finished eating, bye.

740
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,335
Say hello to Feng Jin for me.

741
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:23,975
What exactly is your relationship
with Chen Luzhou?

742
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,055
Nothing.

743
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,335
Sometimes you two are very ambiguous.

744
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:29,736
And sometimes very distant.

745
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:31,215
It confuses me.

746
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:32,975
Are you two together or not?

747
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,175
Come on, here.

748
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:35,536
Sorry, we're late.

749
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,255
Sit.

750
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:37,255
Which two are together?

751
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,055
Xu Zhi.

752
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:39,255
You in a relationship?

753
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:41,255
Not yet.

754
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,095
Who said that?

755
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:42,975
Xu Zhi is single.

756
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:43,255
No.

757
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:44,255
Come on, sit down.

758
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:48,416
- Order.
- Order.

759
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,776
Order whatever you like.

760
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:50,576
Waiter.

761
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:51,416
Some water.

762
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,335
You order main courses.

763
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:53,055
- We check this.
- Whatever.

764
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:53,375
Okay.

765
00:40:53,696 --> 00:40:54,215
Listen to me.

766
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:55,856
Wang Quan, that one on the left.

767
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,175
He is particularly close with Tan Xu.

768
00:40:58,335 --> 00:41:00,135
Don't mention
what's between you and Luzhou.

769
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:02,656
What are we eating?

770
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:05,816
Listen to me.

771
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:06,935
Don't fool me.

772
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,175
When I came in,

773
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,656
I clearly heard Yingying talk

774
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:13,576
about two people's relationship.

775
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:23,215
It's me.

776
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,255
It's me who's in a relationship.

777
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
Are you sleep-talking here?

778
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,656
Can't we see if you're
in a relationship?

779
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,736
Exactly.

780
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:34,696
Come on.

781
00:41:34,816 --> 00:41:36,015
Let me introduce.

782
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:37,935
This person here,

783
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:40,935
is my girlfriend, Cai Yingying.

784
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:47,456
Yes.

785
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:52,896
Look.

786
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:54,095
I told you so.

787
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,656
What's there to hide?

788
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,295
- Right?
- Yes. We've been together for ages.

789
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:00,416
I originally wanted to keep it a secret.

790
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,215
Didn't you catch us in the act?

791
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:03,215
Yes.

792
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:04,816
How did you manage this secrecy?

793
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:06,015
We didn't notice.

794
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:07,015
Nice job.

795
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,616
- Nice job.
- I knew it.

796
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:11,215
You hang out together every day.

797
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:14,856
So, you've been having
a secret relationship?

798
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,856
Zhu, you're something else.

799
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:19,215
Keep it low profile.

800
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:20,816
Yes.

801
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,015
Come, show some respect.

802
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:23,975
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello, Madam.

803
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:25,696
Just call me Yingying.

804
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:27,857
- To Madam.
- To Madam.

805
00:42:27,857 --> 00:42:28,896
Come.

806
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:05,255
How is it? Had too much to drink?

807
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,975
What's up with Xu Zhi?

808
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:30,496
Had too much to drink?

809
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,255
Enough.

810
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:34,296
- You drunk.
- Stop it.

811
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:35,536
Feng Jin had too much to drink.

812
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:36,056
Come on.

813
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:37,935
Fell into Xu Zhi's arms.

814
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:42,935
Separate them.

815
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:44,255
Separate them.

816
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:47,576
Got it.

817
00:43:48,055 --> 00:43:48,296
Wait.

818
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:50,584
Why don't you care about me?

819
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,215
Care what about you?

820
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:53,416
Why worry about you?

821
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:56,536
Nothing.

822
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:59,935
It's just that Cai Yingying and I
officially announced.

823
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:02,896
You're drunk, aren't you?

824
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:09,135
Stop worrying about me.

825
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:10,175
Worry about yourself.

826
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:11,776
Your backyard is on fire.

827
00:44:11,935 --> 00:44:12,935
Over.

828
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:49,336
(Because the puppy is wagging its tail.)

829
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:51,480
(The cheers for you will never stop.)

830
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,752
(The rain in Qingyi
may continue to fall all year round.)

831
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:59,763

in the bustling crowd.)
