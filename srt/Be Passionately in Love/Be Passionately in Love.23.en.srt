(Qingyi Central Hospital)
(National Class A Tertiary Hospital)

19
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:51,817
Is this more comfortable?

20
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:52,897
Alright.

21
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:53,656
- It's okay.
- Mr. Xu.

22
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:54,937
Here's the water.

23
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:56,096
Okay.

24
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:57,656
Dad, have some water.

25
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:58,656
Okay.

26
00:01:58,656 --> 00:01:59,136
Ms. Wei.

27
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:00,977
How about we take care of Mr. Xu?

28
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:01,977
You go ahead.

29
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:03,216
Okay.

30
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:05,616
Alright, then I'll get busy.

31
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:06,256
Okay.

32
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:07,576
I'll come after work.

33
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:08,776
You'll take care of him.

34
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:10,857
Want an orange, Mr. Xu?

35
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:12,457
Sure.

36
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:14,656
Xu.

37
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:16,296
Look who's here.

38
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,696
Fu, what brings you here?

39
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:22,176
What's going on here?

40
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:23,977
Wait.

41
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:25,337
Don't touch.

42
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:26,337
You two chat.

43
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,136
I have work to do. I'll get busy now.

44
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,377
Okay, go ahead.

45
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:30,377
Take a rain check.

46
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:31,377
Okay.

47
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,136
Just ignore him.

48
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,776
What's going on here?

49
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:37,296
Who did this to you?

50
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,338
The delivery guy.

51
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,337
The electric scooter came by in a flash.

52
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:41,616
Where's the person?

53
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:43,017
Gone?

54
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,017
Your dad is such a nice guy.

55
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,216
Why don't you greet me?

56
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:53,616
Come on.

57
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:55,857
Wish me a Happy New Year,

58
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,057
and this will be yours.

59
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,057
Not interested.

60
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,296
Don't you even want it?

61
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:08,616
Just say hello.

62
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,017
You'll have to listen to your boyfriend

63
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,296
to greet me now?

64
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:24,497
Okay.

65
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:25,736
Chen.

66
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:27,457
Then you talk to her.

67
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:29,337
Here.

68
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:30,736
Mr. Xu.

69
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:31,776
Since he's here,

70
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:32,776
I'll leave.

71
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,537
Don't eat in the cafeteria.

72
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:35,857
Zhi and I will bring it here.

73
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:37,296
Alright.

74
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:38,776
Then you...

75
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,017
Just go back together.

76
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:42,897
Okay.

77
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,256
Go to bed early.

78
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,216
What was that?

79
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,216
What's going on with Xu Zhi?

80
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,296
Being with Chen Luzhou,

81
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:04,656
she's changed so much.

82
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:06,216
Do something.

83
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,817
I can't give out the red envelope.

84
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:10,937
Then I'll keep it for her.

85
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:13,656
It's for her.

86
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:14,776
That's a lot of money.

87
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,377
His name is Chen Luzhou.

88
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,857
What's so special about Chen Luzhou?

89
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:21,017
He's impolite.

90
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,576
He's the biological son of Lian Hui.

91
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:35,256
Don't think too much about it.

92
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:36,378
If he knew,

93
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:38,057
he would definitely deeply regret it.

94
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:40,857
Don't worry.

95
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:43,697
I just consider him

96
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,857
as a long dead one

97
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:46,696
who recently came back to life.

98
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:47,696
I'm a bit unused to it.

99
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,176
Alright.

100
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,296
I thought you didn't know
how to face him.

101
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:53,696
He's a stranger.

102
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:54,776
Pay him no attention.

103
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:56,897
Let's go.

104
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:58,457
Accompany me to a place.

105
00:04:58,616 --> 00:04:59,616
What place?

106
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:02,977
First step to win over my father-in-law.

107
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:03,817
Okay.

108
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:04,817
Conquer his stomach.

109
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:07,457
Let's go!

110
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,696
Chen Luzhou.

111
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:16,696
I think I know
how you'll look when you age.

112
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,057
How will I look?

113
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:21,136
A charming one.

114
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:25,136
You've fallen in love with me.

115
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,537
Then we should get married.

116
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:28,696
Indeed.

117
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,696
Why don't you propose to me now?

118
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,656
Maybe I'll agree on a whim.

119
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,256
Dear Chen Luzhou,

120
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:43,457
you...

121
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,537
Have some self-respect.

122
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:51,497
Do you still have

123
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,217
the puppy I gave you?

124
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,256
Of course, there it is.

125
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:56,176
Alright.

126
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,977
This is my first handmade craft.

127
00:05:58,537 --> 00:05:59,937
Keep it safe and don't lose it.

128
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:01,937
Stop nagging.

129
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:02,696
Okay.

130
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:03,817
Go out.

131
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:05,057
Leave it to me.

132
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,656
Go out.

133
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:13,817
Go to your place
after delivering the meal.

134
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:16,256
Aren't you afraid
your dad will break your leg?

135
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,776
Let him take care of himself first.

136
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:49,216
Hi, please sit here.

137
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:49,696
Thank you.

138
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:50,696
You're welcome.

139
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,817
Here, your favorite Da Hong Pao tea.

140
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:08,337
I quit tea long ago.

141
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,736
What happened in the past

142
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,897
was all my fault.

143
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,417
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:28,696
Otherwise?

145
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:33,136
I was too reckless

146
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,136
and unreliable

147
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:35,616
in my youth.

148
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:39,776
I didn't fulfill my responsibilities
as a father.

149
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:41,857
I pushed you to the limit

150
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,576
where you had no choice.

151
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,216
You could only tell me

152
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:47,057
the child was adopted by others.

153
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:52,977
Actually, I saw him

154
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,417
at my villa last year.

155
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:56,337
Really a handsome,

156
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:58,096
well-mannered,

157
00:07:58,656 --> 00:07:59,736
sensible and capable guy

158
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,136
with his own ideas.

159
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:04,057
You clearly raised him well.

160
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:08,497
All these years,

161
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:10,337
you've worked hard.

162
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,057
Now you're suddenly
saying these nice things,

163
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:17,617
so what's the point?

164
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,017
Actually, sending him to the orphanage

165
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:23,256
wasn't my original intention.

166
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:25,697
I went to look for him.

167
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:26,897
You know this.

168
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,897
I know.

169
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:31,496
I know you didn't remember

170
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:32,496
his looks.

171
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,977
I invited you over

172
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:42,937
to discuss

173
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,937
how I can make it up to you two.

174
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,096
Make it up?

175
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,577
How to make it up?

176
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,057
My villa.

177
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,096
Give it to him.

178
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:52,897
I'll do my best

179
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,096
to give him whatever I have.

180
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:02,937
Do you think he'll want it?

181
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,657
If he doesn't want it,

182
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:07,977
I will give it to Xu Zhi.

183
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,376
The two of them...

184
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:10,737
Fu Yuqing.

185
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:12,857
Bonding with your son

186
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,096
isn't that simple.

187
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,018
You give him something.

188
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,536
I nod and he'll agree.
It's not the case.

189
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,456
Luzhou isn't a child now.

190
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,057
He has his own cognition and judgment.

191
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:27,577
Right.

192
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:30,697
You're right.

193
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,817
Got anything else to say?

194
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,937
He and Xu Zhi

195
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:42,216
are quite well?

196
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,176
Whether they are well or not
doesn't seem to concern you.

197
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,496
If nothing else, I'll go.

198
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:18,698
Come.

199
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:19,817
Just in time, take a look.

200
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,017
My family's son-in-law.

201
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,096
Look,

202
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,336
he is handsome,

203
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:26,577
and has good grades

204
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,017
and remarkable cooking skills.

205
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:30,977
You made this?

206
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,096
Yes.

207
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,296
Not bad.

208
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:34,777
As long as Mr. Xu likes it.

209
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,017
Of course.

210
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,017
I'm not bragging.

211
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:39,176
Do you want to try it?

212
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:45,817
How is it?

213
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:51,456
Not bad.

214
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:53,737
When will you return to school?

215
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:54,497
No rush.

216
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:55,897
After you're discharged.

217
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,376
I'm getting discharged tomorrow.

218
00:10:59,057 --> 00:10:59,777
I am thinking

219
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,057
before you leave,

220
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,216
I'll make you a meal.

221
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,136
It'll be summer vacation

222
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,336
the next time you come back.

223
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,336
We may not return this summer.

224
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:08,657
What's wrong?

225
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:09,817
Planning to elope?

226
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:12,256
Mr. Xu, I got
a drone photography project,

227
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:13,617
and may not return.

228
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:14,416
But Xu Zhi

229
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:15,496
can come back.

230
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:17,577
Didn't we agree on it last night?

231
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,577
I'll go with you.

232
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,057
I didn't agree with you.

233
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,977
Don't get involved
in the children's matters.

234
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:27,096
Being a third wheel isn't appropriate.

235
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:29,017
Alright.

236
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,136
Right.

237
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,216
Anyway, after you go to Beijing,

238
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,017
study well.

239
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:38,216
If you run out of money, just call us.

240
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:40,376
You can call me as well.

241
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:40,777
Right.

242
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:42,336
Mr. Cai is rich.

243
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,496
Here.

244
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,577
This is the first time my daughter

245
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:04,176
brings her boyfriend home.

246
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,017
Just in time for the New Year.

247
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:07,697
These are

248
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,376
from Mr. Cai and me.

249
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:11,296
No need, Mr. Xu.

250
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:11,737
I...

251
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:12,577
Take it.

252
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,017
Take it.

253
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:15,256
If not,

254
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:16,977
Xu Zhi won't get her share again.

255
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:18,657
Take it.

256
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:20,817
Take it.

257
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:22,456
Alright.

258
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:23,977
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

259
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:24,977
Thank you, Mr. Cai.

260
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,096
So, this extra one is...

261
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:31,937
The extra one is from Mr. Cai.

262
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:33,857
But there are three.

263
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,857
You mean this one.

264
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:41,617
It's from...

265
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:43,657
Right.

266
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:49,657
I'll keep yours.

267
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:51,456
Let him take his back.

268
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,817
There's no money in it.

269
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:55,256
Not money?

270
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:56,536
Then what is it?

271
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,617
Just open it and check it out.

272
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:06,166
(Happiness)

273
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,096
Feeling good?

274
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,256
Neither my dad nor Mr. Cai
ever gave me this much.

275
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:16,777
Why should I feel good?

276
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,617
Will this money be mine?

277
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:19,937
On the right track.

278
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,376
As expected of my boyfriend.

279
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:24,657
It is for sure.

280
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,496
Open it and check it out.

281
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,897
I will open it.

282
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:37,897
Just open it.

283
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:39,536
Is that okay?

284
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,657
Of course, we have no secrets.

285
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,256
Why give you this?

286
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,577
What else?

287
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:46,577
A check?

288
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,096
He wants to make it up to you.

289
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,977
He should at least show some sincerity.

290
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:54,817
After all those years of neglect,

291
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,376
(Boxing tickets)
giving money is the least he could do.

292
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:00,577
Is he good to you?

293
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:04,536
Pretty good.

294
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:06,536
Before,

295
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,017
my mom often traveled for work.

296
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:09,737
My dad was busy with work.

297
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,577
It was Mr. Fu who played with me.

298
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,017
He taught me how to ride a motorcycle.

299
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,577
He's very patient.

300
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:17,577
And he spoke humorously.

301
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,817
When I was bullied before,
he always stood up for me.

302
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,536
Then something happened to our family.

303
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,336
Those years were the toughest.

304
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,817
He helped us a lot

305
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,136
with dealing with the bullies.

306
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,057
So,

307
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,216
when I heard my dad
say that about Mr. Fu,

308
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:36,017
I can't believe he was bad before.

309
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:38,897
Reformed man.

310
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:41,577
I don't believe it.

311
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,577
You have already known
what's inside, right?

312
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,496
Do you want to see him then?

313
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,416
Of course not.

314
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:13,017
Why did you buy him boxing tickets?

315
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,017
I'm just out of options.

316
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,096
After thinking it over,

317
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:19,657
I can simply

318
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,577
let him give me a beating,

319
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:23,937
and vent his anger on me.

320
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,296
After that, it'll be over.

321
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:31,376
This kid has quite a good physique.

322
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:32,977
I heard that

323
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:34,216
he plays basketball daily.

324
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,336
How's your physique?

325
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,536
My physique isn't bad either.

326
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:40,657
I'm in the prime of life.

327
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,216
Just kidding.

328
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,096
Didn't I give him two tickets?

329
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:49,296
Let him bring Xu Zhi along.

330
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,216
As long as Xu Zhi comes,

331
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,817
he'll definitely hold back.

332
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,496
How could I possibly defeat him?

333
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,057
I feel like

334
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,376
he probably won't bother with you.

335
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:00,697
Impossible.

336
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:03,697
He's my son.

337
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:04,937
I have a mental connection.

338
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:07,376
He'll definitely bring Xu Zhi along.

339
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,176
Alright.

340
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,376
Good luck.

341
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,336
I hope he won't beat me to a pulp.

342
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:21,977
Mr. Xu is discharged tomorrow.

343
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,857
The custom crutch will arrive tomorrow.

344
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:25,376
I've borrowed the SUV

345
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,456
from Zhu Yangqi's family.

346
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,617
Mr. Xu can be comfortable.

347
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,136
You and Cai Yingying

348
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:30,857
are responsible for tidying up the ward.

349
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:34,577
Alright. My boyfriend is so considerate.

350
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:37,296
He's truly smitten with me.

351
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,136
Is it possible that

352
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,657
I am smitten with Mr. Xu instead?

353
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:41,897
Luzhou, don't be cheeky.

354
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,416
I'm serious.

355
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,416
How about this?

356
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:47,176
I won't pretend.

357
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,256
Let's lay it all out.

358
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,496
From now on,

359
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:50,216
you love me,

360
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:51,296
I love Mr. Xu,

361
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:52,057
and Mr. Xu loves you.

362
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:54,136
We three will conserve energy.

363
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,496
Are you silly?

364
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:57,777
Not as silly as you.

365
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:58,496
You're silly.

366
00:16:58,577 --> 00:16:59,577
You're the silliest.

367
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:03,416
Alright.

368
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:04,697
Better go back now.

369
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,017
Recently you've been at my place.

370
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,017
Your dad knows that.

371
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:08,336
How did he find out?

372
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,336
I told you that you're silly.

373
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:12,657
He calls your house every night

374
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:14,176
to see if you've come home

375
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:15,176
and what time you return.

376
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:17,176
You didn't get any calls.

377
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:18,376
No, I didn't.

378
00:17:33,256 --> 00:17:33,858
Hello, Dad.

379
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,216
I was just finishing my homework.

380
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,617
Chen Luzhou.

381
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:44,456
Just call me brother.

382
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:46,536
I can't stand you calling me Dad.

383
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:48,256
And you're really silly.

384
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,176
You're really boring.

385
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:52,777
Is it over or not?

386
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:54,017
Alright.

387
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,256
Xu Zhi's boyfriend

388
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,096
is the biggest fool in the world.

389
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:58,096
Is that okay?

390
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:04,017
Otherwise, you go

391
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,577
to pick up Mr. Xu tomorrow.

392
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:07,937
I have something.

393
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:12,737
Xu and I will cook at home
and wait for you.

394
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,057
Big fool.

395
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,136
It startled me.

396
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,904
(Boxing tickets)

397
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,057
Did Chen Luzhou not come?

398
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,416
He has something to settle.

399
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,536
Then will you pick him up later?

400
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:52,738
We agreed that

401
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:54,536
we cook and wait for him at home.

402
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:55,977
Still coming to eat?

403
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,657
Then I have to take a round
at the market.

404
00:18:58,657 --> 00:18:59,657
Be careful.

405
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,336
Don't waste the things on the table.

406
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:03,697
Take all the fruits and flowers.

407
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:04,336
I want all.

408
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,496
I'll take them back.

409
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:05,777
Okay.

410
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,697
Bye, Mr. Xu.

411
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:07,697
Bye.

412
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,017
Despite his situation,

413
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,017
he goes to buy food.

414
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,096
He really treats Chen Luzhou
as his own son.

415
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:15,817
He can't be his son.

416
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,176
I was scared to death before.

417
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:18,296
Exactly.

418
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,617
I almost became
childhood sweethearts with him.

419
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:21,176
Oh, my.

420
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,057
Come on.

421
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:23,296
Childhood sweethearts?

422
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,737
I'll provide services for you two?

423
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:27,376
Then...

424
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:28,737
Do you want to take a break?

425
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:30,376
I'll finish up.

426
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:31,977
Please go ahead.

427
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,508
(Sky Map Boxing)

428
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:00,017
Why didn't Xu Zhi come?

429
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:01,857
She went to pick up Mr. Xu.

430
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,336
Well.

431
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:10,017
Shall we talk somewhere else then?

432
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:11,937
Chicken out?

433
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:15,137
Weren't you prepared for being beaten

434
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,256
after giving me the tickets?

435
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:33,697
Come on.

436
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,737
Come on.

437
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,216
Nice punch.

438
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,536
This punch is for my mom.

439
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,136
Your fist is quite hard.

440
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:51,376
Come on, continue.

441
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,136
Hit me.

442
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,657
What about the punch for yourself?

443
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,657
Is it fun, Fu Yuqing?

444
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,657
Some things can't be fixed
with a few punches.

445
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:43,456
The best way for us to get along

446
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,536
is to never meet again.

447
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,057
Luzhou.

448
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:51,536
I really

449
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:54,216
never thought

450
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:57,176
of abandoning you.

451
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,096
I went to the orphanage to look for you.

452
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,136
Really.

453
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,136
So what?

454
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,336
Should I thank you?

455
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,456
Fu Yuqing.

456
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,136
Just because you're a scumbag,

457
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,416
my mom has been biased against me.

458
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,536
When I said an extra word to a girl,

459
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:21,857
she thought I would be like you,

460
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:23,536
full of deceitful intentions.

461
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,017
It's also because of you

462
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:29,536
I was sent to the orphanage.

463
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:32,256
I faced endless criticism there.

464
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,176
I hadn't known you
for my first 18 years.

465
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:47,136
But you messed up my life.

466
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:48,577
Do you understand?

467
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,336
Now you bought two boxing tickets

468
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,617
to let me punch you a few times.

469
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,657
Do you think it'll change anything?

470
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:33,017
Forget it.

471
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:35,977
I can forgive you.

472
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:39,977
But that's irrelevant to you.

473
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:42,977
It's because Xu Zhi told me

474
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:44,376
that you treat her well.

475
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:47,256
She likes you very much.

476
00:23:48,857 --> 00:23:50,136
I don't want her to be caught

477
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:51,136
in the middle.

478
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:56,257
Don't try to make up

479
00:23:56,257 --> 00:23:57,416
for our relationship.

480
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,096
You'll only be her uncle.

481
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:02,577
You will always be

482
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:04,496
her uncle.

483
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:09,937
If you want to make it up,

484
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:11,336
then that person isn't me.

485
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:13,857
It's Lian Hui.

489
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,376

How come Luzhou is still not back yet?

514
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,176
You've mentioned him three times.

515
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:51,937
Why keep bringing up my boyfriend?

516
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,817
He is more charming than you.

517

Hold on.

518
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:58,536

525
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,617
I can eat it until next year.

526
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,857
Be content, Yingying.

527
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:13,336
She only gave me a crab shell.

528
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,336
Serves you right.

529
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:16,057
You haven't been married off yet.

Right.

Where should I
put the things Luzhou brought?

539
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:41,176
Just put them there.

540

You brought so many things.

You're too kind.

542
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,416
Why buy things?

543
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,216
You're so kind.

544
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:46,657
No.

545
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:47,577
I brought some fruit.

546
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:48,296
You sit there.

547
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:49,376
Hurry up.

00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:50,738

00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,496
Luzhou, this is my son, Wei Lin.

551
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:53,057
Hello.

552
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,057
Luzhou.

553
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,057
Pour him a drink.

554
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:56,136
Okay.

555
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,136
Do you want orange juice?

556
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,176
Thank you. I'll do it myself.

557
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:00,176
It's okay, I'll do it.

558
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:01,777
Uncle, Auntie, have a seat.

559
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:02,376

00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:03,496
You sit first.

561

It's my home.

562
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:06,536
Sit down.

00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:07,777

the head.

566
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:09,777
Thank you.

567
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:10,977
Thank you.

568
00:28:12,136 --> 00:28:13,136

569
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:14,018
No dish is missing.

570
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:15,336
Slow down.

571
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:16,217
It's okay.

572
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:17,336
No need to help.

573
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:23,256
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

574
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,136
Here.

575
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,136
Luzhou.

576
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:28,697
You said you'll cook Kung Pao Chicken?

577
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:29,376
There's chicken.

578
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,376
What about the peanuts?

579
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,416
You sit first.

580
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:34,737
Zhi told me

581
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:38,336
that you are a bit allergic to peanuts.

582
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:39,897
Then starting from today,

583
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:41,256
Xu's Kung Pao Chicken

584
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:42,376
no longer has peanuts.

585
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:43,657
Come on.

586
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:45,216
Have a taste.

587
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,577
Your father-in-law is thoughtful.

588
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:52,817
Okay.

589
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:06,296
How's the taste?

590
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:07,136
Delicious.

591
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:07,977
Delicious, right?

592
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:08,577
Alright.

593
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:10,577
Then this plain stir-fried chicken

594
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:11,737
is especially for you.

595
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:17,136
Aren't fathers-in-law
picky about sons-in-law?

596
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:18,416
I think Mr. Xu

597
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:20,777
treats Luzhou better than Xu Zhi.

598
00:29:21,256 --> 00:29:22,256
Of course not.

599
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,737
The first time I met him,

600
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:24,618
I found him annoying.

601
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:26,496
He mysteriously came
to register with me,

602
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:28,376
and even gave me a red envelope, right?

603
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:29,777
Wait.

604
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,897
Did he see you for a check-up?

605
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:33,617
Luzhou registered for andrology?

606
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:36,057
Yes.

607
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:40,978
You kid.

608
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:42,017
It was a misunderstanding.

609
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,617
All the indicators were very normal.

610
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:46,777
Luzhou, keep it up.

611
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,977
Then here's to everyone's good health.

612
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:53,977
- Good health.
- Good health.

613
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:55,416
Good health.

614
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:56,416
Dreams come true.

615
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:18,577
Don't be mad.

616
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:20,697
Xu didn't mean it.

617
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,017
He told me everything.

618
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:25,456
You were injured playing ball.

619
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:26,817
You're in great health.

620
00:30:28,817 --> 00:30:29,817
He really said that?

621
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:32,496
I hope he did say so.

622
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:39,496
Stop messing around.

623
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:42,536
Then I'll head back.

624
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:44,777
Xu had drunk a lot today.

625
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:46,456
I'm afraid he'll wake up at night.

626
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:47,377
It's hard for him.

627
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:48,416
I'll go take care of him.

628
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:51,256
You're not allowed to go.

629
00:30:52,296 --> 00:30:53,296
Let him hold it in.

630
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,496
What about the promised love for Xu?

631
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,296
I can't afford to love.

(becoming a stable pillar
of the global economy,)

647
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:44,296
(and a growth engine.)

648
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,376
(According to
the latest published data,)

649
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:48,657
(our country's GDP last year)

650
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,657

(Morning news)
What's for lunch?

653
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,296
Lunch?

654
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:56,817
Should we ask Chen Luzhou?

655
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,018
If he comes to eat,

656
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,657
I can still go buy some food now.

657
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,577
Does he still have the nerve
to see you now?

658
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:03,617
He is so sensitive

659
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,617
and shy.

660
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,376
Isn't it because
you publicly punished him?

661
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:10,057
It's actually good for boys
to be sensitive.

662
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:14,617
Slow down.

663
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:16,456
Are your socks on wrong side?

664
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:17,617
No.

665
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:18,737
It's all good.

666
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:20,496
I'll go out with him in a while.

667
00:32:20,657 --> 00:32:22,496
Buy some stuff to take back to school.

668
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:26,057
I think he is

669
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:27,057
quite impressive.

670
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:27,536
See,

671
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:29,697
you two spent the winter break together.

672
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:31,777
Still want to be together in Beijing?

673
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,617
Aren't you tired of it?

674
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:35,416
Of course not.

675
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:38,057
Come on.

676
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,456
Take these things

677
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:41,496
back.

678
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:42,296
What are they?

679
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,256
So mysterious.

680
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:44,256
See for yourself.

681
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,057
Take them.

682
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:01,216
I'll go to the kitchen

683
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:03,096
and reheat breakfast.

684
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,096
Are you happy now?

685
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,216
Yes.

686
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,737
We have a new family member,

687
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:18,697
but Xu still thinks of me.

688
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:19,697
Very happy.

689
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:21,617
That's good.

690
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:25,296
The dog previously named Lucy

691
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,577
seems to have found a family.

692
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,456
Why does it sound like you're scolding?

693
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:31,456
Not at all.

694
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:35,017
Do you know what

695
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:36,577
the happiest thing is in the world?

696
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:37,817
No idea.

697
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:39,096
It's that

698
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:41,496
everyone else on this street is single,

699
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:42,897
but we're in a relationship.

700
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:43,657
Right?

701
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,096
Be a decent one.

702
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:46,336
Say less if you don't want

703
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:47,416
to get beaten up.

704
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:52,176
Do you know what

705
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:53,697
the most tragic thing is in the world?

706
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:56,737
It's that everyone has an umbrella,

707
00:33:56,977 --> 00:33:58,096
but we don't.

708
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,536
(Because of someone's presence,)

709
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,176
(I no longer hate the rain.)

710
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:22,937
Why did you come here?

711
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,778
You won't come over.

712
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:26,897
So, I have to come find you.

713
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:30,496
Let's eat before school starts.

714
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,336
I...

715
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,697
Open the door.

716
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:36,216
I've been waiting.

717
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:49,897
Bring the food inside.

718
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:21,456
Just order takeout.

719
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:22,937
How can that be okay?

720
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:23,818
I'm here.

721
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:25,017
So, we must cook and eat.

722
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:26,897
That's the healthy way.

723
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,657
Don't cut your hand
when chopping those vegetables.

724
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:34,817
You're underestimating me.

725
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:38,216
Several of Ms. Mei's signature dishes

726
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:39,416
were taught by me.

727
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,256
You sure know

728
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,216
how to boast.

729
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,376
I heard that...

730
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,857
I heard you went to find him.

731
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,216
What did he say?

732
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,376
He sought my forgiveness.

733
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:07,737
What else could he say?

734
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:10,777
What about you?

735
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:16,496
I forgave him

736
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:19,096
for Xu Zhi's sake.

737
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:23,096
Did you hit him then?

738
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:26,456
I did.

739
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:28,176
For both you and myself.

740
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,136
I beat him up well.

741
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,296
Did you break his hand then?

742
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:45,617
That's good then.

743
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:47,577
Last time he told me that

744
00:36:47,577 --> 00:36:47,978
in the future,

745
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,336
Fu Yu Villa is yours.

746
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,176
You should leave him one hand
to sign the contract.

747
00:36:57,336 --> 00:36:58,777
I'm not interested in that.

748
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:01,536
Are you stupid?

749
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,336
If you're not interested,

750
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:05,017
you can leave it to Xu Zhi.

751
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:20,897
Let me do it.

752
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:24,057
What are you doing?

753
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,536
Cooking.

754
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:27,057
It'll be dawn when you're done.

755
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:29,456
Wait,

756
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,496
where did you learn your skills?

757
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,897
When my future father-in-law was hurt,

758
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:34,897
I cooked every day.

759
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:37,216
Stop making things up.

760
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:38,496
What future father-in-law?

761
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,737
Xu Zhi hasn't agreed to marry you yet.

762
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:42,296
Too overconfident.

763
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:43,737
How do you know she's unwilling?

764
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:46,096
Do you know her well?

765
00:37:49,897 --> 00:37:50,336
Right,

766
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:52,897
when you went to Beijing
to pick up Chen Xingqi,

767
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:54,536
what did you say to Xu Zhi?

768
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:56,977
You're close to her.

769
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:58,136
Go ask her.

770
00:37:58,817 --> 00:37:59,817
I don't know.

771
00:38:00,977 --> 00:38:01,416
Forget it.

772
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:02,617
Turn down the heat.

773
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:03,058
The pot will burn.

774
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:04,937
Stop making trouble for me, okay?

775
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:06,296
Just sit and wait for the meal.

776
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:07,136
Stir quickly.

777
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:07,938
It's going to burn.

778
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:09,296
Look, it's smoking.

779
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:10,657
Hurry up.

780
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:11,497
Hurry up.

781
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,737
Alright, you do it.

782
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,456
(Chen Xingqi)
(It's hard to find an essay book)

783
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:29,817
(without Luzhou's essay in it.)

784
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,416
(Chen Luzhou.)

785
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:33,697
(Give me a way out.)

786
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:39,496
(There is no real despair,)

787
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,456
(only prisoners of their thoughts.)

788
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,520
(There is no real despair,
only prisoners of their thoughts.)

789
00:38:58,176 --> 00:38:59,176
What are you looking at?

790
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,136
You've fallen in love with me.

791
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:08,256
Here we go again.

792
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:15,857
Are you childish or not?

793
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:17,336
Not as childish as you.

794
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:19,617
The puppy wags its tail.

795
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,136
I downloaded a movie.

796
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:27,136
I heard it makes everyone cry.

797
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:28,456
Do you want to watch it?

798
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,577
No.

799
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:31,456
That's no fun.

800
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,456
Use it to discipline me?

801
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:37,376
Who is it?

802
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,017
Ms. Qu.

803
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:39,058
She wants me

804
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:41,096
to share College Entrance
Examination experiences

805
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,657
at Ruijun School's
coming-of-age ceremony.

806
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:44,296
I would like to hear

807
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:45,777
your speech.

808
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:48,296
On the 21st?

809
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:50,977
I might be in Beijing by then.

810
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,456
Professor Bai asked Li Ke and me

811
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,937
to conduct an exchange on the college
math modeling competition.

812
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,977
But your speech is also important.

813
00:39:57,977 --> 00:39:59,697
Stop, did you forget what I said?

814
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:03,456
Chen Luzhou, let's move forward for now.

815
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:07,456
Alright.

816
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,697
See you at school.

817
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:14,937
(Being youth, welcome new semester)

818
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:18,697
Next, let's welcome the outstanding
graduate representative, Xu Zhi,

819
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:19,697
to the stage to speak.

820
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:30,817
Learning is limitless,
hardship is the vessel.

821
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:32,496
Plum blossoms' fragrance
arises from the bitter cold.

822
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:34,897
As long as we don't stop moving forward,

823
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:36,817
we can see the light of dawn.

824
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,777
Does anyone want to oppose me
when I say this?

825
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,096
Please.

826
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:43,657
The light of dawn remains still.

827
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:45,096
We can see it while lying down.

828
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,416
That's right.

829
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:48,256
When I sat below the stage like you,

830
00:40:48,256 --> 00:40:49,096
I would also think

831
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,416
why we are sitting here

832
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:51,416
while listening to this.

833
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:56,336
So today, let's talk
something practical.

834
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:00,937
Like how late we can stay up
without looking

835
00:41:01,456 --> 00:41:02,617
as if we are haunted

836
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,176
by a ghost.

837
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:06,136
Like how late we can be

838
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:07,336
before the braised ribs

839
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:09,057
in the second-floor cafeteria

840
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,577
lose the appeal to us.

841
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,999
(Go for it, Zhi)

842
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:19,096
After discussing practical ones,

843
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,416
let's move on to forbidden ones.

844
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,057
For example, young love.

845
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:28,937
I know this is a sensitive word.

846
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,176
Avoiding the topic won't

847
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:32,416
make it disappear, right?

848
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:35,376
However, I personally believe

849
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:37,017
that you should spend

850
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:38,216
precious three years

851
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,577
of high school on studying.

852
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,336
Because this seems to be

853
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:43,697
the most cost-effective
and rewarding thing to do.

854
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:44,697
Of course.

855
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,817
If you unfortunately fall in love,

856
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:48,176
don't feel ashamed either.

857
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:49,337
Because liking someone

858
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:51,536
is never a shameful thing.

859
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,617
You can turn your affection
into a motivation.

860
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:56,777
But you can't let others'
lack of affection make

861
00:41:56,777 --> 00:41:57,937
you feel sorry for yourself.

862
00:41:57,937 --> 00:42:00,496
Because he might only like himself.

863
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:05,017
The above statements
only represent my personal viewpoint,

864
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:06,456
not related to the school's position.

865
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,376
Please don't record videos,

866
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,657
and don't upload them online.

867
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:12,456
If it accidentally goes viral,

868
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,456
Ruijun School will raise
the tuition fees.

869
00:42:14,777 --> 00:42:16,296
Then it will be tough for you all.

870
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:18,697
Anyway, just kidding.

871
00:42:18,697 --> 00:42:20,057
I still want to say

872
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,216
a bit pretentious but sincere words.

873
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:23,658
When I was a first-year student,

874
00:42:23,658 --> 00:42:25,336
I also went through a low point.

875
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,857
I felt very bleak about the future
at that time.

876
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:30,136
And no matter what I did,

877
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,256
I felt no enthusiasm.

878
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:33,657
Later, I accidentally heard a saying.

879
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:35,937
There is no real despair,

880
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:38,057
only prisoners of their thoughts.

881
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:46,657
At that moment, I understood

882
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:48,256
we can be very small.

883
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:49,657
But we can also be great.

884
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:53,937
If your hearts are like steel,

885
00:42:53,937 --> 00:42:56,096
then they will heat up
fiercely in the sun.

886
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:58,017
As long as the sun rises,

887
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,376
we will always have the future.

888
00:43:00,336 --> 00:43:01,977
In those rainy days,

889
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:03,777
we can wring out our clothes.

890
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:04,817
It can still go on.

891
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:06,057
As for whether it's happy

892
00:43:06,057 --> 00:43:07,136
or sad,

893
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,536
or with hopefulness,

894
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:09,857
or without expectations,

895
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:11,176
we can get through it.

896
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:13,897
In the end,
it is us who choose the world,

897
00:43:13,897 --> 00:43:15,817
and not the world that chooses us.

898
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:17,977
Finally, I'd like to share a phrase.

899
00:43:17,977 --> 00:43:19,336
It's my boyfriend's favorite.

900
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:25,336
There are endless ages and vast lands.

901
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,017
The future is bright,
and the days ahead are long.

902
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:29,216
Thank you.

903
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:31,577
Zhi is the best.

904
00:43:31,697 --> 00:43:32,977
Zhi is the greatest.

905
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:40,176
How did your senior Xu Zhi
do with her speech?

906
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:41,657
Good.

907
00:43:42,216 --> 00:43:44,096
You could only hear part of it.

908
00:43:44,336 --> 00:43:46,456
Alright, let's proceed to the next one.

909
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:49,536
Brave through thorns to move forward.

910
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:52,777
Sing and move on without hesitation.

911
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:55,577
All third-year students,
please stand up.

912
00:43:57,817 --> 00:43:58,937
Raise your right fist.

913
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:02,577
I swear in the name of youth.

914
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:05,697
I swear in the name of youth.

915
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:07,536
In our youthful days.

916
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:10,057
In our youthful days.

917
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:11,937
At eighteen, we have our aspirations.

918
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,096
At eighteen, we have our aspirations.

919
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:15,737
The splendor of youth.

920
00:44:15,937 --> 00:44:17,456
The splendor of youth.

921
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:19,017
Assuming great responsibilities.

922
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:20,697
Assuming great responsibilities.

923
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,136
Our dreams set sail.

924
00:44:22,136 --> 00:44:23,977
Didn't we agree to move forward?

925
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:25,057
Why look back now?

926
00:44:25,657 --> 00:44:27,857
I just happened to find
a discounted plane ticket.

927
00:44:28,536 --> 00:44:29,617
So I thought I'd come back.

928
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:31,096
Reimbursable, Zhi?

929
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:32,096
In your dreams.

930
00:44:33,697 --> 00:44:35,336
Right here for the announcement.

931
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:37,096
It's worth it.

932
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:42,216
Spur on to forge a brilliant future.

933
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:45,536
Spur on to forge a brilliant future.
