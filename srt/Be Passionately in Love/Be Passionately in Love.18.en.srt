(If There Were Only One Rose in the World)

18
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,710
I can't just leave right now.

19
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,991
Are you still mad?

20
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,351
Then go back and be mad.

21
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:46,751
If it doesn't work,

22
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,150
run two laps on the field.

23
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm leaving.

24
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,150
Hold on.

25
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,791
Give me the hair tie.

26
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,510
What hair tie?

27
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,070
Close the door.

28
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:43,710
(I promised you.)

29
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,150
(If I spend money on you,
I'll write an 8,000-word essay.)

30
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,590
(I paid for the karaoke tonight.)

31
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,550
(I'll only write)

32
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,791
(hundreds of words.)

33
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,190
(You take a look.)

34
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,911
(During the summer vacation,)

35
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:01,710
(I actually met your mom once.)

36
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:03,751
(But I never told you.)

37
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,030
(Don't worry.)

38
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,030
(She didn't say anything harsh to me)

39
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,550
(or throw money at me.)

40
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,670
(But that's a pity.)

41
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,311
(Your mom is a bit stingy.)

42
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,030
(But from her words, I could feel)

43
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,150
(she loves you very much.)

44
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,230
(She cares about you.)

45
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,911
(She kept saying she had a good son.)

46
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,070
(Your mom also said)

47
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,510
(we're in a relationship)

48
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,911
(on spur of the moment.)

49
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,070
(Rest assured.)

50
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:35,831
(I immediately refuted her on this.)

51
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,991
(Then she remained silent.)

52
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,511
(But at that time,
we had known each other)

53
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,030
(for only a month by then.)

54
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:49,110
(It's easy to be impulsive
in early stage of love.)

55
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,190
(Nobody can predict what will happen.)

56
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,871
(So in the end,)

57
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,110
(I never tried to persuade you to stay.)

58
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,271
(Back then, I was afraid
that if I pushed you,)

59
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:04,070
(you would fall out with your family.)

60
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,271
(When you cooled down later)

61
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,831
(and realized
I wasn't as good as you thought,)

62
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,710
(you might feel regret.)

63
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:13,630
(So at that time,)

64
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:15,271
(I didn't dare to call you)

65
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,791
(or say I missed you.)

66
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,831
(I didn't want you to gamble for me.)

67
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,230
(Nor did I want you
to be seen as ungrateful.)

68
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,150
(Chen Luzhou.)

69
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,791
(If I simply want)

70
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,431
(to date you,)

71
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,271
(I can make it sound more charming.)

72
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,471
(I admit)

73
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:46,751
(that's very romantic.)

74
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,590
(But I want to go further with you.)

75
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,431
(I always feel)

76
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,591
(that love is not)

77
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,710
(all about reckless impulse
and romance.)

78
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,431
(Love should also make people brave)

79
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,110
(and strong.)

80
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,230
(Do you remember the exhibition
during the summer vacation?)

81
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,951
(Actually, after we broke up,)

82
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,190
(I went to see it.)

83
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,590
(That sculptor has vividly expressed)

84
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,431
(what the strongest love is.)

85
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:43,950
(By this,)

86
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,230
(I'd like to say something.)

87
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,991
(If there were only one last rose
in the world,)

88
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,430
(I would rush forward
and grab it for you)

89
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,311
(even if I were aged 80
and in a wheelchair.)

90
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,791
(After all,)

91
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,150
(my boyfriend Shy Boy Chen)

92
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,710

Why did you come back again?

109
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,190
I think you know why.

110
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,591
My mom didn't give you money.

111
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,791
Were you quite sad about it?

112
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:57,150
I didn't feel sad

113
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,511
or disappointed.

114
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,470
I just wondered
why she wasn't playing by the rules.

115
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,270
I thought about what to say.

116
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,390
What would you say?

117
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,430
I would say,

118
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,390
"I'm pregnant with Chen Luzhou's baby,"

119
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,511
"and I'll have this child."

120
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,111
"The money you gave me is not enough
for the child support"

121
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,350
"and emotional injury."

122
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:20,751
"Give me more, anyway."

123
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:25,190
"When our child grows up,
and I don't spend it all,"

124
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,470
"I'll return the rest to you."

125
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,831
You love to tease me, huh?

126
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,430
You're quite tolerant.

127
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,951
Just because of what my mom said,

128
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,070
you only called me once.

129
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:37,951
Did you really miss me?

130
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,030
Did you really miss me?

131
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,311
If you did,

132
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,831
why would you call me once?

133
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,190
You said I was not good. I...

134
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,511
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,591
Why did you say those things

136
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:57,030
after I left?

137
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,270
Aren't you still angry?

138
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,470
Your short essay is quite good.

139
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,430
To be honest,

140
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:18,751
did you like me

141
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,110
when you first saw me?

142
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:23,711
If I say no,

143
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,190
you probably won't believe me.

144
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,631
But truly, I didn't.

145
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,390
Do you still remember our first meeting?

146
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,270
Back then, you lived downstairs
from Tan Xu's house.

147
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,552
Your mom scolded you,

148
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:44,056
as you didn't do well on exams.
She wanted to send you abroad.

149
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,391
At that time,

150
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,911
I didn't dare to approach you.

151
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,030
I was afraid you were like Tan Xu,

152
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,110
blaming everything
for doing badly on exams.

153
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,230
And when others do well,

154
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,751
you would feel jealous.

155
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:58,030
At that time, I thought

156
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,871
18 or 19-year-old boys were dull.

157
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,070
They can do nothing but the exams.

158
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,551
So at that time,

159
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,951
I rarely mentioned scores to you.

160
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:11,991
But later, I discovered

161
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,230
that not all 18 or 19-year-old boys

162
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,551
are that dull.

163
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,110
So,

164
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,430
you are praising me?

165
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:22,591
I'm indeed praising you.

166
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,230
Tan Xu came to me and said

167
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,430
the pressure of repeating the year
was too much for him.

168
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:36,470
He wanted to be motivated in Huaguang.

169
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,831
I didn't tell you

170
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,150
as you didn't care about

171
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,350
the matters of Jiang Yu.

172
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,631
There's a big gap
between Tan Xu and Jiang Yu.

173
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:46,791
Yangqi can't compare with Jiang Yu.

174
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:48,831
I thought you didn't care.

175
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,350
I think Zhu Yangqi is more handsome
than Jiang Yu.

176
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:53,551
Really?

177
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:54,632
I guess

178
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:56,511
you think too highly of Zhu Yangqi.

179
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,230
Previously, we didn't go steady.

180
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,951
But now,

181
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,951
if Tan Xu finds you again,
what will you say?

182
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,270
I'll just tell him

183
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,711
that my boyfriend is the jealous type.

184
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,831
It's hard to please him.

185
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,190
I'll let him talk to you.

186
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,791
That's more like it.

187
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,470
Oh, by the way,

188
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,991
respond to Jiang Yu that way too.

189
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,350
No problem.

190
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:52,110
Hello, Lucy.

191
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,190
What's up?

192
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,350
Turn on the speaker.

193
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,390
Help, I can barely breathe.

194
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,350
What's wrong?
Is your clothing too tight?

195
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,230
No.

196
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:03,831
It's my girlfriend.

197
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:05,911
She just confessed to me.

198
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,591
Girlfriend?

199
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,911
You two are back together?

200
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:12,631
Good for you.

201
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,671
Without me

202
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,150
and Cai Yingying,

203
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,791
you'll never

204
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,911
win back Xu Zhi.

205
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:21,991
You bad boy.

206
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,190
Why don't you scold me again?

207
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:26,791
I even feel it's a bit unreal.

208
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,190
Alright.

209
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:30,911
I'm telling you, be serious.

210
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,711
Pay me for the taxi later.

211
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,911
We're stuck and haven't gone home yet.

212
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:36,311
I'm speechless.

213
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,591
I thought

214
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:38,591
you are popular,

215
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,791
but you need me
to help you pursue a girl. You loser.

216
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,672
- And thank me.
- You also owe Yingying.

217
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:43,871
Okay.

218
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,430
Send me the bill.

219
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,511
I have to go.

220
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,230
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

221
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,230
Finally.

222
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,390
It's too late.

223
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:01,144
(Gaoxing Art Training School)

224
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:03,350
Oh no, we can't get in.

225
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,791
Is there a back door?

226
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,591
Yes.

227
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:09,230
Where is it?

228
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,430
Over there.

229
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:11,671
Let's go.

230
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,110
Let's go.

231
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,390
It's here.

232
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,470
Take off your jacket.

233
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:28,671
What are you doing?

234
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,632
Come on.

235
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:32,751
Don't let your teacher

236
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,511
see it.

237
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,950
Are you kidding me?

238
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,511
Weren't you just saying I was heavy?

239
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,791
I'm strong enough to hold you.

240
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,871
Come on.

241
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:41,351
Well,

242
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:42,431
I'm doing it.

243
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:43,511
Go ahead.

244
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,551
Step on it.

245
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,911
Use your strength.

246
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,030
Go.

247
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,950
Don't look.

248
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,030
I won't look.

249
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,190
So high.

250
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,871
Put your foot over first.

251
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:03,390
Done.

252
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:04,390
Are you okay?

253
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,470
I'm fine.

254
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,831
Wait a moment.

255
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,591
Catch it.

256
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:12,551
Your bag.

257
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:18,831
Here's the jacket.

258
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,310
Put it on in case you get cold.

259
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,671
Okay.

260
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,310
I have to go.

261
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:27,470
Good night.

262
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,671
Alright, you too.

263
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,511
(You're too thin.)

264
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,511
(Be sure to eat more now.)

265
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,551
(Keep healthy for your exam.)

266
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,511
(I'm leaving.)

267
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:51,591
(Good night.)

268
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,310
(You also have to eat well.)

269
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,070
(After all, you're Stylish Zhu.)

270
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,230
(Do not diet.)

271
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,911
On the first day of dating, are you going
to scare your boyfriend away?

272
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:36,751
Eat in small bites.

273
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,990
Don't choke on it.

274
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,070
Here.

275
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,671
Xu Gongzhu and others
want to treat you to a meal.

276
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,070
They will thank you for the drone.

277
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:56,911
Forget it.

278
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,350
Last birthday, they almost beat me.

279
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,390
Were you scared?

280
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,551
Sure.

281
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,631
Why didn't you wear them before?

282
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,110
You know why.

283
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,190
Will you take them off?

284
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,430
It depends on how you behave.

285
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,230
Okay.

286
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,470
You wait and see.

287
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,711
Going to the library later?

288
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,791
I've been busy with calculus.

289
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,110
Other subjects are left behind.

290
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,270
Li Ke urged me again.

291
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,070
Look.

292
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:41,671
What time is it already?

293
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,791
Your major is really competitive.

294
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,270
The papers in College Entrance Exam
weren't the same.

295
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,711
The top students from different places
don't see eye to eye.

296
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,350
Now it's midterms,
and the papers are unified.

297
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,431
Everyone wants to see their level

298
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,511
and compete.

299
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,270
Go to the library with me later.

300
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,591
Then we need to hurry.

301
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,136
It's hard to secure a spot
when the top students are around.

302
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:11,871
Here.

303
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,390
How come

304
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,511
you two came together?

305
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,310
Tell me.

306
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,591
Where did you stay last night?

307
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,470
Let me tell you.

308
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,511
You haven't returned to the dorm
for two nights.

309
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,270
The dorms nearby have known it.

310
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,791
Really?

311
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:43,711
I guess

312
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,671
Zhao Tianqi and you got this out.

313
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,791
That's why there are so many gossips.

314
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,831
I didn't get this out.

315
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,070
Am I that kind of person?

316
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,711
Zhao Tianqi did it.

317
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:55,551
Okay.

318
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,310
Zhu Yangqi is here.

319
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,416
I have stayed with him
in a hotel for two days.

320
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,831
I barely believe it.

321
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:11,991
Be careful.

322
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:13,990
I have only one girlfriend.

323
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,070
Don't get hurt.

324
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:16,831
Let it cool for a while.

325
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,190
So, how many girlfriends do you want?

326
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:21,350
What?

327
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:22,991
You two

328
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,751
are together, right?

329
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,270
She's pretty clingy.

330
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,470
She insisted on coming here with me.

331
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,150
I hate being a third wheel.

332
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,551
Wait. Chen Luzhou.

333
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:41,911
Look at you.

334
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,591
You are bragging.

335
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:47,311
Sit down.

336
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:48,871
Can you find another seat?

337
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,591
What an amazing girl!

338
00:20:58,671 --> 00:20:59,791
Look at her mindset.

339
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,110
She's so calm.

340
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,390
Much better than you.

341
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,310
Am I the first one to know?

342
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,831
No.

343
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:11,631
The second one.

344
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,111
I called Zhu Yangqi

345
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:14,631
when we confirmed our relationship.

346
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:17,591
You're the third one.

347
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,911
Cai Yingying was with him.

348
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,230
Something's not right.

349
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,511
Weren't you staying with Zhu Yangqi

350
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,150
in the same hotel?

351
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:31,991
Did you need to call him?

352
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,110
I have a lot of phone credit.

353
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,470
Is that not okay?

354
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:40,751
Okay.

355
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,711
But I must remind you.

356
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,390
It's not easy to graduate from Huaguang.

357
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,030
Zhang Yuan from Hedong Province
asked me yesterday

358
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,951
about your math score
in College Entrance Examination.

359
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:54,350
He knows you won first prize
in national math and science contest.

360
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:56,030
He is watching you.

361
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,350
Stop worrying about it.

362
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:02,030
I have an excellent girlfriend.

363
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:03,711
Can I fall behind?

364
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:09,791
I think I know

365
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,871
how Xu Zhi won you over.

366
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:18,511
She's an agreeable girl, after all.

367
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:44,350
Good.

368
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,430
Good shot.

369
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,631
Good shot.

370
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:47,711
Let's go.

371
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:48,871
Bye-bye.

372
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,631
Okay, bye.

373
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:51,430
I have chocolates. Do you want them?

374
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,070
You're not losing weight?

375
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:54,951
No, I'm not.

376
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:57,070
Forget it.

377
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,350
My charm isn't affected by my weight.

378
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,591
Come on. Pass it to me.

379
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,030
Lucy.

380
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,711
How about we share an apartment?

381
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,230
I can't stand my two bizarre roommates.

382
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,760
Our schools are far apart.
How can we share an apartment?

383
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,911
It's okay. I'll compromise.

384
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,390
I can live near your school.

385
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,991
I don't have many classes.
It's convenient to play basketball.

386
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,030
Have you thought if it's okay for me?

387
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,551
Are you thinking of Zhi?

388
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,350
It's fine.

389
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,791
I can live with you two.

390
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,430
There's no problem.

391
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,871
Buddy, you're really straightforward.

392
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:32,911
Forget it.

393
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,591
I'll change my major in the second year.

394
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,390
I have a lot of courses to catch up on.

395
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,310
Living at school will be better.

396
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,190
Don't you think about me?

397
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,110
Commuting is allowed in the second year.

398
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,871
Then Ke and I will move out.

399
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,470
And he'll start a business.

400
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,591
You can live with us.

401
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:48,911
What do you think?

402
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,950
You're in our future plans.

403
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,310
Just be patient.

404
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,150
You said

405
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,991
I would have Tony, Andy, and Nancy.

406
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,431
You're the playboy, okay?

407
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:00,991
You have Zhi and Ke.

408
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,951
Look, you can't say things like that.

409
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,871
I can't compare with Xu Zhi.

410
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:07,990
Guess what score Zhi got

411
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,470
on the midterm calculus exam?

412
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,791
Perfect score.

413
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,711
She's the only one in the whole grade.

414
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,350
That's pretty impressive.

415
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,310
But Lucy can do better

416
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,672
than her.

417
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:19,791
Getting a perfect score

418
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,190
is a piece of cake for him.

419
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:22,591
You think too highly

420
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,150
of him.

421
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,511
He only scored 96, okay?

422
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,430
Are you not attractive enough?

423
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:33,831
Xu Zhi isn't much affected by dating.

424
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,070
Your energy got worse

425
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,511
than before.

426
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,430
What makes you say that?

427
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,350
Just tell me.

428
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,711
I got one point in the end.

429
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:44,991
Did you two score today?

430
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,751
Alright.

431
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:46,631
Alright.

432
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,632
Moreover,

433
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:49,270
Zhi is an amazing girl from Qingyi.

434
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:53,390
He is hopeless.

435
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:54,551
I can't stand him.

436
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:57,791
Let's go.

437
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:00,791
Hold on.

438
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,430
Here you go.

439
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,136
Will you come this weekend?

440
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,110
Will you come this weekend?

441
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,911
Why? Be the third wheel again?

442
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:13,591
I haven't bought you dinner
since Zhi and I were in a relationship.

443
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,751
So, come for dinner if you're free

444
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:16,432
this weekend.

445
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,951
We'll celebrate my birthday.

446
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:20,150
Aren't you two doing it alone?

447
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,150
If I celebrate my birthday in a
relationship after being single for long,

448
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,270
I'll let my girlfriend
get a big surprise for me.

449
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,791
Right?

450
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,831
Yeah.

451
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:28,911
Forget it.

452
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,591
I can't bother my girlfriend.

453
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:31,911
She is busy with drawing.

454
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,671
Preparing a surprise will be tiring.

455
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,950
Hey, you are so picky.

456
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,712
Cut it out.

457
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,470
You love ritual, don't you?

458
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,270
The point is,
Zhi's major is mentally draining.

459
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,190
Those seniors in her major even joked

460
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,151
that they can only

461
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,791
contribute to the nation
for five to ten years at most.

462
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,070
So far, how many times

463
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,390
has she stayed up
and how much coffee has she drunk?

464
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,751
In short, come over when you're free.

465
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:55,190
Okay?

466
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,950
Make my birthday

467
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,030
simple.

468
00:25:57,871 --> 00:25:59,470
Are you that considerate?

469
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,270
Then let's date.

470
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:02,591
Guess what?

471
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:04,591
The three of us work hard
to live a better life.

472
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,231
I'll join you.

473
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:06,990
The four of us go for it.

474
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,871
Go for it!

475
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:08,871
- Right?
- Get lost.

476
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:09,951
What do you say?

477
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,390
- Buddy.
- Get lost.

478
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,270
Your lunch has arrived.

479
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,591
Two sandwiches. You're welcome.

480
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,698
Look.

481
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:27,350
(College Mathematics, Total Score, 100)

482
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,350
I already know.

483
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,871
Very impressive.

484
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:32,951
I lost to you.

485
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,791
Let me think about how to punish you.

486
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,711
Think about it.

487
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,470
Speaking.

488
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:49,791
I'm in Beijing now.

489
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,511
I'm at the Tianjie Center.

490
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,190
Come to see me right now.

491
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,030
Are you kidding me?

492
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:56,591
I have to go.

493
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,470
So, did you miss me?

494
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:14,871
Chen Xingqi, are you serious?

495
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,190
What happened?

496
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,350
Chen Xingqi.

497
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,190
You finally came.

498
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,430
You dyed your hair?

499
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:28,671
Why did you do that?

500
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,230
I did it to anger our dad.

501
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,551
Did anyone mistake you
for a traffic light?

502
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,591
Speaking of which,
I remembered something.

503
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,390
When Dad was driving yesterday,

504
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,310
he almost hit me.

505
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,390
- He mistook me for a green light?
- I think he purposely wanted to hit you.

506
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,190
Who cares?

507
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:45,751
Anyway, I'm his only son now.

508
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,671
If I'm dead,

509
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:48,150
who will take care of him?

510
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,591
Why did you come here?

511
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,390
I just missed you.

512
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,631
Cut it out.

513
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,230
I missed you too.

514
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,390
Cut it out.

515
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:01,631
Luzhou,

516
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,190
I'm starving.

517
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,871
Come on.

518
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,951
I need food.

519
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,190
Take me to eat something.

520
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,310
Come on.

521
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,390
Stop it.

522
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:11,551
Take your stuff

523
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:12,150
yourself.

524
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,190
Okay.

525
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,270
Come on.

526
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,751
I want this, this,

527
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,310
and this.

528
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,390
Taro ball dessert without peanuts.

529
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,070
My brother is allergic to them.

530
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:27,591
What food you can't eat?

531
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:28,951
No dietary restrictions.

532
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,591
Alright then, thank you.

533
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:31,911
Okay.

534
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,511
Tell me.

535
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,671
Why are you here?

536
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:41,831
Come out.

537
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,230
Starting today,

538
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,110
I'm officially running away from home.

539
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:48,711
I can't leave this little turtle

540
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:49,552
to Chen Jishen.

541
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:51,511
From now on, you have it.

542
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,190
Treat it well.

543
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:56,310
Feed the turtle three times a week.

544
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,511
I'll take you back later.

545
00:28:58,751 --> 00:28:59,751
What are you doing?

546
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:00,911
Booking a ticket.

547
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:02,951
Give it to me.

548
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:04,831
Sit down.

549
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,150
Can I

550
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,470
be with you?

551
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,270
What?

552
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,270
I'm already broke.

553
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,350
How can I support you?

554
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,791
I'm easy to support.

555
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,511
Just give me food to eat.

556
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,030
If it doesn't work,

557
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,871
I can work and earn money.

558
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:27,671
Did Chen Jishen hit you?

559
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:31,070
After Mom moved out,

560
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,030
she never came to see me again.

561
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,591
Chen Jishen and I argued

562
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,671
every time we met.

563
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:45,030
He rarely came home

564
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,831
or scolded me at home.

565
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,512
Anyway,

566
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:51,711
I will never go back.

567
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:00,751
Listen to me.

568
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,070
Go back and go to school.

569
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,110
I'll see you when I'm free, okay?

570
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,430
You're lying.

571
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,991
You and Mom don't want me.

572
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,110
Mom.

573
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,350
Put your brother on.

574
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:31,150
Mom.

575
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,230
Chen Xingqi.

576
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,390
I can't believe you.

577
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,751
You actually bought a ticket

578
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:35,911
on my phone and ran away.

579
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,070
What if you get lost?

580
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,470
It's none of your business.

581
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:39,911
Chen Xingqi.

582
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,110
Lower your voice.

583
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,190
Behave.

584
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,350
I'll be there soon.

585
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,150
(Luzhou, we will talk privately)

586
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,230
(later.)

587
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:54,791
Zhi.

588
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,350
Help me watch him.

589
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,390
Which one?

590
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,230
Both of them.

591
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:03,350
You stay.

592
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,430
Where are you going?

593
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:05,871
To pick up my mom.

594
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:18,551
Zhi.

595
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:20,511
When did you
and my brother get together?

596
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,751
Kids don't ask about adult matters.

597
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,671
What stage are you at now?

598
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,110
At least,

599
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,671
you've held hands, right?

600
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,631
How's Qian doing lately?

601
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,190
She won an award
in a tennis match last week.

602
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,551
In this week's English speech game,

603
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,950
she won first place.

604
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,030
She's really amazing.

605
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,831
Then you should learn from her.

606
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,470
Put more effort into your studies,

607
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:44,270
and stop meddling in adult matters.

608
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,390
You haven't married my brother yet.

609
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,350
What?

610
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,711
Lecturing me now?

611
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,310
Why do you meddle in my business?

612
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,751
Can't I?

613
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,150
Where's your brother?

614
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:29,671
He's with Xu Zhi.

615
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,230
You and Xu Zhi...

616
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,310
We're good.

617
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:41,511
Well,

618
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,230
during summer vacation,

619
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,350
I went to see her.

620
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,150
I know.

621
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:56,591
If I cause trouble

622
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,511
for you

623
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:01,671
and her,

624
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,270
sorry about that.

625
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,230
What do you plan to do next?

626
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,751
Bring Chen Xingqi back to Qingyi
and hand him over to Chen Jishen?

627
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,511
Actually, I have no choice.

628
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,591
That's how the court ruled.

629
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,070
Sure, that's how the court ruled.

630
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,951
What if the court awards him to you?

631
00:33:23,591 --> 00:33:24,791
Will you abandon him too?

632
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,230
You've already abandoned me once.

633
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:39,110
The offer has arrived.

634
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,911
Yet you gave it up.

635
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,310
No further discussion.

636
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:44,951
Don't I get a say

637
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,430
on Luzhou's matter?

638
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:49,591
Just because of an accident?

639
00:33:50,951 --> 00:33:53,390
I'm Luzhou's biological mother.

640
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,791
I have already abandoned him once.

641
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,631
I won't abandon him again.

642
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:11,672
If I knew

643
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,310
he sent you to the orphanage,

644
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,350
I'd never have handed you over to him.

645
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:19,791
You mean...

646
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:21,951
Your biological father.

647
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:26,591
Don't be afraid.

648
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:33,831
Don't be afraid, Luzhou.

649
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:35,911
Call her mom.

650
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,030
(Nursing Department)
Call her mom.

651
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,390
Mom.

652
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:19,551
At that time, I had no work.

653
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,791
I had to look for a job while pregnant.

654
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:24,270
Later, I met Chen Jishen.

655
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,030
He was pretty good to me at that time.

656
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,991
The more important is

657
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:31,070
that he could accept you.

658
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,470
I thought

659
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,230
that was not bad.

660
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,711
At least I could give you a home.

661
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:44,030
Later, your biological father

662
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:45,631
somehow...

663
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:46,751
Well,

664
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,430
he went to Chen Jishen's company

665
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,951
and made a scene.

666
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:51,591
It was very unbearable.

667
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,990
He scolded me.

668
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,310
He asked me to hand you over to him.

669
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,511
He said he couldn't

670
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:58,592
let another man

671
00:35:58,672 --> 00:35:59,991
raise his own son.

672
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:05,991
Well,

673
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:08,030
why did he abandon me later on?

674
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,110
He was reckless when he was young.

675
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,551
He relied on his driving skills
to race everywhere.

676
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,624
One day, he had a car accident
and went into a coma.

677
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:27,350
His mom was mentally sick.

678
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,991
She sent you to an orphanage.

679
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,390
After he woke up,

680
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,430
he suddenly remembered he had a son.

681
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,711
But he forgot what you looked like.

682
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:44,951
When he was desperate, he came to me.

683
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,751
He asked me to find you
at the orphanage.

684
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,751
I was going crazy.

685
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,350
I couldn't hand you

686
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,511
over to him anymore.

687
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,591
So, I lied to him

688
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,711
about you being adopted by someone else.

689
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,230
At that time,

690
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,190
Chen Xingqi suddenly fell ill.

691
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,430
He had a persistent fever.

692
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:06,711
You know,

693
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,951
Chen Jishen is very superstitious.

694
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:10,991
I found a fortune-teller

695
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:12,751
and let him say

696
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,390
Chen Xingqi must have an elder brother.

697
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:16,951
So,

698
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:19,190
you took that chance

699
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,591
to take me to his home?

700
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:24,551
Right.

701
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:30,390
Does Chen Jishen know my identity?

702
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,430
Lian Hui.

703
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,711
I'm here, honey.

704
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,070
You're back.

705
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:47,310
(DNA Test Report)

706
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,070
You've been tricking me from the start,

707
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,390
haven't you?

708
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,911
Take a look yourself.

709
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:07,032
(Lian Hui is
Chen Luzhou's birth mother.)

710
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,470
Jishen.

711
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,831
Jishen, I'm sorry.

712
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,511
I made a mistake.

713
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,911
Don't involve the child in this matter.

714
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:22,711
Please.

715
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:23,791
Let go.

716
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:30,831
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,631
I'm really sorry. I deceived you.

718
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,511
But Luzhou is still young.

719
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:37,791
He doesn't know anything.

720
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:39,831
Will you forgive me?

721
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:44,350
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

722
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:02,230
When he turns 18,

723
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,791
send him abroad.

724
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,390
Okay.

725
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,350
As you wish.

726
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,430
So, you said

727
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,871
even if he agreed
to not let me go abroad,

728
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:23,070
you wouldn't agree.

729
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,711
Is it because you feel indebted to him?

730
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,751
Even if your dad changes his mind,
I won't agree.

731
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,150
You asked me not to anger him

732
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:42,470
and behave because you were afraid
he'd send me back to the orphanage.

733
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,991
Do you want to be with me forever?

734
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:47,271
You must

735
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,430
listen to Grandma and Dad.

736
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:51,751
Got it?

737
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,430
Let's go.

738
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,070
Don't keep Chen Xingqi waiting.

739
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,070
Luzhou.

740
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:21,991
I'm sorry.

741
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,350
It's all my fault.

742
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:27,831
Can you forgive me?

743
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,671
Forgive me, okay?

744
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,070
I know what you've been through.

745
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,070
It's all my fault.

746
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,991
You ask your brother when he'll be back.

747
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,390
Why don't you ask yourself?

748
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,871
When I send him a message,

749
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,831
he never replies after reading it.

750
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,470
But if you send him a message,

751
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:15,791
he will reply instantly.

752
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,110
Are you sure?

753
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:19,991
Try it.

754
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,310
You ask.

755
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,390
You ask.

756
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:35,150
You know
he's not my biological brother, right?

757
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,430
One time on Children's Day,

758
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:44,831
my parents decided on a whim

759
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:46,511
to take me to Linshi for a day.

760
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,551
My brother didn't have the key that day.

761
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,470
So, when he went back,

762
00:41:51,991 --> 00:41:53,511
he couldn't get the door open.

763
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:58,511
He didn't even call my parents.

764
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,990
He just slept on a bench

765
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,070
in a nearby park.

766
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:08,270
When we found him the next day,

767
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,110
my mom was so worried
that she almost cried.

768
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:17,551
Yet he nonchalantly said,
"It doesn't matter where I sleep."

769
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,390
"Why make a fuss?"

770
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,270
Don't be so upset.

771
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:27,671
I've always felt

772
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,591
my brother never saw my home

773
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:31,671
as his own home.

774
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,430
Maybe it's because he was adopted.

775
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:39,951
He seems amiable with everyone.

776
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:42,871
Actually,

777
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:44,911
he's not close with anyone.

778
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:50,831
However,

779
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,871
he treats you differently.

780
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,350
He really likes you.

781
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:04,751
Please keep what I just said a secret.

782
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,831
Thank you.

783
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,150
Hello, Ms. Lian.

784
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,470
Chen Xingqi.

785
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:19,390
How bold you are!

786
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:21,230
How dare you come here alone?

787
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,310
Are you trying to freak me out?

788
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:25,150
Do you know how worried I am?

789
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,310
Alright.

790
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,310
Luzhou, wait for me outside
with the luggage.

791
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,591
I want to talk to Xu Zhi.

792
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:41,350
Come on. Move now.

793
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:50,030
Just wait for me outside.

794
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:51,551
Please have a seat.

795
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,591
Mom isn't trying to break you two up,
is she?

796
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,150
I absolutely disagree.

797
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,310
You stay out of this.

798
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:14,070
Let me friend you on WeChat.

799
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,671
Okay.

800
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:16,831
Let's keep in touch,

801
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,470
alright?

802
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:18,631
I'll scan your code.

803
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:19,751
Here.

804
00:44:24,991 --> 00:44:26,070
I have to go.

805
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:31,631
I'll see you off.

806
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,991
Xingqi and I will go back to Qingyi.

807
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:43,991
Take good care of yourself.

808
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,030
Don't stay up too late.

809
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,270
Take care.

810
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,230
Ms. Mei is away,

811
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,350
but you need to eat well.

812
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:51,591
Don't get a stomachache again.

813
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,030
Don't worry.

814
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,511
The company cafeteria

815
00:44:55,911 --> 00:44:56,911
provides quite good food.

816
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,070
Let's go.

817
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,030
Give me the suitcase.

818
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:10,951
We're leaving.

819
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:17,592
Bye, Ms. Lian.

820
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:18,751
Alright, bye.

821
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:20,551
Bye-bye.

822
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:30,911
What did you talk about?

823
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:32,951
I told her

824
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,150
I was pregnant with your child
and she had to get a check ready.

825
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,390
What's wrong?

826
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:56,551
Nothing.

827
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:57,791
I want to hug you

828
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,070
to give myself a break.

829
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:34,008
(If there were only one last rose
in the world,)

830
00:46:34,322 --> 00:46:37,048
(I would rush forward
and grab it for you)

831
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:43,864
(even if I were aged 80
and in a wheelchair.)
