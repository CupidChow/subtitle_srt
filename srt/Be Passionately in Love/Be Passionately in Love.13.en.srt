(As Long As It Still Rains in Qingyi)

18
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:20,751
(GuGu: I'm leaving.)

19
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,070
(Won't you see me off?)

20
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:23,191
You reply for me.

21
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,430
What to say?

22
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,030
"Busy with my girlfriend.

23
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,231
Take a taxi yourself."

24
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:31,711
Okay.

25
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,831
Just reply.

26
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,112
You go see her off.

27
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:36,110
Who knows when you'll meet next time?

28
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,150
Aren't you jealous?

29
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,070
Hurry up and go.

30
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,990
Pause.

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,390
Okay.

32
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,470
Wait until I come back.

33
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:53,191
I've gotten you a taxi.

34
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,110
Chen Luzhou.

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,231
If it were someone else,

36
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,391
I wouldn't give up so easily.

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,231
But losing to Xu Zhi,

38
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,110
I'm completely convinced.

39
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,711
But if one day she dumps you,

40
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,311
and if I still like you at that time,

41
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,311
I will pursue you again.

42
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,470
Actually, you don't need
to focus all your attention on me.

43
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,871
Acting must be quite hard.

44
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:29,351
You start work at 5 AM every day

45
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:30,990
and often stay up late.

46
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,391
You must be very tired.

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,831
I hope you keep it up

48
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:37,271
and do a good job acting.

49
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,831
Maybe you can
go to a European film festival

50
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,030
and win an award someday,

51
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,351
making our country proud.

52
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,430
I'll be there to cheer for you.

53
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,311
Alright.

54
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:50,711
See you there.

55
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,311
I'm leaving.

56
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,671
What are you looking for?

57
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,990
Where's my hair tie?

58
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:30,950
I left it here.

59
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,030
I can't find it.

60
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,191
Stop looking.

61
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,311
Just buy a dozen later.

62
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,751
A dozen?

63
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,430
A dozen beers?

64
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,350
I'll go buy them.

65
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,430
No problem.

66
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:42,110
Where's Gu Yan?

67
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,791
She left.

68
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:45,871
It's meal time?

69
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,550
Now I feel hungry too.

70
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,111
Go eat skewers.

71
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,191
What?

72
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,391
Skewers? Let's go.

73
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,990
Why eat skewers so late at night?

74
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,630
Let's go.

75
00:04:58,711 --> 00:04:59,711
Hurry up.

76
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,271
Are we going?

77
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,630
You decide.

78
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,104
(Dan's Snack)

79
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,070
Coming up.

80
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,150
Coming up.

81
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,191
Call me if you need more. Done.

82
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,271
This one's good.

83
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,630
It's their specialty.

84
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,030
Try this one.

85
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:21,950
Can you reach it?

86
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,110
Sorry to interrupt.

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,590
Please lift your feet.

88
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:27,871
Thank you.

89
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,751
Eat, don't just watch.

90
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,150
Excuse me, guys.

91
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,391
Tonight,

92
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,351
we're staying open just for you.

93
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,671
Enjoy yourselves.

94
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:36,871
Eat well and drink well.

95
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

96
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,151
But there's one important thing.

97
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:40,231
Come on.

98
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,271
Remember to pay Dan.

99
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,030
Go to him.

100
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,752
I'll go to you.

101
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:45,831
Ask him to pay.

102
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,631
- No problem.
- I'll find you

103
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:47,231
later.

104
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,951
Go ahead.

105
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,191
- Continue to eat.
- Take your time.

106
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,911
Come on, let's toast.

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,191
Come on.

108
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,271
Cheers.

109
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,191
Cheers.

110
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,271
Cheers.

111
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,071
As a city,

112
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,351
Qingyi is both big and small.

113
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:03,910
Us becoming friends

114
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,271
is destined fate.

115
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,311
We'll be going our separate ways.

116
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,550
We wonder when we'll gather next time.

117
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,751
How about this?

118
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,630
Let's all say a few words.

119
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:15,831
Say something.

120
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,070
Okay.

121
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:18,911
I'll go first.

122
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:21,110
I wish our great artist Zhu

123
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,990
to sell a painting for a million.

124
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,550
- Did you all hear that?
- A million.

125
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,110
Great!

126
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:28,911
Nice.

127
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,030
In that case,

128
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,431
I wish you

129
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,030
to sit at home and have windfall profits
fall from the sky.

130
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,791
Sounds great?

131
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,030
Not bad at all.

132
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,311
Finally, something nice said.

133
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:38,391
Get lost.

134
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,711
Then I'll say something.

135
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:45,070
I wish everyone could find that person

136
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,150
who understands you.

137
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,590
This is indeed hard.

138
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:55,271
Selling a painting for a million

139
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,871
is possible.

140
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,070
Right?

141
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,550
But to really find someone

142
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,070
who understands you

143
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,831
depends on fate.

144
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,030
Some people with good luck

145
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,231
may run into the right one.

146
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,191
Some people with bad luck

147
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,150
may not meet the one in their lifetime.

148
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,510
Don't you agree, Lucy?

149
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,231
But Dan seems
to understand you quite well.

150
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,271
At your gesture,
he comes over to tidy up.

151
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,231
Seeing him sweep, you lift your feet.

152
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,311
You have great rapport.

153
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,110
Alright.

154
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:27,430
Then can you say something?

155
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,470
You said nothing.

156
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,191
I already did.

157
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:29,950
Say more.

158
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:31,191
Alright.

159
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,231
Lucy once told me

160
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,150
that we boys

161
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,191
should have a spirit in our hearts.

162
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,271
This spirit

163
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,751
cannot be killed by either wind or rain.

164
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:47,271
Even if the fuel runs out,

165
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,351
as long as the embers still smolder

166
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,630
and there is light,

167
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:51,911
we can

168
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,791
reignite hope.

169
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,271
This is for all the boys present.

170
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,510
- Come on.
- Come on.

171
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,150
In the future, when we are not around,

172
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,070
don't cry when things happen.

173
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:04,390
We need to be tough.

174
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,510
Say that to yourself.

175
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,350
Control yourself.

176
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,390
Me?

177
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,470
Don't talk nonsense.

178
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:09,231
Zhi,

179
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,510
as the only girl here,

180
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,791
say something too.

181
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,791
Then I hope

182
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,070
we girls can aspire to greater heights.

183
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,950
After all,
beneath our feet is a vast land.

184
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,270
There are many places

185
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,471
we haven't been to.

186
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,591
Come on.

187
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,070
Lucy,

188
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,350
would you like

189
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,471
to make the finale?

190
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:37,870
Then

191
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,471
I will quote what Mr. Liang Qichao said.

192
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,190
There are endless ages.
There are vast lands.

193
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,150
The future is like a sea.

194
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:48,831
There's a long way to go.

195
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,711
There's a long way to go.

196
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,990
Come on.

197
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,070
- Come on.
- Come on.

198
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,310
- To the future like a sea.
- To the future like a sea.

199
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,950
- To the long way ahead.
- To the long way ahead.

200
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,110
Cheers.

201
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,350
Alright, this is where I see you off.

202
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,791
I'm leaving.

203
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,831
Bye-bye.

204
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,511
Keep in touch.

205
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,591
Sure. Bye-bye.

206
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,110
(Notice of Lost Dog, Lucy)
Chen Luzhou.

207
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:52,671
You got lost.

208
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,791
The name Lucy is very common.

209
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,751
I once met a girl

210
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,110
who named her car Lucy.

211
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,471
Shouldn't you change your name

212
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,390
to Lu-Lu-Lucy.

213
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,751
This way no one will have the same name.

214
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,591
People might think you stutter.

215
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,591
Lu-Lu-Lucy.

216
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:16,471
Xu Zhi.

217
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,310
Qingyi is so small.

218
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:24,431
Should we act as strangers
if we meet again?

219
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,310
Qingyi is not small.

220
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,190
We've lived here
for more than ten years.

221
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,230
It seems we haven't met

222
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,831
besides the first year in high school.

223
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,230
And you don't know at all.

224
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,350
Then how do you know we haven't met?

225
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,950
I need to think back carefully.

226
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,950
After all, I felt so special

227
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,471
when first seeing you.

228
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,390
Do you think

229
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,350
money can buy happiness?

230
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,911
I don't know about others.

231
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,030
You probably
will trade happiness for money.

232
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,431
You know me so well.

233
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:13,431

We've all said goodbye in advance.

290
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,190
And he can also

291
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,871
hold back and not come to you?

292
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,591
He might have some formalities to handle

293
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,150
and not have enough time.

294
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,270
Then if you really miss him later,

295
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:41,791
I can fly to Europe with you.

296
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,310
I'm going to Beijing.

297
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,671
Why would I still miss him?

298
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:53,911
That's true.

299
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,671
Once you're in the college in Beijing,

300
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,150
you might meet someone better.

301
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,511
I think Chen Luzhou is just average.

302
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,671
There are tons of people

303
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:06,751
far better than him.

304
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:07,871
He's not the only choice.

305
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:12,831
When we finish eating,

306
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,431
go to the market

307
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:16,791
and buy some moxa sticks
to send to Grandma.

308
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,616
(Billiards)

309
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,030
It's not even dark yet,
and you started crying?

310
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,390
Chen Luzhou is simply going abroad.

311
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:49,990
Don't act like it's a breakup.

312
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,511
I'm not crying at all.

313
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:52,631
No.

314
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,910
It's just that

315
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,351
Lucy is going abroad for so long.

316
00:17:58,431 --> 00:17:59,511
I wonder when he'll return.

317
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,911
I'll be doing everything alone.

318
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:02,871
I better get used to it.

319
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,431
Don't be so gloomy.

320
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,070
Yes, Chen Luzhou will go abroad.

00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:09,871
I'll play with you.

I want to go too.

Stay at the hotel if you keep nagging

420
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:09,575
and go nowhere.

421
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:12,374
Then give me the iPad.

422
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:13,454
I'll play games.

432
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:22,015
What does that mean?

433
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,015
The literal meaning.

434
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:27,064
(A month later, Ruicheng)

435
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,214
Who is it?

436
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,174
I want to sleep with you.

437
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:57,855
Don't cling to me every day.

438
00:29:58,735 --> 00:29:59,895
Go back to your room.

439
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,374
My room is next to Mom and Dad's.

440
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,054
I hear them arguing every day.

441
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:06,775
It's driving me crazy.

442
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,174
So you come to bother me?

443
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:08,775
That's right.

444
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,174
By the way,

445
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:12,054
where is the watermelon
Mom and Dad bought?

446
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:13,294
It's in the fridge.

447
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:14,775
I want to eat it.

448
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:35,895
Why are you sighing?

449
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:37,454
What now?

450
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,254
Qian hasn't replied
to my messages for days.

451
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:43,975
Why is she always so indifferent to me?

452
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:45,815
You want relationship advice?

453
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:47,735
Pay me 800 yuan.

454
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:50,015
That's a robbery.

455
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:00,615
Is it okay now?

456
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:02,935
Come on.

457
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:11,294
Is it sweet?

458
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:14,294
Center is the sweetest.

459
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,655
I want to eat the center part.

460
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:19,094
Don't feed someone

461
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:21,535
the whole watermelon at once.

462
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:24,174
Once they've had the sweetest bite,

463
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:25,575
they'll find the rest plain.

464
00:31:32,735 --> 00:31:33,775
What about yours?

465
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:35,655
You gave your entire melon to Xu Zhi?

466
00:31:38,134 --> 00:31:39,134
Hurry up and eat.

467
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:39,974
And then sleep.

468
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:41,535
Otherwise, go back to your own room.

470
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:42,815

Didn't you promise to focus on studying?

506
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:34,896
Look at you now.

507
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,294
You don't go home after class.

508
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,775
What are you doing in the rain?

509
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:38,975
Sir, don't misunderstand.

00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:03,054
She was speaking in anger.

523
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,935
We've only met two months ago.

524
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:06,094
There's nothing.

00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:09,735

Yangqi.

528
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:14,414
I have been your age too.

529
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,615
You're in the rain, sharing an umbrella.

530
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:17,895
And the milk tea?

531
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:19,174
Don't think I don't know

532
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:20,294
what you are doing.

533
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:21,775
Tell me the truth.

534
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:23,655
To what extent

535
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,414
have you two reached?

536
00:37:27,655 --> 00:37:28,655
I admit.

537
00:37:29,094 --> 00:37:30,094
I do like her.

538
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:32,214
But I can swear.

539
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,334
She knows nothing.

540
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,414
Because even I am not sure

541
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:36,855
my feelings are real.

542
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:39,655
I planned to tell her only when she

543
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:40,735
gets admitted

544
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:42,334
to a college in Beijing.

545
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:45,015
I was afraid
she'd overthink and be affected.

546
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:47,494
So, Sir,

547
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,414
you really misunderstood Yingying.

548
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:52,015
Yingying,

549
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:53,895
did he

550
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:55,775
tell the truth?

551
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:02,454
I'm asking you.

552
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:09,735
You... and you... you two...

553
00:38:10,695 --> 00:38:11,695
Yingying!

554
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:12,975
It's raining, Yingying.

555
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,535
Don't make me worry.

556
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,174
It's raining, Yingying.

557
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:34,695
I think that boy definitely

558
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:36,454
got something with Yingying.

559
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,214
Don't talk nonsense.

560
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,374
Yingying doesn't fancy him at all.

561
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:44,535
If she doesn't fancy him,
why are you sulking here?

562
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:46,975
If you ask me, just apologize to her.

563
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:49,294
Everything will be fine
if you talk it out.

564
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:50,815
I won't apologize.

565
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,414
She's the one ignoring me.

566
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:54,895
Mr. Cai,

567
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:58,015
make use of your mouth.

568
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,174
Aren't you quite talkative
in the hospital?

569
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,655
What does this have to do
with being talkative?

570
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:07,935
It was always me apologizing
since she was little.

571
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,015
I won't this time.

572
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,294
She annoyed me on purpose.

573
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:14,895
Look at this garlic.

574
00:39:15,494 --> 00:39:17,655
The older it gets, the thinner its skin.

575
00:39:18,015 --> 00:39:19,575
Look. You have to...

576
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,174
Smash it.

577
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:24,134
It's settled down, see?

578
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,334
Look at the skin.

579
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:28,975
Layer by layer.

580
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:37,735
- Look.
- So I'm garlic?

581
00:39:37,815 --> 00:39:38,815
I guess so.

582
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:44,855
Still mad at your dad, huh?

583
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:47,735
I don't have time for him.

584
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:50,815
Then is it because of Zhu Yangqi?

585
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:02,254
Lucy, are you still my good buddy?

586
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:03,456
When you're in trouble,

587
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:04,655
I'm always by your side,

588
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,815
giving you advice.

589
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:07,494
And now you just disappear, huh?

590
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:08,855
Get back to me quickly.

591
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:20,615
Buddha, bless me.

592
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:22,254
Don't let last night's incident

593
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:23,775
harm my relationship with Yingying.

594
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:25,975
Buddha, bless me.

595
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:51,494
Yingying,

596
00:40:52,174 --> 00:40:54,054
I'm going to Beijing today at 4 PM.

597
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:56,214
Good luck. See you in Beijing.

598
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:04,254
What's wrong?

599
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:05,494
You startled me.

600
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:08,374
Yingying,

601
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:10,775
I'm going to Beijing today at 4 PM.

602
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:12,895
Good luck. See you in Beijing.

603
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:14,935
Won't you see him off?

604
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:17,014
A-Absolutely not.

605
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:18,134
I've seen him as a buddy.

606
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:21,054
I played billiards with him out of pity.

607
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:23,174
And he wants to be my boyfriend?

608
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:24,214
It's awkward to see him.

609
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:25,414
So you just won't see him?

610
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:26,655
When you go to Beijing,

611
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:27,935
you'll never see him again?

612
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:29,134
It's not to that extent.

613
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:33,174
Sometimes he's quite cheeky.

614
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:35,134
But overall, he's not bad.

615
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:39,134
Isn't that enough?

616
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:40,495
No need to stop being friends

617
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:41,575
because he likes you.

618
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:44,855
Fair point.

619
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:47,254
I am pretty and kind-hearted.

620
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:48,535
Many boys like me.

621
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,094
Zhu Yangqi is just another one.

622
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:52,414
Alright.

623
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,334
He likes me. That's all.

624
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,494
He won't eat me anyway.

625
00:41:58,815 --> 00:41:59,815
I have nothing to fear.

626
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:01,054
I'll see him off.

627
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:13,615
Zhu Yangqi!

628
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:15,935
Yingying.

629
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:20,855
I thought you'd never see me again.

630
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:23,495
After all, you did help me a lot.

631
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,015
It's only right that I see you off.

632
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:29,895
This is for you.

633
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:34,134
It isn't a love letter, is it?

634
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:36,254
Don't be so cheesy.

635
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:38,174
Or we might not even
be able to be friends.

636
00:42:38,374 --> 00:42:39,615
What are you thinking?

637
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:42,655
Here, this is the art exam study guide
I organized for you.

638
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:46,174
Take a look.

639
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:48,792
(To Cai Yingying)

640
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:54,424
(Art Exam Study Guide)

641
00:42:58,374 --> 00:42:59,374
Well,

642
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:00,815
don't take what I said to you

643
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:01,895
that day to heart.

644
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,494
Liking you is my own business.

645
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:05,975
Don't feel burdened.

646
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:08,134
Besides,

647
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:09,414
once I'm in Beijing,

648
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:11,134
I might fall for someone else soon.

649
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,254
That would really be a relief.

650
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,094
The driver is waiting for me.

651
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:26,655
I need to go.

652
00:43:27,414 --> 00:43:29,334
I'm very glad
that you came to see me off.

653
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:36,015
Let me walk with you.
