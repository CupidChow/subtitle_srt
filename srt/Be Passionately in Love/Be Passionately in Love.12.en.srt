(Actually, You Understand Me Well)

18
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,527
What flavor of candy are you eating?

19
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,567
Cherry.

20
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:01,928
You're lying.

21
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,687
If you want a kiss, just tell me.

22
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:14,207
What are you doing?

23
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:19,288
Dad.

24
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,328
Why are you here?

25
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,328
It's downstairs at my door.

26
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,448
Why is he here?

27
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,247
I asked him to take photos.

28
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,207
And the photos need to be confirmed.

29
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:33,928
You've been away so long.

30
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:35,647
Not going back?

31
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:36,928
Okay.

32
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,968
Why not return
for a follow-up this month?

33
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,567
No time.

34
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:56,127
These are all excuses.

35
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,727
You just didn't take this matter
seriously.

36
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:02,247
A patient before,

37
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:04,127
counting on being young,

38
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,448
didn't take care of his health.

39
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:08,408
He checked

40
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,687
after delaying,

41
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:10,888
and almost died.

42
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:12,768
I'm telling you,

43
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,928
find time to come for a check-up.

44
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:16,687
Did you hear me?

45
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,448
Dad, thank you.

46
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,247
Do you want milk?

47
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:48,808
We have milk now.

48
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:50,008
Not bad.

49
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,008
Does Chen Luzhou have any issues?

50
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:00,968
What does that

51
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,408
have to do with you?

52
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:04,008
It has nothing to do with me.

53
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,008
No, I'm just checking.

54
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,207
Girls shouldn't
ask these kinds of questions.

55
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:09,607
Are you hungry?

56
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:10,768
I'll cook.

57
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,127
It's time to eat soon.

58
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,567
Zhi,

59
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:25,607
you've been going out lately.

60
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,288
Have you been going to see him?

61
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:28,488
No.

62
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,167
Didn't I tell you?

63
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,288
I'm tutoring outside.

64
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,288
But I remember the place where you tutor

65
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:37,448
is on Chunshan Road.

66
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,167
But you come back

67
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,968
from Yifeng Alley every time.

68
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:43,448
That's two directions!

69
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,888
I'm just going there to eat.

70
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,008
Haven't you been eating
at the cafeteria?

71
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:50,968
There was no one cooking at home.

72
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,087
I had to go there to eat.

73
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:56,207
Indeed, work has been

74
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:57,687
too busy lately.

75
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:58,968
How about this?

76
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,047
I will come back early tomorrow.

77
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,087
Starting tomorrow,
I'll come back to make dinner.

78
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,368
After dinner and your tutoring session
are done,

79
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,087
we have dinner at home. Okay?

80
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,848
Ask the question again.

81
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:14,647
You've been going out lately.

82
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,127
Have you been going to see him?

83
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,687
Yes, we're dating.

84
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:36,928
Actually, you've grown up.

85
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:40,687
There are some things
I shouldn't interfere with.

86
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,448
Is it such a big deal
that we're just dating?

87
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,727
I accept that you're dating.

88
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,888
Because dating is a matter of time.

89
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,247
And that boy's

90
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,127
character is fairly decent.

91
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:54,607
And he's a local.

92
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,207
After you get married,

93
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:57,449
we can have more contact

94
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,567
since we are close.

95
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:00,376
Right?

96
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,727
Is this wine so intoxicating?

97
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,008
You're talking nonsense.

98
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,167
No, it's not.

99
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,727
If you find someone far away,

100
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,607
you won't come back home all year round.

101
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,368
Who will I talk to when I want to?

102
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,527
I don't want to be an empty nester.

103
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,047
Dad, what are you talking about?

104
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,888
I'm dating him.

105
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,288
But we'll break up soon.

106
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:19,607
He's going abroad.

107
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,727
Chen Luzhou

108
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,448
lives on Yifeng Alley, right?

109
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:36,848
Zhi,

110
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,328
just one word from you.

111
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,768
I have learned it.
I will not hurt vital parts,

112
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,408
Just let him bleed a little.

113
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,527
Okay?

114
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,768
No wonder it's me!

115
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,527
That brat kept it from me for so long.

116
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,207
Why celebrate with him?

117
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:58,520
Jiang Cheng said you were dating,
but I didn't believe it.

118
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:00,928
No.

119
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,008
Congratulations on finding love.

120
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:11,288
Auntie, Mom.

121
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:12,808
Ms. Lian.

122
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:25,008
(Did your dad deal with you?)

123
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,449
(No, but he heard)

124
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,008
(you'd leave me and go abroad alone.)

125
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,448
(He was about
to take a kitchen knife to chop you.)

126
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,968
(Fortunately,
I persuaded him out of it.)

127
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,968
(Then let's not meet tomorrow.)

128
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,768
(Shy Boy Chen, you're really timid.)

129
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,087
(I'm not timid)

130
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,488
(but cared your dad.)

131
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,207
(Chopping people leads to jail.)

132
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,448
(Do you dare to go to my dad
for a review?)

133
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,288
(His professional conduct)

134
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,928
(needs some training.)

135
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:07,808
(Stop here.)

136
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,607
(My dad seems to have drunk much.)

137
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,568
What are you doing, Zhu Yangqi.

138
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,327
How do you...

139
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:24,688
Why are you here?

140
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:29,648
Well, you guys chat first.

141
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:30,888
I'll head back first.

142
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,047
I can't save you anymore.

143
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:46,768
Fell in love?

144
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:48,768
Yes.

145
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,008
Do you want to meet her?

146
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:52,808
Forget it.

147
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,087
I'm afraid you'll be angry.

148
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,728
Study abroad visa has been issued.

149
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,487
I'm going to Ruicheng
for a scene this Sunday.

150
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:02,609
Your dad said we

151
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,928
haven't gone on a trip.

152
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:06,327
Don't take the job in Dunhuang.

153
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,608
Take all the luggage.

154
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,367
After the Ruicheng trip ends,

155
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,648
go directly to your school.

156
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,808
Don't take me along on your family trip.

157
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:19,808
I'll go there myself.

158
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:23,368
You've been sensible

159
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:24,728
and never made me worry.

160
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,407
I believe there will be

161
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:34,904
no exception to this matter either.

162
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,047
(Are you okay, Lucy?)

163
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,728
(She didn't trouble you?)

164
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:00,528
(I really didn't mean to.)

165
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:02,207
(I thought you opened the door.)

166
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,008
(So I let it slip.)

167
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:26,888
Dad, are you okay?

168
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:28,688
I'm fine.

169
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:31,127
This little brat.

170
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,688
He knew he was going abroad

171
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,127
and still came to provoke you.

172
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,568
You two youngsters

173
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:41,008
cannot just seek momentary happiness.

174
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,127
What is happiness?

175
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:48,047
Happiness is about looking far ahead.

176
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:02,808
(My dad truly drank too much.)

177
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:04,247
(He's swearing at you.)

178
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:06,648
(Have you decided
when to go to Dunhuang?)

179
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,008
(Not going anymore.)

180
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,928
(Then I'll reluctantly accompany you
for a few more days.)

181
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:27,528
(My mom changed itinerary.)

182
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,367
(Next Tuesday,
we will go to Ruicheng together,)

183
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,648
(not back to Qingyi.)

184
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:39,608
(Got it.)

185
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:41,327
(Good night, Shy Boy Chen.)

186
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:55,608
Zhi,

187
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,047
why drink alcohol?

188
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,176
- Kids can't drink alcohol.
- Dad.

189
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:05,888
What's wrong?

190
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,008
I really seem to be
a bit reluctant to let him go.

191
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,407
It's okay.

192
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:35,407
It's nothing.

193
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,928
Some things will become better.

194
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,367
If you're unhappy,

195
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,047
then

196
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,287
I will drink with you.

197
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:54,487
Come on.

198
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:56,808
Come on.

199
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,367
Don't be sad.

200
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,888
Some things will become better.

201
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:12,487
Cheers.

202
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,047
Slow down, slow down.

203
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:37,688
Let me tell you.

204
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:40,648
You can't drink outside anymore.

205
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,127
I'll make you some hangover soup.

206
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:44,808
Don't randomly send that.

207
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:05,088
(10 things to do after graduation)

208
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:45,648
(Do you have time tomorrow?)

209
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,512
(Accompany me to get ear piercings.)

210
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:00,688
This little brat.

211
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,648
He's coming for a follow-up examination.

212
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,447
I'll teach him a lesson.

213
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,960
(Qingyi City Central Hospital)

214
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,071
(Chief Physician, Xu Guangji)

215
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,928
Come in.

216
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:32,648
Uncle.

217
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,688
Who's your uncle?

218
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:37,968
Dr. Xu.

219
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,287
Where's medical record?

220
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,207
I heard you're going abroad.

221
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:51,648
Let me show you something.

222
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,528
Hello everyone, my name is Xu Zhi.

223
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,207
Napoleon once said that

224
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,968
a soldier who doesn't
want to be a general isn't a good one.

225
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:05,247
Although I am not as rich as Lin Zixuan,

226
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,087
I'm pretty.

227
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:10,367
Lin Zixuan's money
won't all be spent on you.

228
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:13,407
But my beauty is completely unreserved.

229
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:14,848
You all can see it.

230
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,327
I hope all vote for me.

231
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:19,367
But if I am elected
as the class president,

232
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,528
I hope everyone
can cooperate with me in work.

233
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:22,848
Don't make this hard for me.

234
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,127
Thank you all.

235
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:29,008
How about that?

236
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,087
Isn't my daughter very confident?

237
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,407
Confident and generous.

238
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,648
You raised her very well.

239
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,688
But last night, she cried and said,

240
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:41,608
"Dad, am I really that bad?"

241
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:45,367
"I can't even keep my own boyfriend."

242
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,047
"I'm really useless."

243
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,047
Dad, when did I ever say that?

244
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:56,287
This patient,

245
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,287
why not knock on door?

246
00:16:57,928 --> 00:16:59,888
You have the patient
bring you a meal card?

247
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,207
Even if my own father

248
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,447
has to knock the door.

249
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,327
Okay, I'm your father.

250
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,167
Guangji, I'm here.

251
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:16,608
Stand firm.

252
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,287
The report's out.

253
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,287
Take a look.

254
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,528
What are you looking at, young girl?

255
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,648
- I need to know the situation.
- Girls shouldn't look.

256
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:28,728
Go wait for me outside.

257
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,648
Who do you want her to wait for outside?

258
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,287
Wait for you.

259
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,207
Forget it.

260
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:45,768
I heard it too.

261
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:47,688
Where

262
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,447
are you two going?

263
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,447
Tell me.

264
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,247
Join her for an ear-piercing.

265
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:01,127
Actually, when she was little,

266
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,327
I also took her to get her ears pierced.

267
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,608
But each time we got halfway,

268
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:07,968
we went back home.

269
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:11,487
She is very afraid of pain.

270
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,728
And she loved to act spoiled.

271
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,407
But after her mother left,

272
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:19,688
she completely changed.

273
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,447
Except for some trivial matters,

274
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,848
she stopped telling me a lot of things.

275
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:26,768
Maybe

276
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,127
I didn't give her sense of security.

277
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,447
Am I a failed father?

278
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:38,608
Mr. Xu, I think this is...

279
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:41,247
But even as a failed father,

280
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:44,528
my fists are still strong.

281
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,247
Don't bully my daughter,

282
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,528
or I will beat you to death.

283
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,167
If you want to leave, go.

284
00:19:01,568 --> 00:19:02,888
Don't dawdle.

285
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,008
Okay.

286
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,888
How is your report?

287
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,247
So curious?

288
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:17,928
Alright,

289
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:19,247
I'll show you.

290
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:28,167
What does this mean?

291
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,048
Simply put,

292
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:31,367
it's an excellent

293
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,968
sperm analysis report
of a male high school graduate.

294
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:35,848
Narcissist.

295
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,247
I'm narcissistic?

296
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:38,368
I've never said

297
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:40,608
such things like
my beauty is unreserved.

298
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,568
My dad showed you the video?

299
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,688
Yeah, but my favorite part
is still that line.

300
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,512
"If I am elected
as the class president,"

301
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:49,208
"I hope you
can cooperate with me in work."

302
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,608
"Don't make this hard for me."

303
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,447
Xu Zhi,

304
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,568
you were so boastful and cute
when you were little.

305
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:56,568
Right?

306
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,648
If we had met when we were little,

307
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:00,928
you would have been bowing at
my diapered feet.

308
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:07,487
Disagree with that?

309
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:10,528
Yes, I am afraid
you'd steal my diapers to wear.

310
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:12,968
You really understand me.

311
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:10,776
(Actually, you understand me well.)

312
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,208
(You're afraid I'll be in a dilemma.)

313
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:15,447
(So you've never tried
to persuade me to stay.)

314
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:38,728
Looking at earrings?

315
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,568
Here's one that suits you quite well.

316
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:43,008
Take a look.

317
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:47,127
There's also a new model.

318
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,407
This one is so cute.

319
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:52,688
Nice.

320
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,968
Why don't you help me choose?

321
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:02,688
I choose?

322
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:05,447
I've never chosen
a gift for a girl. You sure?

323
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:12,928
How about this one?

324
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,167
When hungry, gnaw on it.

325
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:17,768
You're so scheming.

326
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:18,968
You want me to put it on

327
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:20,087
and think of you, do you?

328
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:23,247
Alright.

329
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:24,327
Let me take a look.

330
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,047
How about this one?

331
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,528

Let's watch sunrise tomorrow.

375
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,688
Tomorrow?

376
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:46,047
I might be busy tomorrow and can't go.

377
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:46,928
Then forget it.

378
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:48,367
I have to work tomorrow.

379
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:50,424
And you still want
to catch the sunrise?

380
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,688
Can you wake up early?

381
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:52,929
Of course, I can.

382
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:54,487
During my junior year, I always slept

383
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:55,487
and woke up early.

384
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:00,608
Don't believe me?

385
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:01,688
I believe you.

386
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:03,367
That's how I imagined you'd be.

387
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:06,008
What about you?

388
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:07,728
I'm opposite of you.

389
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,688
I always stayed up late
before going to sleep.

390
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:11,849
At eight,

391
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,008
I went to morning self-study.

392
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,127
You stayed up late?
I thought you were disciplined.

393
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,447
You drink lemon water at bars.

394
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:19,768
Just the junior year.

395
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:24,688
So even naturally talented people
have to work hard.

396
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:27,528
I thought you could achieve top scores
just by lying down.

397
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:28,768
How is that possible?

398
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,528
In the junior year,

399
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:32,407
I did a lot of exercises.

400
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,928
So how many points did you score?

401
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:36,407
292.

402
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:37,728
That's so high!

403
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,367
It's just so-so.

404
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:44,127
I probably won't meet anyone
who can score

405
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,888
over 290 points
in comprehensive science.

406
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:51,688
Let's stop here.

407
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:52,808
If Xu sees us,

408
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:53,808
he'll scare you.

409
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:56,207
Bye-bye. Are you eating?

410
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:56,968
It's all yours.

411
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,127
Have this.

412
00:25:58,247 --> 00:25:59,247
Alright, bye-bye.

413
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:10,968
(In the future,)

414
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:12,928
(I probably won't come across)

415
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:14,207
(a girl like you again.)

416
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:34,968
(Are you free tomorrow?)

417
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,167
Luzhou.

418
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:06,768
Where's my mom?

419
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,087
She took Xingqi to the sketch class.

420
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:11,087
It's just the two of us today.

421
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,327
Sit down and eat.

422
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:15,207
Okay.

423
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,087
Have some rice.

424
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,648
I don't know
if it's because I'm getting older,

425
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,608
or because you're going abroad,

426
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,087
but I've been dreaming of the days

427
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,447
when you first came to this family.

428
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:47,047
At that time,

429
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:49,808
you were just this tall.

430
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,928
Time really flies.

431
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,688
In the blink of an eye,
you're taller than me.

432
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:12,808
(Luzhou, come on.)

433
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:14,447
(Change your shoes first.)

434
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:21,327
Quick, look.

435
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:22,448
In the future,

436
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,008
this will be your new home.

437
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:25,688
We will live here.

438
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:27,672
Do you like it?

439
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:36,688
Honey.

440
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:37,247
Coming.

441
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:37,808
We are back.

442
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:38,808
Coming.

443
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,167
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

444
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,327
I'm here.

445
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:44,608
Hello, Luzhou.

446
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:47,167
This is for you.

447
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,528
Take it. Look.

448
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:52,247
A gift your dad bought for you.

449
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:54,287
Take it.

450
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,247
Do you like it?

451
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:02,287
Do you like it?

452
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:07,127
So good.

453
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,047
Let's go.
I will take you to play over there.

454
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:12,207
It's okay. I'm with you.

455
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,247
Don't be afraid.

456
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:13,928
Don't be afraid.

457
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:14,768
Let's go.

458
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,848
Let's go.
There are lots and lots of toys.

459
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:33,487
Here.

460
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:35,327
The key to the apartment.

461
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:47,648
Luzhou,

462
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,207
you don't

463
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:54,087
want to go abroad?

464
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,247
Yes, I do.

465
00:29:58,207 --> 00:29:59,207
Going abroad is good.

466
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:02,968
Yes.

467
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:07,087
Go out and see the world.

468
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,087
It's always good.

469
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:11,247
But no matter where you go,

470
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:13,287
in Qingyi,

471
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,087
you'll always have family.

472
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:17,407
You can visit when you're free.

473
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:22,368
After I go abroad,

474
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:23,736
I might settle down there.

475
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,568
I won't come back often.

476
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,447
Hello, Chen Luzhou.

477
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,487
What's up?

478
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,688
Nothing.

479
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,247
I just want to hear your voice.

480
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,447
What are you doing?

481
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:45,768
I'm preparing lessons.

482
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:47,447
I have to tutor after dinner.

483
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,769
Alright, carry on with your work.

484
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,247
Let's talk after that.

485
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:54,568
Bye.

486
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:15,407
Where are you going?

487
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:17,609
I'm going out.

488
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,648
I won't eat dinner.

489
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,247
Surely to find Chen Luzhou again.

490
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,207
Can't keep a grown-up daughter at home.

491
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:54,568
Hello.

492
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:58,584
Hi.

493
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:01,407
Why are you here?

494
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:03,528
Didn't you want to hear my voice?

495
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:06,808
I'll give you
a live surround sound experience.

496
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:10,447
Not to tutor?

497
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:12,287
There is a child here

498
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:14,087
who needs more of my care.

499
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:19,808
Stop here. Let's go.

500
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,207
You have someone at home.

501
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:25,487
What team is being matched?

502
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,688
Stop pretending.

503
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,287
I just ranked up a little.

504
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,528
You two were hugging already.

505
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:39,848
Why not tell me
there's someone at home?

506
00:33:40,447 --> 00:33:41,448
You came too suddenly.

507
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:43,087
I didn't have the time.

508
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,528
Tell me, who started it first?

509
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:48,928
Was it you?

510
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:55,447
Based on what I know about
that brat Chen Luzhou,

511
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:57,728
he definitely
wouldn't provoke you at this time.

512
00:33:58,688 --> 00:33:59,728
Why?

513
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:01,447
Because

514
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:02,728
he's about to go abroad soon.

515
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:03,728
He wouldn't dare.

516
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,008
So annoying.

517
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,728
What's it got to do with you?

518
00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:13,487
Now you find me annoying.

519
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,087
Fine, I'll leave, alright?

520
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:25,127
Maybe I should go back first.

521
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,087
Call him back.

522
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:29,087
You're in a long-term relationship.

523
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:31,224
- Don't argue over me.
- It's not related to you.

524
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:34,247
When I had to study out of town
in middle school,

525
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:35,528
he was nitpicking

526
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,247
over nothing like this too.

527
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,728
You guys also quarreled back then?

528
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:43,808
He hoped I could ask Chen Jishen

529
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:45,207
to intervene like him,

530
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:46,247
so that I could stay.

531
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:48,688
I didn't agree.

532
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:50,008
Then we quarreled.

533
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,688
As a child, he'd plead with his dad
whenever he messed up.

534
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,087
His dad always forgave him.

535
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:58,127
But he didn't know

536
00:34:58,528 --> 00:34:59,688
my dad and his dad

537
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:01,287
are different people.

538
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:05,447
Then what is he going to do now?

539
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:08,287
It's nothing.

540
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,247
That's about it.

541
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,127
Must I coax you?

542
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,167
Who cares?

543
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,327
I'll buy you two chicken strips.

544
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:37,287
Do you two want it spicy?

545
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:39,407
No.

546
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:41,008
I'll get you a spicy one

547
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,008
to knock your socks off!

548
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:46,327
Bring back a drink.

549
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:48,087
Got it.

550
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,327
You know him well.

551
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,568
He acts this way when sad.

552
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:03,568
I'm used to it.

553
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:12,247
You know what?

554
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:13,848
Actually,

555
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:15,367
the first time we met

556
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,528
was not at your door.

557
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:18,528
Then when was it?

558
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:20,688
In my freshman year.

559
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:21,808
Freshman year?

560
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:24,648
How come I don't remember?

561
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:28,888
In our school's basketball league,

562
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,047
our first match was against your school.

563
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,768
I had to deliver water
to the athletics committee.

564
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:39,008
I saw you standing
at the edge of the basketball court

565
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:42,207
and talking to the girls in your class.

566
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,367
And then?

567
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:47,568
I wanted to ask you to deliver water
to athletics committee.

568
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:48,407
But you

569
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:49,944
mistook me for your fan.

570
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:51,528
You just drank it.

571
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:52,648
Aren't you narcissistic?

572
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:59,047
You may get the wrong person.

573
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:01,447
I don't talk to girls
when playing basketball.

574
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:03,008
Probably not.

575
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:05,367
During the recording,

576
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,367
I even saw that girl.

577
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,008
She is the one taking photos

578
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:10,008
next to you.

579
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:11,407
She looked pretty good.

580
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:13,487
Her name is Zhang Yu.

581
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:19,808
Are you jealous?

582
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:23,247
Back then,
I didn't feel anything for you at all.

583
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:25,928
When did you first feel anything?

584
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:27,367
What about you?

585
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:29,928
From the first glance.

586
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:33,808
But,

587
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,960
I didn't believe in love at first sight.

588
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,127
And I thought you had a boyfriend.

589
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:39,608
I didn't think of it.

590
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,287
Aren't you thinking about it
differently now?

591
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,728
Stop being so cheeky.

592
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:55,528
I'll go take a shower.

593
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:57,047
See a movie and I'll take you back.

594
00:37:58,247 --> 00:37:59,247
Can you leave door open?

595
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:01,648
In your dreams.

596
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:12,968
If on that day
when we played basketball,

597
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:14,768
I asked for your name,

598
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:15,768
would you have told me?

599
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:20,008
I would. I'd even become
your WeChat friend.

600
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:22,688
Why?

601
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:24,688
So that you can
pay for that bottle of water.

602
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,008
Lucy, I'm back.

603
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:34,688
Look who's here.

604
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:36,688
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

605
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:38,688
Wait. How...

606
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:39,688
How did you all...

607
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:41,608
They heard you were going abroad,

608
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:42,840
so they came to bid farewell.

609
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,367
Come on, come on.

610
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:46,487
Jiang Cheng,

611
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:47,928
don't move this chair.

612
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,167
Stingy. Fine, I won't move it.

613
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,167
Why care that?

614
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:54,968
Gu Yan is here too.

615
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:55,808
I run into her

616
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:56,648
at the store,

617
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:57,648
so she came along too.

618
00:38:58,367 --> 00:38:59,367
Come in and sit down.

619
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:00,367
Come on, sit.

620
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:01,648
Long time no see.

621
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:02,648
Yeah.

622
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:04,287
Didn't expect to see you here.

623
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:05,848
Why isn't Cai Yingying here?

624
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:07,968
She's preparing for
her art exams.

625
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:09,207
So she couldn't come.

626
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,888
Art exams? What major?

627
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:12,768
Broadcast hosting.

628
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:14,648
I'm good at this.

629
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:16,568
I've also taken that exam.

630
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:17,728
Maybe I can give her some

631
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:19,008
immature suggestions.

632
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:19,889
Really?

633
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,568
I'll create a group chat for you later,

634
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:22,688
so you two can chat.

635
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:23,688
Okay.

636
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:26,968
It seems like they get along well.

637
00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:28,928
Go take a shower at ease.

638
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:30,447
Don't be so sloppy?

639
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:32,008
Okay, fine.

640
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:36,327
Come on.

641
00:39:36,928 --> 00:39:38,608
Drinks and such are all in the fridge.

642
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:39,768
Have fun.

643
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:41,087
Only kids drink this.

644
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,087
Take a sip.

645
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:47,167
What are you playing with?

646
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,688
Pretty Lu, sing a song.

647
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:52,127
We haven't heard you sing for long.
Sing a song.

648
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:53,649
Do one.

649
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:55,352
I just come out and you make me sing.

650
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:56,768
Sing a song.

651
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:57,808
I'll choose for you.

652
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:58,360
Come on.

653
00:39:58,487 --> 00:39:59,487
- Pick one.
- Pick one.

654
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:00,487
- Pick one.

Do you remember
the last time you went out of town?

684
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:12,367
No one reminded me
to wear a uniform on Mondays.

685
00:42:13,888 --> 00:42:15,247
No one reminded me

686
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:17,784
when you played cards,
trumps were all on the far left.

687
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:21,608
