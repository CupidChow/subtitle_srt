(Is It That Hard To Friend You On Wechat)

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,967
Does your mom come to cook for you?

19
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,047
Coming for free meals?

20
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:52,967
Can I?

21
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:54,726
(I am)

22
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,246
(in trouble.)

23
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,567
Let me friend you on WeChat.

24
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:00,447
My phone is out of battery.

25
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,686
You said it earlier.

26
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,166
Friend me on WeChat
and put a chair there.

27
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:19,847
I'm getting a bit tired now.

28
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,047
Can you put a chair here?

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,847
It is hot.

30
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,286
Why are you still up?

31
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,646
You're finally back.

32
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,447
Where's my roasted sweet potato?

33
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,407
Here you are.

34
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:04,847
One more.

35
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:08,927
Tell me earlier if you want this.

36
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,447
I'm not always lucky
to get them for free

37
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,166
from a kind-hearted guy.

38
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:14,286
This is my favorite.

39
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,407
There is a trendy girl in your room.

40
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:22,887
A trendy girl in my room?

41
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:27,286
You went to his house?

42
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:28,806
Did you see his mom then?

43
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:32,246
He doesn't live with his mom.

44
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,487
Are they not close?

45
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,206
She let him live alone?

46
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:38,166
Maybe

47
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:40,726
Chen Luzhou was adopted.

48
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:46,766
That day at his doorstep,

49
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,527
I heard him arguing with his mom.

50
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:49,606
His mom said things like,

51
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,408
"when you first came to our place,
you weren't like this."

52
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,367
Don't you think she doesn't

53
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:55,967
sound like his birth mother?

54
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,447
Right.

55
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,686
But we can't conclude

56
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,206
that he was adopted.

57
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:03,407
Many things at his place
have his name on them.

58
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,527
How's that related to him being adopted?

59
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,367
I think it shows

60
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:12,567
(Be a beacon of light.)
he may be a bit narcissistic.

61
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,967
But it could also be a habit.

62
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:17,126
Maybe he used to live

63
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,326
in an environment

64
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:19,646
similar to a welfare center.

65
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:21,847
And he was particular about hygiene.

66
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,246
So, he wrote his name on items.

67
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:26,766
However, these are just my guesses.

68
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,407
I might be overthinking it.

69
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,206
You are like Sherlock Holmes.

70
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:35,967
So, do you still plan to meet his mom?

71
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:38,567
Yes, I do.

72
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,047
When my mom had a car accident,

73
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,286
I didn't see her one last time.

74
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:45,007
Actually,

75
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:47,166
I feel regretful about it.

76
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,806
When I heard him arguing with his mom,

77
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:52,566
his mom's voice

78
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:54,126
was exactly like my mom's.

79
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:55,646
Well,

80
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:58,967
no matter what,

81
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:00,367
I want to meet his mom.

82
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,126
It's also good to hear her talk.

83
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,126
Then let's go find Chen Luzhou tomorrow.

84
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,206
Let him ask his mom out

85
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:08,927
to see you.

86
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:10,326
That's inappropriate.

87
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:11,367
Think about it.

88
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:13,646
If a stranger suddenly holds you
and says,

89
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:14,246
"Yingying,"

90
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:15,686
"Mr. Cai"

91
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,007
"looks like my deceased dad,"

92
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:18,527
"so I want to see him."

93
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:19,686
What do you think?

94
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,246
I might think

95
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:22,806
he is crazy.

96
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:23,766
Right.

97
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,766
So, we can't be hasty.

98
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:27,567
I think

99
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,367
we can

100
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,606
become friends with Chen Luzhou first.

101
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,766
After we become friends,

102
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,086
we can tell him the reason

103
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,487
I want to meet his mom.

104
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,047
But he is a bit difficult to deal with.

105
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:41,847
I haven't friended him on WeChat.

106
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,606
No worries.
I friended Zhu Yangwo on WeChat.

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,606
What?

108
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,206
Zhu Qizuo?

109
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:49,126
He's called Zhu Yangqi.

110
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,087
Who cares what his name is?

111
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:51,726
Anyway,

112
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,007
I just friended him on WeChat.

113
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,047
So,

114
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,847
I will help you inquire
about Chen Luzhou.

115
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:57,487
From now on,

116
00:05:57,726 --> 00:05:59,246
I am your spy.

117
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:06,686
What's wrong with you?

118
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,166
Why did you climb trees?

119
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:28,007
Kid.

120
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,927
Where did he hit you?

121
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:30,887
Does it hurt?

122
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:31,847
Let me check.

123
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,646
He kicked me.

124
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,766
His shoe soles are so clean.

125
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,967
They didn't leave a mark
on your white pants.

126
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,967
My son must have cleaned it.

127
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:42,967
What do you mean?

128
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,606
Are you saying that my son lied?

129
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:46,367
Uncle, don't get worked up.

130
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,367
It's reasonable doubt.

131
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,967
I'm not worked up. We're reasonable.

132
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,527
Who are you calling "Uncle"?

133
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:51,887
Do I look that old?

134
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,367
You stay out of this.

135
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,407
Lucy.

136
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,526
You clean freak.

137
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:03,367
Are you trying

138
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,047
to polish the ground until it gleams?

139
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,087
There is phlegm.

140
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,087
What?

141
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,166
Who did this wicked thing?

142
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,047
The owner of the gold chain.

143
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,567
The police station found the owner
so quickly.

144
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,246
He hid money in the tree,

145
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,487
but his wife found out.

146
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,246
Since when can money be hidden in trees?

147
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,806
Poverty really limits our imagination.

148
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,126
So, he took revenge by spitting

149
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,606
at your doorstep?

150
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,927
But he got the wrong guy.

151
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,527
So, I give him your address?

152
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:43,487
No, don't do that.

153
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,566
What happened between you and Xu Zhi

154
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:49,927
last night?

155
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:53,407
Come on.

156
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:54,606
I knew it.

157
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,766
She is experienced.

158
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,847
You brought her home
to roast sweet potatoes.

159
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:09,246
Weren't you falling into her trap?

160
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:11,646
Move aside.

161
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,286
Take off your shoes.

162
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,246
Anyway, you'll mop the floor.

163
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:25,166
Alright.

164
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:26,967
I'm telling you, Lucy,

165
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,007
If she wasn't trying to flirt with you,

166
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,406
I'd be renamed as Stylish Zhu.

167
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:48,687
Which do you

168
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,286
find more romantic?
Roasting sweet potatoes with her

169
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,206
or having a candlelight lunch with me?

170
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,007
I prefer to choose her.

171
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,406
Feeling awkward is fine.

172
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,847
I can't choose you

173
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,607
in case you'll fall for me.

174
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:09,687
Wait.

175
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,927
You're afraid I'll fall for you?

176
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,847
Aren't you afraid she will do the same?

177
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,087
She has a boyfriend.

178
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:17,246
What can I do?

179
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:18,887
She didn't say anything.

180
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,087
You were expecting her to say something
to you, weren't you?

181
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,406
I'm telling you,

182
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,007
Xu Zhi is a heartbreaker.

183
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:33,047
You're too naive.

184
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,007
Alright,

185
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:35,847
I'll avoid seeing her again, okay?

186
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:37,446
Okay.

187
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,784
(8090 Convenience Store)

188
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:47,166
Take it back.

189
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,767
I won't raise it anymore.

190
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:50,526
You've grown taller.

191
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:52,366
What did you eat?

192
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,166
I'm not joking with you.

193
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,056
Get down.

194
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,166
If you don't take it back,

195
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:00,687
I'll cook it tomorrow.

196
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,927
Make turtle soup.

197
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,286
Why make turtle soup?

198
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,126
It's so cute.

199
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:05,007
Why not raise it?

200
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:06,727
It's not cute at all.

201
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,406
It's like Chen Luzhou,

202
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,286
loving to run away from home

203
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,647
and frequently going missing.

204
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,246
Maybe you are overstepping.

205
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,046
Can't I do something

206
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:16,927
and go out to relax?

207
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:20,607
Have you considered my feelings?

208
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,246
You rarely answer your phone.

209
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:23,566
Now it's worse.

210
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:25,047
You live far away from me.

211
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,446
If I need you,

212
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,526
I can't even reach you.

213
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,687
You have trouble in school?

214
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,647
No, I don't.

215
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:33,887
Alright.

216
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,087
Don't come unless you're dying.

217
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:36,927
Luzhou.

218
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:38,486
Luzhou.

219
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:41,526
So, when I'm about to die,
I can come to you?

220
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,847
Chen Xingqi, are you a fool?

221
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,286
Can't you tell I was joking?

222
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:49,687
Alright.

223
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:52,248
If you don't want me
to see you, just say it.

224
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:55,526
Alright, go ahead.

225
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:56,687
What's it?

226
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,807
I want to head to the mountains
with my classmates.

227
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,047
Mom didn't agree.

228
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:05,566
So, you want someone

229
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,166
to go with you kids, right?

230
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:09,887
Alright.

231
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,246
Pay me 800 a day.

232
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,526
I can go with you then.

233
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:13,967
Deal.

234
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:15,607
Me.

235
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:16,927
Me.

236
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,126
Add another 500.

237
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:20,607
Zhu Yangqi will join us.

238
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:22,446
He can be an art teacher.

239
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,206
How come I'm paid three hundred less?

240
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,406
So, it is a deal?

241
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:29,047
Luzhou.

242
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:30,967
It depends on my mood.

243
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:32,767
Yes.

244
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,967
I'll spend the holiday with my brother.

245
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:18,936
(Ten Things to Do after Graduation)

246
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,832
(10. Watch the sunrise
with someone you like)

247
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:26,007
Abandon.

248
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,286
Abandon.

249
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,286
Analyze.

250
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:32,246
Analyze.

251
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:32,927
Zhi.

252
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,967
Are you in love?

253
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:36,326
No.

254
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,887
I saw the list

255
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,246
in your room.

256
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,647
Watch the sunrise with someone you like?

257
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:44,126
What's that?

258
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:45,687
It was listed by Cai Yingying.

259
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:46,927
She wanted to make a video

260
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,486
about ten things to do after graduation.

261
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,366
Since Yingying wanted

262
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,847
to do it with you,

263
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,727
do you want me to financially help you

264
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,526
with your graduation trip?

265
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,047
The exam results will come out soon.

266
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,927
I should just study at home.

267
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,126
As the old saying goes,

268
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,366
traveling benefits people more
than reading.

269
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,326
Now that you've read books,

270
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:14,767
it's time to travel.

271
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:16,607
Go see the great landscapes.

272
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:17,847
- Isn't that right?
- Xu.

273
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,446
Traveling will cost a lot of money.

274
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,607
Don't you know our financial situation?

275
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,366
The money you guaranteed for others

276
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:26,566
is still unpaid.

277
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:27,687
Yeah,

278
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,927
but Mr. Cai has already paid it back
for me.

279
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,126
Don't worry about this.

280
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:31,687
Moreover,

281
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,326
someone else owes me money.

282
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:33,887
Who?

283
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,768
Mr. Lin, the lottery ticket seller?

284
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,246
He owes our family five million.

285
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:39,526
Zhi.

286
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,286
I have big news.

287
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:42,767
Yingying.

288
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,240
- Have you eaten?
- Hello, Mr. Xu.

289
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,567
I haven't eaten. But it doesn't matter.

290
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,486
- Guess what?
- What happened to your hair?

291
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:51,767
It was dyed black yesterday.

292
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,446
Listen to me.

293
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:54,366
I have good news.

294
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:00,847
I'm going out
with Yingying for two days.

295
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:04,086
Weren't you saying
you'd save money for me

296
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,126
and stay home?

297
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,887
Didn't you tell me
to see the landscapes?

298
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,112
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

299
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,807
By the way, where are you going?

300
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:13,687
How many people?

301
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:15,007
With any boys?

302
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:18,126
What are you posting?

303
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:21,326
Let me see.

304
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,967
Spitting

305
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,647
makes you lose money.

306
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,144
(Spitting makes you lose money)

307
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,087
Isn't that Xu Zhi's boyfriend?

308
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:46,967
Were you just avoiding him?

309
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:48,887
Don't be silly. Let's go.

310
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:50,927
We have to catch the bus now.

311
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,406
Wait, what do you actually mean, Lucy?

312
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:55,566
You have a crush on Xu Zhi?

313
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:57,567
I'm saying something immoral.

314
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,807
If you really want to steal

315
00:14:58,927 --> 00:14:59,767
his girlfriend,

316
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:00,366
it's okay.

317
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,286
I'll back you up, buddy.

318
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:02,967
But,

319
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:04,486
why did you just avoid him?

320
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:05,887
I'm just worried

321
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,486
if his girlfriend is into me,

322
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,847
can't I try to avoid confronting him?

323
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,007
Drop the act.

324
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,967
You reacted like having an affair.

325
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,446
Also, I'm telling you,

326
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:16,687
Xu Zhi's boyfriend

327
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:17,767
isn't a good person.

328
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:19,326
She made bad choices.

329
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,406
Be careful.

330
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:22,607
Did you hear me?

331
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:48,246
Do you know him?

332
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:49,967
Who?

333
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,526
Xu Zhi's boyfriend.

334
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,166
I know him very well.

335
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:56,727
His name is Tan Xu.

336
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,246
We went to the same high school.

337
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:00,126
In his second year,
he had a problem with a guy.

338
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,326
He told everyone

339
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,887
that he excluded him.

340
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,047
That's not even the main point.

341
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:08,246
He presented the school

342
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,687
with a depression diagnosis certificate.

343
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,406
He even got that guy expelled.

344
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:13,967
Most disgustingly,

345
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,687
that diagnosis certificate
was actually fake.

346
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,366
How do you know it was fake?

347
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,007
Do you remember Feng Jin?

348
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,566
My classmate in middle school.

349
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,246
Feng Jin was close to him back then.

350
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:24,406
He told me personally.

351
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,807
Listen, there are
even more outrageous things.

352
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,440
- Alright, stop talking.
- That is...

353
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:33,326
Let's sleep.

354
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,927
(Fu Yu Villa)

355
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,126
Hello, your room card.

356
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:01,967
Thank you.

357
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,607
Put it away.

358
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:05,286
Okay.

359
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:06,887
Still not feeling well?

360
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:07,967
I got car sick.

361
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:10,166
I'll ask Mr. Fu for some ginger slices.

362
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,647
- Alright.
- Ginger water will help.

363
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:14,607
Who needs ginger slices?

364
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:16,687
- Mr. Fu.
- Mr. Fu.

365
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,687
What brings you here?

366
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,767
It's been a long time.

367
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,126
Have you forgotten me?

368
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:25,007
How could it be?

369
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,446
Want to ride a bike, don't you?

370
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:28,967
I haven't ridden for two years.

371
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,807
You aren't here for a vacation, right?

372
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:31,566
It's a secret.

373
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:34,767
Get her some ginger slices.

374
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,046
Thank you.

375
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:37,166
Put them in water.

376
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:38,967
I want to talk

377
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,206
to your boss, not you.

378
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,727
Call him out. Where is he?

379
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:43,486
Call him out. Come on.

380
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:44,166
Sorry.

381
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:45,526
We only have spring water.

382
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,047
What's going on?

383
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,967
Stop making a scene here.

384
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:49,847
This isn't your home.

385
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,087
You may go.

386
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:53,526
What's wrong?

387
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,566
I can't drink this terrible water.

388
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:57,526
Why did you say it?

389
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,206
We just have spring water here.

390
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,007
I'll tell you one last time.

391
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:02,647
If you don't like it,

392
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:04,647
then boil it before drinking.

393
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,406
What if I get kidney stones then?

394
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,126
Who will

395
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:08,047
be responsible?

396
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:09,486
Get what?

397
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:11,687
Kidney stones.

398
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:12,727
Kidney stones?

399
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:16,326
Kid, have you grown up physically?

400
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,486
You're being rude.

401
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,246
Kid.

402
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:20,326
You calm down.

403
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:21,767
My brother is coming soon.

404
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:22,847
You wait.

405
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,326
Welcome, this way, please.

406
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,166
Chen Xingqi,
how many times have I told you?

407
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:33,366
Don't call me for no reason, okay?

408
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,887
We met again. What a coincidence.

409
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,007
No, it can't be such a coincidence.

410
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:43,767
She planned it.

411
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:44,767
His parents.

412
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,446
Cai Yingying messaged me
a couple of days ago.

413
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:49,727
Now I think I know why.

414
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,486
The owner of the villa
is my dad's friend.

415
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:54,328
Yingying and I came for a vacation.

416
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,326
Have your parents

417
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:56,206
arrived?

418
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:57,566
My parents?

419
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,406
Didn't you come with your family?

420
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:00,847
Who told you that?

421
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:04,526
Zhu Yangqi said Chen Luzhou

422
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,166
is going to spend a vacation

423
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,887
with his family at Fu Yu Villa today.

424
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:09,126
If you go there,

425
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,887
you'll definitely see his mom.

426
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,126
This boy is Lucy's family.

427
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,847
- He's my brother.
- This boy?

428
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:20,647
- Luzhou.
- Right.

429
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:22,967
He has no sense of offering service.

430
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,560
This water is terrible.
But he refused to change it.

431
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:26,246
What's wrong?

432
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:27,687
You are

433
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,526
so picky.

434
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:29,647
You're his brother?

435
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,687
He isn't used to our water.

436
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,286
Unfortunately,

437
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,566
we only have spring water,

438
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:37,526
not purified water.

439
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,047
Can't it be delivered?

440
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,047
No.

441
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,616
It takes two hours to get here.
Nobody does it.

442
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:44,126
And the guests who come here

443
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:45,566
like to drink spring water.

444
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,007
No one wants ordinary water.

445
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:52,526
How about this?

446
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,406
I'll refund your room charge.

447
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,286
You can leave then.

448
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:57,087
Wait a minute.

449
00:19:58,007 --> 00:19:59,567
If it's just about water,

450
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:00,607
I can go down to buy it.

451
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:02,326
How are you going?

452
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:03,486
By driving.

453
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:05,807
Can you drive?

454
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:06,904
You have a license?

455
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,486
Do you want to be detained?

456
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,486
Alright, I was wrong.

457
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,366
I should comply with the law.

458
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:12,727
I have a license.

459
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,246
Where can I buy water

460
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:16,166
around here?

461
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:17,927
Can you lend me a car?

462
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,246
I can pay money.

463
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:21,246
A bike or a car is fine.

464
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:27,687
No car.

465
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,526
Figure it out yourself.

466
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:31,807
You bad kid.

467
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,566
Luzhou, he insulted me.

468
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:34,446
What a hot temper!

469
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:35,887
Being single for decades

470
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:37,767
makes his temper get worse.

471
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:40,126
Can I friend you on WeChat?

472
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:42,046
If you and your brother have anything,

473
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:42,727
just tell me.

474
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,007
For example,

475
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,486
borrowing a car from Mr. Fu.

476
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,446
Chen Luzhou,

477
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,446
I pay you 800 a day.

478
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:51,446
It's not for you

479
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,807
to friend a girl here.

480
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,246
Help me get the water.

481
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:56,126
Come on.

482
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,976
- Go to our room. Hurry.
- Let me friend you.

483
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:00,206
Zhu Yangqi.

484
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:01,687
Coming.

485
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:02,847
I have to go.

486
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,246
Come on.

487
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,526
It's hard to friend him on WeChat.

488
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,727
It's all Zhu Yangqi's fault.

489
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:17,967
Just Luzhou's brother.

490
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,967
He said Luzhou came with his parents.

491
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:21,847
We came in a hurry

492
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:22,887
all the way.

493
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:23,927
I even got car sick.

494
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:28,126
So bitter.

495
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:31,927
What are you doing?

496
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:36,047
I'm thinking about
how to friend Chen Luzhou on WeChat.

497
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,767
Since his mother doesn't come,

498
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,366
we have to win him over first.

499
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:41,007
Isn't this easy?

500
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,166
Let me teach you some tips

501
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,366
for making friends.

502
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:48,807
If you want to friend a hot guy,

503
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,647
remember the following things.

504
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:51,847
First,

505
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,566
surpass him and defeat him

506
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:55,366
in his area of expertise

507
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:56,687
to attract his attention.

508
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:58,326
Second,

509
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,286
in a field he is unfamiliar with,

510
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,126
try to be humble,

511
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:03,927
lest you hurt his pride.

512
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:05,967
Third,

513
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,166
and last but not least...

514
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:14,126
Have you remembered it?

515
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,566
They are important

516
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,927
and I told nobody before.

517
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,526
You must keep it in mind

518
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:19,767
and get the point.

519
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,567
Could you ask Cai Yingying

520
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:30,807
if Xu Zhi is free later?

521
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,326
You're finally ready to act.

522
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,727
Yeah, I can't wait.

523
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:40,007
What do you plan to do?

524
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:41,647
What can I do?

525
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,647
Let Lun get in there

526
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:43,727
to score.

527
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:46,366
No, I mean Xu Zhi.

528
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:47,967
Why are you talking about Lun?

529
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,206
I mean the game.

530
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,687
Why did you bring up Xu Zhi?

531
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,007
You just asked if she is free.

532
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,007
Although she's here for you,

533
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:58,246
and her boyfriend isn't a good guy,

534
00:22:58,326 --> 00:22:59,927
they haven't broken up yet.

535
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:02,166
You better not mess this up.

536
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:06,486
Who promised to back me up before?

537
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:09,406
Come on.

538
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,126
Even so, let me prepare mentally.

539
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:14,047
Buddy.

540
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:16,607
How can I borrow a car without Xu Zhi?

541
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:17,847
Without a car,

542
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:19,727
how can I buy water for you guys?

543
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:21,366
You also can't

544
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:22,607
drink spring water, can you?

545
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,280
(One New Message)

546
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,206
Who is it? So annoying.

547
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:30,366
Zhi.

548
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:32,687
Big news.

549
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:33,566
What is it?

550
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:34,727
Listen.

551
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:36,607
Hello!

552
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:39,286
Chen Luzhou asks if Xu Zhi is free now

553
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:41,326
to take him to buy purified water.

554
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:45,286
Congrats, Zhi.

555
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:47,526
Just one step away from meeting his mom.

556
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,647
You must seize the opportunity.

557
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:50,566
Hurry up.

558
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:51,967
Friend him on WeChat.

559
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:53,446
Come on.

560
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:55,807
Hurry up.

561
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:58,166
Bye-bye.

562
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:23,727
(If you want to friend a hot guy,)

563
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:24,566
(first,)

564
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,767
(defeat him in his area of expertise)

565
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:28,206
(to attract his attention.)

566
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:29,720
(Set as background)

567
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,126
Do you have a charger?

568
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:40,087
Thank you.

569
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:41,007
No problem.

570
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,624
(The Bicycle Thief, comments)

571
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:06,727
Listen to music?

572
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:07,967
Up to you.

573
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:27,087
I really like this movie.

574
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:29,727
It shows the indifference

575
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,366
and poverty in Rome after World War II

576
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:33,967
and the importance of family.

577
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,406
Although it is a tragic story,

578
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,406
it also conveys a sense of hope.

579
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:40,566
No matter how tough life is,

580
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:42,047
with the warmth of family,

581
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,406
there will always be a new day.

582
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:46,406
You have seen it.

583
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:48,486
I like it when the director

584
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:49,687
integrated his metaphor

585
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,246
in that kind of audiovisual language.

586
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:52,366
For example,

587
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,246
when Ricci passed under the bridge,

588
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:54,887
he seized

589
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,727
the man with a flower pot
in the bike basket.

590
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:57,767
The director tried to say

591
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,727
- the flower pot means...
- It was debunked.

592
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:00,687
That was just a prop.

593
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:01,927
Don't overinterpret it.

594
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:03,727
Alright.

595
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:08,047
(Cai Yingying must be tricking me.)

596
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,007
(I knew I couldn't trust her.)

597
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,047
By the way,

598
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,807
can you help me with navigation?
I'm not familiar with the road.

599
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:21,446
Password?

600
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:22,727
Four ones.

601
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:24,727
Why not set it as your birthday?

602
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:26,526
This is my birth date.

603
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,126
Good day.

604
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:33,046
You have entered the mountain route.

605
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:35,166
The journey takes about one hour
and 45 minutes.

606
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,566
The road is winding.

607
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:37,607
Can you hear it?

608
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,607
Keep your speed
within 40 kilometers per hour.

609
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:42,446
Some sections have no signal coverage.

610
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:44,366
Just download offline maps in advance.

611
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:46,526
(Have you friended him?)

612
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:50,486
(Your advice doesn't work.)

613
00:26:58,206 --> 00:26:59,807
(After all, he is a freak.)

614
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:05,286
(You think about)

615
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:08,047
(what I should do to make him
take me to see his mom.)

616
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,566
(Be his girlfriend.)

617
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,767
(Then he will take you
to meet his parents.)

618
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:19,406
(What if he has a girlfriend?)

619
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:24,007
(Then be his dad's girlfriend.)

620
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,647
(His mom will surely come to find you.)

621
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,166
(Yingying.)

622
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,007
(Go take a morality class.)

623
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,366
(You need proper moral values.)

624
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,807
Consecutive sharp turns
three kilometers ahead.

625
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:41,286
Watch out for oncoming vehicles.

626
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,087
Do you have a girlfriend?

627
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:45,126
No.

628
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:49,847
(I really miss you.)

629
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,206
(Are you still mad at me?)

630
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:52,246
(Chen Luzhou.)

631
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,246
(I'm crazy about you.)

632
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:56,647
She's not my girlfriend.

633
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:04,087
Your screensaver is quite nice.

634
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:06,687
It was taken during a game.

635
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,446
Game?

636
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:13,607
What's wrong?

637
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:26,366
It seems like

638
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:27,687
your chat is inconsistent.

639
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,607
I'm thinking. Don't disturb me for now.

640
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:31,687
Let me think carefully.

641
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:34,526
(Why are you being mad?)

642
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:45,727
(No.1 High School)
Chen Luzhou, go!

643
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:52,967
(Ruijun VS. No.1 High School,
Second Quarter)

644
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,486
Xu Zhi.

645
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,608
Give this to sports coordinator.

646
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,166
No.1 High School, go!

647
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:20,727
No.1 High School, go!

648
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,286
No.1 High School, go!

649
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:23,887
No.1 High School, go!

650
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:25,286
No.1 High School, go!

651
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,486
Help me give it to that guy.

652
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,566
Sports coordinator.

653
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,206
Thanks.

654
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:44,166
Xu Zhi.

655
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:45,927
Who did you give the water to?

656
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:47,566
I don't know either.

657
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:49,087
Forget it.

658
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:04,887
(So, it was him.)

659
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:07,246
(He's still so narcissistic.)

660
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,486
(She's good)

661
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:15,647
(at flirting.)

662
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,286
(Is she trying to attract me?)

663
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:40,807
What's wrong now?

664
00:30:41,246 --> 00:30:41,807
Luzhou.

665
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,887
There's nothing to eat
in this lousy villa.

666
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:45,607
Buy me griddled bullfrog.

667
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,526
I want it.

668
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,727
I don't offer this service.

669
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:51,446
If you want full delivery service,
raise my pay tenfold.

670
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:52,446
Chen Luzhou.

671
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,126
You've gone crazy for money, huh?

672
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,647
You're overcharging me.

673
00:30:56,246 --> 00:30:58,007
Anyway, I want griddled bullfrog.

674
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:58,526
No way.

675
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,647
Who did you go out with?

676
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:01,967
What took you so long?

677
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,647
The girl you ran into in the lobby.

678
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:06,847
The girl

679
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:09,446
who intended to drive without a license?

680
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:11,326
Can you keep your voice down?

681
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:12,246
She can hear you.

682
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,047
Pretty lady.

683
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:16,647
If you want to date my brother,

684
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,206
buy me griddled bullfrog

685
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:19,126
without coriander.

686
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:20,286
I've bought sickness pills.

687
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,687
What did your brother say?
He wanted griddled bullfrog?

688
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,246
Just ignore him.

689
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:27,126
He's spoiled.

690
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:30,887
There's a restaurant right here.

691
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:33,007
Let's go.

692
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:34,607
Just buy it for your brother.

693
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:36,326
(So thoughtful.)

694
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,847
(You are falling for me.)

695
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:40,166
(Stop pretending.)

696
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:47,126
What flavor does your brother like?

697
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,887
The fermented bean one is good.

698
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:52,486
Just say it, Xu Zhi.

699
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:53,406
Are you pursuing...?

700
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:55,326
Stop!

701
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:56,286
You can't catch me.

702
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:12,206
Are you okay?

703
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,647
If you need me to help explain,

704
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:30,687
I can go.

705
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:32,967
You order. I'll be right back.

706
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:39,166
Tan Xu.

707
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:52,087
What can we talk about?

708
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:55,007
Can you stop being so disheartened?

709
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:58,687
How I am doesn't concern you.

710
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,807
In my second year of high school,
my dad got depression.

711
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:04,967
I was also muddled all day.

712
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:06,727
Your words enlightened me.

713
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:09,007
You said that there is no real despair,

714
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,007
only prisoners of their thoughts.

715
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:13,286
Sorry.

716
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,326
Those aren't my words.

717
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:18,007
I saw them in a book.

718
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:23,047
I just don't get it.

719
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:25,406
Are those words that good?

720
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:28,166
Why do you always use them
to lecture me?

721
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:30,246
You're sad for failing
College Entrance Examination.

722
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,246
I understand you.

723
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:32,647
But you don't need to be hostile.

724
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,566
The one who failed the exam is me,

725
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:35,366
not you.

726
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:37,847
As a winner,

727
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:39,366
stop showing off

728
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:40,446
in front of me.

729
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:45,126
Xu Zhi.

730
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,206
Do you know
what your biggest problem is?

731
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,126
You are always emotionally stable.

732
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:54,927
But actually,

733
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:56,967
it's because you have poor empathy.

734
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,767
You can't know what others are thinking.

735
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:06,887
No, one more round.

736
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,607
Best two out of three. A game is a game.

737
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:12,286
Now that you lost,

738
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,046
you promise me

739
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:14,927
not to point this gun at others.

740
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,326
It's dangerous. Got it?

741
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:18,967
Here you are.

742
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:21,406
Thank you.

743
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:24,206
Wait.

744
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:25,847
Take your gun.

745
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,087
Thank you.

746
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:37,847
Because of him?

747
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:39,406
It's between us.

748
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:40,607
Nothing to do with him.

749
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:43,767
Didn't he ask you

750
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:45,607
make a clean break

751
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:46,967
with me?

752
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,486
You and I were never together.

753
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:50,687
Because I failed the exam

754
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:54,007
and you found a better guy?

755
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:56,486
That's why you deny our past?

756
00:34:59,047 --> 00:34:59,767
Xu Zhi.

757
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:01,366
I thought

758
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:02,566
we were in a relationship.

759
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:04,286
I used to help you so much.

760
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:05,607
So what?

761
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:07,887
Do I have to like you
just because I'm grateful?

762
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:18,206
It seems I overthought it.

763
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:20,446
I thought you were different.

764
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,526
You wouldn't be distant

765
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:25,007
because I'm depressed.

766
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:27,126
In the end,

767
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:28,286
you aren't different.

768
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:31,246
You still look down on me.

769
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,326
Have you seen a doctor?

770
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:36,406
Are you sure you're depressed?

771
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:39,526
What do you mean?

772
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:42,607
You think I'm lying?

773
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,126
Do you dare to admit it?

774
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,687
You're gaslighting me.

775
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,246
Here you go.

776
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:10,767
Why are you here again?

777
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:11,927
I already got one.

778
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,166
I can't eat anymore.

779
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:14,566
Thank you.

780
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:21,446
You want this?

781
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:29,446
Where are your mom and dad?

782
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:32,206
Do they let you eat things
from strangers?

783
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,566
What if this guy is a bad person?

784
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,807
I don't want it.

785
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,286
Why are you being harsh?

786
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,166
You had a quarrel?

787
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:46,526
I didn't.

788
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:49,087
I just scared him.

789
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:50,526
Why?

790
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:52,126
I told him not to bother me.

791
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:14,446
If you need someone

792
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:15,887
to talk with you,

793
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:16,566
I can do that.

794
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:17,647
No need.

795
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,847
Finish this and go back early,
or your brother will trouble you again.

796
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:23,767
You know him so well.

797
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:25,526
Your brother

798
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:27,206
wants bullfrog,

799
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:27,847
just like

800
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,366
my grandma wants sweet potatoes.

801
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:30,526
She can't wait.

802
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:31,567
If she wants it,

803
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:32,847
she must have it immediately.

804
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:34,406
I see.

805
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:38,007
Your brother pays you 800 a day.

806
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:39,128
Are you short of money?

807
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:41,206
I want to be financially independent.

808
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:43,727
Do you have a problem?

809
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:44,727
No.

810
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:46,687
Friend you on WeChat.

811
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:49,847
(She just broke up.)

812
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,607
(She can't wait, can she?)

813
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:53,807
(She can't do)

814
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,326
(without a boyfriend?)

815
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:57,246
If there's a job, I'll think of you.

816
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,767
Hey, you opened the payment code.

817
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,687
I sent it.

818
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:21,007
Chen Luzhou, right?

819
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:27,166
I am Xu Zhi on Wechat.

820
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:33,807
So, when can I go to your place?

821
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:39,406
It's okay.

822
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:42,486
Too fast.

823
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:44,126
You said it at your doorstep.

824
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:46,687
Friend you on WeChat,
and you'll let me hear you

825
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:47,526
get scolded.

826
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,126
You're persistent.

827
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,567
My mom has been too busy lately

828
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:55,566
to look after me.

829
00:38:56,486 --> 00:38:57,206
Otherwise,

830
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:58,607
she won't leave his son to me.

831
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:02,446
If you want to hear me getting scolded,
you'll have to wait.

832
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:07,087
Looking forward to it.

833
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:11,326
(Now,)

834
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:12,847
(am I having an affair?)

835
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,448
(Chen Luzhou.)

836
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:30,526
There's nothing you can't do.

837
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:33,286
I'll create a group.
You get Chen Luzhou in.

838
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:34,647
What do you want?

839
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,087
I know the two of you.

840
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,166
You can make the conversation
a dead end.

841
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:40,847
But it won't happen in a group.

842
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:41,927
There's no silence.

843
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,366
If you don't respond,
someone else always will.

844
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:48,509
(Group chat)

845
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,246
Let me reply.

846
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:53,887
Let's earn money

847
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:55,366
together.

848
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,366
See, I told you.

849
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:04,927
Cai Yingying,

850
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:06,526
you've got something.

851
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,847
(Change the name of group chat)
Get gold chains everywhere.

852
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:15,967
This is not bad.

853
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,126
Just now Zhu Yangqi asked me

854
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:35,366
if you took Lucy
to plow the fields this afternoon.

855
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:36,607
He looks exhausted.

856
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:37,887
Really?

857
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:40,366
He looked happy

858
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:41,566
with the little girl.

859
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,086
Given your tone,

860
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,767
are you being jealous?

861
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:52,446
What makes you say that?

862
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:57,752
Who knows?

863
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:11,126
Lucy, can I borrow your charging cable?

864
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:13,047
I lent it to Xu Zhi.

865
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:15,166
Can you get it back?

866
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:16,126
It's urgent.

867
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:17,887
Okay.

868
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,807
Hurry up.

869
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,767
I've already texted her.

870
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:27,326
Sorry, I left it at the restaurant.

871
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,807
I'll buy you a new one later.

872
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:31,807
It's a trick.

873
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:33,166
It's a total trick.

874
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:34,847
She just created opportunities

875
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,607
to see you again.

876
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:37,967
She used that as an excuse.

877
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:39,406
Lucy,

878
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,526
you're in trouble now.

879
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:45,087
Do we have something to drink?

880
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:48,647
You usually don't drink beverages.

881
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:50,366
I want to drink now.

882
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:51,087
Can't I?

883
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:53,326
Okay, I'll get it for you.

884
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:54,687
Thanks.

885
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:58,967
By the way, after you went out,

886
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:01,046
why do you seem so gloomy now?

887
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:01,887
What happened?

888
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,406
It seems Xu Zhi and Tan Xu broke up.

889
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:07,727
Chen Luzhou, it's none of your business.

890
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:08,607
Why are you gloomy?

891
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,847
Don't do something stupid.

892
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:12,607
No.

893
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:13,607
I...

894
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:14,486
I don't know why.

895
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:16,807
I just feel...

896
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,087
What?

897
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:21,086
I want to buy you food

898
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,246
to not owe you a favor.

899
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:26,767
Lead the way, then.

900
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,486
If you need me to help explain,

901
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:29,286
I can go.

902
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:31,687
You order. I'll be right back.

903
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:34,607
Friend you on WeChat.

904
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:38,126
If there's a job, I'll think of you.

905
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:44,847
I just

906
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:46,526
can't refuse her.

907
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,607
What do you mean by that?

908
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,566
I don't know either.

909
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:51,847
If I knew,

910
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:53,126
I wouldn't be annoyed by her.

911
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:54,767
She had a boyfriend,

912
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:55,647
but she still...

913
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:57,446
Are you annoyed by her?

914
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,526
You're annoyed that she had a boyfriend.

915
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,087
Let me tell you.

916
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:07,526
Xu Zhi is indeed quite pretty.

917
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:09,246
But the girls pursuing you

918
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:10,526
are all pretty, right?

919
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:11,607
Gu Yan

920
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:13,607
is a gorgeous girl.

921
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:14,807
Yet you refused her.

922
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:16,887
So,

923
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:18,967
Xu Zhi

924
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:21,246
is different from other girls

925
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,446
because she had a boyfriend.

926
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:27,087
So?

927
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:28,126
So,

928
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:30,927
what you can't refuse
isn't actually her,

929
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:32,246
well,

930
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,246
but this kind of

931
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,446
excitement.

932
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:38,526
Well,

933
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:41,246
it is like

934
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,206
an unspeakable affair.

935
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:45,807
Got it?

936
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:12,388
(She's good)

937
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,968
(at flirting.)

938
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:21,880
(Is she trying to attract me?)

939
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:29,360
♪Like a cloud drifting away♪

940
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:35,440
♪Freely crossing the vast sky♪
