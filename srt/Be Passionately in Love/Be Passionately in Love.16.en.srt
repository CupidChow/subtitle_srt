(I'm Trying to Win My Ex Back)

18
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:49,243
You have no idea

19
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:50,722
what happened

20
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:51,723
in the first month.

21
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:53,083
A senior

22
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,403
brings Xu Zhi breakfast

23
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:56,484
at 8 AM outside her dorm every day.

24
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,083
Guess what Xu Zhi said to him.

25
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:59,404
What did she say?

26
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,203
She said,

27
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,242
"Senior, you're a bit too late.

28
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,243
I've already eaten."

29
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:05,722
The guy asked her, "What time

30
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:06,723
do you have breakfast?"

31
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,004
She said, "At 4 AM."

32
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,924
The senior complained to his roommate,

33
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:14,004
"She's so mean.

34
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,283
She could have said 6 AM

35
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:17,484
to make it sound less harsh."

36
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,364
Who wakes up at 4 AM in college?

37
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,804
She does.

38
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,083
How do you know?

39
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:26,284
You think it's easy to succeed?

40
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:28,884
As the only dark horse in Ruijun School,

41
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,964
she has put in great effort to get here.

42
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:32,284
That's impressive.

43
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:33,845
We studied so hard

44
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,484
in the No.1 High School.

45
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:38,123
We benefited
from the environment greatly.

46
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,123
It's expected that we can get enrolled.

47
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:41,723
But she's different.

48
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:44,324
Her story brought hope to many people.

49
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,284
Don't you find it cool?

50
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:48,964
True.

51
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,324
She's much cooler than us.

52
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:10,083
She has a lot of admirers?

53
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:13,844
Anyway,

54
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,284
there are quite a few.

55
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,884
I've run into several of them.

56
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,123
Random people asked for her contact.

57
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,444
But it's died down a lot.

58
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:26,324
They know that she's hard to approach.

59
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,163
Even Jiang Yu couldn't win her over.

60
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:31,122
So others wouldn't humiliate themselves.

61
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,123
Jiang Yu?

62
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:33,603
The one we just ran into?

63
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:38,324
He's alright.

64
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,683
Pretty handsome.

65
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,284
Come on, stop being so jealous.

66
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,404
I'm not jealous.

67
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,004
If she wants to date

68
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,123
a decent guy,

69
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:50,004
I'm fine with it.

70
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:56,764
Sure.

71
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,284
Anyway, I've asked around.

72
00:03:58,764 --> 00:03:59,844
Jiang Yu

73
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:01,563
is quite a nice guy.

74
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,123
Xu Zhi

75
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,484
works in his department.

76
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:07,404
What department?

77
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,203
I heard

78
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,444
that a senior student

79
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,964
sharing the dorm with Xu Zhi

80
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,683
instigated Xu Zhi to join

81
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,523
the publicity department.

82
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,884
Anyway, he has the upper hand here.

83
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,603
Bro,

84
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:23,804
you'd better hurry.

85
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,843
It can accommodate about 500 people.

86
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:33,404
I think the venue is big enough.

87
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,444
(Campus Basketball Game)
Since we have so many audiences,

88
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,242
we must secure a drink supplier

89
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:38,364
as soon as possible.

90
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:40,404
So how's it going

91
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,444
with the two potential sponsors?

92
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,843
I have their information.

93
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:45,884
I'll send it to everyone.

94
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,324
We'll decide

95
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:49,444
whom to work with through discussion.

96
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:54,563
That's pretty much it
about the sponsorship

97
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:56,324
for next week's basketball game.

98
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,643
Let's see which one

99
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:58,563
of these two companies

100
00:04:58,563 --> 00:04:59,643
should we work with.

101
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,484
Alright?

102
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:01,484
- Keep it up.
- Okay.

103
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:02,683
- Alright.
- Okay.

104
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:05,243
Senior,

105
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:07,324
we have many potential sponsors.

106
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:08,763
How do we decide

107
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:10,682
which one is better?

108
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,203
Should we work with all of them

109
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,243
or should we choose one?

110
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,004
It requires more consideration.

111
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:18,004
Alright.

112
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:19,603
Let's see.

113
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,043
Which one should we choose?

114
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:23,484
Which one

115
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,884
do you think is better?

116
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,288
Focus on how much the school can fund.

117
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:29,764
(Something bothering you?
Feeling unwell?)

118
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,683
That's it then.

119
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:41,243
(Go back to rest.)

120
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:43,203
(I'll update you later.)

121
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:45,284
- Okay, no problem.
- Okay.

122
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:46,683
Send me a copy too.

123
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:48,563
Let's pack up.

124
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,563
- Alright.
- Okay.

125
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:50,964
(Thank you, Senior.)

126
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:51,884
Alright.

127
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:53,444
Take a look at this.

128
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:55,044
Let's put these away

129
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:56,964
and start working on it.

130
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,523
Okay.

131
00:05:58,603 --> 00:05:59,364
- Alright.
- Okay.

132
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:00,364
Alright.

133
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,682
Zhi, stop being mad.

134
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,444
Chen Luzhou is not that kind of person.

135
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:09,723
What kind of person?

136
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,562
The kind who comes and goes
as they please

137
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:13,643
and shirks responsibility.

138
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:14,844
You know him well?

139
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:16,484
No, I don't.

140
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,443
I just think that he didn't tell you

141
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:21,643
because he couldn't.

142
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:25,444
You're not surprised

143
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,163
that Chen Luzhou came

144
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,603
to Huaguang University.

145
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:31,643
Come clean.

146
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:39,003
I went to Zhu Yangqi's place

147
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,364
when I first came to Beijing

148
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:41,285
to form a plan

149
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:42,484
to surprise you.

150
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,043
But in his rental, I ran into

151
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:45,963
Chen Luzhou who had just returned.

152
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:47,284
Turns out I was the only fool.

153
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:48,803
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

154
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,404
They forbade me from telling you.

155
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:51,683
Enough, no need to explain.

156
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,523
Are you really mad at me?

157
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,723
We're breaking off for 24 hours.

158
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:57,123
Where are you going?

159
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:57,844
Back to study

160
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:58,924
to feel better.

161
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:05,964
Is this the mindset of a top student?

162
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:14,764
We're finally back.

163
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:16,723
Xu Zhi.

164
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,163
How did it go?

165
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,203
Did you see that guy?

166
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,884
Isn't he extremely

167
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:23,203
handsome?

168
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:25,884
He's okay. Just so-so.

169
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,963
Are you calling the grapes sour

170
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:28,964
out of jealousy?

171
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,643
This is good.

172
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,924
You have different aesthetics.

173
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:34,163
Besides,

174
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:37,484
I really find Jiang Yu nice

175
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:38,804
and trustworthy.

176
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:40,523
Give him a chance, maybe.

177
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,284
Come on. Can't you tell

178
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,243
that Xu Zhi doesn't like him at all?

179
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:45,805
She said she wasn't

180
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:47,082
looking for a relationship.

181
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,444
Why do you keep pushing her?

182
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,964
I just don't want her
to miss out on him.

183
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:52,643
Besides, look at her.

184
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,884
Isn't it obvious

185
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:55,562
that she hasn't

186
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,804
moved on from the last relationship?

187
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,723
Jiang Yu is a nice guy.

188
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:00,764
Don't you think so?

189
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:01,364
That's true.

190
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,523
No, I don't.

191
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,924
That's very kind of you.

192
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,043
But I don't have feelings for him.

193
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:08,603
Enough.

194
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,284
We're roommates.

195
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,364
Don't be so serious. Okay?

196
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:14,723
Fine.

197
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:15,844
I won't mention it again.

198
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:19,043
It's okay.

199
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:20,203
I apologize.

200
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:21,964
I got worked up just now.

201
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,123
Sorry.

202
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,403
What's wrong, Si?

203
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:26,524
Anything bothering you lately?

204
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:28,804
My boyfriend annoys me so much.

205
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,884
Your boyfriend?

206
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,123
Since when?

207
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,644
We started dating before university

208
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:36,644
and we both got admitted here.

209
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,564
Nice, Si.

210
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:40,243
You're quite something.

211
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:40,844
Tell us.

212
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,524
What does he study? What's his name?

213
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,243
Got a photo?

214
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:44,483
Economics.

215
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:45,564
Zhao Tianqi.

216
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,924
Economics. Zhao Tianqi.

217
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,203
- Haven't heard of him.
- Haven't heard of him.

218
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:51,684
Come on.

219
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:52,844
He's very handsome.

220
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:54,323
He's also been to the canteen.

221
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:55,323
Really?

222
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:55,924
Yeah.

223
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:57,724
Introduce him to us next time.

224
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,764
That depends on my mood.

225
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,403
I'll see if he's
as handsome as Jiang Yu.

226
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:04,524
Wait, Si.

227
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:06,163
Why are you mad

228
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:07,443
at your boyfriend?

229
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:13,684
I'm not forcing you.

230
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:14,684
Don't feel pressured.

231
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:17,684
Because

232
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:20,884
he keeps making decisions for me,

233
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:22,564
telling me what to do.

234
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,363
But I don't like it at all.

235
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,283
That's why I got agitated

236
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:27,564
when I heard what you said.

237
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:28,965
If you don't like it,

238
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,123
why don't you tell him?

239
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:34,323
I don't want to disappoint him

240
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,283
or let it affect our relationship.

241
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:37,924
But you're getting affected now.

242
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:39,844
If you keep it to yourself,

243
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:41,403
he will never know how you feel.

244
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:42,443
You will end up

245
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,083
finding him boring one day.

246
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,564
And he won't know what went wrong.

247
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:47,444
Exactly.

248
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:48,724
It's the 21st century.

249
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:50,323
Say what you have to say.

250
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:51,803
Start expressing yourself

251
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,123
in your relationships.

252
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:55,004
It gets me so anxious
just to hear about it.

253
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:56,443
Yeah, she is right.

254
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,684
Tianqi.

255
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,443
Your girlfriend studies architecture?

256
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:22,684
Yeah.

257
00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:24,483
Can you send me

258
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:25,684
her course schedule?

259
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,123
What for?

260
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,004
To sit in on the classes.

261
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:34,684
There you go.

262
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:35,483
Thanks.

263
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:36,483
No problem.

264
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:48,147
(Timetable for Huaguang University's
School of Architecture's Courses)

265
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:08,984
- Have to line up.
- Okay.

266
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:09,524
If you...

00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:10,524

How about breakfast together?

290

Waiting outside my dorm? What a cliché.

291
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,083
It's too outdated to be you.

292
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:37,644
I don't mind clichés.

293
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,604
I just want to see you.

294
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,083
You saw me.

295
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,604
You can leave.

296
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:57,604
Thanks.

297
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:03,924
Thanks.

298
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,163
What time did you come?

299
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,083
At 4 AM.

300
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,123
Why didn't you text me first?

301
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,684
I did.

302
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,163
You didn't reply.

303
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:30,283
You sent an emoji.

304
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,483
What should I reply?

305
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,243
I know you're busy today.

306
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:36,604
I won't waste too much

307
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:37,924
of your time.

308
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,403
How do you know I'm busy today?

309
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:41,283
I live in the same dorm

310
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:42,283
as your roommate

311
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:43,564
Liu Yisi's boyfriend.

312
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,123
I asked for your course schedule.

313
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,443
You're roommates with Zhao Tianqi?

314
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:53,565
Alright.

315
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:54,804
You've said enough.

316
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,564
Now you can stay quiet.

317
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:01,884
I don't drink milk.

318
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,323
Is it fun to mess with me?

319
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:21,243
You're allowed one more sentence.

320
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,203
I didn't mean it.

321
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:26,684
Something happened.

322
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,724
There was a bombing case in Ruicheng.

323
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:31,884
My mom changed her mind

324
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:32,964
and allowed me to stay.

325
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:36,363
And then?

326
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:40,243
I wanted to retake Grade 12.

327
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,163
But I saw the enrollment plan

328
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,684
on Huaguang's website.

329
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,964
Public Administration major
didn't fill up.

330
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:47,203
I thought it was destiny.

331
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,724
So I applied to see how it would go.

332
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:52,724
Why didn't you tell me?

333
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,083
I didn't know if it would work.

334
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,443
So I didn't tell you.

335
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:59,564
Will you stick to this major?

336
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:01,644
I'll go for Economics

337
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:03,083
or pursue a double degree.

338
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:07,203
Alright.

339
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,083
Catch up on this month's classes first

340
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,083
and we'll see.

341
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:12,644
You won't understand anything

342
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,203
about advanced math this afternoon.

343
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:17,964
You have my schedule, too?

344
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:20,803
Where will you sit?

345
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:21,804
Front or back row?

346
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,043
So what?

347
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,043
Want to sit next to me?

348
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:25,724
No.

349
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,283
I just want to see

350
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:28,284
how the brainiac

351
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:29,884
fails to understand anything in class.

352
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:32,924
Alright.

353
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,363
When did them cross paths?

354
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,283
No idea.

355
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:07,043
You're bold enough

356
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:08,884
to sit in the front row.

357
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:11,004
Where did you go?

358
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:12,403
The publicity department

359
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:13,844
held a long meeting.

360
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,163
You're quite busy.

361
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:16,564
Addicted to power?

362
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:18,083
Mind your own business.

363
00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:20,764
Which one of you

364
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:22,363
would like to come up

365
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:23,804
and solve this problem?

366
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,604
I guess some students
have done their homework.

367
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:33,564
Young lady,

368
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:36,924
will you solve this problem?

369
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:38,283
Okay.

370
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:41,004
The answer is here.

371
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:42,203
Do the calculation.

372
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:43,032
Lagrange...

373
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:43,565
Thanks.

374
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,043
Let's give her some encouragement.

375
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,924
We encounter many problems

376
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,403
while answering the questions.

377
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:58,163
Solving problems
is both easy and difficult.

378
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,524
When you review

379
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:01,564
the laws

380
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:03,724
and theorems,

381
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:05,884
it's crucial to understand them

382
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,203
thoroughly.

383
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:19,243
Alright.

384
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:23,283
Actually,

385
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:24,964
this problem

386
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:28,123
can be solved with

387
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,524
Lagrange's theorem.

388
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,283
Try to solve it with the theorem

389
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:32,323
you learned today.

390
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:34,443
I'll give you some time.

391
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:36,163
Okay?

392
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,764
Okay.

393
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:44,123
You studied at home, didn't you?

394
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:46,924
You even knew Lagrange.

395
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,163
I learned it in high school.

396
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:51,563
I didn't expect him to cover

397
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,243
definite integrals in just one month.

398
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:54,644
I was just lucky

399
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:56,243
that I've learned it.

400
00:18:58,163 --> 00:18:59,884
You learned that in high school?

401
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:01,884
You're way too competitive.

402
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:03,403
I learned it

403
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:05,483
for the physics competition.

404
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,525
This theorem

405
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,323
is more useful in physics competitions.

406
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,083
Okay.

407
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:11,564
Have you finished?

408
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,043
Look at the next question in the book.

409
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:15,203
What's the answer?

410
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,004
Young man,

411
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:22,004
tell us your answer.

412
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:27,043
Maybe B.

413
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,083
A.

414
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:31,684
This young lady is correct.

415
00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:33,764
The answer

416
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:35,123
is

417
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:36,323
A.

418
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:44,764
That's impressive.

419
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:47,323
Still amazing at multitasking.

420
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:49,804
Try to understand it.

421
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:54,604
What are they saying?

422
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,123
I can't hear them.

423
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,483
You free this weekend?

424
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:03,203
Why?

425
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,604
Let me help you with math.

426
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:08,724
Ever watched The Disguiser?

427
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:11,483
"Ming Lou.

428
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:12,604
On your knees.

429
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,163
Do me a favor."

430
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:17,924
That's how you sounded.

431
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:21,844
You can help me with math.

432
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:24,163
I'm busy.

433
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:28,403
They're so close.

434
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,283
I bet there's something.

435
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,763
Come clean.

436
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,764
What's your deal with that handsome guy?

437
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:38,364
I took the empty seat

438
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:39,804
next to him because I was late.

439
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,323
Come on.

440
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,083
Did you know each other?

441
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,644
We both come from Qingyi.

442
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,084
No wonder.

443
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,764
You talked for almost half the class.

444
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:49,844
Looks like you had fun.

445
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,044
Do you think

446
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:52,724
that he's a bit into you?

447
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,203
Maybe a little.

448
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,083
If I had half your confidence,

449
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,004
I'd already have a boyfriend.

450
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:08,604
(Chen Luzhou: Zhi, help.)

451
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:09,483
What happened?

452
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,483
(Stop pretending.)

453
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,362
(It's too easy for you.)

454
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,363
(Catch up on lessons.)

455
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,403
Something's fishy.

456
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:18,884
(I'll do my best.)

457
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,564
(Guess I'll have to stay up late.)

458
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:23,443
(Perfect. Don't wait for me
for breakfast.)

459
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:24,884
(Let's eat separately.)

460
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:26,203
(Are you going to eat)

461
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:27,684
(with Jiang Yu?)

462
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,203
(Oh, come on.)

463
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,883
(Didn't you tell Zhu Yangqi)

464
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,203
(that I could date anyone?)

465
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,004
Hello.

466
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,043
What else did Zhu Yangqi tell you?

467
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:42,564
Nothing much.

468
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:43,804
Focus on your study.

469
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:45,764
Talk after the midterm exams.

470
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,043
Alright.

471
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:48,403
Once I catch up on the lessons,

472
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:49,403
let's talk properly.

473
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,403
Chen Luzhou.

474
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:54,123
You're so lame.

475
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,323
I thought the brainiac
would know everything.

476
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,764
The brainiac doesn't necessarily
know everything.

477
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,804
But once I put in a little effort,

478
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:01,804
I'll master everything.

479
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:04,363
Who was asking for my help just now?

480
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:05,884
My brother.

481
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:06,884
Chen Sanzhou.

482
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:08,884
Alright.

483
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:11,043
Let's see how much you score
in the midterm exams.

484
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:14,403
I'm also waiting to be surprised
by the dark horse from Qingyi.

485
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:17,443
Just wait and see. Bye.

486
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,604
Dark horse from Qingyi?

487
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:24,443
Then what are you?

488
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:25,844
White goose from Qingyi?

489
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:30,443
(Cai Yingying: Ready to apologize.)

490
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:32,043
(Zhi, please show up.)

491
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:45,363
Twenty-four hours have passed.

492
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,083
Am I your best girlfriend again?

493
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:48,604
Where is my best girlfriend?

494
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,243
I only see an opportunist.

495
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,563
I promise it won't happen again.

496
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:54,684
No matter what they offer,

497
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:56,163
my bestie comes first.

498
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:56,844
I swear.

499
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:57,804
If I break my promise...

500
00:22:57,804 --> 00:22:58,392
Enough.

501
00:22:58,524 --> 00:22:59,524
Next time, no mercy.

502
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:04,764
So Chen Luzhou spoke with you?

503
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:07,764
Are you going to forgive him?

504
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:10,483
Let him be for now.

505
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:12,764
Alright.

506
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:28,481
(Timetable for Huaguang University's
School of Architecture's Courses)

507
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:33,043
Xu Zhi forgave you?

508
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:36,004
Sort of.

509
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:39,083
Focus on the study in the library.

510
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:40,203
Stop talking.

511
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,083
So, what's going on

512
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:46,644
between you two right now?

513
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,203
What are your plans?

514
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:50,804
Don't you know my plans?

515
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,004
How would I know...

516
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:55,443
Is this seat taken?

517
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,363
- Well...
- No.

518
00:23:58,684 --> 00:23:59,684
Okay.

519
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,483
Isn't she the belle majoring in English?

520
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:07,764
Are you doing this

521
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:09,123
to make Xu Zhi jealous?

522
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:12,043
Do you have to be so provocative?

523
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:13,644
If you have the time,

524
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:14,884
help me solve this inequation.

525
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:18,243
You used to ignore girls like her.

526
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,083
Chen Luzhou.

527
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:26,322
Our senior from the photography club

528
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:28,203
wonders if you're interested
in joining us.

529
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:29,483
No.

530
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:30,644
Sorry.

531
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,403
There will be a basketball game.

532
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,684
I heard you brought a drone.

533
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:41,243
- May I borrow it...?
- Sorry.

534
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:44,004
Let's cut to the chase.

535
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,363
We can go

536
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:54,363
somewhere else.

537
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:10,403
Your hometown fellow.

538
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:12,804
I think she's the belle
majoring in English.

539
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:17,844
Xu Zhi.

540
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:19,604
What a coincidence.

541
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:22,443
("What a coincidence?")

542
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:23,844
(Someone's jealous.)

543
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:24,844
Thank you.

544
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:26,684
Let's go.

545
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:29,283
Do you have a girlfriend?

546
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:31,123
No.

547
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:32,925
Then can I...

548
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:34,684
But I'm trying to win my ex back.

549
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,564
Ex-girlfriend? Who?

550
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:40,644
You said you knew him.

551
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,524
Does his ex-girlfriend look

552
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:43,363
extremely pretty?

553
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:44,363
She's alright.

554
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:45,203
Not too bad.

555
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,924
Don't tell me you're jealous.

556
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:48,363
- Sorry.
- Of whom?

557
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:49,604
Chen Luzhou's ex-girlfriend.

558
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:51,724
You're right.

559
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:15,283
She saw you?

560
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:17,564
Yeah, downstairs.

561
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:19,684
Did she say anything?

562
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:22,764
"What a coincidence."

563
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,123
She got jealous.

564
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,724
Talk to her and explain it now.

565
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:28,964
Let her be

566
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:30,203
for a while.

567
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:37,884
Hold on.

568
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:39,724
Why do I feel

569
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:41,363
that she is not jealous?

570
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,083
I don't think she is jealous.

571
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:54,884
She's pretending.

572
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:56,524
Serenity before the storm.

573
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,283
Come on.

574
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,084
You have never

575
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,764
seen a girl getting jealous, huh?

576
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:02,844
Have you?

577
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:04,243
I-I...

578
00:27:04,684 --> 00:27:05,724
I haven't dated anyone,

579
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:06,964
but I'm sure that

580
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:09,363
a girl would complain if she is jealous.

581
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,283
What are you trying to say?

582
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,083
Bro, here's my advice.

583
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:17,564
If she's jealous,

584
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,443
it might be a good thing.

585
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,363
At least, she cares about you.

586
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,043
But if she's not jealous,

587
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:24,804
then it's a big problem.

588
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,844
It means she has already

589
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,004
moved on.

590
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,524
Get lost.

591
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:49,443
Look, is it this one?

592
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:51,764
It's different.

593
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:54,043
This style. This one.

594
00:27:54,163 --> 00:27:55,163
It's this one.

595
00:27:57,724 --> 00:27:59,123
Let your arms drop naturally.

596
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:02,363
Chen Luzhou?

597
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:07,004
What's wrong? What do you want?

598
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:10,043
Nothing. I'm just curious

599
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:13,323
if Xu Zhi has mentioned me these days.

600
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:15,724
No, she hasn't. Why?

601
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:18,243
She

602
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:20,203
is probably still mad at me, right?

603
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:23,123
I don't know if she's mad at you.

604
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,844
But don't call me in private again.

605
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,524
Otherwise, she'll be mad at me.

606
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:27,684
Bye-bye.

607
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,483
(Bro, here's my advice.)

608
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:09,804
(If she's jealous,)

609
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,403
it might be a good thing.

610
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,043
At least, she cares about you.

611
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:14,804
But if she's not jealous,

612
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:18,283
it means she's already moved on.

613
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:26,328
(Call from Her Majesty)

614
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:33,924
Hello, Luzhou.

615
00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:36,964
You've been busy, huh?

616
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:41,363
I know you didn't take that card.

617
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:45,043
I'll transfer the money to your WeChat

618
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:46,323
every month.

619
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:47,684
Stop sending me money.

620
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,884
I'll try to get a scholarship.

621
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:52,443
The scholarship is 15,000 yuan tops.

622
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:55,804
What will be left
after paying the tuition?

623
00:29:57,604 --> 00:29:59,243
I've also done some part-time jobs.

624
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:01,443
I can save money.

625
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:03,123
I know.

626
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:06,524
But as long as you keep going to school,

627
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:10,564
I have the right and duty
to support you.

628
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,323
I'll transfer the money
to you every month.

629
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:15,323
You can decide

630
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:16,764
whether you spend it.

631
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,083
Okay?

632
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,203
I missed you a lot.

633
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:26,043
Take care of yourself out there.

634
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:32,323
Bye.

635
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:42,712
(10,000 yuan from Mom)

636
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,323
Luzhou.

637
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:05,804
You're back?

638
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:08,163
You can check the school forum

639
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,283
for part-time jobs.

640
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:12,644
You misunderstood.

641
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,844
I just hate to spend my parents' money.

642
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:18,644
I knew it.

643
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,163
Judging from your drone,

644
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,924
your family should be doing fine.

645
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:24,483
But are you

646
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,243
really going for a scholarship?

647
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:29,483
So ambitious.

648
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,483
But it's not so easy

649
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,924
to get a scholarship.

650
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:35,564
You need a GPA of above 4.0

651
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:37,163
for every subject.

652
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:39,644
Funding opportunities may vary.

653
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:42,844
Could it be harder
than winning my ex back?

654
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:44,804
Wait.

655
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:47,123
You asked me for that timetable

656
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:48,564
to win your ex back?

657
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:53,203
A girl from Qingyi?

658
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:54,564
School of Architecture.

659
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,844
Don't tell me it's Xu Zhi.

660
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:05,764
What's wrong?

661
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:07,322
Did Zhao Tianqi tell you

662
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:08,524
to do something again?

663
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:10,764
No.

664
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,283
I've made it clear to him.

665
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,203
He won't meddle
with my business anymore.

666
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,243
Then why are you looking so downcast?

667
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:25,363
Look.

668
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:26,884
Oh, my God.

669
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:32,644
"Lacking a basic sense of space."

670
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:34,443
It's heartbreaking.

671
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,564
Do you think I'll fail the course?

672
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:38,483
Not really.

673
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:39,684
It's only the first task.

674
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:42,964
But our senior said that many people

675
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:45,123
fail the architecture design course

676
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,123
every year.

677
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,564
What should I do?

678
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:48,644
Ask Xu Zhi.

679
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:50,724
Her engineering design plans

680
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,243
scored the highest in our class.

681
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:54,843
Ms. Xu, please take a look
at my work next time.

682
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:56,443
Take a look at mine, too.

683
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:57,443
No problem.

684
00:32:57,924 --> 00:32:58,924
Here.

685
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:02,123
Ms. Xu, please bless me

686
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:03,644
to pass the course.

687
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:05,483
If I were that awesome,

688
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,804
I could get rich

689
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:08,924
just by selling charms.

690
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,763
I remember our teacher saying

691
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:13,004
that we can photograph

692
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:14,603
the exterior of buildings with drones

693
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:15,844
to help us understand.

694
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:19,363
I remember that Chen Luzhou had a drone.

695
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:22,243
Can you borrow it for us, please?

696
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,483
Please, Ms. Xu.

697
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,443
Please.

698
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:27,364
Xu Zhi.

699
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:28,684
Alright, I'll give it a try.

700
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:30,924
We're saved.

701
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,523
(Stylish Zhu: How's it going with Zhi?)

702
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,123
(I've grown tired of eating salad.)

703
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:46,484
(When can we gather)

704
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,283
(for a nice meal as the Qingyi squad?)

705
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:53,083
(Got it.)

706
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:54,363
(Good luck, buddy.)

707
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:56,724
(A long and arduous journey lies ahead.)

708
00:33:58,724 --> 00:33:59,724
Chen Luzhou is there.

709
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:02,043
Come on.

710
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:11,243
Can I ask you for a favor?

711
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:13,443
Go ahead.

712
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,363
Can I borrow your drone?

713
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,004
Sure.

714
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:18,884
When?

715
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:20,283
I can teach you.

716
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:21,884
Really? That would be great.

717
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,844
No need.

718
00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:23,885
Give me the manual.

719
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,203
I'll figure it out myself.

720
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:28,844
That's impressive.

721
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,203
So independent.

722
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,203
Aren't you curious why I'm borrowing it?

723
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,483
As long as you don't

724
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:35,483
film naked guys.

725
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,243
Zhi, you're not mad at me anymore?

726
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:46,524
Dig in. Stop talking.

727
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,884
Don't you have anything else to say?

728
00:34:52,564 --> 00:34:53,604
Then,

729
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:55,924
thank you for your drone.

730
00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:59,004
Thank you for the drumstick.

731
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:00,203
My pleasure.

732
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:01,604
My pleasure, too.

733
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:04,924
(What the heck? What's going on?)

734
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:06,243
(So much flirting.)

735
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,724
She likes to gnaw on chopsticks.

736
00:35:15,844 --> 00:35:16,724
Not at all.

737
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:17,564
I just really like

738
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,043
digging into gossip.

739
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:20,604
And I have a keen eye

740
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:21,924
for big scoops.

741
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:24,123
What's there to gossip about us?

742
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:24,844
I guess

743
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:26,644
you didn't lie to us at all.

744
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,724
This handsome guy is a bit into you.

745
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:30,684
Really?

746
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:34,163
What do you mean by "a bit"?

747
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:36,323
No idea.

748
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,282
You seem to enjoy the meal.

749
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:43,083
I'm full.

750
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:44,043
Take your time.

751
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:45,043
I'm off.

752
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,524
What did you say about me?

753
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:57,283
She said I was jealous of your ex

754
00:35:57,684 --> 00:36:00,403
and claimed the grapes to be sour
because I couldn't have them.

755
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:04,243
If you're so jealous
of my ex-girlfriend,

756
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:05,524
you can admit it.

757
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:07,564
Also, the grapes are sweet.

758
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:08,964
I suggest you try them.

759
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:14,443
You left and came back as you pleased.

760
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:16,884
Not everyone is lined up,
waiting for your call.

761
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:19,203
Also, I'm quite jealous of your ex.

762
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,403
You weren't this obnoxious back then.

763
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:25,123
I'll run everything by my girlfriend.

764
00:36:25,844 --> 00:36:28,043
A decent ex should
maintain proper boundaries.

765
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:29,804
So that you can

766
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,123
start dating someone?

767
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:34,483
So that you can start dating someone.

768
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:35,883
Now everyone knows

769
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:36,964
that I'm trying to win

770
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:37,964
my ex back at Huaguang.

771
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,283
Who's going to date me?

772
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:40,564
Who knows?

773
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:41,483
Chen Luzhou.

774
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:42,884
Can I add you on WeChat?

775
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:49,043
You might have to ask my ex first.

776
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,243
Sorry about that.

777
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:00,884
So awkward. How come...

778
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:02,163
But they were so sweet.

779
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:04,964
- Xu Zhi.
- Xu Zhi.

780
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:05,964
What's wrong?

781
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:08,964
Come on, sit.

782
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,043
Oh my, Xu Zhi.

783
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:12,683
I never realized it.

784
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:15,644
So you were Chen Luzhou's ex-girlfriend?

785
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:19,443
Oh my, you hid it so well.

786
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:21,483
So,

787
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:22,924
are you back together?

788
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,163
It's all in the past. We've moved on.

789
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:26,684
No way.

790
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:28,523
You were flirting with each other

791
00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:30,004
at the canteen.

792
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:32,004
He couldn't keep his eyes off you.

793
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,403
You obviously have feelings

794
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:35,524
for each other.

795
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:37,564
I almost forgot.

796
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,924
It will be my birthday tomorrow.

797
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:43,804
I was going to celebrate
with my boyfriend

798
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:46,083
and his roommate Chen Luzhou.

799
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:49,724
But if you mind it,

800
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:50,764
I won't invite him.

801
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:51,844
Wait.

802
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:55,283
Chen Luzhou
is your boyfriend's roommate?

803
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:59,203
And he is also
my roommate's ex-boyfriend.

804
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,604
Such a coincidence?

805
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:02,162
How can we not invite him?

806
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:03,323
We must invite him.

807
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,363
Right, Xu Zhi?

808
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:07,363
Didn't you say you'd moved on?

809
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:09,123
So, you definitely wouldn't mind it.

810
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:10,924
Go ahead.

811
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:12,363
I don't mind.

812
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:13,524
Let's see if he comes.

813
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:14,684
She agreed.

814
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:15,524
I'll invite him.

815
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:16,163
Come on.

816
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:17,524
Come on.

817
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:28,524
Sorry, I'm late.

818
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,323
Meet my boyfriend, Tianqi.

819
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:30,844
Hello.

820
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:31,644
Hello.

821
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,524
Thanks for joining Yisi's birthday.

822
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,964
- Birthday cake!
- Birthday cake.

823
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:36,004
Thank you.

824
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:37,004
Happy birthday.

825
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:37,724
Thank you.

826
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,004
This is...

827
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:39,965
Hello.

828
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:41,403
This is Chen Luzhou from Qingyi.

829
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,564
Save it. We got it.

830
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:48,964
Thanks.

831
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:51,243
It's a cream cake.

832
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:51,844
Creamy?

833
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:52,844
Thank you.

834
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:55,203
He's quite handsome.

835
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:58,363
Did I embarrass you?

836
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:00,724
No, you look great today.

837
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:05,363
How about we order first?

838
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:06,764
Alright.

839
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:09,845
I bet Jiang Yu

840
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:12,323
is crying his heart out in the bathroom.

841
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:14,283
I'm quite straightforward.

842
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:15,884
I'll just say it.

843
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,083
Chen Luzhou.

844
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,563
When are you going to

845
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,924
make yourself her current boyfriend?

846
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,684
He became my ex-boyfriend

847
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:24,243
for a reason, of course.

848
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:26,363
Life is so long.

849
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:28,363
Why fall into the same pit twice?

850
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:31,929
(Two days ago)

851
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:42,283
- Nice shot.
- Nice shot.

852
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:43,123
Nice shot.

853
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:44,724
The match is over.

854
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:46,242
Public Administration won.

855
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:46,965
Next up.

856
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:48,363
Public Affairs vs. Philosophy.

857
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:49,764
Senior, you finally came.

858
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,004
We're counting on you.

859
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,283
How was it?

860
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:23,192
Nice shot.

861
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:32,403
Tianqi.

862
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:33,304
Practice more.

863
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:33,924
Let's go.

864
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:34,724
We go to practice.

865
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:35,724
See you.

866
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:38,844
Take a break.

867
00:42:00,363 --> 00:42:01,443
You are

868
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:03,524
Xu Zhi's ex-boyfriend,

869
00:42:03,884 --> 00:42:05,004
Chen Luzhou, right?

870
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:08,564
You are Xu Zhi's superior,
Jiang Yu, right?

871
00:42:09,644 --> 00:42:10,644
You play well.

872
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:12,203
You too.

873
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:14,884
By the way,

874
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,604
I want to offer you

875
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:18,123
a piece of advice.

876
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:20,604
Go ahead.

877
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,724
The publicity department
holds too many meetings.

878
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:25,843
If there aren't urgent matters

879
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:26,524
to discuss,

880
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,924
please try to end

881
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:29,403
the meetings on time

882
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:31,323
and let Zhi attend her classes.

883
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:34,203
Got it. I'll pay attention to it.

884
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:36,123
Speaking of which,

885
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:38,083
here's my advice.

886
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:43,804
Cherish what you have.

887
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:47,363
If you don't know how to do that,

888
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,323
then just remain her ex-boyfriend.

889
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:51,283
Don't hurt her again.

890
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:56,004
Did she tell you I hurt her?

891
00:42:57,764 --> 00:42:59,043
She never mentioned you.

892
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,403
Then why did you say that I hurt her?

893
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:05,924
Do you know

894
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:08,604
why she accepted me
as a friend on WeChat?

895
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:12,684
My profile picture was also

896
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:14,004
Neuschwanstein Castle.

897
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:15,644
She thought it was

898
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:16,644
your spare account.

899
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,004
The earrings were from you, right?

900
00:43:26,283 --> 00:43:27,684
She lost them on the night

901
00:43:27,764 --> 00:43:28,764
of the freshman gathering

902
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:30,283
and looked everywhere.

903
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:31,884
I found them for her.

904
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:33,363
She was very grateful.

905
00:43:33,764 --> 00:43:35,004
She said those earrings

906
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:36,604
meant a lot to her.

907
00:43:41,004 --> 00:43:42,004
It's time to play.

908
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:45,483
Don't let your guard down.

909
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:46,804
Don't give me a chance.

910
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:51,243
(Ke.)

911
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:53,524
(You're very wrong.)

912
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:56,403
(Who told you she's moved on?)

913
00:43:56,964 --> 00:43:57,964
Come on.

914
00:43:57,964 --> 00:43:59,203
