(Exchanging Names Made Us Friends)

18
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,167
(Hello, Mr. Qu.)

19
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:51,568
(Xu Zhi.)

20
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,887
(With your estimated score,)

21
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,447
(it's a pity to go
to the local Qingyi University.)

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,736
(But it is a real pity for Tan Xu.)

23
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,608
(Yifeng Alley)
(He may repeat a year,)

24
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,048
(as he can't get
into a first-tier university.)

25
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:06,807
(Try to cheer him up
if you get a chance.)

26
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:08,407
(Okay.)

27
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:09,928
Tan Xu.

28
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:13,288
Tan Xu.

29
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:27,608
Hello, the number you have dialed...

30
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,048
Tan Xu, let's meet
and talk in person tomorrow.

31
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,367
I told you. She's not my girlfriend.

32
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:48,728
Stop lying.

33
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,728
Chen Luzhou, can you stop
making me worried?

34
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,607
(Stop lying.)

35
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:01,048
(Xu Zhi, can you stop
making me worried?)

36
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:04,407
(Why does she sound
so much like my mom?)

37
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:08,008
If I hadn't come today,

38
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,967
what would you have done?

39
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,167
I don't forbid you from dating.

40
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:13,968
But don't

41
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,447
leave me a huge mess

42
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:16,768
to clean up.

43
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:18,208
Isn't that perfect?

44
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:19,807
You won't have to try

45
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:20,608
to send me abroad.

46
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,768
Do you have to be so mean?

47
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,167
You weren't like this

48
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,488
when you first came.

49
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:27,928
Anyway,

50
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,368
you have to sort everything out

51
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,448
before going abroad.

52
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,687
You're giving me a stomachache.

53
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,768
(Qingyi No.1 High School)

54
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,208
(No. 1 High School?)

55
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,448
Add me on WeChat.

56
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:57,287
Text me when you want to hear me

57
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,328
get scolded again.

58
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,208
I will put a chair out there.

59
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:02,608
Isn't it tiring

60
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:03,928
to stand here?

61
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:07,448
I'm

62
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:09,567
sorry.

63
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,608
Who were you whispering to?

64
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,088
Why draw the curtains

65
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,488
in the middle of the day?

66
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,007
Hurry up and get changed.

67
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:34,408
Professor Jiang wrote you
a recommendation letter.

68
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:36,367
We need to thank him.

69
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,127
I played games all night

70
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,088
with Chen Xingqi.

71
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,207
Even a full-time nanny gets a break.

72
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:44,488
Why don't you send me

73
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,367
to the national team

74
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:47,928
for Ultra-Extreme Triathlon?

75
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:48,807
Chen Luzhou.

76
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,888
Could you please be serious?

77
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:51,968
How am I not serious?

78
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,968
I have a lot more to say.

79
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,648
But have I ever gone against you?

80
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,488
Repeat a year. Go abroad.

81
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:04,408
I'll do whatever you say.

82
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:07,848
Zhu Yangqi would

83
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,367
call me "Mama's boy".

84
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,207
I promise I'll let you know

85
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,168
when I have a girlfriend.

86
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:15,127
Okay?

87
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:16,488
I'm going to sleep.

88
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:17,567
Sleep?

89
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,048
Your home isn't here.

90
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,327
College Entrance Examination is over.
Move back home.

91
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:24,928
Move back home?

92
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:25,728
Forget it.

93
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,687
I'm going abroad soon.

94
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:28,807
Why bother

95
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:30,007
moving back and forth?

96
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,424
(Troublemaker)

97
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:44,687
What's wrong?

98
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:48,727
Wait for me.

99
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,687
I'll be right there.

100
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,168
Understand?

101
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,288
Troublemaker.

102
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,048
Chen Xingqi.

103
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,728
You caused your mom trouble again?

104
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,127
(Monkey King,
I lured the tigress away, okay?)

105
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,968
(How are you going to thank me?)

106
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:45,088
You called your mom a tigress?

107
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,288
(Chen Luzhou.)

108
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,567
(Isn't my mom also your mom?)

109
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:01,088
(Luzhou, so this is your type, huh?)

110
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,327
(Stylish Zhu, Lucy, is Gu Yan there?)

111
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:15,928
Zhu Yangqi.

112
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,367
(Billiard room)
It's not my fault.

113
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,648
Gu Yan forced me to tell her
where you live.

114
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,807
She said she forged a love diary

115
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,367
with you to gain fame on a whim

116
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,968
and got caught by netizens.

117
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:27,528
If it is confirmed,

118
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,007
she can't be an actress
even if she gets into

119
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,488
the Film Academy.

120
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,767
I panicked when I heard it.

121
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,488
So you just gave her

122
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,168
my address right away.

123
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:43,928
Zhu Yangqi.

124
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,408
Do you realize

125
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,408
this could make me

126
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,207
single forever?

127
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:48,728
Is it that serious?

128
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:54,608
Chen Luzhou.

129
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,648
I really like you.

130
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,247
Can you go along with it
and be my boyfriend?

131
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:02,367
No.

132
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:03,807
Why not?

133
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,807
Is there someone you like?

134
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,288
I just don't

135
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,207
have feelings for you.

136
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:10,728
And then?

137
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,007
Then my mom came.

138
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,447
So thrilling.

139
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:16,048
Your mom caught you on the spot.

140
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,767
Zhu Yangqi.

141
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:21,687
You disappointed me a lot.

142
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:24,367
Don't tell anyone my address again.

143
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:26,207
Got it.

144
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,608
I swear solemnly.

145
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,127
It won't happen again.

146
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,207
But many people
think you're a hopeless romantic

147
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:39,567
who didn't take the Optional Modules
because of Gu Yan.

148
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:41,408
Why should I care

149
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:43,648
about what they say?

150
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:45,967
I'm off.

151
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:47,768
Done with it?

152
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:48,967
It's boring. I'm out.

153
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,048
Wait.

154
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:53,967
I'll treat you to barbecue later.

155
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:54,687
Barbecue?

156
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:56,408
No, thanks.

157
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,528
See you around. It's done.

158
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,447
Grandma, Dad, I'm back.

159
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,168
Zhi.

160
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:08,448
Where have you been all day?

161
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,328
I estimated the scores in Ruijun.

162
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,727
What? Sun Wukong passed out?

163
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,168
Yeah, Zhu Bajie captured the Tang Monk.

164
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,687
"Estimate the scores."

165
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:21,687
Even I hear better than you.

166
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,487
How was it?

167
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,487
Everything went as planned.

168
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:27,567
Yes!

169
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,207
Why can't I claim this?

170
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,727
How much did Yingying score?

171
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,168
You sound quite concerned.

172
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:37,767
Your Uncle Cai has high blood pressure.

173
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,568
He might be shocked by her score.

174
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:40,247
Right?

175
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:42,648
Then you should
show more concern for Mr. Cai.

176
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,567
Really.

177
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:45,368
It's over.

178
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:47,487
It's over.

179
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,847
Dad, I like that you have time

180
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:51,887
to cook at home.

181
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:52,847
I can come home

182
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,087
from the college for food.

183
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:57,408
What do you mean?

184
00:09:58,607 --> 00:09:59,808
You haven't applied

185
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:00,847
to universities yet.

186
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,967
Are you going to Qingyi University?

187
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:04,768
Isn't that pretty good?

188
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:05,928
It's close by.

189
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,207
What's good about that?

190
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,367
Mom, didn't we agree
to visit the Great Wall?

191
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:11,800
Grandma, dinner's ready.

192
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:13,727
- Come on.
- Forget it.

193
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,567
I'm going back to work after dinner.

194
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,928
Give Grandma a bath tonight.

195
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:18,847
I'm not doing it.

196
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,967
No matter what you say.

197
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,087
I just won't do it.

198
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,327
Sit down.

199
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:25,768
If you don't do it,

200
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,888
I won't top up
your in-game "happy beans"

201
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,248
once you run out.

202
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,247
Let's do it after dinner.

203
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,048
Okay.

204
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:38,687
Grandma, dig in.

205
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,248
Let me have some meat.

206
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:43,128
It's a bit sweet.

207
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,128
Go easy on the sweet and sour pork.

208
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
You can have more.

209
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,048
I made it really well.

210
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,816
(Mom)

211
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:08,664
(Chat history: Happy birthday, Mom.)

212
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,848
(Yingying)

213
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:18,327
(Help me dye my hair exactly like this.)

214
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,967
(Nostalgic about the Shamate culture?)

215
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,607
(Ten things to do after graduation)
Hello. Welcome to Yingying's vlog.

216
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,727
Today, let's talk about

217
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:34,327
the ten things
you must do after graduation.

218
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,248
Take a look.

219
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,847
Dye your hair. Get ear piercings.

220
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,727
Go on a spontaneous trip.

221
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,048
Did you film it?

222
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:42,207
Okay.

223
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:44,807
Today, I'm going to dye my hair.

224
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:48,008
Still lying? Xu Zhi.

225
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,687
Can you stop making me worried?

226
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:52,368
Time's up.

227
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,128
Zhi, hurry up. Film me.

228
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:58,727
Ready?

229
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:00,487
Alright, guys.

230
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:02,447
Now let's see my new hair color.

231
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:04,687
I'm so nervous.

232
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:07,888
How do I look?

233
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:12,008
I hereby declare

234
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:14,727
that dyeing my hair
is checked off my list.

235
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,048
Challenge accomplished!

236
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:18,128
Give it a go if you're interested.

237
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:20,248
How is it?

238
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,727
Let me see.

239
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,248
It's quite nice.

240
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,528
What's wrong? Are you upset?

241
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:38,288
No, I was thinking about something.

242
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,087
- A quick question.
- What?

243
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,727
Do you think two people can sound

244
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:43,928
exactly the same?

245
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,168
What do you mean?

246
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:47,768
I met an auntie yesterday.

247
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,567
Her voice, tone, and catchphrases were

248
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,687
exactly like my mom's.

249
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:54,487
Where did you meet her?

250
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,327
Under the apartment Tan Xu rented.

251
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,528
You went to see Tan Xu?

252
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:00,487
I went to talk to him

253
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:01,727
and get my necklace back.

254
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,288
You gave him the necklace?

255
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,368
No, I lent it to him.

256
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,928
He said that the four-leaf clover

257
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,008
represents luck and borrowed it

258
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,288
for good luck during
College Entrance Examination.

259
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:14,168
That's just wishful thinking.

260
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,528
In the end, he failed.

261
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,168
Did he return it to you?

262
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,847
He wasn't there
and didn't answer the phone.

263
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,288
Why is he so full of himself?

264
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:25,288
He didn't do well,

265
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:26,648
so he's just being petty?

266
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:29,087
He got mad
because you did great last time.

267
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:30,487
He's totally gaslighting you.

268
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,168
But he's repeating the year.

269
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,847
I want to talk to him in a bit.

270
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:37,768
You're going there again?

271
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,648
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

272
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,567
I'll get the necklace and leave.

273
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,128
I'll come along.

274
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:44,768
Alright.

275
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:53,288
Second floor?

276
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,408
Here.

277
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:13,928
Here to mock me?

278
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,447
Do you have to be so mean?

279
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:19,727
Go ahead.

280
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,327
What's there to say?

281
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:22,888
Come in.

282
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:24,607
Can you stop being

283
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,607
so negative before the results are out?

284
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,048
It's because I solved
the last two math questions

285
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:30,567
and you didn't?

286
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,288
If that makes you so upset,

287
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:33,808
I admit it's my fault.

288
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,288
She's bad at comforting people,

289
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,648
just like you.

290
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,768
Many people from the No. 1 High School
didn't do well.

291
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,768
The prospective top scorer
even missed out on one subject.

292
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:45,928
The prospective top scorer.

293
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,447
She's talking about you.

294
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,288
But she doesn't know

295
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,248
that you missed out
on the Optional Modules.

296
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,087
She's comforting her useless boyfriend
with your story.

297
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,168
Why don't you tell them?

298
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:58,207
Why should I?

299
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:00,207
I may have missed out on one subject,

300
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:01,408
but I won't

301
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,008
fall into despair.

302
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,136
Nor do I need comfort of a girlfriend.

303
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,687
Her boyfriend is too lame.

304
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,128
Let's go.

305
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:12,928
So what?

306
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,248
Get to the point.

307
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,408
There is no real despair,

308
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,447
only prisoners of their thoughts.

309
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:19,807
This is what you told me.

310
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:24,048
I really appreciate you tutoring me

311
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:25,368
and helping me through.

312
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:27,128
If you need me,

313
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,487
I'd love to help you.

314
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:29,327
No, thanks.

315
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:30,607
I don't need your pity.

316
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:31,487
Tan Xu.

317
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:32,367
I...

318
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,567
Stop being a hypocrite.

319
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,647
Didn't you come

320
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,408
to sever your tie with me?

321
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:40,768
You're going to college.

322
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,776
I'm repeating the year.

323
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,008
We'll head into two different worlds.

324
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:47,288
Thanks for the reminder.

325
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:48,567
I know it very well.

326
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,088
That's what you think?

327
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:52,168
Of course.

328
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:53,967
Anyway, the exams are over.

329
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:55,528
I have

330
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,127
no more value to you.

331
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,288
Do you have to be

332
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:00,087
so sarcastic and cynical?

333
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:02,367
In that case,

334
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:03,888
I want my necklace back.

335
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:06,448
Let's not meet

336
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:07,408
unless it's necessary.

337
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,207
Are you crazy?

338
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:26,528
Let's go.

339
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,767
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

340
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,048
It's not here.

341
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,168
Zhi.

342
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,648
Could it be in this tree?

343
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,447
It's very likely.

344
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,567
How are we going to find it?

345
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:58,968
Don't you think

346
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,647
that girl's sarcastic way of speaking

347
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:03,087
is quite similar to yours?

348
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:03,727
So what?

349
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,368
So,

350
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:07,368
will you try to date her?

351
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,328
Why should I?

352
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,287
You'll have nothing to do
for two months before you go abroad.

353
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:14,408
Still, not interested.

354
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:16,447
Did you get PTSD

355
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,808
because of Gu Yan?

356
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,047
Not really.

357
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:20,928
My mom is strict with me.

358
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:22,287
I promised

359
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:24,527
to tell her before getting a girlfriend.

360
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:25,728
Besides, we'll have to

361
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:27,008
video chat every day

362
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,487
once I go abroad.

363
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:31,287
But then...

364
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,888
Long-distance relationships could work.

365
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,288
But I'm broke.

366
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:38,088
If my mom unlocks my card,

367
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:39,767
then I might consider it.

368
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:41,967
Otherwise, I can't even fly back

369
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:43,647
when my girlfriend misses me.

370
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:44,767
Isn't that awkward?

371
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:48,168
I just mentioned it for fun.

372
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,088
But you took it quite far.

373
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,687
And you sound well-planned.

374
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,368
Are you really thinking about it?

375
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,167
She used me as a negative example.

376
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:57,648
Can't I just think about it?

377
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:03,408
Who is it?

378
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,408
Coming.

379
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:13,287
Can you...

380
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:15,247
Lucy.

381
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,727
Lucy, hurry up!

382
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:18,888
What?

383
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:20,888
The pretty girl is here.

384
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,527
What's wrong?

385
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,128
Can you do me a favor?

386
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:30,768
My necklace might be

387
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,648
hanging in that tree over there.

388
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:33,648
I can't help you.

389
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,487
Hurry, go.

390
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,128
Go ahead. I'll come later.

391
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:45,168
Don't be embarrassed.

392
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:47,168
You blocked me out like this yesterday.

393
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:11,687
You got yourself a handsome helper.

394
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:17,568
How about

395
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:19,527
I buy you a new one?

396
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:21,487
That's inappropriate.

397
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,168
I'd like to see how you got it up there.

398
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,608
Sorry for the trouble.
That necklace is quite valuable.

399
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:31,808
Really?

400
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,048
Then you'd better make a wish.

401
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:35,207
Or it'll be wasted.

402
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,088
I think I saw a drone
at your place yesterday.

403
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:39,568
Can you fly it up there?

404
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:42,607
I also have a plane.

405
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:43,687
Are you interested?

406
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,447
I got this.

407
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,487
Is she impersonating a parrot?

408
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:54,407
He says I'm a parrot.

409
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:55,447
What are you doing?

410
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,568
What do you think?

411
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,936
- Looking for her necklace.
- He says I'm like a parrot.

412
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,047
Why did you get my tripod?

413
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,407
It's an emergency.

414
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:02,928
Come on, make way.

415
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,207
Don't get hurt.

416
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,247
A big gold chain.

417
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:22,928
Valuable indeed.

418
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:24,247
This isn't mine.

419
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:29,888
Let me do it.

420
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:34,088
Where is it?

421
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,808
Just hold it like this.

422
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:36,967
Where is it?

423
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:37,687
Do this.

424
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:38,447
Where is it?

425
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,007
Yingying, over there.

426
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:44,767
Where?

427
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:45,328
There.

428
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:45,927
Where?

429
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:46,727
There, I see it.

430
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:48,007
- Come on.
- Come on.

431
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:49,288
Help me.

432
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,168
Lower it a bit, yeah.

433
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:12,767
That's it.

434
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:13,568
Is it broken?

435
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:15,928
No.

436
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,447
Thank you.

437
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:19,287
Can I buy you dinner?

438
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,687
- Sure.
- No need.

439
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:26,447
So unfriendly.

440
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,088
Are you afraid we're trying
to make a move on you two?

441
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:30,287
Both of us

442
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:32,608
have boyfriends.

443
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,048
Handsome guys like him
hate being pestered.

444
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,568
We have to do the opposite.

445
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:42,527
We'll pass since you have boyfriends.

446
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:43,287
Bye.

447
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:45,487
Come on.

448
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,168
Well...

449
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,727
My mom left me this necklace.

450
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,527
It's very important to me.

451
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,368
You helped me get it.

452
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,247
I want to buy you food

453
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:02,487
to not owe you a favor.

454
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,687
Lead the way, then.

455
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:08,928
Okay.

456
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:10,648
What are we having?

457
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:12,967
Barbecue.

458
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,687
Are you really
stealing someone's girlfriend?

459
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:26,727
It was his mom
who sounded like your mom?

460
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:28,487
Yeah, that's right.

461
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,247
So, you plan to

462
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:32,608
get close to him first

463
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,088
and approach his mom?

464
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,408
That's exciting.

465
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:40,608
There is a new place over there.

466
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,328
Really?

467
00:22:43,168 --> 00:22:45,007
Are you watching "The Bicycle Thief"?

468
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:46,767
I also like this director.

469
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:51,608
One of his movies is being re-released.

470
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,088
Want to watch it? It's on me.

471
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:54,568
(Flirting with me?)

472
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:55,808
One meal is enough.

473
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,648
(I can't just tell you)

474
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,608
(I want to meet your mom.)

475
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,656
It's okay if you're not interested.

476
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:04,928
Does your boyfriend

477
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,247
know we're having dinner?

478
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,527
Am I not allowed
to have dinner with a guy?

479
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:11,047
Good question.

480
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,584
(Hu's Barbecue)

481
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:24,648
Tasty, right?

482
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,328
It's so good.

483
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:27,247
Thanks.

484
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:28,168
Dig in.

485
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:30,767
Thanks.

486
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:36,328
What's your birthday?

487
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:41,928
Don't you know about pickup lines?

488
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,527
Ask for the name first.

489
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:47,168
Xu Zhi.

490
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:50,888
Chen Luzhou.

491
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:54,088
You know a lot about pickup lines?

492
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,447
No, don't get our Lucy wrong.

493
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:03,808
He's always the one being approached.

494
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,447
Why is a guy like him called Lucy?

495
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:11,207
That's because he is too good-looking.

496
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:12,647
His English tutor mistook him

497
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,168
for a girl when he was young.

498
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:14,928
That's enough.

499
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,647
You don't look like a girl now.

500
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,168
You look very handsome.

501
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:19,888
Right, Zhi?

502
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:21,007
Yeah.

503
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:25,888
I'm still curious about
how your necklace

504
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:27,648
ended up in the tree.

505
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:30,487
Well...

506
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:35,047
She did better than her boyfriend
in College Entrance Examination.

507
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,848
He resorted to cold violence

508
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,088
because he felt inferior.

509
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:40,767
This wasn't the first time.

510
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,088
Zhi went to ask him

511
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,168
for her necklace back.

512
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:44,328
But he lost it

513
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:45,207
and threw it

514
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:46,128
downstairs.

515
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:52,088
People say that one shouldn't look for

516
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,808
a boyfriend in the trash can.

517
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,007
But look at you.

518
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,568
You went directly
to the recycling station.

519
00:24:58,128 --> 00:24:59,967
Trying to keep the trash to yourself?

520
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:01,248
You're failing

521
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:02,767
to meet the KPI because of that?

522
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,168
It's just my advice.

523
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:06,608
Handsome guys are everywhere.

524
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,128
We have many in the No.1 High School.

525
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:11,648
Don't miss the forest for one dead tree.

526
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:13,727
You are from the No.1 High School?

527
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:14,808
Yeah.

528
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,928
Can't you tell?

529
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:18,808
Do you know Zhai Xiao?

530
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:20,408
Yeah, we play basketball.

531
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:24,767
What a coincidence.

532
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,408
You know him, too?

533
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,008
Then I have a lot to tell you.

534
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:32,928
Go ahead.

535
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:34,808
He'll be here soon.

536
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,047
Let's eat first.

537
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,808
(Skewer)
Let me do it.

538
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,207
Weren't you supposed to treat us?

539
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,088
Did you expect me to pay?

540
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:48,808
Of course, I'm paying.

541
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:51,328
Table eight, please.

542
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:55,608
Thanks.

543
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:01,407
Sorry.

544
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:02,607
It's getting stuck.

545
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,967
Just a second.

546
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:12,288
Happy now?

547
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:13,167
Queue up.

548
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:14,047
No.

549
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,408
Fine, let's have another round.

550
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:19,287
Take my seat if you win, okay?

551
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:20,568
No.

552
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,568
I just lost five rounds to you.

553
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:24,687
You cheated.

554
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:27,527
You can't just call me a cheater

555
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:28,527
because you lost.

556
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:30,648
Then how did you win me every time?

557
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:32,856
Maybe you're dumb.

558
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,687
Aren't you afraid of Ultraman?

559
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:39,167
Yes, I am terrified.

560
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,568
Do you believe

561
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:42,808
that I'll ask Ultraman
to teach you a lesson?

562
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:44,088
Mebius.

563
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:45,888
The mascot of the Ultraman world.

564
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:47,047
Mascot.

565
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:50,088
Aren't mascots usually the weakest ones?

566
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:53,967
Big brother.

567
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,288
How old are you?

568
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:57,247
Why did you take the seat from a kid?

569
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:58,887
It's tiring to stay standing.

570
00:26:58,967 --> 00:26:59,728
If you don't mind,

571
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:01,168
I can call you brother.

572
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:05,687
Enough, brother.

573
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:07,767
Your snot is sticking to my clothes.

574
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,928
Son.

575
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:11,888
What's going on?

576
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:13,527
Son, what's wrong?

577
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,247
Dad, he took my seat.

578
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:17,967
What's going on here?

579
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,487
Don't you feel ashamed to take

580
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:21,447
a child's seat?

581
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:22,648
I was here first.

582
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:23,247
You...

583
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:24,247
He's lying.

584
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:26,287
I was here first.

585
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:27,408
He also hit me.

586
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:28,047
He did?

587
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,047
It hurts so much.

588
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,887
Where did he hit you?

589
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:31,248
He...

590
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:32,767
Tell me. Where did he hit you?

591
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:34,207
H-He kicked me.

592
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,047
He did?

593
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:36,487
He kicked you?

594
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:38,247
Alright, young man.

595
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,487
You hit my son, huh?

596
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:40,967
Let's get things straight.

597
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:41,967
What do you want?

598
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:43,368
Young man.

599
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,007
Kid.

600
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,088
Where did he hit you?

601
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,928
Does it hurt? Let me see.

602
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,447
H-He kicked me.

603
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,888
His shoe soles are so clean.

604
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,007
They didn't leave a mark
on your white pants.

605
00:27:58,608 --> 00:27:59,527
What do you mean?

606
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,247
My son must have cleaned it.

607
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,928
Are you saying that my son lied?

608
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:04,488
Uncle, don't get worked up.

609
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,008
It's reasonable doubt.

610
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:07,528
I'm not worked up.

611
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:08,328
I'm not angry.

612
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,888
We're reasonable people, okay?

613
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:11,447
Who are you calling "Uncle"?

614
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,007
Do I look that old?

615
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,648
He hit my kid.

616
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,247
Thank you, young man.

617
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:18,047
You're back.

618
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:20,488
Dad, sit. Be careful.

619
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,368
This place turns out to be so popular.

620
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:23,687
Be careful.

621
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:24,687
Be careful.

622
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:26,207
My dad doesn't walk well.

623
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,288
We went to the restroom

624
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:29,287
because this young man saved us a seat.

625
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,648
Your waiting ticket.

626
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,128
What's going on?

627
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,088
He hit you, and does it hurt?

628
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:45,247
Well, sorry about that.

629
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:47,287
I didn't teach him well.

630
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,967
I almost got fooled.

631
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,568
Sorry.

632
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:52,487
Let's go home.

633
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:54,928
Dad, I want skewers.

634
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:55,967
Forget it.

635
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:57,727
How did you learn to lie?

636
00:28:57,848 --> 00:28:58,407
Let's go.

637
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,287
Let's go home.

638
00:28:59,568 --> 00:29:01,207
Bro, we also want skewers.

639
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:02,568
Are you fools?

640
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:03,568
Yeah, right.

641
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,047
- Can't you read the room?
- Thanks.

642
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,447
It's CLZ, right?

643
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,447

What's wrong?

646
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:20,528
My dad works in a hospital.

647
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:22,328
He's seen lots of people
who pick fights.

648
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:24,568
He told me to always keep evidence

649
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:26,687
when I run into someone

650
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,848
who wants trouble.

651
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:30,608
So friendly on our second meeting?

652
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:33,088
I thought exchanging names

653
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,207
made us friends.

Besides, they were a group.

Nothing. My grandma wants

Go back. I'll look around.

Professor Jiang wants to see you
tomorrow afternoon.

Got it.

674
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,207
Aren't you going to ask
which university it is?

I don't mind. You can decide.

When are you

681
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:22,608
sending Luzhou abroad?

682
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,287
I'm already working on it.

683
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:26,967
No rush.

684
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,967
Why is it taking so long?

685
00:31:32,168 --> 00:31:33,768
You didn't want

686
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,527
to send him abroad, did you?

687
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:39,888
He's been here for over ten years.

688
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:41,848
I've never seen you

689
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:44,287
lift a finger against him.

690
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:46,527
But you've never hesitated

691
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:48,767

Xingqi is my biological son, after all.

694
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:55,728
Luzhou is an outsider.

695

How can they be the same?

696
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:00,007
You remember he's an outsider?

Luzhou has always been a cunning child.

I'm worried that he won't leave.

Really?

720
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,168
A couple of days ago,

721
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,168
a cleaning lady came

722
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,128

Go to your place?

00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:18,727
Let's go.

727
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:21,328

728
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:58,447
Thank you. Let me do this.

00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:05,967

00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,007

732
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,888
You don't like rainy days?

733
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,328
I hate rainy days.

734
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:36,768
I wouldn't have come out

735
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:38,007
If I had known.

736
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:38,848
What about you?

737
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,047
I like rainy days.

738
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:42,888
I don't go out unless it rains.

739
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:46,487
Do you also like

740
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:47,808
walking in the rain

741
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,087
and looking up at the sky,
so it's hard to tell

742
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:52,328
if it's rain or tears on your cheeks

743
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:54,607
and whether you are sad deep down?

744
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:56,768
What an expert.

745
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:58,967
What's so great about rainy days?

746
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,288
Where do I even begin?

747
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,208
When I was a child,

748
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:05,808
my parents would

749
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,368
take my brother out
and leave me home alone.

750
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,648
But it rained as soon as they went out.

751
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:13,487
They came back like drowned rats.

752
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:15,208
I was like, "See?"

753
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:16,808
"This is what you get."

754
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:20,888
Isn't it quite interesting?

755
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:24,248
You're good at cheering yourself up.

756
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:26,168
Life is already bitter.

757
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,408
Might as well find the funny parts.

758
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:32,087
What about you?

759
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:34,527
Why don't you like rainy days?

760
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:59,127
(Sign-Up for the Teen Motorcycle Race)
I won't sign. Forget it.

761
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,007
Why?

762
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,527
I've been training

763
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,248
for this competition.

764
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:05,288
Take a look at yourself.

765
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:06,768
You're injured badly.

766
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,047
What if it's on your face?

767
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:09,647
What if you hit your head?

768
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:11,487
I have a helmet.

769
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,967
Besides, all professional players

770
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,328
have been injured.

771
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:15,527
Sign it.

772
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,367
No way.

773
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:17,208
Forget it.

774
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:18,248
I'll ask my dad.

775
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:20,848
Xu Guangji really spoiled you.

776
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,647
You nearly flooded the house
when playing with water as a child.

777
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,607
Now, you ride a motorbike
and injure yourself.

778
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,647
You've never spared me any worries.

779
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,208
(If you get hurt again,)

780
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:54,551
(don't come home.)

781
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:59,608
(Lin Qiudie.)

782
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,328
Hello, Dad.

783
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:19,967
Why isn't Mom answering the phone?

784
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,647
I just don't like it.

785
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,728
There's no particular reason.

786
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:49,768
Let's go.

787
00:37:49,848 --> 00:37:50,607
Okay.

788
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:56,888
By the way,

789
00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:58,447
I forgot to ask you.

790
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:00,208
Is your mom at home?

791
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,087
Do you want her

792
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,368
to be there or not?

793
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,808
If you want to see me get scolded,

794
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,248
you'll be disappointed.

795
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:10,808
She doesn't live with me.

796
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:14,087
I'm indeed a bit disappointed.

797
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:15,288
But

798
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:16,728
next time your mom comes,

799
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,127
remember to save me a seat.

800
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,408
You need to buy a ticket.

801
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:22,487
How much is it?

802
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:26,328
Sit anywhere you like.

803
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:41,808
CLZ.

804
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,768
That's so narcissistic.

805
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,728
I'll give you six of them.

806
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:53,567
Can you roast it?

807
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:56,368
Do you have a microwave?

808
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,647
You'll do it here?

809
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,928
Can I? We don't have a microwave.

810
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:03,127
(Really?)

811
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:04,928
Really.

812
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:07,007
Grandma thinks it has radiation

813
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,127
and won't allow its use.

814
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,808
Six is a bit much. Two will do.

815
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,328
(Keep making things up.)

816
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:16,688
Sure.

817
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:17,688
Alright.

818
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,768
Do you cook?

819
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,127
I make instant noodles sometimes.

820
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:44,808
Does your mom come to cook for you?

821
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:46,928
Coming for free meals?

822
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:47,848
Can I?

823
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:51,567
(I am in trouble.)

824
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,647
Let me friend you on WeChat.

825
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,384
My phone is out of battery.

826
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:35,007
Finally free from night study!

827
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:36,487
We've graduated.

828
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,768

I have a hunch.

837
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,967
You'll find your Mr. Right
in the upcoming month.

838
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:08,848
He should be someone hard to handle

839
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:10,408
but incredibly awesome.

840
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:11,688
How about that?

841
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,128
Doesn't your boyfriend sound arrogant

842
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:15,407
but worth looking forward to?

843
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:16,487
Sounds boring.
