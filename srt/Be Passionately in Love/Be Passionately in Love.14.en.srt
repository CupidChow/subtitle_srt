Luzhou.

19
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:01,421
Luzhou.

20
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:04,342
Don't you feel

21
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:06,220
the taste of this place's food
is just average?

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,660
Why do so many people still come here?

23
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,861
A movie had some scenes
filmed here before.

24
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,301
What movie?

25
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
What is it about?

26
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
Want to know?

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,140
Another 800?

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,781
This time, in euros.

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,861
Are you not afraid of draining me?

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,660
Getting addicted to extorting me.

31
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,301
You're heartless.

32
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,941
No pay?

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,700
Then ask others.

34
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:39,821
Excuse me.

35
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,220
Kid,

36
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,461
what do you want to know?

37
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:45,461
I will tell you.

38
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,021
You are also Chinese?

39
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,700
Many Chinese people come here to eat.

40
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,381
Such eye-catching ones are rare.

41
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:53,821
The brother is handsome.

42
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:54,821
The younger one is cute.

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,060
My cute little brother
has many questions.

44
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,140
Please answer them for him.

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Come find me outside later.

46
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I'll be at the door.

47
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:06,821
Thank you.

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,220
What do you want to know?

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Don't mind him.

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
He ended a relationship.

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
Luzhou, wait for me.

52
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:18,821
Wait for me.

53
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,540
They told us to go to the Lego store.

54
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:23,501
Is that okay?

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
Okay.

56
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,620
It's not that I'm picking on him.

57
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,180
You know, it's rare for us to go out.

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,501
Is it so hard to take a picture?

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Are you alright?

60
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:31,672
I'm fine.

61
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,260
Luzhou has been in a bad mood.

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
You know that.

63
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,821
What's there to be
in a bad mood about for him?

64
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,421
We are seeing him off to school.

65
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,342
He should be happy.

66
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:40,421
Always pulling a long face.

67
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,421
All right.

68
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,781
You are his dad.

69
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,301
Can you stop arguing with the child?

70
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,220
Was that an explosion just now?

71
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,461
Someone is injured.

72
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,301
From the restaurant.

73
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700

74
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:16,341
Xingqi.

75
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,021
Wait. Slow down.

76
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,021
Luzhou.

77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Slow down.

78
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,341
Come on.

79
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Let me see.

80
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,140
Be careful.

81
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:28,901

83
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,320
Luzhou, where are you?

84
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,821
How's the situation?

85
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:33,660
Yes, how is it?

86
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Chen Xingqi is fine.

87
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:35,941
No, he got hit and injured.

88
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,661
What about you?

89
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,341
How are you? Are you okay?

90
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,620
Hello, Luzhou.

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,421

144
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:51,341

149

I dropped the phone.

150
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:57,741
I couldn't answer it.

151
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,021

152
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,781
I'm okay.

153

Don't worry. I won't die.

154
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,862
I promise you

155
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,420
I'd play the violin for you at 80.

156

Have you missed me?

157
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:31,781
You're really bad at this.

158
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,420
You should say it's okay,

159
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:35,340
when we broke up, you said,

160
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:37,661
"Xu Zhi, your shoelace is untied."

161
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,981
How arrogant.

162
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Not as arrogant as you.

163
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,300
Then why don't you ask me?

164
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
What?

165
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,661
Ask if I've missed you.

166
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Have you?

167
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,821

No. Luzhou!

172
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:20,661
No.

173
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,420
This matter is unacceptable.

174
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:23,941
No room for discussion.

175
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,541
Such a big matter

176
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,781
is not up to you.

177
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,180
You think it's easy to get in here?

178
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,340
I've put in so much effort.

179
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,260
What exactly are you thinking?

180
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:40,021
You should also
consider from our perspective,

181
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,021
Luzhou.

182
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:42,901
No way.

183
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Besides,

184
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,300
the arrangements

185
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,141
are all set.

186
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,300
Now you're not going.

187
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:53,981
Why?

188
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,741
This is my own decision.

189
00:11:58,581 --> 00:11:59,741
I'm not to discuss with you.

190
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,260
Luzhou.

191
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,661
Nice job raising your son.

Look at him now.

193
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,701
Just perfect.

194
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,981
I'll book the flight ticket.

195
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,340
I can't stay in this place any longer.

196
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,621
What's gotten into you?

197
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,060
He's losing it, you have to too?

198
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,100
Can you calm down?

199
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,060
Calm down.

200
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,901
How can I calm down!

201
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,781
- You...
- Every time I close my eyes,

202
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,220
I see that boy covered in blood

203
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,541
lying in front of me.

204
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,060
He's about the same age as Luzhou.

205
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,981
Who can guarantee

206
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:43,701
similar situations won't happen again.

207
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,380
What if it's Luzhou?

208
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,541
Just because of an incidental event,

209
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,100
do you need to be so emotional?

210
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,621
If this continues like this,

211
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:52,781
will he continue his studies?

212
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,901
Luzhou is my son.

213
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,781
His life is more important
than anything.

214
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:58,661
Let's return

215
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,140
immediately.

216
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,100
Zhi, here's a little fortune pouch
for you.

217
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,821
Good luck always.
You really understand me.

218
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,060
Xu Zhi,

219
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,661
this is a small token for you.

220
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,541
T-This wouldn't be
a promissory note, would it?

221
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,220
How could a promissory note
be this thick? Feel it.

222
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,981
When did you become so generous?

223
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:31,581
Exactly.

224
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:32,861
Can't remember?

225
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,942
Isn't this

226
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,260
a promise from when you were 6?

227
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:36,941
I gave you New Year's money

228
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
and you said,

229
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,621
"You give me the money,

230
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:40,621
but I can't spend it.

231
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,260
My dad takes it all."

232
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:43,821
I asked you what to do.

233
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:44,621
You said,

234
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,621
"You save it for me.

235
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,500
When I hit college,

236
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,421
give it all to me."

237
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,781
I'm here to fulfill that today.

238
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,901
As expected of Zhi,

239
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,981
having such a business mind at 6.

240
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,220
Isn't this at least 10,000?

241
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
A round number.

242
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,741
See. I told you my lucky bag worked.

243
00:13:58,741 --> 00:13:59,941
Really!

244
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,180
Don't take so much money.

245
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
What if she wastes it?

246
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:06,100
It's for her.

247
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,060
Now that you've grown up,
you get to manage it.

248
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,742
Ignore him.

249
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:10,941
Yes, I'll use it wisely.

250
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,060
But I have to add.

251
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,340
When you earn money,

252
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,140
first buy clothes and food for your dad.

253
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,380
Boyfriend should come second.

254
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:23,060
Dad is most important. You know?

255
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,500
He's telling you.

256
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:26,701
Dad is the most important.

257
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,260
Then I might as well not date
or marry in the future.

258
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,420
Just stay by your side.

259
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Don't find me annoying.

260
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:32,861
How could you not date?

261
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,942
I'm telling you.

262
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,781
Once you're in college
and enter society,

263
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:36,781
you'll know.

264
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,460
The most innocent romance

265
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:39,981
is just in the campus.

266
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,741
You should still

267
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:42,741
give it a try.

268
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:43,380
Alright.

269
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,060
Don't chase my boyfriend around

270
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,901
with a knife.

271
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,100
How come?

272
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,260
You'd be better off without Chen Luzhou.

273
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,861
Check it at the Hua University.

274
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,180
What if among ten guys,

275
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,701
nine of them are like him?

276
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,781
Just don't get tired of them.

277
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:58,701
Okay, I'll take your good words.

278
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:01,180
Love is love.

279
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,460
If someone bullies you,

280
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,180
remember to tell me immediately.

281
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:05,781
Okay.

282
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:07,701
The car is here.

283
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,301
Hurry.

284
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,340
So soon?

285
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,341
Don't miss the train.

286
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,300
- Really.
- Zhi.

287
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,460
Zhi, this time you really have
to take care of yourself.

288
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,180
Wear more when it gets cold.

289
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,060
Mr. Xu, are you finished?

290
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,180
Zhi,
you must take good care of yourself.

291
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,500
Make a video call every day.

292
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,581
Call me daily.

293
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:27,622
Don't lose weight.

294
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,741
You must stay chubby.

295
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:30,140
- Got it?
- Got it.

296
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,741
Miss me.

297
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:31,861
You need to study well.

298
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:34,180
You've never been away from me

299
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,180
for so long.

300
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,300
Alright.

301
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,861
Don't go.

302
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,021
That's enough.

303
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,741
She'll come back during holidays.

304
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:40,301
Yes.

305
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:41,941
Missing the train later would be bad.

306
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,781
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

307
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:44,781
Bye-bye.

308
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
Wait for me.

309
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,021
I'll go to Beijing next year.

310
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,021
Alright.

311
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,581
Bye-bye.

312

Hello.

Everyone who can get into Hua University

343
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,021
is truly extraordinary.

345

school starts,

let's go to the library together.

347
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:27,512
Is it okay?

348
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,781
Okay.

349
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,060
Hello,

350
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,460
I am your roommate, Du Qilan.

351
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:32,821
Thank you.

352
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,981

Don't be shy with Senior.

357
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Senior?

358
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,941
Yes, she is

359
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,140
a sophomore in philosophy.

360
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,621
I was assigned

361
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:44,901
with several seniors.

362
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:46,340
After they graduated,

363
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
you all came.

364
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
By the way,

365
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,060
there's a mixer.

366
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,500
I signed you all up.

367
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,581
Many seniors will be there.

368
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,140
Don't be late.

369
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,421
Senior.

370
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:58,500
- Handsome guy.
- Handsome guy.

371
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:00,500
Thank you.

372
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
No problem.

373
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,340
I'll leave first.

374
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,300
Contact me anytime.

375
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,420
Okay, bye-bye.

376
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,460
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

377
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm coming. Don't rush me.

378
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,862
Need me?

379
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,420
No need. I can do it myself.

380
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:12,621
Okay.

00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:53,981
(I changed my number.
Remember to save it.)

00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:55,701
(Received.)

387
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,421
(On the first day,)

388
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:58,621
(how did you all spend it?)

389
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,541
(Making my bed.)

390
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,260
(Did you go to Ruicheng
to change your number, Lucy?)

391
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,340
(Why aren't you talking?)

392
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,661
(You haven't
forgotten us already, have you?)

393
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:19,981
(Silly boy,)

394
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,460
(do you know)

395
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,060
(what does time difference mean?)

396
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:30,741
(I'm going to sleep.)

397
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Luzhou.

398
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,781
Luzhou.

399
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:49,701
Mom,

400
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:52,420
how many days remain?

401
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,541
If this continues,

402
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,781
my hand will swell like a pig's trotter.

403
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,140
The doctor said

404
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:01,781
you won't need injections
until all your indicators

405
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
are completely normal.

406
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,500
They also said I need to rest more.

407
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:08,941
Don't think about it.

408
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,100
You have to attend art class as usual.

409
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,100
Didn't Dad say I could skip it?

410
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Useless.

411
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,901
I don't care. I just want to rest.

412
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
I just want to rest.

413
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,300
I want to eat ice cream.

414
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
Remember?

415
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,901
When you were in Ruicheng,

416
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:27,621
you had a fever and started vomiting.

417
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,340
Still want to eat ice cream?

418
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,541
I don't care. I just want it.

419
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:32,582
Alright, stop...

420
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:33,981
Sir, turn right ahead

421
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
and stop.

422
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,380
Still macadamia, two scoops?

423
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,340
Right.

424
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,541
Mom,

425
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
don't you think

426
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:03,781
Luzhou is acting weird.

427
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:06,821
If it were before,

428
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,100
he would take
the opportunity to extort me.

429
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,901
But this time he agreed so quickly.

430
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,781
Your brother treats you well.

431
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:17,861
Not well?

432
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:22,741
I still like him the way he was before.

433
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,781
Ever since he came back,

434
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,901
he's not close to us anymore.

435
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:41,220
(Welcome Party)

436
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:52,981
Xu Zhi.

437
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Xu Zhi.

438
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
Excuse me.

439
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,260
No wonder looking familiar.

440
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
It really is you.

441
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,541
Qian's mom always mentions you.

442
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,060
She said you're

443
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,260
the best among Qian's tutors.

444
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:08,861
Did you come alone?

445
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,821
Xu Zhi.

446
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,500
I'll go over first.

447
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:12,941
Okay.

448
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:19,701
Where are the others?

449
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,380
Backstage. Eyeing cute guys.

450
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,420

Nothing. I'm dieting.

489
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,460
I want to eat fried chicken.

490
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:36,901
Sure.

491
00:26:58,621 --> 00:26:59,621
Where's she going?

492
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:00,741
I don't know.

493
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:30,941
Junior.

494
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:32,220
What's wrong?

495
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:33,901
I've lost one of my earrings.

496
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
Let me help you find it.

497
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:08,901
Junior!

498
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:14,981
Is it this one?

499
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:21,781
Thank you.

500
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,260
Thank you.

501
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,941
I almost thought I couldn't find it.

502
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,781
This earring is important to you, right?

503
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,781
That's right.

504
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
My name is Jiang Yu,

505
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:41,581
sophomore from School of Humanities.

506
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:42,701
My name is Xu Zhi.

507
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:43,340
Architecture.

508
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
How did you know?

509
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,982
When singing,

510
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:47,021
I noticed you.

511
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:47,500
Alright.

512
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Xu Zhi.

513
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:49,621
Li Ke.

514
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,180
You left too quickly.

515
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I forgot to tell you.

516
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,021
I formed a group for Qingyi locals.

517
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:55,220
We meet occasionally.

518
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,060
I'll add you later.

519
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,821
Sure.

520
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:57,661
I'm there.

521
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,661
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

522
00:28:58,661 --> 00:28:59,140
Bye-bye.

523
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Bye-bye.

524
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,701
You two are high school classmates?

525
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:10,140
No, we're both from Qingyi.

526
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Different high schools.

527
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,541
She's a friend of my friend.

528
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,220
Girlfriend?

529
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,901
Sort of an ex-girlfriend.

530
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:21,821
I'm off now.

531
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:41,336
(Huaguang University's
Extra Admissions Plan)

532
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:49,260
(Luzhou, you're about to be outed.)

533
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,220
(There's a charming guy chasing Xu Zhi.)

534
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,621
(You better be careful now.)

535
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,140
(Even though I think you're
more handsome than him.)

536
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,500
(But, maybe Xu Zhi)

537
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
(doesn't think so.)

538
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,380
The offer arrived.

539
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:14,180
You just let him not go.

540
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,420
No further discussion.

541
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,220
Do I not even have the right

542
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,701
to speak about Luzhou?

543
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,661
Because of an accidental incident?

544
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:25,621
Yes.

545
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,581
I did promise you

546
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,581
to send Luzhou abroad when he turned 18.

547
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,380
But you saw what happened that time.

548
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,901
That young man was covered in blood,

549
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,300
lying in front of us.

550
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,100
He's about the same age as Luzhou.

551
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:40,060
I can't leave my own son

552
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,340
alone abroad.

553
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,340
Except Ruicheng,

554
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,380
he can go to another country.

555
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Have you

556
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,300
already made up your mind

557
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:52,420
not to make him to go out at all?

558
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,981
You simply don't trust me.

559
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:57,861
No matter what I say,

560
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:00,861
you won't believe it.

561
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,741
Is it that I don't trust you?

562
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:05,822
From the start,

563
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,140
you lied to me.

564
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,781
How is it my fault then?

565
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,300
This happened more than a decade ago.

566
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,661
You're bringing up the past?

567
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:15,901
I can stop bringing up past,

568
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
but please

569
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:18,781
fulfill your promise.

570
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,220
I can't fulfill it.

571
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:22,981
If you insist on forcing Luzhou abroad,

572
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,380
we'll get a divorce.

573
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,380
You want to divorce me?

574
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,701
You better not regret it.

575
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
I understand.

576
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,021
So you two

577
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,060
have already discussed this.

578
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:00,781
I'm the only one left in the dark.

579
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Divorce.

580
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:07,861
Fine then, divorce it is!

581
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,100
(Friend Reuqest)

582
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
(I'm Jiang Yu.)

583
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,621
(Don't lose important things again
next time.)

584
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:15,781
It's okay. Just a small wound.

585
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:31,821
Otherwise, tonight,

586
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:34,060
you go sleep in Xingqi's room.

587
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:35,981
I'll stay with him.

588
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
Are you okay?

589
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,460
Even if I explain many things to you,

590
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,821
you may not necessarily understand.

591
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,941
You will definitely look at us
from your perspective.

592
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,420
All would do so.

593
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,661
We are not the same.

594
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:10,781
I feel that in this world,

595
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:12,621
there is no such thing as empathy.

596
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,380
Because there is no one

597
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,140
who can truly understand one another.

598
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,300
Don't make things so complicated.

599
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:23,661
Have you ever thought

600
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,861
if I leave this family,

601
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:27,220
there wouldn't be many problems.

602
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,460
Don't think like that.

603
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,300
This matter has nothing to do with you.

604
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,220
It's an issue between
Chen Jishen and me.

605
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,060
Adults will handle adult matters.

606
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,781
But I am also an adult now.

607
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,901
From now on,

608
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:51,781
about the future,

609
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
I'll decide my future.

610
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:02,460
Go to sleep.

611

612
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,901
Are mom and dad really going to divorce?

613
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:13,500
Who will you stay with then?

614
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I won't stay with anyone.

615
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:19,861
Then can I stay with you?

616
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:26,941

642
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,500
how should we stick it here?

647

Hey, Miss Cai,

650
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,100
you finally have time to care about me.

651
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,541
I started school.

652
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,180
I can't contact you freely, okay?

653
00:37:58,981 --> 00:37:59,981
How have you been?

654
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,941
Did you meet the alternative
Chen Luzhou?

655
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,140
I'm not that free.

656
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,021
At our second canteen,

657
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,621
there's a delicious malatang.

658
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,901
For just over 10 yuan,
you get a full bowl.

659
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,180
Really?

660
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,821
Are you trying to tempt me
to go to Beijing?

661
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:16,861
You should come quickly.

662
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,340
If you're late,

663
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:20,220
this title of my bestie

664
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
will belong to others.

665
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:22,581

666
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,981

with your dad been?

667

(Join the Chemistry Experiment Club)
To be honest,

668
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:27,661
I think

669
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,701
since I'm repeating my studies,
I can spend an extra year with him.

670
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:32,021
It's quite good.

671
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,060
You figured it out so quickly?

672
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:36,220
Because that day,

673
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,821
I went to the hospital.

674
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,340
Come on. Let's drink.

675
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:46,500
Mr. Cai,

676
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:48,260
where did Yingying end up going?

677
00:38:50,781 --> 00:38:52,340
She didn't do well on the exam.

678
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,021
She's at home, repeating her studies.

679
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:56,021
Repeating studies is so tough.

680
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
There's no need for this.

681
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:58,582
For girls,

682
00:38:58,582 --> 00:38:59,608
it's all the same.

683
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,460
Education just sounds good in theory.

684
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,621
A good husband

685
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:04,440
matters most, right?

686
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,822
Don't say that.

687
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:07,781
How can a girl's education
not be important?

688
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,821
(Cai Binhong, Vice Dean)
In the past,

689
00:39:10,021 --> 00:39:11,100
I was too busy with work

690
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,621
to look after her when she was young.

691
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Never mind.

692
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,701
She is not worse than others.

693
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,180
And she's intelligent.

694
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,180
If she works hard,

695
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,621
she can get into the university
she likes.

696
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:24,581
Moreover, I feel

697
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,420
her future marriage quality
isn't important.

698
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,420
What matters is her happiness.

699
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,060
Isn't it?

700
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,862
Yes.

701
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,220
It's okay to stay single.

702
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,581
That's what I think.

703
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,500
If she does well in the next exam,

704
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:38,861
she will support me.

705
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,380
In case she doesn't do well,

706
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,500
I will support her for life.

707
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:44,701

708
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:45,701

719
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:30,021
It's nothing. Just a slight sprain.
It's not serious.

730
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,140

00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,420
(Li Ke: Xu Zhi, did you receive
the medicine for you?)

757
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:34,861
(I received it.)

758
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,821
(How did you know I was injured?)

759
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,260
(I have informants, you know.)

760
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,460
(I'm really sorry.)

761
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:42,542
(I don't know it.)

762
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:43,901
(So I just bought randomly.)

763
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,060
(For sprains, joint pain,
calcium supplements,)

764
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,741
(I got them all.)

765
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:47,581
(Pick)

766
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:48,861
(a useful one.)

767
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:51,581
(Thanks a lot.)

768
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:53,500
(You're welcome.)

769
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:54,661
(We're fellow villagers.)

770
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:56,180
(You are a friend of Luzhou.)

771
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,180
(My duty.)

772
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,460
(Impossible.)

773
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,541
(Chen Luzhou is in Ruicheng.)

774
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,621
(How could he possibly
appear in Beijing?)

775
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:41,541
(Nothing. I hit the wrong key.)

776
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:15,000
(Zhi)

777
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:41,661
(Done. There shouldn't
be any loopholes.)

778
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,340
Thanks.

779
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:53,821
Why so polite with me?

780
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,100
I just didn't expect you

781
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,861
act like a coward,

782
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,981
sending medicine under my name.

783
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,380
In my opinion,

784
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,341
if you really like,

785
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:03,621
just go for her boldly.

786
00:46:03,981 --> 00:46:05,500
The far-away love isn't unusual.

787
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:07,140
You have me as a lookout.

788
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,300
I'm busy.

789
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:11,701
Talk later. Bye.

790
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:01,408
(Fighting alone for so many years.
What I want might be a bit greedier.)

791
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:03,320
(It's passionate and unfaltering love.
It's one of a kind. It must be me.)
