=Episode 4=
(Xu Zhi, Turn Around and Look at Me)

18
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:49,413
You should learn from Chen Luzhou.

19
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:51,293
Look at his level of thought,

20
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,013
capturing the beauty of the world
with the camera.

21
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:58,212
Even the pheasants in his pictures
appear in pairs.

22
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,373
Now look at you.

23
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:02,333
You should talk more about things

24
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,293
like the stars and the sea,
ideals, and such.

25
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:06,893
No money talk anymore.

26
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:07,893
It's vulgar.

27
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:09,813
I think you just don't want
to give him a raise.

28
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:11,532
He didn't tell me.

29
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:12,453
Why do you argue?

30
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:14,532
Why can't I argue?

31
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,773
He's my responsibility.
I introduced him to you.

32
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:18,293
I think

33
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,013
you should get it down to written form

34
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:23,373
to avoid any default.

35
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,453
(Isn't she not interested in me?)

36
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,532
(Why is she defending me?)

37
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,172
Applied for college yet?

38
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:32,692
Which college?

39
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:34,853
Qingyi University.

40
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:36,013
Qingyi University?

41
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:37,893
Are you joking?

42
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:39,813
In the last mock exam,

43
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,368
you ranked in the city's top 10.

44
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,293
Aren't you going to Beijing or Shanghai?

45
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:46,692
Qingyi University is good.

46
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,493
When I'm free,

47
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:49,692
I can walk your dog.

48
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:50,933
Here, walk the dog. Take this.

49
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:54,172
Are you worried
about your dad and your grandma?

50
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,333
Your dad's illness has long been cured.
Don't worry.

51
00:02:57,572 --> 00:02:59,333
Your grandma has me and Mr. Cai.

52
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,413
I can handle my own matters properly.

53
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:02,520
Let's go.

54
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:05,572
I'm so worried.

55
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:56,293
Hello, Mom.

56
00:03:58,092 --> 00:03:59,333
Have you been busy lately?

57
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,252
I'll be busy until mid-next month.

58
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,732
Why? Did Chen Xingqi
cause trouble again?

59
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:05,532
No, I'm just checking.

60
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:09,692
I have a friend.

61
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,576
If you have time...

62
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:12,076
Hui.

63
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:12,576
Could you...

64
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:13,080
Hui.

65
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,252
I have to go. Watch your brother.

66
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:16,212
I'm hanging up.

67
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:47,052
Why didn't I answer your phone?

68
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,813
Don't you know it yourself?

69
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:51,652
Hang up, will you?

70
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,333
Isn't Chai Jingjing

71
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,853
waiting for you to have coffee?

72
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,572
Are there girls
who are usually close to Zhai Xiao?

73
00:04:58,373 --> 00:04:59,252
After graduation,

74
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:00,453
he seems to have a girlfriend.

75
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,532
Her name sounds a lot like mine, right?

76
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:04,472
Got it.

77
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:06,293
It's Chai Jingjing,

78
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:07,773
from the 8th High School.

79
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:10,413
Chai Jingjing.

80
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,453
Zhai Xiao?

81
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,453
Hurry.

82
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:24,373
I don't have to make excuses

83
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,656
since you found it out.

84
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:26,712
That's it.

85
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:28,893
Zhai Xiao,

86
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,333
do you have any shame?

87
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,732
You're still so arrogant.

88
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,933
Really think you're a princess, huh?

89
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:36,092
If it weren't for your dean dad

90
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:36,773
backing you up,

91
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,773
what are you, Cai Yingying?

92
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:40,493
I...

93
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:41,692
You get by day by day

94
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:43,373
with no goals or plans.

95
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:44,898
You even dare not estimate your score.

96
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:45,732
Someone like you

97
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,052
acting all arrogant with me?

98
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:47,973
Shut up.

99
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:49,293
I don't need you

100
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:50,532
to judge my life.

101
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:51,773
Now get lost.

102
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,293
Miss Model,

103
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,172
are you okay?

104
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:08,052
I'm fine.

105
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:16,732
We're in the middle of nowhere.

106
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:18,132
We can't play Whac-A-Mole.

107
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,132
How about

108
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:23,612
we drag Chen Xingqi over here

109
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:24,493
and beat him up?

110
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:25,532
Whac-A-Mole?

111
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:26,532
You forgot?

112
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:27,853
Scoundrel.

113
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:28,773
Take this.

114
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:29,493
Take this.

115
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:31,172
I'll beat you to death.

116
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:32,212
Take this.

117
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,052
Why are you standing here?

118
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:36,612
Me?

119
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:37,293
Join me now.

120
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:38,584
Okay.

121
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:39,572
Right away.

122
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,333
Scoundrel, I'll beat you to death.

123
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,052
Alright.

124
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:47,052
So you heard everything?

125
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:47,576
I...

126
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:48,893
I didn't mean to.

127
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:49,413
I swear.

128
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,172
Then why didn't you defend me?

129
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,092
Alright.

130
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,652
Next time, I'll show you what I got.

131
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:57,813
No need.

132
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:00,092
Don't waste your breath
on an unworthy scoundrel.

133
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:02,393
Yingying,

134
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,652
your modeling job isn't over.

135
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,413
Chen Luzhou, be responsible for me.

136
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:18,692
Being busy, Lucy?

137
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:19,800
Nothing.

138
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:21,973
What's up with him?

139
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:23,893
It's all your fault.

140
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,773
You insisted on us
sketching in the woods.

141
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:27,493
The mosquitoes were killing me.

142
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:28,888
Let me see.

143
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,272
No medicine?

144
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,692
I brought mosquito repellent, bro.

145
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:37,373
Who to blame?

146
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:38,333
You didn't bring it.

147
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,572
The mountain mosquitoes are vicious.

148
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,172
I feel like I'm hit by...

149
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,293
well...

150
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:44,933
Nine Yin White Bone Claw.

151
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,333
I'm itchy all over.

152
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,532
Nine Yin White Bone Claw?

153
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,333
Nine Yin White Bone Claw crushes skulls.

154
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,293
Alright, go take a shower first.

155
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,172
Later, I'll ask who brought medicine.

156
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:59,333
Are you trying
to hit on the young ladies?

157
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:05,773
Mind your own business.

158
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,212
You're so boring.

159
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:09,172
Totally love-struck.

160
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:10,973
What a pity.

161
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,092
She just doesn't like you.

162
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:18,452
Zhu Yangqi.

163
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,933
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

164
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:22,613
Should I have someone zip it for you?

165
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,573
I didn't say it.

166
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:25,893
Chen Xingqi.

167
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:28,092
It has nothing to do with Stylish Zhu.

168
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:29,933
Last night at the bar,

169
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:30,933
that microphone

170
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:32,893
made a loud sound.

171
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:36,452
The whole villa should have heard it.

172
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,013
Seeking a beating?

173
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:40,252
Remember my medicine.

174
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:53,613
Ask for me on WeChat later to see

175
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,973
if Xu Zhi brought the medicine.

176
00:08:58,492 --> 00:08:59,773
I've zipped my mouth.

177
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,372
I can't speak.

178
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:03,768
Okay.

179
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,052
Don't let me know who you like later.

180
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,613
(Do you have any anti-itch cream?)

181
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,592
(Chen Xingqi got mosquito bites.)

182
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,693
(I'll bring it to you in the lobby.)

183
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:21,052
See?

184
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,212
Isn't this a chance to meet?

185
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,092
Then get it for me, alright?

186
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:26,372
I won't.

187
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:28,372
I just want you two to meet.

188
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:30,013
I want to see how she

189
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:31,332
barely pays you any attention.

190
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:32,973
I find it amusing to watch.

191
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:34,693
If you have the guts, go after her.

192
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,933
If you dare, go pursue her.

193
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:42,893
What for?

194
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:44,573
Breaking up soon

195
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,092
to get a love experience card?

196
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:47,452
Alright.

197
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,492
As long as you can hold back.

You're here.

For a while.

212
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:09,452
Sorry.

213
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,853
These colorful little fish

214
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:12,653
are quite cute.

215
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:15,773
By the way,

216
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:18,252
my dad's friend gave us this.

217
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,973
It smells a bit like menthol.

218
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,452
Let your brother make do with it.

219
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:24,813
Thanks.

220
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:25,853
You're welcome.

221
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:30,492
Had dinner yet?

222
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:31,973
No.

223
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:33,452
Want to join me?

224
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,224
Here.

225
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:48,212
What do you want?

226
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,452
You decide. I'm not picky.

227
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:50,360
Okay.

228
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:02,492
(I'm eating with her.)

229
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,252
(Have dinner yourself.)

230
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,412
(I underestimated)

231
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:11,853
(the charm of you scoundrel.)

232
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:23,452
Don't order alcohol.

233
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:24,952
Let's drink soda.

234
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,092
Don't be like Cai Yingying,

235
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:26,773
drunk and blue.

236
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,252
It's fine. I can hold my liquor.
I won't get drunk.

237
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:34,813
Alright, suit yourself.

238
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:36,252
Excuse me.

239
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:37,933
A glass of lemonade.

240
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:38,693
Okay.

241
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:42,813
Dad.

242
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,973
Dad, I want to drink orange soda.

243
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:50,853
Let me open it for you.

244
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:54,332
Xu.

245
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,092
Perfect timing.

246
00:12:57,332 --> 00:12:59,052
Zhi said this is expired, right?

247
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:00,013
This...

248
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,172
Come on.

249
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,172
Let me take a look.

250
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:04,292
Can't you see

251
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,172
such big letters?

252
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:06,653
Presbyopia?

253
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,452
Yes.

254
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,013
Don't drink such unhealthy things.

255
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,092
Come on, sweetie.

256
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:11,933
Let's have some lemonade.

257
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,733
I don't want lemonade.

258
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:19,893
I want something sweet.

259
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:21,813
Be good.

260
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,292
Drink it. It whitens and is healthy.

261
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:30,212
It whitens.

262
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,372
Excuse me,
we'd like two glasses of lemonade

263
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:41,733
and a set meal for two.

264
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:42,616
Okay.

265
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:43,332
Thank you.

266
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:58,092
Why stare at me?

267
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,893
You don't have
any bad habits usually, right?

268
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:02,813
No, I don't.

269
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:05,132
Almost none.

270
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,132
Why this question?

271
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,412
How long do you plan to live?

272
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,252
So disciplined.

273
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,052
Is this sarcasm?

274
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,052
Am I being a buzzkiller to you?

275
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,013
Let's have alcohol then.

276
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:16,773
No need.

277
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:23,693
Lemonade is quite good.

278
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,252
My mom often drank it.

279
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:31,492
Here is your food.

280
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:36,172
Thank you.

281
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:45,492
Please enjoy.

282
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,013
Your estimated score is quite high,

283
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,893
according to Cai Yingying.

284
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,933
What college will you go to?

285
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,573
I want to stay in this city

286
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,613
and study architecture
at Qingyi University.

287
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:03,773
Architecture?

288
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:05,052
What?

289
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,653
Can't girls study it?

290
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,212
Not what I meant.

291
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:11,693
Its School of Architecture is ordinary.

292
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,092
Given your score,

293
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,013
won't you go to Shanghai or Beijing?

294
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,013
Alright, I misunderstood you.

295
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:19,332
Actually,

296
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:21,613
my friends and relatives

297
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,292
always advise me to change my major,

298
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,813
saying that few girls
study architecture.

299
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:27,773
I thought you thought the same.

300
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:30,613
I actually think girls

301
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,693
can do better in architecture than boys.

302
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:35,533
Really?

303
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:39,132
Apart from space, structure, and logic,

304
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,092
architectural works actually

305
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,372
are somewhat like literary works.

306
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:44,813
They need emotions.

307
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,452
I think in this aspect,

308
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:48,853
girls may be more subtle than boys.

309
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:52,412
But it's just my personal opinion.

310
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:56,452
There is an underwater bookstore
in the city.

311
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:57,172
Do you know it?

312
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:58,492
I heard it is

313
00:15:58,492 --> 00:15:59,653
a female architect's work.

314
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:01,973
You know that too?

315
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:04,893
The underwater design is very clever.

316
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,653
When you read
by the glass window and look up,

317
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,372
you can see water,
plants, fish, and insects.

318
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,733
People, nature, and architecture

319
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,332
harmoniously blend together.

320
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,733
It's a great design.

321
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,372
But you're different from other girls.

322
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,613
The word 'subtle'
might not apply to you.

323
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:30,452
But I think

324
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:31,653
you can

325
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,092
do whatever well.

326
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:38,813
I'll take it as a compliment.

327
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,412
I'm complimenting you.

328
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,132
What about you?

329
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:02,452
You study art, right?

330
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:03,693
What are your plans?

331
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:06,733
I feel like you have a lot of options.

332
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:08,973
Who told you I study art?

333
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:10,853
You and Zhu Yangqi are good friends.

334
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:12,853
I thought you were art students.

335
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:14,613
I'm not.

336
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:16,052
I'm a regular student.

337
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,773
You failed the college entrance exam?

338
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:23,893
I heard your mom say that
at the door earlier.

339
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:26,613
Sort of.

340
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,573
Something happened.

341
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:31,013
Alright.

342
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:34,292
Not full yet?

343
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:35,813
Time to go.

344
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,052
You go first. I'll sit for a while.

345
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:40,653
Don't forget the ointment.

346
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,092
It's in my pocket.

347
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,292
Okay.

348
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,933
Want to sneak some alcohol?

349
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:54,573
I know what you're majoring in.

350
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,653
Police or criminal investigation.

351
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:00,573
My dad has always said

352
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:01,773
I can't be a cop.

353
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:02,600
Why?

354
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,172
I'm too handsome

355
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:05,853
and too conspicuous in a crowd.

356
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,212
Being an undercover cop

357
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:08,212
makes me vulnerable.

358
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,773
You really are quite narcissistic.

359
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:16,332
Are you leaving?

360
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:17,212
I can't drink.

361
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:18,452
Allergy?

362
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:19,613
Not really.

363
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:20,893
I can't hold my liquor.

364
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,172
When I was younger, Zhu Yangqi's dad

365
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,252
made me drink liquor.

366
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,132
I chatted with his grandma all night.

367
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,092
I even aggravated her shoulder pain.

368
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,693
She was bedridden for a week.

369
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:33,172
Impressive.

370
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,492
Oh my gosh.

371
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,813
What kind of person is Chen Luzhou?

372
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,492
Next time, we have to get him drunk

373
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:45,653
and see what he can talk about
for all night.

374
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:46,773
Good idea.

375
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,292
I'm tired. I'm taking a shower.

376
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:28,533
(I actually think girls)

377
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:30,533
(can do better in architecture
than boys.)

378
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,418
(The National Astronomical Observatory's
latest forecast says)

379
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,573
(the highly anticipated
Aries meteor shower)

380
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,172
(will reach its peak)

381
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,372
(between 11 PM tonight)

382
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,733
(and 1 AM tomorrow.)

383
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,973
(Tonight is its peak viewing period.
It's also the Northern Hemisphere's...)

384
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,052
Zhi. Zhi.

385
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,013
Look, a meteor shower.

386
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,733
The ten things to do after graduation

387
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:03,853
must have a meteor shower.

388
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:05,893
Let's go see it.

389
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,332
Let's invite Chen Luzhou and others.

390
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:09,720
Okay.

391
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,332
(It is recommended
to use moisture-proof mats...)

392
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:15,172
Hello, Dad.

393
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:15,928
Hello,

394
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:16,853
Zhi.

395
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:19,292
How is it going at the villa?

396
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,092
I'm having fun.

397
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:22,412
You know what?

398
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:23,973
It's really cool in the mountains.

399
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:26,492
Mr. Fu said once the tea is roasted,

400
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,693
I must get two bags for you.

401
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:28,773
Okay.

402
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:31,132
Wait a moment.

403
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:36,492
Xu Zhi,

404
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:37,853
is Yingying next to you?

405
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,332
Put her on the phone.

406
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:42,052
It's for you.

407
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:43,013
Me?

408
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:45,252
Hello?

409
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:46,292
Cai Yingying.

410
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:47,613
What?

411
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:49,013
Tell me.

412
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:50,573
Why didn't you

413
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:51,492
put away the hair dye?

414
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,372
Your grandma now has green hair.

415
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:54,613
Isn't that embarrassing?

416
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:59,212
Grandma herself used the wrong hair dye.

417
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,013
Not my fault.

418
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:00,813
Besides,

419
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:03,132
who says an old lady
can't dye her hair green?

420
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,212
Cut the nonsense.

421
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,092
Listen to me. Right now, you...

422
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:07,893
Cai Binhong,

423
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,773
stop talking like this. I'll be mad.

424
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:10,533
I'll not go back.

425
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:11,573
Suit yourself.

426
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:13,653
You're fierce.

427
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:14,653
Ignore him.

428
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,292
Let's see the meteor shower.

429
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,332
She hung up.

430
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,533
Why was she getting mad at me?

431
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,372
As a new high school graduate,

432
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:28,132
why are you so awesome, Lucy?

433
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:30,452
I've been awesome for 18 years already.

434
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,893
Don't push it.

435
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:47,252
Cai Yingying said an Aries meteor shower

436
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,292
will be here at 11 PM,

437
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:49,693
wondering if you'll go.

438
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:51,092
No. I have to edit the video.

439
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,013
She said Xu Zhi seems to be going too.

440
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:00,452
She said

441
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:02,733
Xu Zhi's mother was also an Aries,

442
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,533
and a departed family member

443
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,052
would turn into a meteor in the sky.

444
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,013
So

445
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:08,733
she wants to go.

446
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:10,813
She believes in that?

447
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:11,773
Yeah.

448
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,212
Lucy, you are so fickle.

449
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:22,933
Are you going?

450
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:25,240
Yes.

451
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:38,573
Those are quite bright colors.

452
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,533
Why don't you usually wear them?

453
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:41,292
Why today?

454
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:42,498
None of your business.

455
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,613
By the way,

456
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,452
you came back so late last night.

457
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,693
Was there any progress with Xu Zhi?

458
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:51,693
What progress?

459
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,132
We just chatted and had dinner.

460
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:55,013
Then we parted ways.

461
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,372
You chatted?

462
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:58,013
About what?

463
00:22:59,132 --> 00:22:59,773
Studies.

464
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:00,733
Stud...?

465
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,492
Were you insane?

466
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:10,132
Just say it.

467
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:11,853
I really thought

468
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:13,212
that you were endlessly charming.

469
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:14,613
Come on, let me tell you.

470
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:16,693
When a man and woman go out for a meal,

471
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:19,332
there's usually
a hint of ambiguity and chemistry.

472
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,132
And you two talked about studies?

473
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,292
It seems Xu Zhi has no feelings for you.

474
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:29,773
Yes, she does have no feelings for me.

475
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:32,212
So don't bring up those topics

476
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,172
in front of her anymore.

477
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:33,720
Got it?

478
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,613
Alright, fine.

479
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,853
I was wrong, alright?

480
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:38,212
I'll stop joking.

481
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,693
Why did you change to black?

482
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,212
None of your business.

483
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,252
Dressed so stylishly?

484
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,452
You're so trendy, Zhu.

485
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,412
My name isn't being called for nothing.

486
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,813
Zhu Yangqi, aka Stylish Zhu.

487
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:03,332
What? Got a problem?

488
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:04,653
No. As long as you like it.

489
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:06,013
Here, take this.

490
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:08,172
Get in the car.

491
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:16,533
What? Are you going to drive?

492
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:18,332
Does your car still have gas?

493
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:20,573
Did you refuel it
last time you came back?

494
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,088
It's enough.

495
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,332
I'm going down tomorrow.

496
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,172
I'll refuel it then.

497
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:29,893
You're going down again tomorrow?

498
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:31,492
What for?

499
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:34,013
If you're uninterested, don't ask.

500
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,172
Going down tomorrow?

501
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:36,533
It's my mom.

502
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:43,733
Not this time.

503
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:45,773
I'll introduce you next time.

504
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:50,693
Why the tantrum?

505
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:51,212
Zhi, hurry.

506
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:00,533
Fasten your seat belts.

507
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,653
Let's go.

508
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:05,573
Let's go.

509
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:26,533
This place is so beautiful.

510
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:28,212
Where to put the bottle?

511
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,092
Can the grill be used if washed?

512
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:33,573
Someone left it here. It's dirty.

513
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:43,853
Are you okay?

514
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:45,452
Yes.

515
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,212
Don't break the camera.

516
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:50,092
Is your camera expensive?

517
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:52,132
It's sturdier than your flesh anyway.

518
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:01,533
Alright.

519
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:02,893
Isn't it enough?

520
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:06,172
Your ears are turning red, bro.

521
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:07,893
It's the cold.

522
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:09,212
No, the cowardice.

523
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:18,136
Here.

524
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:23,608
May I?

525
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:24,693
The two cups are empty.

526
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,092
Lucy, stop adjusting it.

527
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:31,052
The lighting is good.

528
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:31,653
Come on.

529
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:32,292
Take some shots.

530
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:33,973
I'm done adjusting.

531
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,212
I've posed already.

532
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,132
It's fine. Come on.

533
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:38,332
Okay.

534
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:42,252
The lighting is average.

535
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:43,893
But the model is handsome.

536
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,132
The meteors are here!

537
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:48,733
There are meteors.

538
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:49,933
Look at the meteors.

539
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:50,872
Quick, look.

540
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:51,372
Where?

541
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:52,332
There. Did you see?

542
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:53,773
It's true.

543
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:57,653
Meteors. Look.

544
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:00,172
I want to make a wish.

545
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,573
I want to go to the same city as Zhi.

546
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,372
Heavens, bless me.

547
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:07,252
I want to host an art exhibition
and go to

548
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,092
the art academy.

549
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:10,172
What heavens? It's meteors.

550
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:11,252
It's the same.

551
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:13,092
Zhi, make a wish.

552
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:16,332
I want to make a lot of money.

553
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:20,773
Lucy, what is your wish?

554
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:23,292
I hope for

555
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:28,492
world peace.

556
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:31,092
What a grand vision.

557
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:32,252
Go work in space then.

558
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:33,013
Exactly.

559
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,092
Another wave of meteors.

560
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:37,372
Look, there are so many.

561
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:40,613
Quick, take pictures.

562
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,092
Don't use a filter.

563
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:43,773
No filters.

564
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:44,933
A filter makes it better.

565
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,332
Xu Zhi, turn around and look at me.

566
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,448
♪On a midsummer night♪

567
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:03,992
♪The streetlights gradually awaken♪

568
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:10,022
♪The moonlight
penetrates the tree shades♪

It's hard to imagine

583
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:57,332
that every single meteor just now

584
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:59,332
completely disappeared in the universe.

585
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:00,613
How wonderful.

586
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,573
Not a second early or late.

587
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,013
It's the four of us

588
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:05,292
witnessing this moment together.

589
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,212
Did you take
all these pictures just now?

590
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,372
Your spot was good.

591
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,573
Then can you send the photos to me?

592
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:23,372
For Moments posts.

593
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:26,613
Don't you rarely post on Moments?

594
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,013
You saw my Moments?

595
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:32,332
Just browsing, nothing else.

596
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:33,252
I know.

597
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,853
But I have groups.

598
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:36,533
You can't see many things.

599
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:40,172
How about I add you to the right group?

600
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,292
Send me the photos.

601
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:42,700
I'll list you as the photographer.

602
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:45,252
Add me if you want.

603
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,132
Why ask so much?

604
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:48,292
Why are you so mean to her?

605
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:51,492
Was I mean to you?

606
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:56,013
You were a bit mean earlier.

607
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:58,573
Sorry.

608
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:06,973
Yingying,

609
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:08,212
how about we go there

610
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,452
to take photos by the spring?

611
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:11,533
Are you a good photographer?

612
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,172
Of course, I am.

613
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:14,813
Then you guys have fun here.

614
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:15,492
We're leaving.

615
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,120
Have fun.

616
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,664
Let's go.

617
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:17,336
Let's go.

618
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:18,613
Talk well.

619
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:47,292
Come here. I'll show you something.

620
00:30:51,212 --> 00:30:51,813
What is it?

621
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:55,412
There's another one?

622
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:57,973
I thought the meteor shower ended.

623
00:30:58,172 --> 00:30:59,412
Why was there a straggler?

624
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:04,372
But the one you shot

625
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,332
feels better
than what I saw with the naked eye.

626
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:09,172
Of course. Because I shot it.

627
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:14,813
Do you like shooting the starry sky?

628
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:16,492
It's all right.

629
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:17,973
I like photographing people.

630
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,013
I photograph people
of all ages and genders.

631
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:22,936
Don't overthink it.

632
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:23,933
I wasn't.

633
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,132
I'm just a bit curious.

634
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:26,893
Will you learn photography abroad?

635
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:29,973
Why are you so curious?

636
00:31:30,412 --> 00:31:32,292
Because it seems like
you know a lot of things.

637
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,212
But I don't know what you like exactly.

638
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:39,292
Sometimes we don't necessarily get to do

639
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:40,172
what we like.

640
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:43,893
Do you like architecture?

641
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,412
But my dad might not be that supportive.

642
00:31:51,252 --> 00:31:53,172
He thinks architecture
is too tiring for a girl,

643
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:55,573
and it requires
a lot of construction site visits.

644
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,372
My mom studied architecture.

645
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:58,933
The underwater bookstore

646
00:31:59,013 --> 00:31:59,773
is her work.

647
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,933
Your mom designed it?

648
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,693
I want to become an architect like her.

649
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,172
Watching my own designs

650
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,052
turn from drawings into reality

651
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:10,893
must be very fulfilling.

652
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:16,212
If you like it, just do it.

653
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,372
No need to worry so much.

654
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:23,933
Actually, a long time ago,

655
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:25,332
I had already given up the idea

656
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,132
of studying out of town
because of my family.

657
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,773
But what you said to me yesterday

658
00:32:32,092 --> 00:32:33,653
had a deep impact on me.

659
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:36,412
I've been wondering

660
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:38,492
whether I can

661
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:40,052
go to a better school.

662
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:41,933
It was just a suggestion.

663
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:43,733
The choice is yours.

664
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:46,452
Like today. You were waiting
for the starry sky,

665
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,412
while I was waiting
for the autumn breeze.

666
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:53,332
There are also people waiting
for flowers to bloom in the desert.

667
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,092
Everyone has their own choices
and their own scenery.

668
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:02,693
Must it always be scenery?

669
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:05,332
Why the question?

670
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,252
Our future is the scenery.

671
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:13,052
No one else has a say.

672
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:15,013
We decide for ourselves.

673
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,733
If I'm going to study in Beijing,

674
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:32,773
I need to earn more living expenses.

675
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,092
You're resourceful.

676
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:36,653
Do you have any ideas?

677
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:39,332
You can't join my project.

678
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:40,653
What project?

679
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:41,813
Chat companion.

680
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,973
Can I pay five yuan
to check it out first?

681
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:50,613
Dream on.

682
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:52,813
Then I'll pass.

683
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,533
Your project isn't serious.

684
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,212
Do you want to join me
on something else?

685
00:33:58,372 --> 00:33:58,933
Like what?

686
00:33:59,252 --> 00:33:59,853
Like buying

687
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:01,653
some tropical fish

688
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:02,933
to resell by the street.

689
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:05,613
So, you've had a plan.

690
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:06,893
And you want my funding.

691
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,212
I have no choice.

692
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:09,893
I don't have a rich little brother

693
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:11,212
to get started.

694
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,893
You'll need more than that.

695
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,372
You'll need
a rich, silly little brother.

696
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:22,773
Zhi,

697
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:24,132
it's time to go.

698
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:26,252
Where did you two just go?

699
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:27,212
It's a secret.

700
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,412
Let's put the food in the car first.

701
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:42,853
Isn't it dirty?

702
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:44,653
Don't grab anything in your hands.

703
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,052
I used to chew it when I was a kid.

704
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:48,252
Is it an honor?

705
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:50,533
Get some more for breakfast then.

706
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:51,533
Maybe I will.

707
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:53,080
Only if you don't mind.

708
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:55,052
I just saw Zhu Yangqi pee here.

709
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:57,613
That's gross.

710
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,013
Zhi,

711
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:21,653
did Lucy upset you again?

712
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:25,933
I'm impressed, Chen Luzhou.

713
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:27,492
You actually made Zhi angry.

714
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,653
I haven't seen Zhi angry
in all these years.

715
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:30,372
Right, Zhi?

716
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:31,332
Not my fault.

717
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:32,893
You may ask her.

718
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:36,172
Slow down. I'm really going to throw up.

719
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:36,760
Okay.

720
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,372
Let's have Zhu Yangqi
get out of the car.

721
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:40,212
Okay.

722
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:41,172
Wait, what?

723
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:44,212
What does your argument
have to do with me?

724
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,573
Of course,
it has something to do with you.

725
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,412
People have needs.

726
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:56,893
Could you hold it in?

727
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,252
I knew we'd be in the mountain.

728
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:00,212
So I didn't drink water.

729
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:01,693
The girls were there too.

730
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,252
You should be more careful.

731
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:05,492
Okay, you got me.

732
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:08,733
Next time, when I go out with girls,

733
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,533
I won't drink water.

734
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:10,813
Alright?

735
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:12,024
Alright.

736
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:15,412
You can drink now.

737
00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:17,052
Thank you.

738
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:20,212
I can't drink.

739
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:21,492
I don't want that.

740
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:27,613
By the way,

741
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:31,092
you tried so hard to coax Xu Zhi.

742
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:31,896
Will you pursue her?

743
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:33,412
Who told you that?

744
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:35,492
Then why did you coax her?

745
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:37,292
I coax you too when you're mad.

746
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:39,853
I always coax you.

747
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:40,933
Alright, bro?

748
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:44,693
But seriously.

749
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:46,412
Are you sure?

750
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:48,132
You will make a great couple.

751
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:51,372
Really?

752
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:56,573
Alright.

753
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:58,853
When I return from abroad,

754
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:00,412
I'll pursue her if she's unmarried.

755
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,252
What if she gets divorced?

756
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:04,172
Can't you wish well for her?

757
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:07,973
If she gets divorced,

758
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:09,412
I can pursue her.

759
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:12,372
Are you overthinking it a bit?

760
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:13,933
I remember she said

761
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,733
she doesn't have feelings for you.

762
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:19,492
Why are you asking so much?

763
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:21,560
I'll stop.

764
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:22,813
I won't ask anymore.

765
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:42,573
Chen Luzhou.

766
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:53,492
Why do you want to drink?

767
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:54,744
You said you didn't drink.

768
00:37:56,613 --> 00:37:57,933
Can't I get drunk late at night?

769
00:37:58,372 --> 00:37:59,252
Get drunk?

770
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:00,653
With a cocktail?

771
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,172
You're really bad at this.

772
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:05,452
Were you really mad?

773
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:09,013
To be precise, I was disgusted.

774
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:11,132
I'm sorry.

775
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:12,933
The joke went a bit too far.

776
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:13,733
Joke?

777
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,973
Where Zhu Yangqi peed was quite far.

778
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:18,492
You can chew the grass if you want.

779
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:22,693
Chen Luzhou,

780
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:24,813
you are so childish.

781
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:25,893
I'm childish?

782
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,052
Didn't you trick me too?

783
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:32,212
We're even now.

784
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:33,688
Alright.

785
00:38:34,172 --> 00:38:34,933
Then we are even.

786
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:36,056
We don't owe each other.

787
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:39,653
Alright.

788
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:44,813
Hungry?

789
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,008
A little.

790
00:38:46,212 --> 00:38:47,613
What would you like? I'll order it.

791
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:50,332
Then let's

792
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:53,332
offer Master Kang some hot water.

793
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:55,813
What is that?

794
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,212
You're so mischievous.

795
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:05,092
Excuse me.

796
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,773
A bowl of instant noodles.

797
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:10,893
Wait, sir, madam.

798
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,132
An umbrella for you
to avoid getting wet.

799
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:14,773
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

800
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:15,288
Pleasure.

801
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:20,613
How much was the food just now?

802
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:21,533
I'll pay.

803
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:24,013
Then pay

804
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:25,412
for the chatting too.

805
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,773
Let's chat ten more minutes.

806
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:27,973
I'll be the companion now.

807
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:30,653
Forcing a deal, huh?

808
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:31,448
Yes.

809
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:33,452
You've been forced to place an order.

810
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:35,813
I find you really strange.

811
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,813
Must you set all the boundaries?

812
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:39,412
Last time as well.

813
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:40,733
You pretended to have a boyfriend

814
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,893
to treat me to that meal.

815
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:43,693
You don't want to owe me.

816
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:44,376
Is that it?

817
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:48,573
You'll do it to your boyfriend too?

818
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:49,973
Of course.

819
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,013
But you're not my boyfriend.

820
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:53,773
Does that have anything to do with it?

821
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:56,332
Alright.

822
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:59,212
Then let's split. Pay me on WeChat.

823
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:05,172
Done.

824
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:09,813
Good luck with your interview tomorrow.

825
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,372
You can do it.

826
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,424
(Our future is the scenery.)

827
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:49,624
(No one else has a say.)

828
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:54,374
