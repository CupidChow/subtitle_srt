(A Gift for 6-Year-Old Chen Luzhou)

18
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,399
Stewed mutton?

19
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,078
Okay, sure.

20
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,198
Stewed mutton.

21
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,198
Okay.

22
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:53,158
Let me see.

23
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:54,678
Smashed cucumbers.

24
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:56,678
(Happy birthday, Luzhou!)

25
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:57,639
Bean jelly.

26
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,799
(You promised me.)

27
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,238
(If I improve...)

28
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:01,079
A pot of rice.

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,439
(I'll go to Beijing to visit you.)

30
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:05,718
- Then get us
- Lucy.

31
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:06,759
four bottles of Coke.

32
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,759
Coming.

33
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,399
Limited edition hoodie.

34
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,359
How's that? I love you, right?

35
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:15,399
Alright, I will accept it then.

36
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,518
Where's Zhi? Has she arrived?

37
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,439
She will come over soon.

38
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,399
What did you order?

39
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,518
I ordered a snow crab.

40
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,038
Okay. Let me see.

41
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:28,638
Open-air food stall.

42
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:30,960
Celebrating a birthday,

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,598
why choose to eat here?

44
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,118
Why?

45
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:35,919
Why make it so grand?

46
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,879
Don't distract her. Just a birthday.

47
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,479
Alright, you are really considerate.

48
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:46,558
Okay, thank you.

49
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,479
Thanks.

50
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,479
About what I said,

51
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,919
you think about it.

52
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:56,238
What is it?

53
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:57,518
What?

54
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,238
I want him
in the math modeling competition.

55
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,759
But his current state

56
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:03,038
is not that great.

57
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,598
I think being in a relationship
has affected him a bit.

58
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:06,959
Come on.

59
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:09,919
How long does

60
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,399
the passion phase last?

61
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,118
Well...

62
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,479
Three months?

63
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,439
But it depends.

64
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,999
He

65
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,598
might take at least a year or two.

66
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:22,718
That won't do.

67
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,999
What a hopeless romantic.

68
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:25,598
The competition will end then.

69
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,479
Who told you I'm not going?

70
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,399
Y-You'd be the witness that he agreed.

71
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,038
You agreed.

72
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
There you go.

73
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,198
Let's do our best.

74
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,319
In our sophomore year,

75
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,319
these are all credits.

76
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,319
You are all here.

77
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:39,558
Happy birthday.

78
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:40,718
You are here.

79
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:43,238
That's it?

80
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,999
You didn't bring anything
for my birthday?

81
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,638
You told me not to prepare anything.

82
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:50,038
Alright.

83
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:53,238
What did you order?

84
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,319
Here, take a look.

85
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,279
W-We ordered the snow crab.

86
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,118
Don't hide it.

87
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:01,919
In the bag? Take it out.

88
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:03,238
No, really.

89
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,238
Boss, I want a can of cola.

90
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:05,879
Really?

91
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:07,238
Really.

92
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,518
See?

93
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:11,518
Thank you.

94
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,238
Luzhou is acting melodramatic.

95
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,038
What a hopeless romantic.

96
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,678
I told you.

97
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:17,678
Go buy me

98
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,238
a basketball.

99
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:20,999
Get a cheap one.

100
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:22,558
No Spalding.

101
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:25,198
So, if I ask you about this,

102
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,638
you can throw the basketball at me.

103
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,598
See?

104
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,238
Nice.

105
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:40,399
You got it.

106
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,959
You're back.

107
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:54,799
Where's the ball?

108
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,879
I asked the owner
which ball doesn't hurt.

109
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,038
He said only keychains don't hurt.

110
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,759
You get angry so easily.

111
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,839
This one would be safer.

112
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,359
Alright then.

113
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:11,919
This will be my birthday gift.

114
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:15,718
Thank you.

115
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,759
I'll have this one.

116
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,319
It tastes good.
Try it, tender and flavorful.

117
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,799
(Come with me to a place later.)

118
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,718
(I have a gift for you.)

119
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,799
See?

120
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:11,118
It's sour.

121
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:11,879
It's smelly.

122
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,038
It's bitter.

123
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:21,638
Excuse me.

124
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,919
Enough, you eat.

125
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,919
Enough?

126
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,399
The last one.

127
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,038
See. I am good to you.

128
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,679
Every birthday boy

129
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,759
has a birthday cake.

130
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,759
Do I love you?

131
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:38,999
Thank you, my son.

132
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:40,718
You're the boss today. I'll let you go.

133
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,759
Candle?

134
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:47,119
No need.

135
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,799
Don't do that. Let's get right to it.

136
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,118
- Okay.
- Okay.

It's okay.

152
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:39,038
You practice,

153
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,479
and we'll be your audience.

Sorry. I'm not skilled.

159
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,439
I'll give it back to you.

160
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,759
Then you go ahead.

(Someone held hands while eating crabs,)

170
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,559
(while others
got their tongues stabbed.)

171
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,879
(I won't tell who it is.)

172
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,198
(When I get a girlfriend,)

173

(I'll make you pay.)

(Li Ke)
(Who can tell me how long)

175
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,038
(the passion phase lasts?)

176
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,519
(Waiting the answer here.)

177

(Ask Zhi for me)

178

(With mouth, a secret technique.)

180

181
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,679
What?

182
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,839
You'll know.

183

This is the gift you prepared for me?

184
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:23,158
Nice.

185

Thanks.

186
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,318
Take a seat.

187
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:26,478
Why?

188
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,959
Just sit.

189
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:31,398
Alright then.

190
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,438
Then what? More surprise?

191
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,438

257
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,278
will have two weeks after the final exam

258
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:38,278
to go out for sketching.

259
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,919

260

two weeks later than you.

to be during that period.

264
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:49,158
I might not get back.

265
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,238
Then I won't go back either.

00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:53,478

00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:04,599

271
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:06,839
You guys are really close.

272
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,398
You are funny.

273
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:11,839

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,238
except Li Ke.

278
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:24,519

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,479
Hey, you!

283
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,639
Is Li Ke or...

284
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,519

285
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,959

288
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,799

289
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,038

290
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:56,398
Hey, Dad.

291
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,879
What are you doing?

292
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,799
You're still up so late.

293
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,158
I'm doing homework.

294
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,038
A lot of homework lately?

295
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,438
You haven't called me for a long time.

296
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,559
I heard it's snowing in Beijing tonight.

297
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,600
Yes.

298
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,398
I could make a snowman tomorrow.

299
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,799
First winter in Beijing,

300
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,959
you need to keep warm.

301
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,398
Okay, we have heating here.

302
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,278
Don't worry. I won't freeze.

303
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:27,919
Got the thermal pants, right?

304
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,999
Yes.

305
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,839
It made Cai extremely jealous.

306
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:37,639
Half the semester is over,

307
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,559
any desirable boys appeared?

308
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,759
No.

309
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:48,358
I am busy doing homework.

310
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:52,519
Are you still thinking
about Chen Luzhou?

311
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,198
Why would I?

312
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:55,879
We haven't been in touch at all.

313
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,639
Okay.

314
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,919
It's good then.

315
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,559
It's late.

316
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,679
Go to bed after finishing your homework.

317
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,719
Okay, bye-bye.

318
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:11,959
We haven't been in touch at all?

319
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,078
You are such a liar now.

320
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:17,118
I was before too.

321
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:18,720
You are

322
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,238
so good at lying.

323
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:21,639
If you cheat on me,

324
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,519
I wouldn't even know.

325
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,519
Impossible.

326
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,038
If I cheat on you,

327
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,118
I surely won't keep you in the dark.

328
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:31,438
I will bury you in the ground.

329
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,679
How ruthless.

330
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,158
I heard from Zhao Tianqi

331
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,879
Luzhou entered
a math modeling competition.

332
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,398
Usually, only sophomores

333
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:17,078
participate in this competition.

334
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,278
They did it as freshmen.

335
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,278
Impressive.

336
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,358
Not really.

337
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,278
He got 96 in calculus.

338
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:24,278
Xu Zhi scored 100.

339
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
Xu Zhi is a bit more impressive.

340
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,038
Right.

341
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,839
Alright, class begins.

342
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,839
The teacher is here.

343
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,429
(Architectural Design)

344
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,038
Three students have to redo

345
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,238
their design hand-drawings
from last time.

346
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:41,398
I hope I'm not included.

347
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:42,759
These three students are...

348
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,679
Don't say my name.

349
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,759
Xu Yumo,

350
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,038
Ma Yuting,

351
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,919
and Xu Zhi.

352
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,478
What's going on?

353
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,038
There must be a mistake.

354
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:09,839
All our drawings
were under her guidance.

355
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:14,358
These three students,

356
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,398
redraw it

357
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,559
and submit it to me next week.

358
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:21,398
Alright, students.

359
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,639
Turn to page 61 of your textbook.

360
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,358
Today I'll be talking about

361
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,919
architectural structure.

362
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,639
Before it,

363
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,278
I will first talk about

364
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:38,559
the components of architecture.

365
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,319
Are you okay?

366
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,799
And the core principles.

367
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,759
Alright.

368
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,999
That's it for today.

369
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:52,599
Class dismissed.

370
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,959
Thank you, Sir.

371
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,038
What do you want to eat?

372
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,488
Let's go.

373
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:03,599
Let's go.

374
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,078
It seems today

375
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,599
you can't have lunch with us.

376
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:15,999
What do you want to eat?

377
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:18,478
The first canteen got a new malatang.

378
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,438
You go eat by yourself.

379
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,959
I'm not that hungry.

380
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,879
I'm going to the library.

382
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:35,478
Her

383
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,158
design hand-drawing assignment

384
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:38,559
got rejected by Mr. Hu.

385
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,999
And both of our assignments
were under her guidance,

386
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,278
and we both passed.

387
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:44,278
Go check on her.

388
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,559
Thanks.

in there.

425
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:13,719

Professor,

489
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,158
I tried drawing a few more drafts,

490
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:56,038
yet I can't make it right.

491
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:57,478
I would like to ask

492
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,759
what the problem is with my design.

493
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,519
Your drawings are accurate,

494
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,519

495
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:23,158

This assignment

498
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,358
is to construct a small urban park

499
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:30,839

500
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,959
Your work is meticulous enough,

501
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,478
but

502
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,438
lacking a bit of spirit.

503
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:41,198
The spirit

504
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:45,158
refers mainly to the humanistic emotion.

505
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,879

Don't waste your time.

512
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,639
You are not suited to be an architect.

513
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,519
To be honest,

514
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,238
you have no talent in this.

515
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,719

517
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:33,198
Don't you accept it?

518
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,078
Then cry it out.

519
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,959
Look at you.

520
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,799
You can't even cry.

521
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,398
What else can you accomplish?

522
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:00,519
You were such a crybaby

523
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:03,679
back then.

524
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,519
You would cry if you couldn't get candy.

525
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:10,919
When the flowers you grew died,

526
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,038
you would cry too.

527
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:21,038
Think about it.

528
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:24,959

since you last cried out?

530
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,038
if this is what you chose,

531
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:36,478
then go forward.

542
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,679

546
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,398
Do you work out around here?

547
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:56,078
I stopped working out.

548
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,519
Why?

549
00:30:58,438 --> 00:30:59,639
We can go work out together.

550
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,639
Maybe I can even teach you.

551
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,839
No need. It's not appropriate.

552
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,679
Don't be shy.

553
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:07,398
Maybe exchange WeChat contacts?

554
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,599
WeChat...

555
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,919
It's not appropriate.

556
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:11,919
Come on.

557
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,999
Sorry, I'm late.

558
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:19,520
Sorry,

559
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,272
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

560
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:23,039
She is not...

561
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,398
It's okay. Not too late to know now.

562
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:27,759
Then I won't disturb you.

563
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,478
Come on, Zhu.
What are you treating me to?

564
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:41,398
Whatever you like, I am treating.

565
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,599
Whatever I like? Really?

566
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:45,799
Waiter, I'd like to order.

567
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:48,599

- I want this.

568
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,038

569
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,238

00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:53,679
Yes.

571
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,519
Professor Liu
has experience and resources.

572
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,198
And he has led
several championship teams.

573
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,319
For us,

574
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,478
he is the best option.

575
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,999
Wait. You know.

576
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:03,478
There are only a few professors

577
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:04,478
as competition mentors.

578
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,238
Professor Liu is so famous.

579
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:07,559
He must lead a lot of people.

580
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,839
Last time I heard

581
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,158
he is leading over 40 teams.

582
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:11,839
Can he manage so many people?

583
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:13,759
Mr. Bai is different.

584
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,879
He is very responsible
for every student.

585
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,158
Indeed,

586
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,198
but he's not even a full professor.

587
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,599
For us,

588
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,959
there's no real advantage.

589
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,759
Ke, you don't understand.

590
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,438
Listen

591
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,158
more about Mr. Bai.

592
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,158
He is indifferent to fame and fortune,

593
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:31,759
but that doesn't mean
he's less capable than others.

594
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,959
Luzhou.

595
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:35,879
Luzhou.

596
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,559
Luzhou.

597
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:41,398
Tell us who you choose.

598
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:42,519
What?

599
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,759
Our mentor.

600
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,278
Between Liu Ming and Bai Jiang,

601
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:46,959
choose one.

602
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,038
(Chen Luzhou, can you make me cry?)

603
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:55,639
(I had a nightmare.)

604
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,839
(Want to cry, but can't.)

605
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:58,839
(Where are you?)

606
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,839
(Downstairs of your dorm.)

607
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:03,959
I'm going out.

608
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:04,959
Where are you going?

609
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,038
Xu Zhi had a nightmare.

610
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:09,038
I'll go comfort her.

611
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:11,639
Take a coat.

612
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,759
He...

613
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,759
I-It's okay.

614
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,158
Except spoiling his girlfriend,

615
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:19,158
he's fine.

616
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,719
Quite nice.

617
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,078
A good boyfriend.

618
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:25,559
I need to learn from him.

619
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,278
What? You bachelor.

620
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,679
Who's the bachelor?

621
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:31,839
You...

622
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:33,398
You are not a bachelor?

623
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,559
I have a girlfriend.

624
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,719
Just after high school.

625
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:37,478
She's at Qingyi University.

626
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,318
What? You didn't ask me.

627
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:49,519
Fine.

628
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:52,919
So I'm the only bachelor here?

629
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,438
I think so.

630
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,198
I dreamed of my mom again.

631
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:28,358
She said
I'm not suited for architecture.

632
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:32,278
She told me that I have no talent,
and couldn't even cry.

633
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,559
Dreams are all opposite. Don't mind it.

634
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,559
But Professor Hu said the same thing.

635
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,639
He said my designs are accurate,

636
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,519
but lacking a bit of spirit.

637
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,919
I can probably understand
why he said that.

638
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:52,999
I've known you for so long,

639
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,438
yet you have never been angry.

640
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,519
Even when we argued,

641
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,038
you left without saying anything.

642
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:02,078
What does this
have to do with my design?

643
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,398
I thought that a designer's inspiration

644
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:09,559
comes from capturing
and conveying emotions.

645
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:12,198
At this time,

646
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:13,199
sentimental people

647
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,679
have an advantage,

648
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,438
which is the spirit.

649
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:19,438
But you seem to be accustomed to

650
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:20,839
suppressing your emotions.

651
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:27,398
Maybe it has something
to do with my mom.

652
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:30,559
My mom is
a particularly excellent architect.

653
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,839
She is very strong-willed,

654
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:33,038
and domineering at home.

655
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:34,759
She treated me harshly,

656
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,358
but was soft-hearted to others.

657
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,038
Later, she died,

658
00:35:38,198 --> 00:35:39,639
leaving a big mess behind

659
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,198
for my dad and I.

660
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:43,919
You probably can't imagine that.

661
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:46,719
Someone once brought a child
to my dad for upbringing.

662
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:49,839
She said after my mom died,

663
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:51,719
all engineering projects have stopped.

664
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:53,639
Nobody's paying them wages.

665
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:55,519
There's no money for baby formula.

666
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,198
Before my mom died,

667
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,438
she thought they were pitiful

668
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,959
and helped them a few times.

669
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:02,719
At that time, I felt

670
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,759
that emotions
are the most useless things.

671
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:06,398
Without emotions,

672
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,478
there's no empathy

673
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,559
or troubles.

674
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,679
No wonder when Tan Xu failed the exam,

675
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,679
you would say that.

676
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,919
But do you realize

677
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:22,278
that you don't get to the point
many times?

678
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:23,959
Is that so?

679
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:26,038
It hurts others more.

680
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,278
So stop

681
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,438
suppressing your emotions anymore,

682
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,839
even making the people around you
do the same.

683
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:35,238
Over time,

684
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:36,438
your perception

685
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:39,118
and empathy will weaken.

686
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:41,238
Is that so?

687
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,599
Anyway,

688
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,118
Zhi,

689
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,358
it's good you want to cry.

690
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:49,839
Just let your emotions out.

691
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:51,438
Don't hold them in.

692
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:56,679
Then help me out.

693
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,198
Okay. Any method?

694
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,679
Then I'll do it.

695
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,038
What? No way.

696
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:05,960
I'll beat you to tears.

697
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,238
Doesn't it count?

698
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,639
Just don't complain about it.

699
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:15,238
Okay?

700
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:16,919
Do you think it's okay?

701
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:18,759
I'd rather beat you up.

702
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,919
What are you doing?

703
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,438
Okay. It's fine.

704
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,919
Give me a hug.

705
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:30,799
Come on.

706
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,879
Let's go.

707
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:48,919
I'm energetic now.

708
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:51,159
I can beat you now.

709
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,919
It's an honor to make you energetic.

710
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,919
Seriously?

711
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,278
I'm the one being harassed.

712
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,328
What's wrong with you?

713
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:04,398
It's all your fault

714
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:05,759
for dressing too flamboyantly,

715
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:06,720
not decent at all.

716
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,078
Or you can't be that attractive.

717
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,198
You troublemaker.

718
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:12,559
Isn't this normal attire?

719
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:19,158
Well...

720
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,959
You quite minded pretending

721
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,358
to be a couple with me.

722
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,799
Why...?

723
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,038
I saw you were in embarrassment,

724
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:29,118
so I helped you out.

725
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:30,118
Don't overthink it.

726
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,560
Did I

727
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,038
ruin your plans?

728
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,078
You can't resist pretty girls.

729
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:40,599
What?

730
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,358
Next time. I'll just tell her directly

731
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:44,478
that...

732
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:45,478
What?

733
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:47,719
I already have a crush.

734
00:38:51,438 --> 00:38:52,799
At the gate of your school,

735
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,759
I saw the promotion
of freshman art exhibition.

736
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:55,759
Will you participate?

737
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:00,038
What for?

738
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,519
I'm already at the next level.

739
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,118
I would only participate in

740
00:39:04,118 --> 00:39:05,158
the school art exhibition.

741
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:07,959
I'll come to support you then.

742
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,559
No need.

743
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:11,398
It's troublesome for you to come.

744
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:13,358
It's okay. I can take a day off.

745
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,118
Wait...

746
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:27,278
Let's stop here.

747
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:28,999
Go to bed early.

748
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,999
Goodnight.

749
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:31,398
By the way,

750
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:33,559
when are you free next week?

751
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,559
What's wrong?

752
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:36,198
You forgot it?

753
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:38,959
You asked me to make you cry.

754
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,599
Go to bed early.

755
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:33,358
Shy Boy Chen, what's wrong with you?

756
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,839
Why are you crying?

757
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:41,118
I only brought one pack of tissues.

758
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:42,118
If you use it up,

759
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,679
there's no more for you.

760
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:45,398
Stop crying.

761
00:41:50,038 --> 00:41:52,478
Fake. It's all acting.

762
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,278
Xu Zhi, you really don't know
how to comfort me.

763
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,358
We all know the film is fake,

764
00:42:05,038 --> 00:42:06,599
but we all believe

765
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,719
Mr. Ba's love is real, right?

766
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:10,799
Yes. I'm sorry.

767
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:16,719
Use a new one.

768
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:19,919
Before,

769
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,999
Zhu Yangqi recommended this film
to me many times,

770
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,639
saying he and Feng Jin tear up
every single time.

771
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,839
So I didn't dare to watch it.

772
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,759
He even kept a dog because of this film,

773
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,720
and named it Mr. Qi.

774
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,198
But he got beaten by his dad.

775
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:36,318
Because his great-grandfather
has the same name.

776
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:47,896
(Film Review)
(It is based on a true story.)

777
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,318
Shy Boy Chen.

778
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:52,999
I was wrong.

779
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:55,438
This is based on a true story.

780
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:12,238
If you keep crying, the staff will see

781
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:14,358
and think I did something to you.

782
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:47,544
(The essence of youth)

783
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,880
(lies in their inspiring initiative.)

784
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:51,864
(It's better to take action
than just talk.)

785
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:57,464
(Do it once you think of it.
No matter how difficult, never give up.)
