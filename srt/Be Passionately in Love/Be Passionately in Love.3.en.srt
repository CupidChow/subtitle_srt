(Lucy Met A Tough Challenge!)

18
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,074
So,

19
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,154
for you,

20
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:53,435
what makes Xu Zhi
different from other girls

21
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:56,634
is that she has a boyfriend.

22
00:01:58,594 --> 00:01:59,275
So?

23
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:00,315
So,

24
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,114
it's not her you can't resist,

25
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:04,435
but

26
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:07,435
this kind of

27
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:09,634
thrill,

28
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:10,714
a forbidden

29
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,435
and unspeakable

30
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,475
taboo feeling.

31
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:18,136
Got it?

32
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:21,554
Chen Luzhou, you're crazy.

33
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:22,395
Get it treated.

34
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,395
You're the one who's crazy.

35
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,435
Do you have to be so competitive?

36
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,194
Even got up early to have breakfast.

37
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,554
Lovely weather today!

38
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,915
Shall we hang out later?

39
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,395
Fine.

40
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,275
Can we not bring Chen Xingqi?

41
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,216
As you say.

42
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:09,514
That's fine.

43
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,554
(Where are you?)

44
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:21,714
(We need to talk.)

45
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:22,795
(See you at the diner.)

46
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:29,955
Xu Zhi?

47
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:33,594
I must warn you.

48
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:34,915
Be careful of traps.

49
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:43,435
Oh, Chen Luzhou,

50
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,074
you're hopeless.

51
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:50,424
Morning.

52
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:51,995
Good morning.

53
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,074
Morning, morning.

54
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:56,755
Morning, Mr. Fu.

55
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:58,072
Morning.

56
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,395
How is it? Is the breakfast good?

57
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:04,315
It's okay.

58
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:06,154
Even if not, it's just so.

59
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:10,955
I heard

60
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:12,594
you've done commercials.

61
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:14,904
Yes.

62
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:17,154
Do one for me.

63
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:22,875
Touch up his makeup.

64
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,034
Alright, Luzhou,

65
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:30,755
let's do it again.

66
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:31,674
Take it easy.

67
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,915
Don't be nervous.

68
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,554
Yes, smile just like that.

69
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:36,594
Look at me and smile.

70
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:38,634
That's right.

71
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,714
Not bad, it's very good.

72
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:42,514
Up to here.

73
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,154
Don't be nervous, Luzhou.

74
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:45,554
Yes, look at me.

75
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:47,795
Good, come on, give me a smile.

76
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:50,594
Very good, keep it up.

77
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:51,875
Boy,

78
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,514
are you here to film a commercial?

79
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:54,714
You are so cute.

80
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:56,915
Such a cute little boy.

81
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:58,114
Give me a kiss.

82
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,034
You are too cute.

83
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:03,915
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, little boy.

84
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,154
No.

85
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:12,154
Why?

86
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,034
I'll pay you.

87
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:15,634
Three thousand.

88
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:16,714
It's not about money.

89
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:17,880
You...

90
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:21,955
Zhi said,

91
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:23,194
you need money.

92
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:24,355
Isn't this an opportunity?

93
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:26,154
Besides, you are suitable.

94
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:31,875
I do want to make money,

95
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:33,955
but I'm not yet
at the point of selling my looks

96
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:34,875
to make money.

97
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,475
You're overthinking it.

98
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,074
Mr. Fu just wants you

99
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,755
to film a tea garden commercial

100
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,514
with your photography equipment.

101
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:51,875
Alright.

102
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:53,915
It's a deal.

103
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:55,634
Bring your equipment

104
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:56,795
to the garden.

105
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:04,634
Take care, Mr. Fu.

106
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,755
Why did you take this gig?

107
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:11,755
Didn't we agree on it?

108
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,435
If I find a way to make money,

109
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:14,275
I'd take you.

110
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,355
I keep my word.

111
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:19,194
I remind you.

112
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:21,594
Mr. Fu's money isn't that easy to earn.

113
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:22,808
Keep it up!

114
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,472
I'm leaving.

115
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,634
(Cast a long line to catch a big fish!)

116
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:28,154
Bye-bye.

117
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:29,154
Bye-bye.

118
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:35,714

Give a bottle to Mr. Chen later.

132
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:13,544
Mr. Fu,

133
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,745
I am both a model and a gofer.

134
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,984
Even the bee can't work like this.

135
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,384
Do you know how they work?

136
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,062
Help me.

137
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:25,024
Come on.

138
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,905
Calling you two over to be models

139
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:30,344
wasn't my idea.

140
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:32,184
He suggested it?

141
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,264
He doesn't want to hinder
tea farmers' progress.

142
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:38,745
So he called you two over.

143
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:41,905
Well,

144
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,184
I, the boss, am right here.

145
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:46,465
I can give these workers a day off

146
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:47,304
to film.

147
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,064
But he insists not to.

148
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,505
He just hides in a little corner,

149
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,344
not interfering with their work.

150
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:54,825
That's interesting.

151
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:57,625
Completely unlike his brother.

152
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:07,545
Quite unusual.

153
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:08,545
That's right.

154
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:10,585
Quite unusually bad.

155
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,465
The lines

156
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,545
are all messed up.

157
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,785
The lack of basic skills
is completely exposed.

158
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,705
Even worse than my work
in primary school.

159
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:21,785
I think your appreciation level
is lacking.

160
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:22,825
Kids,

161
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:25,144
come on, look over here.

162
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:27,024
This is the new work

163
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,825
(Monkey King)
of our great artist, Mr. Chen.

164
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:31,104
Everyone, take a look.

165
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:33,344
Take it as a warning.

166
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,545
Return it to me.

167
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,024
If you say one more word,

168
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,384
I'll fire you.

169
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:40,865
You fire me?

170
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:42,945
I'm saying this for your own good, okay?

171
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,505
Better than you

172
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,224
not getting into college.

173
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,144
You're cursing me?

174
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:50,064
I'm going to tell my brother.

175
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,384
Telling him is useless.

176
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:54,545
He will only say things
that sound worse than I do.

177
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:56,865
Looks really good.

178
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:57,945
Zhi, look.

179
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,625
I've looked at this face
for so many years,

180
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,144
I should get used to it.

181
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:05,945
How annoying!

182
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,625
I'm still amazed by you.

183
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:09,505
But I have to say,

184
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:11,545
Mr. Chen is really biased.

185
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,224
So many close-ups of Zhi,

186
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:14,984
yet not a single direct shot of me.

187
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:17,062
No,

188
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:18,384
take a few more shots of me.

189
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,224
Well,

190
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:21,585
take a picture of me there.

191
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:22,785
Right here?

192
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,545
But the background...

193
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:25,384
It's okay.

194
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,505
I won't draw anymore, okay?

195
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,984
Fine, don't draw anymore.

196
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:31,526
Wait...

197
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:34,344
Are you okay?

198
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,424
Who is there?

199
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:38,705
Chen Xingqi, put it down.

200
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:39,545
Move aside.

201
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:40,070
Put it down.

202
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:41,104
Put it down.

203
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:41,625
Move aside.

204
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,825
Put it down!

205
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,465
Monkey King.

206
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:53,465
Who is the Monkey King?

207
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:57,785
Apologize.

208
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,465
Why should I apologize?

209
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:04,184
He bullied me first.

210
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,705
How come you accuse me?

211
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,024
I didn't force you to throw it.

212
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:09,705
Apologize, Chen Xingqi.

213
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,024
Why are you siding with outsiders?

214
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,384
I'm your brother.

215
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:15,224
Why help others bully me?

216
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:16,505
You won't apologize?

217
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:19,264
Fine, I'll apologize for you.

218
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,264
Pack your things and go home.

219
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,384
You just want to drive me away.

220
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:25,104
I get it.

221
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:26,865
You're just a bully.

222
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:28,825
You hate me

223
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:30,865
and want me gone.

224
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:36,465
Hey, Troublemaker,

225
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:37,785
why are you crying again?

226
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,184
You're making it seem like we all

227
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,184
picked on you.

228
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,424
Clearly you threw things first.

229
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:44,984
And it almost hit her.

230
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,064
Mr. Fu will settle the score with you.

231
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:48,625
No, he won't.

232
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,304
Mr. Fu said
he can understand quite well.

233
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:53,785
He said that?

234
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,984
In his own words, he said

235
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,024
if this were his,

236
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,705
he'd throw it too.

237
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:02,424
Great!

238
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:03,814
Great!

239
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:05,585
Too great!

240
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:06,705
Okay.

241
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:09,905
Just you wait.

242
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:10,598
Hey.

243
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:11,465
Chen Xingqi.

244
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,024
Forget it, no need to apologize.

245
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:18,825
Just remember to slim me down a bit.

246
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:20,825
Come on, let's go.

247
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:21,825
It's too hot.

248
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:30,865
I think this Xu Zhi

249
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:31,825
is quite okay.

250
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:34,705
If she becomes your girlfriend,

251
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:37,144
she could keep Chen Xingqi in check.

252
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:39,945
I think you are crazy.

253
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:41,705
Where are you going?

254
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,264
Coax my boss,
or else later he'll complain to my mom.

255
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:44,902
Wait for me!

256
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:49,984
It feels good!

257
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:52,064
As satisfying as handling a bratty kid.

258
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,745
Actually, I didn't intend to say it.

259
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:57,304
You know,

260
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:58,545
Mr. Fu's words

261
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,865
also have considerable impact.

262
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:01,264
But...

263
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,545
But you don't want
to embarrass Chen Luzhou,

264
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:05,505
so you showed your trump card.

265
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,224
Sort of.

266
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,424
Actually, I think your guess is correct.

267
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,945
Chen Luzhou might have been adopted.

268
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,264
His brother

269
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,264
is so arrogant.

270
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:17,585
They don't look like family.

271
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:22,745
Feeling sorry?

272
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,024
I was just thinking

273
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,144
if that's really the case,

274
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,264
what kind of person is his mother?

275
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:34,224
Don't overthink it.

276
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,745
You'll know once you meet.

277
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:36,585
Zhi,

278
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:38,224
considering you

279
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,625
helped me out,

280
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:40,785
I'll treat you to a spa.

281
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:42,024
No need.

282
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:45,064
I just want to lie down on my bed
and rest now.

283
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:47,785
I'll just enjoy it on my own.

284
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,865
Don't regret it later.

285
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:50,825
Go ahead.

286
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:54,984
You're really leaving?

287
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:01,785
He wears your clothes.

288
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,064
Because he admires you.

289
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:05,144
You know,

290
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,705
every time he invites classmates over,

291
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:09,665
he always takes them to your room

292
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,344
to see your trophies.

293
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,505
Really? He admires me?

294
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:15,585
Why did he discard my gifts?

295
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:19,705
So you dampen his confidence,
is that it?

296
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:22,304
That was just an objective assessment.

297
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:24,545
If he can't even take that,

298
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:26,024
how will he face the adult world?

299
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,264
Chen Xingqi isn't as smart as you.

300
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:30,905
He can't achieve everything he wants.

301
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,384
He grew up in your shadow.

302
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:35,945
So he needs more protection.

303
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:37,424
So?

304
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,264
Weakness means right?

305
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:40,705
Chen Luzhou,

306
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:42,465
could you be reasonable?

307
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:44,545
I'm very busy with work.

308
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:45,304
I don't have time

309
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,984
for the grudges between you three men.

310
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:48,224
Fine,

311
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,344
please endure it for two more months.

312
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,104
After I go abroad,

313
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:52,505
I won't be an eyesore to you.

314
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,625
How long do you plan to eavesdrop?

315
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:23,984
You love hearing people being scolded.

316
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,545
I didn't mean to.

317
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:30,224

Actually, I quite envy you.

330
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:28,505
Envy me for what?

331
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:30,505
Getting scolded?

332
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:34,825
You have Stockholm syndrome?

333
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:41,705
My mom used to be like that too.

334
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,944
She never spoke nicely,

335
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,064
always with sarcasm.

336
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,625
She also loved to nag.

337
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:50,825
A bit bossy.

338
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:56,825
But later I realized,

339
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:00,024
she always tries her hardest

340
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:01,505
to express her concern.

341
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:04,865
But when she tries to speak,

342
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,224
it comes out wrong.

343
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,705
But it doesn't mean she doesn't love me.

344
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:18,505
You're right,

345
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,545
but some people become family because

346
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,505
it's a mutual exchange of needs
from the start.

347
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,264
Why are you sighing?

348
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:32,264
And not eating well?

349
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:33,585
What's wrong?

350
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,304
Grandma said,

351
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:37,865
you took me from the orphanage

352
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,865
just to avert disaster for my brother.

353
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:44,064
Is it true?

354
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:51,425
True or not, it doesn't matter.

355
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,625
Chen Luzhou,

356
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,745
do you want to stay with me forever?

357
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:57,384
Then in this family,

358
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,104
you must listen to Grandma and Dad.

359
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:01,384
Got it?

360
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,425
All exchanges are conditional.

361
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:18,625
As long as you disappoint them,

362
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,224
you will be discarded.

363
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,465
Thank you both
for taking care of Luzhou.

364
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:26,505
No trouble.

365
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,984
Mr. Chen, I truly envy you.

366
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,184
Once Luzhou graduates,

367
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:31,465
you'll have a successor.

368
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,745
Not like my kid,

369
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:34,665
he falls short.

370
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:36,705
If he didn't make trouble,

371
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:37,905
I'd be thankful for that.

372
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:40,224
I'm not sure if I'll return.

373
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:44,785
I know nothing about management.

374
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:46,745
I won't come back

375
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:48,825
to cause trouble for my dad.

376
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:54,865
I'll go to the restroom.

377
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:56,024
You guys eat.

378
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:56,825
Are you okay?

379
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,184
You guys eat first.

380
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:01,865
Look at you.

381
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,064
What do you mean
you'll cause me trouble?

382
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:16,545
Chen Luzhou,

383
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:19,825
what's with your sarcastic tone?

384
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:22,064
Do you know?

385
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:25,024
Studying abroad is something
many people can't even dream of.

386
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:26,425
Remember,

387
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,745
it's all your luck that you can live

388
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:29,705
such a life today.

389
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,465
Stop talking.

390
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:35,625
Yes.

391
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:37,785
I'm lucky.

392
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:40,625
Thank you.

393
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:42,465
And I thank my mom.

394
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,104
Of course, I need to thank Chen Xingqi.

395
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,064
Without him, there wouldn't be me.

396
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:53,304
You two,

397
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,545
say less.

398
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:00,144
Since you know better than anyone else,

399
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:06,944
you should know

400
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:09,425
what to do

401
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,745
and what not to do.

402
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,264
Alright, go back and sit down.

403
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,944
Worried I won't repay your kindness?

404
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:19,944
I can write you a guarantee.

405
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:24,984
You've raised me.

406
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,344
Don't worry,

407
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,304
whether I'm abroad or not,

408
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,224
I'll care for you in your old age.

409
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:42,304
Dad, this time
you didn't perform well, right?

410
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,144
Before leaving,

411
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:57,705
what did I tell you?

412
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,905
Keep quiet while riding with you,

413
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:04,545
and don't disturb the clients.

414
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:05,465
That's right.

415
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:06,984
It's okay, boy.

416
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:08,625
Go play.

417
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:10,505
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,465
I promise not to bother you anymore.

419
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:17,224
Please don't give my dad
a bad review, okay?

420
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:17,785
I won't.

421
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:19,425
I'll give your dad five stars.

422
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:21,224
Thank you.

423
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:24,825
I'm sorry.

424
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,224
It's okay.

425
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:29,984
You brat,

426
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,264
be quiet.

427
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,064
Being loved unconditionally

428
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,465
requires luck.

429
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:55,006
Let's go,

430
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:56,184
follow me.

431
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:15,465
Hurry up.

432
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,505
I'll introduce you to my old friend.

433
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,425
Is this yours?

434
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:29,886
Yes.

435
00:22:33,064 --> 00:22:33,745
Put it on.

436
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:39,944
You test boundaries of the law,

437
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:40,705
why involve me too?

438
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:43,425
I am a certified professional.

439
00:22:58,465 --> 00:22:59,184
Sit tight.

440
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:08,132
♪Listen to the cicadas in the midsummer♪

441
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:18,776
♪The reflection in your eyes,
a brilliant scenery♪

442
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:23,896
♪Moonlight spills over
the endless clear sky♪

443
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:33,359
♪The roar of the heartbeat
leaves a trace behind♪

444
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:40,474
♪Crush, when night meets dawn♪

445
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,954
♪Crush, rushing to you in the crowd♪

446
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,937
Are you feeling better now?

447
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:05,697
Wait a moment.

448
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:18,536
Here.

449
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:20,862
This...

450
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,097
Now you have what I have.

451
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,496
Luck.

452
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,097
Being loved unconditionally

453
00:24:36,697 --> 00:24:37,496
requires luck.

454
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:47,136
Forget it.

455
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,376
Let's talk at the bar later.

456
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:51,376
What?

457
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:53,777
I thought

458
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:54,817
you don't drink?

459
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:56,937
Actually,

460
00:24:58,017 --> 00:24:59,216
it's hard to talk about it

461
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,256
without a bit of alcohol.

462
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,136
(Is she...)

463
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,937
(Is she going to confess to me?)

464
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:02,897
No thanks.

465
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,657
Just drink.

466
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:06,657
Without drinking a bit,

467
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:07,496
I can't continue.

468
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:09,456
I'm afraid you won't listen.

469
00:26:16,336 --> 00:26:17,136
A cup of lemon tea.

470
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:24,416
I know what you want to say.

471
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:26,216
You know?

472
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:29,977
I can somewhat guess.

473
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:31,817
Do I still need to say it then?

474
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:36,376
Alright, let's talk
when Yingying arrives.

475
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:36,894
Xu Zhi.

476
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,416
Xu Zhi, I'm here.

477
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,006
She's here.

478
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,097
I'm here.

479
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,496
Waiter, a pot of water.

480
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,496
He insisted on joining in the fun.

481
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:50,897
Why is the vibe so strange?

482
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:52,017
She'll confess to you?

483
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:54,216
I'll say it.

484
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,182
Wait.

485
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:09,097
My shoelace is loose.

486
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:11,697
I actually just want to meet your mom.

487
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:12,857
No matter how.

488
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:26,136
Now I've added you.
When can I visit your house?

489
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:28,376
Is your mom home?

490
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,136
Next time your mom comes,

491
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:31,617
remember to save me a seat.

492
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:33,977
Does your mom usually
come to cook for you?

493
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:35,416
You want a free meal?

494
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:36,336
Is it okay?

495
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:45,617
What does "no matter how" mean?

496
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,136
It means

497
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:50,176
if you want Xu Zhi
to be your girlfriend,

498
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,176
only then will she see your mom,

499
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,017
she would agree.

500
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:04,057
Do you think I like you?

501
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:04,937
No,

502
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,216
I'm definitely not that narcissistic.

503
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:09,496
Moreover, I have no other intentions.

504
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:11,376
I added you on WeChat,

505
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,977
also hoping to meet your mom.

506
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:15,176
That's all.

507
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,256
I didn't disturb you on WeChat.

508
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:28,456
Take a look.
I haven't opened your Moments.

509
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:35,216
Chen Luzhou, it's an "L".

510
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:37,456
Thanks.

511
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,590
(Chen Ruzhou)

512
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:39,660
(Data Settings)

513
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,446
(Set Tags)

514
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:43,657
(Don't lose it, stay calm.)

515
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:45,737
(This might be)

516
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,536
(an advanced flirting trick.)

517
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:49,230
(Chen Luzhou)

518
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,296
Why did you break up with your ex?

519
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:55,897
What ex?

520
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,697
(Don't make grand excuses for yourself.)

521
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:00,456
(Do you dare say you have)

522
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,737
(no interest in me?)

523
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,897
Right, why did you break up with him?

524
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,017
My bad, my bad.

525
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:08,937
Let me explain.

526
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,296
Xu Zhi doesn't have a boyfriend.

527
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:18,496
We were just afraid
you wouldn't hang out with us,

528
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,416
so we lied to you.

529
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:24,766
Alright.

530
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:25,617
You lied to me?

531
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:26,576
No sound.

532
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,176
So what if she lied to you?

533
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,057
Alright.

534
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:29,977
Let go.

535
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,017
Why...

536
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:32,897
Why don't you hear about my mom?

537
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:33,977
Alright.

538
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,536
Sorry, sorry everyone.

539
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:36,176
Please.

540
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:36,977
Or you'd think

541
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,216
Xu Zhi liked you.

542
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:39,134
Right?

543
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:39,742
You guys chat.

544
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,857
What are you doing?

545
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:42,536
You guys chat.

546
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:44,256
Yingying drank too much.

547
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:45,296
Don't listen to her.

548
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:50,336
So, your mom.

549
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:53,097
What about her?

550
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,697
You were going to talk about her?

551
00:30:01,657 --> 00:30:03,176
I also find it incredible.

552
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:05,057
Their voices and tones

553
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:06,057
are exactly the same.

554
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:07,937
If you don't mind,

555
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:09,057
can you take me to your mom?

556
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:10,256
Just once.

557
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,456
As my girlfriend?

558
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,136
As long as you don't mind.

559
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,456
We two pretend to be a couple then.

560
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:28,990
Right?

561
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:30,536
Why should I?

562
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:33,296
Pretend to be in love.

563
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:34,536
I don't want to.

564
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,216
I don't want to date either.

565
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:40,857
Xu Zhi,

566
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,697
I don't want to play with him.

567
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:43,817
Take care.

568
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:47,057
What's wrong?

569
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,376
Is this alcohol allergy?

570
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:50,256
Let me take a look.

571
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:51,296
It hurts.

572
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:51,870
Where?

573
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:54,496
Heart pain.

574
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:56,057
Any heart condition?

575
00:30:56,496 --> 00:30:57,017
No.

576
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:00,617
It's time for my depression.

577
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:04,857
Sorry.

578
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,336
She drank too much.

579
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:07,296
We should go.

580
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:08,536
Why now?

581
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,817
It's time to take medicine.

582
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,777
What medicine? Is it tasty?

583
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:12,496
- You guess.
- Bye.

584
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:19,977
Lucy.

585
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:21,536
After we left,

586
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:22,737
what did you talk about?

587
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:41,336
Stop it.

588
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:44,536
So, you know,

589
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:47,657
one cannot be too stuck
in habitual thinking.

590
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,977
You see, although since childhood,

591
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:52,336
so many girls
have shown interest in you,

592
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:54,536
not all girls

593
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:55,977
will be moved by you, right?

594
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,097
Lucy, Lucy.

595
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:00,817
This time, you've met a tough one.

596
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:01,937
And

597
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,857
you can't even refuse her.

598
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,657
The air is cleared.

599
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:14,057
Do you still have

600
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,456
that tingly feeling

601
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:16,937
that you can't refuse?

602
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,817
Zhu Yangqi, if you don't shower now,

603
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,176
there will be no hot water.

604
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:25,278
Alright,

605
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:26,216
I'll go.

606
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:40,576
Are you crazy? Stop it.

607
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:46,991
(Yuechang Cola)

608
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,496
(Qiqi: I'm from class 9.)

609
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:55,897
(Can I add you?)

610
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:05,455
(Xu Zhi, Nickname:
Gardenia Doesn't Want to Bloom.)

611
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,017
(I didn't disturb you)

612
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,136
(on WeChat.)

613
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,017
(I haven't opened your Moments.)

614
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:16,857
(Well, speak for yourself. I'm not you.)

615
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:25,534
(Xu Zhi's Moments)

616
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:31,057
(Xu Zhi: Hello.)

617
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:40,880
(Xu Zhi: Hello.)

618
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:46,456
(Anything else?)

619
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,977
(Actually, I was lying to you just now.)

620
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,137
(Chat Screenshot)

621
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:00,576
(Yingying said
she left her bag at the bar.)

622
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,296
(She asked if you guys saw it.)

623
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:03,336
(But now it's found.)

624
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:14,657
What was I expecting?

625
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,366
(Rushi Qingzuo)

626
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:28,136
What is this?

627
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:28,857
Watch it.

628
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:32,697
It's fine, keep drawing.

629
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:34,897
That's pretty good.

630
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:39,256
Relax a bit, everyone, relax a bit.

631
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:39,897
Don't be tense.

632
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:47,536
Mosquitoes.

633
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:48,857
Sorry.

634
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:50,416
Go on.

635
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:51,737
It's just a mosquito.

636
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:53,057
Keep drawing, keep drawing.

637
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,097
Is the model you hired okay?

638
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:56,376
Where are mosquitoes?

639
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:57,857
Why haven't I been bitten?

640
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:02,536
What is this?

641
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,176
A mosquito.

642
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:05,897
So disgusting.

643
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:07,777
Kids,

644
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:08,937
do you see it?

645
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:10,737
That's what outdoor sketching is like.

646
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:11,416
Sometimes,

647
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,136
there are bugs and mosquitoes
everywhere.

648
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:14,937
As great artists,

649
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:16,097
we'd learn to overcome it,

650
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:17,216
got it?

651
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,857
Miss, go on.

652
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:21,216
This stroke of yours.

653
00:35:23,637 --> 00:35:25,086
(Zhai Xiao)

654
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:29,496
It's okay. Just a call.

655
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,296
Keep drawing. Come on.

656
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,376
I should take it.

657
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:43,697
Sorry.

658
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:44,456
Keep drawing.

659
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:49,376
Yingying, you...

660
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,897
Sir,

661
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:51,576
the model has left.

662
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:53,017
What do we draw?

663
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:53,817
She's gone.

664
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,697
Are you sure?

665
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:57,336
Draw what?

666
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,937
(Spring harvests tender tips.)

667
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:00,416
(Summer stores essence.)

668
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:01,977
(Autumn conceals richness.)

669
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:03,456
(And winter refines aroma.)

670
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:05,416
(The cycle of four seasons,)

671
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:06,296
(here,)

672
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:07,617
(every brew of tea)

673
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,256
(is the whisper of time,)

674
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:10,657
(the breath of mountains)

675
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:13,576
(and the perfect fusion
of craftsmanship and nature.)

676
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,336
(Fu Yu Tea Garden)

677
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:16,977
(invites you to enjoy)

678
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:18,296
(the gift from the earth.)

679
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:21,737
(Let the soul dance leisurely
in the aroma of tea.)

680
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:22,416
It's okay.

681
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:25,496
Maybe you can handle the editing.

682
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,336
Let me check.

683
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:28,737
Today is Wednesday.

684
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,456
Can I submit work next week?

685
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:37,857
Wait.

686
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:40,376
Tea here.

687
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,174
New tea.

688
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,136
Try it.

689
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:03,017
Tastes good, right?

690
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,057
Not bad. I don't know much about tea.

691
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,176
It refines our temperament.

692
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,937
I used to be really impatient.

693
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:15,256
I calmed down thanks to drinking tea.

694
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,376
Who is older, you or Xu Zhi?

695
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:23,657
We should be of the same age, right?

696
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:26,017
Which month were you born?

697
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:27,296
November.

698
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,057
She is July.

699
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:32,737
You should call her "sister".

700
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:42,017
You should be filling out
your college applications, right?

701
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:43,977
What major, photography?

702
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:45,576
It's just a hobby.

703
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:47,897
I plan to go abroad.

704
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:50,496
Why do all want to go abroad?

705
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:54,057
I'm telling you,
I've been to several countries.

706
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:55,977
I really think

707
00:37:56,136 --> 00:37:57,817
the domestic environment is quite good.

708
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,576
Going abroad is not
as good as you imagine.

709
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:02,416
Do you know?

710
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:05,456
Mr. Fu.

711
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:08,256
Perfect timing.

712
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:09,097
Tell him

713
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,496
how good our country is.

714
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:13,777
Mr. Fu,

715
00:38:14,176 --> 00:38:16,176
everyone has the right to choose freely.

716
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,617
Why do you care what he chooses?

717
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:18,456
Isn't it so?

718
00:38:21,977 --> 00:38:23,256
I still have something to do.

719
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:24,136
I'll go back first.

720
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:33,057
Let's go too.

721
00:38:33,857 --> 00:38:34,416
Let's go.

722
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,336
Let's go out to play.

723
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:41,256
Let's go.

724
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:44,336
Chen Luzhou.

725
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:45,777
Who did you invite?

726
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:47,617
I just came out to sketch.

727
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:50,256
Now the teacher and the model are gone.

728
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,136
How am I supposed to draw?

729
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:53,336
Isn't it perfect?

730
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:54,977
Pack up your things,

731
00:38:54,977 --> 00:38:56,176
and let's go downhill to home.

732
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:58,737
Wait...

733
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:05,336
Chen Luzhou

734
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,617
and I were in a good conversation.

735
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:10,576
As soon as you came in, he left.

736
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,536
Does he not like you?

737
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:16,216
Maybe he really has something to do.

738
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:18,617
He said just now

739
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,336
he'd help you with the editing.

740
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,296
Did you offer him more money?

741
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:24,817
Keep out of it.

742
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,937
You should learn from Chen Luzhou well.

743
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:29,817
His mindset,

744
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,536
capturing the beauty
of the world with a camera.

745
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,737
Even pheasants he shoots are in pairs.

746
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:38,897
Now look at you.

747
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,857
You should talk more about things

748
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:43,817
like the world, ideals and such.

749
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,416
No more money talk.

750
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:46,494
Vulgar.

751
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:48,336
You just don't want to give him a raise.

752
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,057
He didn't ask.

753
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:50,977
Why do you care?

754
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:53,057
Why shouldn't I?

755
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:55,296
It's my responsibility.
I introduced him to you.

756
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:56,817
I think...

757
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:00,536
you should get it down to written form

758
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:01,897
