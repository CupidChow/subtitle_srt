(No Feelings for Me at All?)

You're truly blessed.

19
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:56,888
Hui is a good girl.

20
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,048
Thank you.

21
00:01:58,488 --> 00:01:59,328
Luzhou, you're back.

22
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:01,247
Let me introduce you.

23
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:02,687
This is Ms. Xue.

24
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:03,968
Professor Jiang's wife.

25
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,727
This is Luzhou, my son.

26
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:07,008
Hello, Ms. Xue.

27
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:07,888
Hello.

28
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:08,687
Have a seat.

29
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:09,928
Sit down.

30
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,048
- Please, have a seat.
- Sit.

31
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:15,287
She's

32
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:16,167
Hui.

33
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,647
Professor Jiang mentioned her before.
His daughter.

34
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,287
She's off to Ruicheng University

35
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,287
in a few days.

36
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:22,888
That way, the two of you can

37
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:24,127
watch out for each other.

38
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,368
Right, Hui?

39
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:26,848
Okay.

40
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:28,408
By the way,

41
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,048
your dad will be at the airport.

42
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:33,448
Go pick him up, and also drop off Hui.

43
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,727
She's off to Bohui for a movie.

44
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:36,607
Okay.

45
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:40,888
Thank you, Ma'am.

46
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:41,687
You're welcome.

47
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:43,767
Come, have some fruit.

48
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:44,448
Feel free.

49
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,328
Dad, I'm washing up.

50
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:54,808
Up so early?

51
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,647
Didn't you watch
the meteor shower last night?

52
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,687
How did you know?

53
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:01,928
Did Yingying tell you?

54
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:04,287
I saw it on your social media.

55
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:07,928
Right...

56
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:09,928
Who is Chen Luzhou?

57
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,848
(Oh no, I forgot to block him.)

58
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:15,207
It's

59
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:17,607
a friend I recently met.

60
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:19,448
A guy?

61
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:22,247
He's good at taking photos.

62
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,087
Why are you asking?

63
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:26,448
Never mind.

64
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:27,247
Well...

65
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,167
That Zhou guy

66
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:30,888
takes quite good pictures.

67
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:31,647
Pretty good.

68
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,167
If there's nothing else, bye.

69
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,448
Oh right.

70
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,767
There seems to be a typhoon
in a couple of days.

71
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:39,247
Once finished,

72
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:40,167
return early.

73
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,488
Bye.

74
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,272
(Zhu Yangqi)

75
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:55,488
Hello.

76
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:01,767
Chen Xingqi is unwilling to paint.

77
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:02,767
Why look for Xu Zhi?

78
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:04,207
If you can't do it, she can?

79
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:06,368
Based on my observation,

80
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,087
Chen Xingqi is not afraid of anything,

81
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,647
except for Xu Zhi.

82
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:11,808
Alright.

83
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,408
I'll ask

84
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:15,207
will she help Chen Luzhou
with his brother.

85
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:16,647
Sure.

86
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,528
Eight hundred a day for me.

87
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:20,647
Alright, that's a deal.

88
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,767
Where has Chen Luzhou gone?

89
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,368
Why isn't he taking his brother?

90
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,968
Chen Luzhou went on a blind date today.

91
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,207
- Blind date?
- Blind date?

92
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:33,888
The car's parked a bit far.

93
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,048
Need to walk a bit.

94
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:37,808
Hello.

95
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,687
I'll be out soon.

96
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:44,448
My boyfriend's there.

97
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:45,287
No need.

98
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,687
Boyfriend?

99
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:50,687
Don't tell my parents.

100
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,127
We

101
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,808
are planning to go abroad together.

102
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:56,607
Don't worry. Once we're abroad,

103
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:57,808
I won't trouble you.

104
00:04:58,647 --> 00:04:59,287
It's not you.

105
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,087
I dislike chatting, not your fault.

106
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,048
It's between my mom and me.

107
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,167
Ms. Lian is quite nice.

108
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,647
She's actually very proud of you.

109
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:10,848
You might not know,

110
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:13,247
but she often tells my mom
and others at work

111
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,928
how outstanding
and how hardworking you are.

112
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:19,448
My mom says she's just tough-talking
but soft-hearted.

113
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,928
In fact, it's obvious.

114
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:22,087
She cares about you a lot.

115
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,127
From No.1 High School?

116
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,928
With your good grades
and handsome looks,

117
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,408
many girls must like you.

118
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:33,928
Not really.

119
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:35,328
How come?

120
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,207
Do you have a girlfriend?

121
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:38,408
No.

122
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,848
Then you must like someone.

123
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:43,968
Sort of.

124
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:46,287
Add me on WeChat.

125
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,607
Let's have dinner abroad.

126
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,488
As a thank you for keeping my secret.

127
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:51,328
That's your boyfriend?

128
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:54,567
Hui.

129
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:55,687
Bye.

130
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:03,928
Let's go.

131
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:04,767
Go.

132
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:06,848
Watch a movie or eat?

133
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,207
- Eat.
- Okay.

134
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:10,167
I haven't eaten much.

135
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,687
(Xu Zhi is indeed quite pretty.)

136
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,687
But the girls who pursued you before,

137
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,647
were all pretty.

138
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,968
What's different with her
compared to other girls

139
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,247
is that she has a boyfriend.

140
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,567
(Zhu Yangqi, you're completely wrong.)

141
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,567
(I don't like girls
who have boyfriends.)

142
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:28,848
(I just...)

143
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,528
Can you guess
where Xu Zhi took Chen Xingqi?

144
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:40,048
Go ahead.

145
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:41,528
Foot massage parlor.

146
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,328
She said Chen Xingqi's feet
were too smelly.

147
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,928
Chen Xingqi's face turned green.

148
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:47,328
In your family,

149
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,008
who would dare to openly despise him?

150
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:50,808
Even Chen Xingqi has a day like this.

151
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,008
I told you before

152
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:54,767
that if Xu Zhi could be your girlfriend,

153
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,647
then someone could handle Chen Xingqi.

154
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:02,848
How did your blind date go?

155
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,167
I told you it's not a blind date.

156
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:08,008
Did you...

157
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,567
Did you tell Xu Zhi
I went on a blind date?

158
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:11,848
Yes, I did.

159
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:13,687
What'd she say?

160
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,528
She said you were talking nonsense

161
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,127
about interviews

162
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:20,167
and blind dates.

163
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,808
And then?

164
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:23,287
She asked you

165
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:24,968
do you want Chen Xingqi's business.

166
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,048
If not,

167
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,448
then she'll take over.

168
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,848
Tell her to dream on.

169
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,328
(No feelings for me at all?)

170
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:55,528
Three.

171
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,127
Three?

172
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,207
What did Chen Luzhou say?

173
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:04,408
Did he agree I take over?

174
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:06,767
He said no way.

175
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:08,127
Stingy.

176
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,167
Six.

177
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:14,008
Pass.

178
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:17,968
Zhu Yangqi, are you a pig?

179
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,087
I'm on the same team as you.

180
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:20,207
Why do you block my cards?

181
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,648
Do you even know how to play?

182
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,407
My cards are good, okay?

183
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:30,087
Hello.

184
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:30,848
Welcome.

185
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:31,247
Hello.

186
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:31,808
Two people?

187
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:32,407
I...

188
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:33,207
Zhai Xiao.

189
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:33,968
Okay.

190
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,487
Bad guy.

191
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,087
I'll handle him.

192
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,207
Wait a moment.

193
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:40,848
Look.

194
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:44,608
Not bad here.

195
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:45,848
I was here before.

196
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,127
It's quite nice.

197
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:48,247
She is...

198
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:49,688
Chai Jingjing?

199
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:50,968
No.

200
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:52,928
That's too bizarre.

201
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,808
This guy needs handling.

202
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,087
Otherwise,
more naive girls will get hurt.

203
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:57,928
How?

204
00:08:58,648 --> 00:08:59,287
What do we do?

205
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:00,008
Got it.

206
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,648
We record it and then expose him.

207
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:02,688
Okay.

208
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:05,648
Alright.

209
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:07,367
Thank you.

210
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:10,287
Stop.

211
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:12,768
What?

212
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,287
Fur. It must be from the tree.

213
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:19,048
Receive it.

214
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,487
- Okay.
- You can get her?

215
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,287
I'll send a message to Chai Jingjing
with my secondary account.

216
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:34,608
Hello.

217
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:35,728
- Hello.
- Some water.

218
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:36,367
Okay.

219
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:40,608
Who is it?

220
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:41,407
It's nothing.

221
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:44,648
Please enjoy.

222
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,805
(Chai Jingjing)

223
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:51,888
Chai Jingjing?

224
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:53,127
Who's that?

225
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:54,487
My cousin.

226
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,768
Maybe something's happening at home.

227
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:58,928
It does seem urgent.

228
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:00,968
Let me take this call.

229
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:02,127
Alright.

230
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,048
Okay.

231
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:04,207
Wait for me for a moment.

232
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:10,688
Hello, Jingjing.

233
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,527
Let me explain.

234
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:19,087
Tomorrow...

235
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:19,768
Tomorrow I'll...

236
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,008
Don't explain, bad guy.

237
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:23,447
Bad guy, we're done!

238
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,968
Stop it, or I'll call the cops.

239
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:29,848
Bad guy.

240
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:32,008
Serves him right.

241
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:32,487
Ling.

242
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,048
Cai Yingying?

243
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,487
You guys did it?

244
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,087
Yes, it was us. What about it?

245
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,728
Are you clinging to me?

246
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:04,367
You followed me here.

247
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,287
We're not related.

248
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,608
Why are you so clingy?

249
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:07,728
Pester you?

250
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,728
Yingying has great eyesight.

251
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:10,648
It's 5.3.

252
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:13,648
Let's go out.

253
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:14,407
What?

254
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,487
What? Starting a fight?

255
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,367
Want to fight?

256
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,728
Do you know that
Xu Zhi's uncle owns this villa.

257
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,287
What good outcome can there be

258
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,928
misbehaving here?

259
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,048
You...

260
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:39,888
Just wait.

261
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:41,407
Thank you for the reminder.

262
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,167
I'm not ambitious enough.

263
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:44,888
I don't know what I want.

264
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,207
But now I'm very sure

265
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,527
what I don't want.

266
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:49,888
Like you,

267
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,688
a piece of non-recyclable trash.

268
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:58,367
You all just wait.

269
00:11:58,768 --> 00:11:59,247
Just wait.

270
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:03,407
It's okay.

271
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,487
High five.

272
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,527
Give it to me.

273
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,327
What have you been busy with lately?

274
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,127
Accompanying Chen Xingqi
to paint at the villa.

275
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:31,688
Luzhou,

276
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,048
that day, I...

277
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:34,968
It was my fault.

278
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:36,848
I was too much.

279
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:39,728
By the way,

280
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,728
everything is settled at school.

281
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,688
I bought an apartment nearby for you.

282
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,648
Living at home is always
more comfortable than staying in a dorm.

283
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,207
Thanks, Dad.

284
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:51,648
Let's go.

285
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,127
The weather has been very dry lately.

286
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:00,287
I made some pear soup.

287
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:01,167
Look.

288
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:02,848
How nice it is.

289
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:03,728
We're back.

290
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:04,968
You're back.

291
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,048
You must be tired from the trip.

292
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:11,648
Wash your hands. Ms. Mei made pear soup.

293
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,327
Get me a bowl. I'll go make a call.

294
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,167
Drink later.

295
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:15,848
Alright.

296
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:19,127
Luzhou.

297
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,367
Come, have a bowl of pear soup.

298
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,447
Thank you, Ms. Mei.

299
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:26,848
Come on.

300
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:29,688
Want a spoon? No?

301
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:33,447
Wash your hands before you drink it.

302
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:35,648
Changing your face quickly.

303
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:36,768
Here's a spoon.

304
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,048
You should be in Sichuan Opera.

305
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:38,808
No.

306
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:43,648
Want some?

307
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,648
I'll drink it later.

308
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:48,968
Drink to dissipate the heat.

309
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:53,207
What did your dad say to you

310
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,127
along the trip?

311
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:56,928
He told me

312
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,768
once I get settled at school abroad,

313
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:00,487
he'll buy me an apartment.

314
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:01,768
Look.

315
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:03,648
Your dad cares about you.

316
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:08,087
Remember

317
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,327
when we traveled to Spain?

318
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:10,968
You didn't buy the speaker

319
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,848
to buy Xingqi a drawing board.

320
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,087
When your dad heard,

321
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,527
he spent the money for his suit

322
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,568
to buy you the speaker.

323
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,287
I joked,

324
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:20,688
"You can wear a suit for years,

325
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,848
but will the speaker last that long?

326
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:23,888
Is it worth it?"

327
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:25,568
He said it's worth it.

328
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,247
If his son likes it,
that's all that matters.

329
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,008
I know.

330
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:33,048
I know he's good to me.

331
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:35,728
I won't let him down.

332
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,720

(that was the one I broke as a child.)

350
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,367
(Now I'm an adult,
he can collect the debt.)

351
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,568
(Get ready to work.)

352
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,287
Where are you?

353
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:16,768
Still down here.

354
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,367
Bring some things back when you return.

355
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,367
I'm starving.

356
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:22,608
Want what?

357
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,167
Some instant noodles.

358
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,568
Don't forget Xingqi's water.

359
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,367
You can choose the rest as you like.

360
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:29,447
What about Xu Zhi?

361
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:31,447
You tell him.

362
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:33,127
Chen Luzhou.

363
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:34,527
Which Lu is it?

364
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:35,768
Lu as in dumb.

365
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:36,968
Alright.

366
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:38,848
Forget it.

367
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,048
I wanted to bring you

368
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:41,407
two bottles of juice back.

369
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:42,928
Lu as in twists

370
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:44,487
and turns, all roads lead to Rome.

371
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:46,247
Too late.

372
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:48,728
Not late. You'll buy them for me.

373
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,888
Dream on.

374
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,008
Hello.

375
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,327
Where are you?
I'm tired of playing cards.

376
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:25,768
In such a hurry to see me?

377
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,527
Rider, the order is overdue.

378
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,808
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

379
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:32,247
Don't give a bad review.

380
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,008
Depends on how long I wait.

381
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,447
About half an hour.

382
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:37,768
Okay.

383
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,648
They're returning to rest.

384
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:41,087
Meet downstairs

385
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:42,568
at the restaurant?

386
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:43,487
Okay.

387
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:54,648
Hello.

388
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,127
Two of us.

389
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:56,808
Hello.

390
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:58,207
Sorry.

391
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,568
No personal drinks here.

392
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,568
So, should we still drink them?

393
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,247
I won't waste them.

394
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,048
I think there's an AV room nearby.

395
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,127
Lead the way.

396
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:22,608
Come in.

397
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:26,487
Sorry about that.

398
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,087
We only have this one left here.

399
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:29,167
How about it?

400
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:31,568
No problem. This one is fine.

401
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:32,688
Okay.

402
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:33,407
Thank you.

403
00:18:58,008 --> 00:18:58,888
Watch what?

404
00:18:58,888 --> 00:18:59,968
I'm fine. Up to you.

405
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:01,327
I'll choose.

00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,048
Thank you.

410
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,087
You're not happy?

411
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:50,648
No.

412
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,207
Because of the blind date?

413
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,367
Don't listen to Zhu Yangqi's nonsense.

414
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:58,648
My mom tricked me.

415
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,247
She took me to meet a girl

416
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,167
and asked me to look after her abroad.

417
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,527
But she has a boyfriend.

418
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,407
Why are you saying so much?

419
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,167
I didn't ask.

420
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:08,688
I don't care.

421
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,207
I just feel that

422
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,728
you look a bit off today.

423
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:13,608
You need a drink

424
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,552
more than whining.

425
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:29,688
I'm just asking casually.

426
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:30,728
No hard feelings.

427
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:31,367
Go ahead.

428
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:35,888
Have you thought

429
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:36,928
about what kind

430
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,207
of guy you want?

431
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,648
No, I'll let fate decide.

432
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,327
But I'm somewhat superficial.

433
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:45,888
I prefer someone smart,

434
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:47,167
and also earn money.

435
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,207
Because if they're too dumb,

436
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:50,968
even if they're very handsome,

437
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:52,167
I refuse.

438
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:53,327
I don't like it.

439
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,048
Too exhausting to communicate.

440
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:57,888
I'm not patient.

441
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,447
How to judge intelligence?

442
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,447
Most people have similar intelligence,

443
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:06,888
except for a few exceptions.

444
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,167
So, before dating,

445
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,367
would you take someone
to the hospital for an IQ test?

446
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:13,527
That's why I say I'm superficial.

447
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:15,568
For now, I can only rely on feelings.

448
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,888
College Entrance Examination
is a divide.

449
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:19,768
Between high scorers and others,

450
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,207
they naturally part ways.

451
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:24,327
I'm not talking about you.

452
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:26,247
You're from No.1 High School.

453
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,087
A lean camel is bigger than a horse.

454
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,367
Planning to date once you're in college?

455
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,207
At fate's will.

456
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:43,527
Qingyi University is average.

457
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:44,728
Which school is nice?

458
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:46,527
Jing and Hua Universities

459
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:47,447
are both okay.

460
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,087

Nothing.

466
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,207
I think your idea is quite good.

467
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:14,728
(Alright.)

468
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:16,768

491
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:13,207
hadn't been so worried
about what others thought,

492
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:14,728
would he have ended up like that?

493
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,848
Everyone has a wall in their heart.

494
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:18,207
It seems solid,

495
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:19,768
but it can be broken

496
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:20,808
by one sentence,

497
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:22,287
or a moment of collapse.

498
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,648
So, if your wall of heart collapses,

499
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:28,167
then what will you do?

500
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:39,848
I'll look into this question
and then get back to you.

501
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:41,928
Okay.

502
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:45,367
Typhoon weather is coming.

503
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,808
I'll leave here tomorrow.

504
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,008
Dad is about to switch
to the night shift.

505
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,688
I can't leave my grandma home alone.

506
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:54,928
I should probably take Chen Xingqi down.

507
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:00,487
By the way,

508
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,127
I got a job to Linshi today.

509
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:04,247
Needs a photographer.

510
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,048
How much do you plan to hire me for?

511
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:09,968
How much are you thinking? Name a price.

512
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:11,008
Keep it reasonable.

513
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:12,688
Okay.

514
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:14,928
Okay, goodnight.

515
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:17,888
Goodnight.

516
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:37,688
Dad.

517
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:38,447
You're back.

518
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,928
Such a feast, do we have guests today?

519
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:44,008
No guests at all.

520
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:45,327
Just welcoming you back.

521
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:47,808
Better be.

522
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:49,327
Where's Grandma?

523
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,688
She suddenly said
that the city is noisy.

524
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:53,688
Desires rural living.

525
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:54,608
I'm telling you.

526
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:55,888
She just wants to go back

527
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:57,247
to find her friends there.

528
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,527
I brought back the tea for you.

529
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:02,327
You really thought.

530
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:05,287
Wash your hands and eat.

531
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:06,127
Smells so good.

532
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:08,087
Go wash your hands.

533
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:24,768
- Dad.
- Zhi.

534
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:25,527
Go ahead.

535
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,648
Do you think I have

536
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:32,728
any changes today?

537
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,728
You changed your hairstyle?

538
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:38,688
You're much energetic.

539
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:39,287
That's right.

540
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,287
Then take another look at home.

541
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:42,608
Any changes?

542
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,247
At home...

543
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:48,407
It's spotless clean.

544
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:49,848
Did you hire a maid?

545
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:51,487
What maid?

546
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,648
Even a maid can't clean
as well as I did.

547
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:56,048
I did everything up and down by myself.

548
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:58,447
And then?

549
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:01,527
Then the hospital said

550
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:02,928
they want to bond.

551
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:04,888
This time we'll go to Sanya.

552
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:06,048
Then I thought

553
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:07,127
I have vacation.

554
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,568
Why not take your grandma to Beijing?

555
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:11,327
What's your point?

556
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:15,888
I hope you

557
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,608
to attend a Beijing college.

558
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:19,928
Dad.

559
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,048
I already discussed it with Cai.

560
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:25,367
He also said

561
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:27,688
with your estimated score,
Qingyi University

562
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,648
is really a compromise.

563
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:30,728
And your homeroom teacher, Mr. Qu,

564
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,728
specially called to tell me

565
00:27:32,928 --> 00:27:34,127
to be sure to persuade you.

566
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,327
He thinks you're young and outstanding,

567
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,407
and should go out to explore
and see the world.

568
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:43,287
Don't worry.

569
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,247
When you're not around,

570
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:44,808
I can

571
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:46,087
take care of myself very well.

572
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,487
Look how well I've kept the house.

573
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,808
This is my last confidence,

574
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,127
enough until your PhD graduation.

575
00:27:59,048 --> 00:27:59,327
Wait.

576
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:00,888
Where did you get so much money?

577
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:02,808
Didn't I tell you?

578
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:03,928
Mr. Lin, the lottery guy,

579
00:28:03,928 --> 00:28:05,207
owes our family five million.

580
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:06,447
Alright.

581
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:08,728
Our family's savings
are more than Grandma's Fun Beans.

582
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,287
Okay?

583
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:09,808
Okay.

584
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:12,888
Think about it what I just

585
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:13,928
told you carefully.

586
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:15,888
I need to go to the hospital now.

587
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:18,247
You wash the dishes today.

(I can still afford
to treat you to a movie.)

600
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:10,087

Dad,

605
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,367
Beijing has heating.

606
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:37,728
An electric blanket?

607
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,928
Are you trying to make me
get heat rash in winter?

608
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:49,167
How about

609
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,447
I get her to meet you?

610
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,608
You can give her these photos.

611
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:54,048
Forget it.

612
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:56,407
So she won't bring up
the money issue again.

613
00:31:58,127 --> 00:31:59,928
Weren't you two doing well

614
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:00,928
at Fu Yu Villa?

615
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:01,968
Why

616
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:03,848
suddenly become distant?

617
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,127
I've been thinking why I like her

618
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:08,808
these past few days.

619
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:11,008
Love at first sight?

620
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:12,928
Maybe.

621
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:16,848
But I think it's more likely
due to a sense of conquest.

622
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:19,287
I see.

623
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:20,648
It's because

624
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,247
she

625
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:23,568
isn't interested in you.

626
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:24,928
So, unlike those girls

627
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:27,768
who admired and pursued you.

628
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:29,648
Or

629
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:31,127
you don't believe that she's

630
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:32,487
only interested in your mom.

631
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:35,447
I just often don't know

632
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:36,568
what she's really thinking.

633
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:39,447
Sometimes I feel it seems like

634
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:42,968
she's playing dumb.

635
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:44,768
But sometimes I think

636
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:46,087
she really hasn't caught on.

637
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:48,728
Either way,

638
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:49,888
I'm too passive.

639
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:51,407
I'm done guessing.

640
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,527
Besides, I'm going abroad soon.

641
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,808
We won't work out.

642
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,207
I think it's enough.

643
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:19,407
Check for anything

644
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:20,207
to fix.

645
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:21,167
Let me see.

646
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:25,447
Okay.

647
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,167
Let's go with this.

648
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:28,008
Okay.

649
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:30,527
Everything is ready,

650
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:31,888
we just need a photographer.

651
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:33,768
Chen Luzhou said what?

652
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,207
He didn't agree or refuse.

653
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:37,487
He'll check his schedule.

654
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:40,527
Should we ask him again?

655
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:41,648
Okay.

656
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:54,648
Good shot!

657
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:04,074
(Stay focused. Victory
in the College Entrance Examination!)

658
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,367
(Have you decided about the shop visit?)

659
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:26,568
(Sorry, I got a rush job.)

660
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:27,648
(I can't go.)

661
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:36,487
(There's a job shooting a convoy.
Are you taking it?)

662
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:38,087
(The price is negotiable.)

663
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:42,487
(Okay.)

664
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:48,008
It's for you.

665
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:48,968
Hello, Senior.

666
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:50,207
Hello.

667
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,407
Senior Luzhou,

668
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:53,287
could you sign a message for me?

669
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:55,888
He's busy.

670
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:58,728
Then we'll have to find someone else.

671
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,367
(Successful shooting.)

672
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:09,527
Great Photographer Chen
isn't joining us to make money.

673
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:12,367
He went back to school
to sign autographs for underclassmen.

674
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:14,247
Look.

675
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:17,327
A lark in No.1 High School,
who sings very well.

676
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,327
One grade below.

677
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:20,600
(Got a message from Senior Luzhou.)
She was on a TV talent show.

678
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,127
Do you think

679
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,728
Chen Luzhou really considers us

680
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:30,048
as friends or not?

681
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:31,487
What do you mean?

682
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:33,768
Nothing.

683
00:35:34,728 --> 00:35:35,768
I just feel that

684
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:37,407
although we know each other,

685
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:38,648
in the end,

686
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,327
everyone returns to their circles.

687
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:44,648
Even if that's the case,
it's normal, right?

688
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:45,928
Anyway, he's going abroad.

689
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:47,848
After that, we'll rarely interact.

690
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:02,367
Don't worry.

691
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,247
The world will turn without Chen Luzhou.

692
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:05,768
Just a photographer.

693
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:07,407
I can find you someone even more...

694
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:09,447
Almost the same.

695
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,848
I'll look right now.

696
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:20,087
Lucy.

697
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:23,207
Why did he come?

698
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,127
This guy.

699
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,447
Here to find you?

700
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:30,127
You guys go ahead. I'm leaving.

701
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,768
Why run away, Chen Luzhou?

702
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:33,808
What's he worth?

703
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:34,888
That's not you.

704
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:38,527
If you leave, we're done.

705
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:40,648
Can you just spare me, okay?

706
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:43,207
Didn't you say he was sneaky?

707
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,327
I'll just be cautious.

708
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,008
No excuses.

709
00:36:46,127 --> 00:36:47,928
You're just scared
to confront him directly.

710
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:00,968
Watch out.

711
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,768
Come on, pass it over.

712
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:06,247
Here!

713
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:08,888
Nice shot!

714
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,167
Defense!

715
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:14,608
Nice shot!

716
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:26,888
Nice!

717
00:37:26,888 --> 00:37:27,648
Get the rebound!

718
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:28,888
Nice shot!

719
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:30,127
Double dribble?

720
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:34,608
Stay closer.

721
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:36,407
There!

722
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:39,568
Don't let him through.

723
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:46,648
Lucy.

724
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:48,327
Are you okay?

725
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:49,367
Can you do it?

726
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,768
- Are you okay?
- Hurt?

727
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:53,367
Tan Xu, why did you kick him?

728
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:54,008
Go!

729
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:55,048
Come.

730
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:56,367
Lucy, get up first.

731
00:37:58,768 --> 00:37:59,367
Walk this way.

732
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,367
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

733
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:01,768
Hang in there.

734
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:11,357
(The Origin of Man)

735
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:12,848
That's the air conditioner remote.

736
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:13,527
Look!

737
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:14,648
On and off.

738
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,207
Messing up the air conditioner.

739
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:22,167
Come on. Tell me.

740
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,127
What made you unhappy?

741
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:26,728
Why

742
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,768
are people less happy
as they grow older?

743
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:32,247
In theory,

744
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,407
it's because you've grown up

745
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:35,568
and seen more.

746
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,327
Your world's expanded.

747
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:39,447
What used to thrill you

748
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,848
doesn't anymore.

749
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:42,968
For example?

750
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:46,487
For example,
you used to get upset as a child.

751
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,367
I just had to give you candy back then,

752
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,728
and you could be happy all day.

753
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,048
But later on, as you gradually grew up,

754
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,728
one piece of candy was no longer enough.

755
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:56,287
Then I had to take you
to the amusement park,

756
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:57,888
buy you beautiful clothes,

757
00:38:57,888 --> 00:38:59,768
and even help you
run for class president.

758
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:01,407
Was I like this when I was little?

759
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:03,008
Look,

760
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:06,087
the video of my dear daughter's
class president election.

761
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:07,888
I've always kept it on my phone.

762
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,648
I've kept it.

763
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:13,848
Hello everyone, my name is Xu Zhi.

764
00:39:14,127 --> 00:39:15,608
Napoleon once said that

765
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:18,367
a soldier who doesn't
want to be a general isn't a good one.

766
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,768
Although I am not as rich as Lin Zixuan,

767
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:23,487
I'm pretty.

768
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,888
Lin Zixuan's money
won't all be spent on you.

769
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:30,087
But my beauty is completely unreserved.

770
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,608
You all can see.

771
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:32,968
I hope all vote for me.

772
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:35,968
But if I am elected class president,

773
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,287
I hope everyone
can cooperate with me in work.

774
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,608
Don't make this hard for me.

775
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:40,728
Thank you all.

776
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:44,167
Okay, keep it for your own viewing.

777
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:45,688
Just don't spread it around.

778
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,527
In the past, candy could soothe you.

779
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:52,608
But now, even a mountain of candy

780
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:53,848
might not make you happy.

781
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:56,167
I also know

782
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:58,167
that sooner or later,

783
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:00,247
I won't be able to cheer you up.

784
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,247
By then, there'll definitely be someone

785
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:03,207
who can make you happy.

786
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:04,648
However, I hope

787
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:07,048
that person can appear later.

788
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:10,167
Dad, don't worry.

789
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:11,608
I don't need cheering up now.

790
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,367
I just need to make money.

791
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:16,688
Make money?

792
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:18,568
Think about it,

793
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:19,848
I'm going to study in Beijing.

794
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,527
It will cost more than in Qingyi.

795
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:23,728
I have to earn some pocket money.

796
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:25,608
Got time.

797
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:29,527
I'm going with Cai Yingying
tomorrow to Linshi.

798
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:30,808
Visit a shop.

799
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:32,127
Earn some money.

800
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,487
You can make money by visiting shops?

801
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:36,688
Impressive, right?

802
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:44,447
Let me check whether
inviting shops is profitable.

803
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:49,608
Sorry.

804
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:50,888
I'm late.

805
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:51,848
Aren't you...

806
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:53,167
Couldn't sleep last night.

807
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,608
Felt dizzy in the morning.

808
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:56,327
Took a long time to make soy milk.

809
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,087
Couldn't sleep?

810
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:58,487
Why?

811
00:40:59,928 --> 00:41:01,848
Something is wrong with Zhi.

812
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:03,048
What's wrong?

813
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:04,327
Here's the hospital.

814
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:05,648
Take her here to check.

815
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:07,527
The doctor can't help.

816
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:08,888
Ever since

817
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:11,048
she came back from Fu Yu Villa,

818
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,608
I've felt something's off.

819
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:14,608
Last night, she grabbed the AC remote,

820
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:15,447
and went to watch TV.

821
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:17,928
In the middle of the night,
she oddly asked me,

822
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,808
"Why are people less happy
as they grow older?"

823
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:21,928
The whole day she's been

824
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:23,247
absent-minded.

825
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:25,287
Do you think

826
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:27,568
she might be in love?

827
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:30,768
Impossible.

828
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:32,568
D-Didn't you ask her?

829
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:34,287
She mentioned that...

830
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:35,287
That Xu guy...

831
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:35,968
No.

832
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:36,608
Just classmates.

833
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:37,888
New situation.

834
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,287
N-New situation? What...

835
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,167
Quick, look at the phone.

836
00:41:43,327 --> 00:41:44,167
Look at this.

837
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:47,648
Take a look.

838
00:41:47,768 --> 00:41:48,648
Look, you see.

839
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:50,888
Chen Luzhou.

840
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:52,527
Nice picture.

841
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,327
Just this, you...

842
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:55,327
I think

843
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,808
you need to check,

844
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,127
or ask the child again.

845
00:41:58,928 --> 00:41:59,447
How do I ask?

846
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:01,928
She definitely won't tell.

847
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:03,048
Needs checking.

848
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:07,103
(Andrology, Treatment Room One)

849
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:13,728
(1034.)

850
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:16,048
(Chen Luzhou, consultation room 7.)

851
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,327
It's your turn.

852
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:29,648
Hello, over here.

853
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:30,848
Doctor.

854
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:34,247
Where's the discomfort?

855
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:37,287
I bumped into someone
while playing ball.

856
00:42:38,616 --> 00:42:41,592
(Chen Luzhou)

857
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,087
Are you Chen Luzhou?

858
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:52,407
I am Chen Luzhou.

859
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:17,240
(Everyone has a wall in their heart.)

860
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,544
(It seems solid, but it can be broken)

861
00:43:19,704 --> 00:43:22,040
(by one sentence,)

862
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,733
