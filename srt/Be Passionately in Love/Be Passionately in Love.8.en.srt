(A Rainy Day Not So Annoying)

18
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,352
I heard someone across the street

19
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,392
bit a dog.

20
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,671
No, the dog bit the person.

21
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:55,992
Hurry, check it out.

22
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:57,511
There must be some news.

23
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:58,631
Okay, investigate it.

24
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,031
Okay.

25
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,191
What's up?

26
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:12,591
Nothing.

27
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,511
Let me see your hand.

28
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,671
Hurry and remove it.

29
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,031
Don't let your dad see.

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,138
Okay.

31
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:34,671
Come with me.

32
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:37,832
Come with me.

33
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:41,432
Are you okay?

34
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:43,432
I'm okay.

35
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:52,631
Zhi.

36
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:54,752
This is Chen Luzhou's mom.

37
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,352
You always said that she sounded

38
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:00,551
like Ms. Lin.

39
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,472
I didn't believe it.

40
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:04,151
When she spoke, I was lost.

41
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:06,952
How is it?

42
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,711
Meeting the person you've longed to see.

43
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:09,912
How do you feel?

44
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,111
I always felt

45
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,472
that she was very similar to my mom.

46
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:15,952
But after seeing her today,

47
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,432
I now feel she isn't

48
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:18,631
similar to my mom at all.

49
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:38,312
You're back.

50
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:41,792
What's wrong?

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,352
Playing in the water again?

52
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:54,992
Seriously.

53
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:57,671
How many pairs are worn out?

54
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,312
It was only bought a few days ago.

55
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:09,711
You're even feeling wronged?

56
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:27,151
(If you play in the water again,)

57
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:28,591
(then you'll go to school barefoot.)

58
00:04:57,352 --> 00:05:00,191
Although my mom always scolded me,

59
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,191
she always forgave my mistakes.

60
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,191
Ms. Lin is sharp-tongued,
but soft-hearted.

61
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:08,591
Chen Luzhou's mom

62
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,832
speaks softly,

63
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:12,671
but is quite aggressive,

64
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,151
causing slight suffocation.

65
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:18,752
Is it because Chen Luzhou was adopted,

66
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:21,231
that she used a favor as leverage?

67
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,272
Although my dad often scolds me,

68
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,912
I still like him.

69
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,432
(No wonder he would say that)

70
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,272
(being unconditionally loved)

71
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:36,912
(requires a bit of luck.)

72
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,031
I've spoken with your dad.

73
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:41,031
The school professors

74
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,312
are quite satisfied with you.

75
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,191
Now it's just the visa required.

76
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,631
After I'm done being busy these days,

77
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,071
I'll go to the consulate with you.

78
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,071
I'll make a wish.

79
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,631
Come on.

80
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,111
Can I not go abroad?

81
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,792
This has been planned for a long time.

82
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,031
Now you say you don't want it?

83
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:14,992
I don't have to go to Hua University.
Any university nationwide will work.

84
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,031
A less popular major is fine.

85
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:19,912
Chen Luzhou.

86
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,832
Sending you abroad is good for you.

87
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,111
Not an exile.

88
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:26,031
Don't make yourself feel so aggrieved.

89
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:26,551
Alright?

90
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:28,792
If you're not at ease, it's okay.

91
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,191
I can sign a guarantee letter.

92
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,671
I promise not to take anything
from Chen Jishen,

93
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:36,151
as long as I can stay here.

94
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,912
What nonsense are you talking about?

95
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:41,872
Even if your dad changes his mind,

96
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:42,912
I still won't agree.

97
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:43,912
Hui.

98
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,472
We have some shots ready here.

99
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,511
Come over and take a look.

100
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,392
Okay, I'm coming over right away.

101
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,151
As for that girl,

102
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:55,031
I still say the same thing.

103
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,472
Regardless of your relationship,

104
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:58,792
it's best to end it before going abroad.

105
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,031
Do you understand?

106
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:12,432
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

107
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:50,039
(Convenience Store)

108
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:01,832
Boss, here's the money.

109
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,231
Be careful.

110
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:17,952
Chen Luzhou's phone.

111
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:20,271
It's also wet.

112
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:21,512
Take a look quickly.

113
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:30,471
Here.

114
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:32,672
This...

115
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,632
Now you have what I have.

116
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:38,912
Good luck.

117
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,031
You go home first.

118
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,832
I'll take his phone to him.

119
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,992
How can you do it in such heavy rain?

120
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:55,832
No problem, I have an umbrella.

121
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,151
Here.

122
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:58,672
Hold this for me.

123
00:09:58,672 --> 00:09:59,191
I'll pack it.

124
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:06,231
CLZ, Chen Luzhou.

125
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:08,592
Zhi.

126
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,431
You know what a crush is?

127
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,151
It means

128
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,912
even though it's
a rainy day you dislike,

129
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:17,071
you'll still go without hesitation

130
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:18,752
to take the phone to him.

131
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:24,992
How's business?

132
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,031
Mr. Xu.

133
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,271
Why are you here?

134
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:29,752
I had to come and see

135
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,111
you two lively entrepreneurs.

136
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,071
Welcome.

137
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,632
I just heard about a phone
not being taken.

138
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:37,792
Chen Luzhou's?

139
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:38,752
No, it's not.

140
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,952
A customer who got a manicure.

141
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:41,992
She left her phone here.

142
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:43,031
A woman?

143
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:45,832
Mr. Xu, you're really funny.

144
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:48,351
How could it possibly
be a man getting a manicure?

145
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,071
True.

146
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:52,512
Well then.

147
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,431
Dad, could you put this away for me?

148
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:56,231
- Bye.
- Bye.

Thank you.

177
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,592
You went drinking?

178
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,512
You are upset?

179
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,431
No, I've gotten used to it.

180
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,512
You have a fever.

181
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,391
Do you have a thermometer?

182
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:52,471

I haven't decided how to tell her.

185
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:00,952
You saw it too.

186
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,712
She's not someone easily dealt with.

187
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:04,912
Never mind.

188
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,311
I'm not here to see your mom.

00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,592
I'm here to tell you a joke.

190
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:10,752
It's about you.

191
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:13,311
Can I not listen?

192
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,431
Really not going to listen?

193
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:20,111
Go ahead.

194
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:23,512
Thanks to you, I honored
the Childbirth Buddha last time.

195
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,111
Xu found out about this.

196
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:27,311
He nearly thought
I was carrying your child,

197
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:28,632
and was ready to stab you.

198
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:30,712
I stopped him.

199
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,311
Then I must thank you.

200
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:34,912
Don't mention it.

201
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,151
I need mental distress

202
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,311
compensation from you.

203
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,191
I was chased by him with a knife.

204
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,471
What did you lose?

205
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,672
Xu nags at me every day, telling me

206
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,031
to stay away from bad guys.

207
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:48,431
I've been at my wits' end

208
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,672
in dealing with him.

209
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,752
Alright, go ahead.

210
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,448
How much do you want?

211
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:57,016
How much do you have?

212
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,752
I have five million. Do you want it?

213
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:00,271
Yes, if legal.

214
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:03,391
It's hard to make
such a large sum legal,

215
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:04,592
unless married.

216
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:07,471
That won't work.

217
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:09,632
You're even picky about that?

218
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,792
We're not of marriageable age yet.

219
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,471
Even at that age, I won't.

220
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,592
Marriage is a very serious matter.

221
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,552
I didn't expect you
to be so traditional.

222
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,391
So, don't flirt
with me casually anymore.

223
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,872
I don't want to misunderstand you again.

224
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:51,712
(We applied screen films,)

225
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,431
(and had the first financial success.)

226
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:00,832
(Congratulations to Lucy
for bouncing back.)

227
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:03,952
(Thanks to Jiang for treating us again.)

228
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,071
The lark.

229
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,471
It's her again.

230
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,071
Take a look.

231
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:19,752
Don't cross.

232
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,271
- I see you doing it solo.
- Look at me, impressive?

233
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,071
Nice.

234
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:25,471
Come on, solo kill.

235
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:26,712
- Nice, cool.
- Impressive?

236
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:27,351
Yes.

237
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:28,552
Hold off.

238
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:29,231
Hold off.

239
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,271
Just go for the dragon.

240
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,672
- Got it.
- Go for the dragon.

241
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:34,168
Nice, Zhu.

242
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,151
(Are you planning
to bail on last time's hotpot?)

243
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,111
(The kind Zhu.)

244
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:39,071
Got the middle tower.

245
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,752
(Who said I bailed?
I'll treat you next time.)

246
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,872
Hurry up, someone, go check.

247
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:52,672
They all went over.

248
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,391
(It's a rainy day, perfect for hotpot)

249
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:56,391
Don't go AFK.

250
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:57,952
(Isn't it perfect for gaming?)

251
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:58,992
Are you a bot, Zhu?

252
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:00,031
I'm coming.

253
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,752
Why send a location?

254
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:06,512
It's okay.

255
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,231
What's she doing?

256
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,431
(I'm leaving, don't forget an umbrella.)

257
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,071
It's okay, it's fine.

258
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:14,471
Ridiculous.

259
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:15,552
Why should I care?

260
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:16,592
Don't go AFK.

261
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,191
- Okay. I 'll play well.
- Counting on you, Zhu.

262
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,471
- You're the main position.
- I'll get back here.

263
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,311
Attack him.

264
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:22,471
Let's protect Zhu this round.

265
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,872
Save me, Jiang Cheng.

266
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:24,832
Hurry, he's coming!

267
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:25,912
I can't save you.

268
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:27,592
Buddies.

269
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,351
I need to leave.

270
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:31,752
- No. Finish this.
- Finish this.

271
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:32,552
I can't.

272
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,363
(Paracetamol-Amantadine Capsule)

273
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,351
This is mine.

274
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:46,672
My cup.

275
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:48,311
I drank from it.

276
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:51,592
I didn't notice.

277
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:55,632
If there's anyone at a loss,
it's me, right?

278
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,271
Then I should be happy?

279
00:17:58,832 --> 00:17:59,712
No need for that.

280
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,151
Remember 5,000 yuan for each kiss?

281
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:04,351
It's indirect one.

282
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,752
You can just pay 2,500 yuan.

283
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,231
Transfer it to my WeChat.

284
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:11,191
We're even.

285
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,111
Or have another drink.

286
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,351
You owe me 2,500 yuan.

287
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:19,872
Are you feeling better?

288
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:22,752
What else can I do?

289
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,191
Take me for a drive?

290
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:25,592
The weather is bad.

291
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:28,952
When the weather clears up,
if I'm still unhappy,

292
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,351
then I'll schedule with you.

293
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:32,792
Well...

294
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,311
I hope you can cheer up soon.

295
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,071
Let's watch a movie.

296
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,056
I'll get you home when the rain stops.

297
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,712
Go inside and take a nap.

298
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:06,872
Alright, no problem.

299
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,111
Remember to wake me up
when the rain stops.

300
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,592
Your favorite drink is in the fridge.

301
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,191
Feel free.

302
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,712
Come, have some meat.

303
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:31,552
Thanks.

304
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:35,384
What's the relationship between the lark
in No.1 High School and Chen Luzhou?

305
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:38,992
She was messaging him
and giving him water.

306
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,351
From my observations of Chen Luzhou,

307
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,792
he usually kept his distance from girls.

308
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:45,872
A perilous feast?

309
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,592
Who send you to ask me? Xu Zhi?

310
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,231
What's wrong with me
looking out for my bestie?

311
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:53,351
Fine.

312
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:54,952
We're both supporting the same couple.

313
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:55,632
Come on.

314
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:57,872
Stop being so attentive.

315
00:19:58,552 --> 00:19:59,391
Tell me,

316
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:00,592
what's their relationship?

317
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:02,471
There's nothing special.

318
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,391
She is Lucy's younger sister.

319
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,311
Then why does Yan Lelin
call Chen Luzhou brother?

320
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,872
How many sisters are there?

321
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:09,832
Really not many.

322
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:12,912
The lark is the daughter of Lucy's aunt,

323
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,311
and Luzhou's legitimate cousin.

324
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:16,191
If you dare to lie to me...

325
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,712
You can ask Chen Xingqi.

326
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,351
Alright, I'll trust you once.

327
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:24,912
But I have to say,

328
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,752
you're doing a pretty good job
as her bestie.

329
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:28,672
That's right.

330
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,231
I can't just see Zhi

331
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,191
get hurt by Chen Luzhou.

332
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,191
Not sure who'll be hurt, alright?

333
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:35,992
Our Lucy

334
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,471
is an innocent and chaste young man.

335
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,071
Innocent?

336
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:42,992
Don't believe it, do you?

337
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:44,071
You just wait.

338
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:49,752
See for yourself.

339
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:51,351
What's this?

340
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:53,311
Isn't it just a chair?

341
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:56,031
No.

342
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,592
I'll send it to you.

343
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:10,872
(Zhi.)

344
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:12,071
(Check if there is)

345
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,712
(a small blue chair in Luzhou's place.)

346
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:16,471
(What?)

347
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:19,752
(That's the special seat
he prepared for you.)

348
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,952
Text me when you want to hear me

349
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:46,912
get scolded again.

350
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:49,071
I will put a chair out there.

351
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:51,992
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,351
You said it earlier.

353
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,912
Friend me on WeChat
and put a chair there.

354
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:58,471
I'm getting a bit tired now.

355
00:21:58,471 --> 00:21:59,912

(Last night, I was)

393
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:22,071
(having a feast
at upscale Shan Fang Hotpot.)

394
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,231
(You unlucky person)

395
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,672

00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:28,431
(Right. You are romantic.)

398
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:30,512
(You go swinging while on the toilet.)

399
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:47,952
What are you doing?

400
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,231
Get a new broadband service.

401
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,271
Won't you check the score?

402
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:52,952
I'll boost the internet speed,

403
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:54,912
and ensure you can check it promptly.

404
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:55,992
We will have

405
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,351
gigabit fiber optic.

406
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,151
After turning it on,
the speed is extremely fast.

407
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:06,648
Why the one behind it is not lit?

408
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:11,712
This backfires so quickly.

409
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:13,271
Don't move.

410
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:15,231
I'll go check.

411
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:28,752
(What's up?)

412
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:32,271
(My dad is afraid
the network is too slow.)

413
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,471
(He upgraded the fiber optic,)

414
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:35,111
(but failed to set up the router.)

415
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:36,231
(The circuit is faulty now.)

416
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:38,712
Your dad is really something.

417
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,592
It's not easy for you
to have grown up smoothly.

418
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:47,952
The flashlight is too dim.

419
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:50,792
Pay attention.

420
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:12,311
(Are you angry?)

421
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,912
(I only see it now.)

422
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:21,632
(I thought I mentioned your family
and you got upset.)

423
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:25,632
(I am not angry.)

424
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,552
(It's not that easy to get angry.)

425
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:28,471
(True.)

426
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,952
(I don't think I've seen you get angry.)

427
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,992
(So, what exactly
would make you lose temper?)

428
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:38,191
(You can try.)

429
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,512
(You have nothing to do.)

430
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:47,872
It's lit.

431
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,471
(Or else why chat with you?)

432
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:03,872
(I'm just your tool to kill time.)

433
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:05,912
(I won't make ginger tea for a tool.)

434
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:07,592
(Is that so?)

435
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:10,151
(What were you thinking last night?)

436
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:13,151
(Why not write
a three-thousand-word essay)

437
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,672
- (to analyze inner thoughts in detail?)
- I want to get warranty support.

438
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,071
- (Xu Tianluo.)
- The router.

439
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,391
Right.

440
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,031
The one behind it is not lit.

441
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,471
(Do you know how much
gigabit fiber optic costs?)

442
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:30,832
(Over a thousand a year.
I can't remember clearly.)

443
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,231
Just come and take a look.

444
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,992
(Xu really loves me the most.)

445
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,752
(Grandma had internet lags
while playing poker online.)

446
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:40,552
(He didn't want to upgrade the fiber.)

447
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:42,752
(So, about making ginger tea,)

448
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,760
(I can't write
a three-thousand-word essay.)

449
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:47,071
(But if I ever spend money on you,)

450
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:49,512
(I'll write an eight-thousand-word essay
to reproach you.)

451
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:50,992
(You don't need to rush.)

452
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:53,811
- (Better be.)
- No way.

453
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:55,552
We're checking the score today.

454
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:57,880
Tomorrow just won't work.

455
00:28:58,512 --> 00:28:59,672
Can you think of a way?

456
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:01,031
Yeah.

457
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:03,391
Alright.

458
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:05,231
Alright.

459
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,152
What did support team say?

460
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:10,488
They said today
there were many broadband issues.

461
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:11,872
No one can come help.

462
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:15,872
It's already 10 AM.

463
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:18,104
Support team would be too late, right?

464
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:21,191
It's okay.

465
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,592
Checking the results

466
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:23,752
sooner or later is same.

467
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,391
I'll use data, and you'll make a call.

468
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:25,992
It's fine.

469
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:28,592
Right, I'll make the call.

470
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:29,952
You check it out.

471
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:54,872
Zhi.

472
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:56,872
Today, I shouldn't be

473
00:29:57,872 --> 00:29:59,391
doing things at the last minute.

474
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:00,872
- It's okay.
- I messed up.

475
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:02,752
Don't worry, I have a helper.

476
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:11,111
Hello, what's up?

477
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,632
Emergency rescue.

478
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,351
I can't fix circuits.

479
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,512
School didn't teach this.

480
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,191
The circuit's fixed,
but the network is down.

481
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:20,512
That grade-checking website won't load.

482
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,792
The call won't connect.

483
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,191
Dad is collapsing.

484
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:25,712
If you don't mind,
send me the exam admission ticket.

485
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:26,512
I'll help you check.

486
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:27,592
I don't mind.

487
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,271
I even feel a bit guilty.

488
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:31,952
I want to make ginger tea
for you right away.

489
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,151
Alright.

490
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:37,151
Whoever skips is a puppy.

491
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:49,191
I'm at the internet cafe.

492
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:49,752
Wait a bit.

493
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,231
How is it?

494
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,231
Just 680. I can't attend Hua University.

495
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:54,271
Chen Luzhou.

496
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,391
Honestly, you're so handsome

497
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:58,592
and

498
00:30:58,832 --> 00:30:59,752
considerate.

499
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,271
Surely many girls in China
will pursue you.

500
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,031
But you're about to go abroad.

501
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:06,872
Girls abroad might not

502
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:07,992
like you.

503
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:10,752
No need to worry about that.

504
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:13,191
I should be popular wherever I go.

505
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:15,311
Shameless.

506
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:22,712
You haven't turned on the computer?

507
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:23,992
Nervous?

508
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:25,271
Frankly,

509
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:27,031
I was bolder when I was a child.

510
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,471
Our school held a cultural performance.

511
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,832
I was supposed to go on stage
to conduct a chorus.

512
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:36,151
But the teacher gave me a quick lesson,
and then I went on stage.

513
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,111
Actually, I'm quite tone-deaf.

514
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:40,111
But I was not afraid
of being embarrassed.

515
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:42,391
I went up and conducted blindly.

516
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:44,952
In the end, everyone sang correctly.

517
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:46,431
Later I found out

518
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:47,832
they didn't look at me.

519
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:49,191
They looked at the teacher behind.

520
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:50,952
So, you still went up there?

521
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,351
Because I looked good.

522
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,071
The judges liked looking at me.

523
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:57,752
How should I put it?

524
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:58,992
I can't say more.

525
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:00,872
As a showpiece, I was top-notch.

526
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:02,552
Alright.

527
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:04,672
Being shameless,

528
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,712
you and I are on par.

529
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:07,552
What's your certificate number?

530
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:15,391
I sent the information to you.

531
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:18,712
If it is less than 680,
then don't tell me.

532
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,240
With Optional Module?

533
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:21,872
Of course.

534
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:23,752
I performed better in it.

535
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,111
I scored 690 in the third mock exam.

536
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:28,592
That score aren't reliable references.

537
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:31,592
It is just to boost your confidence.

538
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,391

00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:35,311
Seven hundred thirteen.

555
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:37,912
Well done.

556
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:39,512
It's okay.

557
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,592
If it's less than 750,

558
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:42,552
then it's a failure.

559
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,552
You people at No.1 High School
are really crazy.

560
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:48,672
Chen Luzhou.

561
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,512
Could you help check
another one's score?

562
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:55,592
He really helped me a lot with my study.

563
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:57,231
I just want to see

564
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:58,752
which course exactly had a problem?

565
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:01,191
No need to explain.

566
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:03,752
Send me the information.

567
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,311
Forget it.

568
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:10,680
Checking others' scores
without permission seems a bit unethical.

569
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:12,552
Up to you.

570
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,552
Then I'll hang up now.

571
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:16,912
Xu is still anxious outside.

572
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,071
Thank you for today.

573
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:35,952
(Well done, Xu Zhi)

574
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:47,832
How was it?

575
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:49,688
You checked it?

576
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:51,992
How is it?

577
00:34:57,912 --> 00:34:59,912
Qingyi University
is actually quite good.

578
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:01,992
See, you can also stay here.

579
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,632
You can build your hometown,

580
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:06,031
and also close to me,
as well as our place.

581
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:09,311
The electric blanket I bought last time
can be used now.

582
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,071
That's good.

583
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,752
Then it might not be usable.

584
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:19,391
You can go to Beijing?

585
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:21,832
How is it?

586
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:23,712
Seven hundred and thirty-eight.

587
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:26,151
Seven hundred and thirty-eight.

588
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:27,912
Barring accidents, it should be fine.

589
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:32,832
Seven hundred and thirty-eight.

590
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,191
My daughter will attend Hua University.

591
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:42,031
Am I too excited?

592
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:44,952
If your mom knew,

593
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,552
she would also be very happy.

594
00:35:50,712 --> 00:35:51,912
You did so well.

595
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:56,672
We definitely must hold
a big celebration banquet.

596
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:59,552
Invite everyone we know over

597
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,031
to celebrate for you together.

598
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:02,151
No need for that.

599
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:03,712
The application isn't done.

600
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:06,271
Let's not get happy too soon.

601
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:08,512
That's right.

602
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:12,752
Keep things discreet to succeed.

603
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:20,111
Go to the right.

604
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,231
- Right.
- Go to the right with me.

605
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:23,191
Not enough.

606
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:27,752
Go to the right.

607
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,391
I went right, and you blame me.

608
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:34,752
I heard Xu Zhi
was their school's top scorer.

609
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,111
You know the score?

610
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:37,832
I don't know.

611
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:42,071
But still,

612
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,231
the top scorer at Ruijun

613
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:44,952
probably

614
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,391
is average at No.1 High School.

615
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:48,712
Wanna bet?

616
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,111
Bet on what?

617
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,992
With her score,
even in No.1 High School,

618
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,712
she would definitely be among the top.

619
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:57,552
Oh.

620
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:01,624
You ordered takeout?

621
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:02,391
I'll go.

622
00:37:03,311 --> 00:37:04,592
Nice, I'm just hungry.

623
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:05,952
I'll start a game.

624
00:37:07,912 --> 00:37:08,792
Your takeout.

625
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,071
I didn't order.

626
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:13,512
You did.

627
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:15,071
Wrong address?

628
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:23,071
What's this?

629
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:23,792
Good stuff.

630
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:27,992
If Zhu Yangqi opened the door,

631
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:29,752
your head would've been smashed.

632
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:31,431
If he opened the door for me,

633
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:33,111
I'd leave right away.

634
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,391
Then why are you here, Architect Xu?

635
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:37,111
I'd be a puppy if I didn't come.

636
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:39,992
You came to make me ginger tea.

637
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:42,431
I came to discuss my application.

638
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:45,512
I no longer consider Qingyi University.

639
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,872
But Beijing is too far.

640
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,632
How about going to Shanghai?

641
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:51,792
Tech University's School of Architecture
is second only to Hua University.

642
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:52,912
Moreover,

643
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:55,832
a train ticket to Beijing
costs 680 yuan.

644
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,071
It costs only 180 yuan
to go to Shanghai.

645
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:00,832
I don't suggest

646
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:03,431
to choose a school
based on train ticket prices.

647
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:08,191
Your eyelashes are so long.

648
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:12,431
Why discuss eyelashes?

649
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,992
What was that girl's name again?

650
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,471
Xu Zhi, right?

651
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,752
Stop arguing.

652
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,792
Alright, let's go.

653
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:21,151
Really.

654
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:29,632
Look at them.

655
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:31,952
They even led our Tan Xu astray.

656
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:34,912
Young people nowadays
are really shameless.

657
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,752
I suggested earlier
that the kid stayed home.

658
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:40,311
But you insisted all the students
here are high school seniors.

659
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:41,391
Study atmosphere is good.

660
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:42,471
Isn't it your fault?

661
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:43,431
Alright.

662
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:45,632
I'll cancel the lease tomorrow.

663
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:46,351
Let's go.

664
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:47,632
I won't return here.

00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:19,752
and Cai Yingying?

677
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:23,872
Sorry.

678
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,992
You're quite fast.

679
00:39:35,992 --> 00:39:36,992
You called Xu Zhi.

680
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,512
Only Cai Yingying is left.

681
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:40,471
I think Yingying didn't do quite well.

682
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,792
She doesn't seem like someone
who didn't do well.

683
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:43,912
I'll show you.

684
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:48,031
(Celebrate, we must celebrate.)

685
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:49,351
(I'm coming right now.)

686
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:53,792
I'll call her.

687
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:55,632
Let's wait inside.

688
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,600
Let's go.

689
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:07,912
Come on, cheers.

690
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:09,471
Come on, cheers.

691
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,640
Have you decided
which university to apply?

692
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:19,151
I think

693
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,071
Hua University or Tech University.

694
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,200
I haven't decided.

695
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,391
As for me,

696
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:26,992
no hope applying
to the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

697
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:29,391
I should apply to Academy
of Theater Arts.

698
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:32,071
It also has an art major?

699
00:40:32,872 --> 00:40:33,592
You don't know.

700
00:40:33,592 --> 00:40:35,271
That's called stage art major.

701
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:38,031
We both scored 400.

702
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:39,864
You can attend
a top university in Beijing,

703
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:41,632
but I can't.

704
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:43,071
How is this so unfair?

705
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:44,992
I just have high HP.

706
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:47,792
Let me play.

707
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:49,271
I'm dying.

708
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:51,071
Don't you have high HP?

709
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:52,672
Let me finish this game.

710
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:58,952
I won't be able to get into college,
and you still won't let me play.

711
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:04,471
Alright, here you go.

712
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,271
Can you play?

713
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,071
You die right when you start playing.

714
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:10,872
Rightward.

715
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:11,952
I know.

716
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:13,431
Press this.

717
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:14,752
I'll teach you.

718
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,592
Let's talk inside.

719
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:16,351
Don't fly.

720
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:17,512
Let's talk inside.

721
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:19,471
Your screen is gone. Look.

722
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:21,752
No, hurry, adjust it back.

723
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:25,672
Come on. My left hand, your right hand.

724
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:26,191
I want that.

725
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,271
I want that skin.

726
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:27,912
That skin.

727
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:29,720
Adjust like this. I'll help you adjust.

728
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:32,552
Just sit.

729
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:40,471
For me?

730
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:41,111
Thank you.

731
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:43,431
I just stocked some at home.

732
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:53,151
I reviewed previous admission scores.

733
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,752
Hua University should be fine.

734
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:56,792
But the School of Architecture
at Hua University

735
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:57,952
maybe

736
00:41:57,952 --> 00:41:58,992
a bit risky.

737
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:04,872
The School of Architecture has a big
difference compared to other related majors.

738
00:42:05,672 --> 00:42:07,672
Apart from the School of Architecture,

739
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:09,816
