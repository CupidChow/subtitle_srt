(Now I Only Have You)

18
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:49,821
Home is still the best.

19
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,141
Right?

20
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,422
Clean up.

21
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,342
In a while, Mr. Cai and Yingying

22
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:55,422
will come to have a meal.

23
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,701
Yingying is on vacation?

24
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:57,821
No.

25
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:58,781
She aced art exam.

26
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,422
She's attending review classes.

27
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,423
Logically speaking,

28
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:02,822
she'd be studying hard at home.

29
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:04,341
Heard you were back.

30
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,462
Mr. Cai

31
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,462
gave her a day off.

32
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:07,101
Xu Zhi.

33
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:07,423
Good.

34
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,701
I'm here.

35
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:10,261
So fast.

36
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:11,621
I just mentioned you.

37
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,741
I miss you so much.

38
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,141
Didn't we just meet two weeks ago?

39
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,661
I just miss you.

40
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,502
Let's go. Hurry up. Go inside.

41
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,101
You're shaking me to pieces.

42
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:24,301
Clothes.

43
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,022
Help me take them.

44
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:27,821
Hang them and help.

45
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,261
The young one orders me.

46
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:31,141
So do you.

47
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,221
Chop the vegetables!

48
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:32,902
Alright.

49
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:33,982
Right away.

50
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:41,502
I forgot to ask you.

51
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,741
I noticed your daughter

52
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:44,862
is much thinner.

53
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,141
Is it because she missed you

54
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:47,661
out of town?

55
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:52,422
Three calls a day.

56
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:55,221
She's worried I don't eat well
and dress warmly at home.

57
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:55,821
Look,

58
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:58,422
she bought me
this pure wool home outfit.

59
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,741
It's really warm to wear.

60
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,782
Isn't the padded jacket you wore

61
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:04,342
a bit drafty now?

62
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:05,422
Stop it.

63
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,141
Yingying now

64
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,221
is well-behaved.

65
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,382
Now whoever calls,

66
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:10,502
she just won't go out.

67
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,141
Recently, in the mock exam,

68
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:14,622
she got 120 in Chinese

69
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:15,661
and 110 for Math.

70
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,462
The scores shot up quickly.

71
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,741
I couldn't stop it.

72
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,862
If it keeps going,

73
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,982
getting into
is Huaguang University is easy.

74
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,141
It would be lucky

75
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,382
to have us.

76
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,582
Yes.

77
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,701
Yingying has been a smart child
since childhood.

78
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:30,382
Was she

79
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,221
spoiled by you?

80
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,061
By the way,

81
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,221
you and Ms. Wei lately...

82
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,782
Zhi's sensitive.

83
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:45,942
I haven't mentioned it to her yet.

84
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:47,141
I just wanted

85
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:48,541
to let her

86
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:49,862
focus wholeheartedly

87
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:50,942
on studying.

88
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,621
This matter

89
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:53,902
can be mentioned later.

90
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,102
Don't let it slip later.

91
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,782
It would affect her mood.

92
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,022
Alright, I got it.

93
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:01,022
Zhi, it's only been two weeks.

94
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:02,342
How did you lose weight?

95
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:03,342
It's exam week.

96
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:04,222
The intensity's high

97
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:05,582
and meals are not on time.

98
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:07,541
When Zhu Yangqi comes back,

99
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,902
let's ask him to work out.

100
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,261
My back and waist kill me after class.

101
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:12,542
I feel lousy all over.

102
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:13,983
Alright.

103
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:15,261
It saves on hiring a trainer.

104
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,181
He seems to return next week.

105
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,022
Scheduled.

106
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,542
Still not on vacation?

107
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,822
Beijing Theater Academy
has no broadcasting.

108
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:22,742
If I got in,

109
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,141
I'd be still staying at school

110
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,542
like Zhu Yangqi.

111
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,301
Why do you keep
talking about Zhu Yangqi?

112
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:33,102
You're not falling for him, are you?

113
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:37,781
Is it that obvious?

114
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:39,382
Since when?

115
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:40,181
Together now?

116
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,301
Not yet.

117
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,582
I must focus on
reviewing cultural courses.

118
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:45,582
When I get into college,

119
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,301
I'll tell him.

120
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,821
I think it's okay.

121
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,101
Those two in the room.

122
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:51,181
Come out to eat!

123
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,101
Don't tell my dad about Zhu Yangqi.

124
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:55,541
Don't tell my dad about Luzhou.

125
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,621
Okay.

126
00:04:59,261 --> 00:04:59,943
Come on.

127
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,061
Good girl,

128
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,542
eat a piece of fish

129
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:03,982
to nourish your brain.

130
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:04,862
- Thank you, Dad.
- Studying is tiring.

131
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:05,502
Look.

132
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:06,582
You've lost weight.

133
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,301
Dad, drink some chicken soup
to nourish your body.

134
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:21,462
Come on.

135
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,542
Red beans and red dates

136
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,261
are nourishment.

137
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:27,862
Come on.

138
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:29,702
For me?

139
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,862
Drink it to look healthy.

140
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:31,942
Thank you, Dad.

141
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,781
Dad, let me get you some greens.

142
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:39,741
Eat more.

143
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:40,902
Okay.

144
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,181
Try some of the greens.

145
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:46,862
Yingying,

146
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:48,902
serve a bowl of soup

147
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:49,982
for me.

148
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:51,621
Why not do it yourself?

149
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,982
My hands are all greasy.

150
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:57,541
Fine.

151
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,862
I'll get the bowl myself.

152
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:01,221
You're right.

153
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:02,701
Mine is a bit drafty.

154
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:05,102
How is it?

155
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:06,181
Are those delicious?

156
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,062
Very delicious.

157
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:08,181
Then eat more.

158
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,701
Our Xu family's unique recipe.

159
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,422
Come on.

160
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:17,902
My drafty cotton-padded jacket.

161
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,302
I serve you a bowl of soup?

162
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:20,181
Okay.

163
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:21,261
Serve more.

164
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:25,262
All the good stuff

165
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,462
went into your bowl.

166
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,621
I'll give you this bowl.

167
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,462
No need.

168
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:32,302
I don't want to go.

169
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,022
I haven't finished saying to you.

170
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,741
Then let's talk about it another day.

171
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:37,101
Yingying, that's enough.

172
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,462
- It's fine.
- Go. He is waiting for you.

173
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,022
Then I'm leaving.

174
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:40,621
Bye-bye.

175
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:41,342
- Hurry up.
- Bye-bye.

176
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:42,422
- Bye-bye.
- Let's go.

177
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,462
Bye-bye, Mr. Cai.

178
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,221
Bye-bye.

179
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:44,982
Bye-bye!

180
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:45,622
That's enough.

181
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:47,062
It's not a farewell forever.

182
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,102
Dad, let's watch some TV.

183
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,741
Okay.

184
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,302
Watch what?

185
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,062
Watching the show

186
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,181
you've been following?

187
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:07,982
Anything is fine.

188
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,022
So sleepy.

189
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:07,621
L-Let's sleep.

190
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:16,662
- Good night.
- Good night.

191
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:38,301
Hello.

192
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,581
I was just watching TV with my daughter.

193
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,862
(Reporting today's situation.)

194
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:47,823
(After dinner,)

195
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,782
(I especially watched TV with my dad.)

196
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,822
(His mood is very stable.)

197
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,822
(Now your boyfriend's not so stable.)

198
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,461
(No message in six hours.)

199
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:03,022
(I thought you were in the bathroom)

200
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,102
(and passed out.)

201
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,982
(I'm afraid my dad sees me
replying too frequently.)

202
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,062
(He might suspect.)

203
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,341
(Can we video call later?)

204
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:14,461
(No.)

205
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,662
(You wish.)

206
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,501
(I'm going to sleep.)

207
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:21,902
(Good night.)

208
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,582
(You better pray
for a snowstorm in Beijing)

209
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:26,461
(can trap me.)

210
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,702
(Or I'll fix you
when I return to Qingyi.)

211
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,141
(Promise kept, Shy Boy Chen.)

212
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:41,863
(I advise you)

213
00:09:41,943 --> 00:09:43,862
(not to provoke me
who you left in Beijing,)

214
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,822
(feeling all neglected.)

215
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,381
(I'm going to sleep,)

216
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:49,501
(really tired.)

217
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,582
(Today was a busy day.)

218
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:52,782
(Really exhausted.)

219
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,062
(Spend time with your dad.)

220
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,261
(I have taken a backseat.)

221
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:10,982
(Call me if you miss me.)

222
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:12,102
(Any time is fine.)

223
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:29,048
(Vacation, Day 1)

224
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:36,381
Please come in.

225
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:40,381
Awake?

226
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:41,982
Good morning.

227
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,702
Do you want to have breakfast?

228
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:47,101
Haven't you had peanut porridge

229
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,541
I made in a long time?

230
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,261
Get up soon.

231
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:52,461
It's ready.

232
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,582
Okay.

233
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:55,301
Alright, waiting for you.

234
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,581
(Day 2)
Please come in.

235
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,822
What do you want for lunch today?

236
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:08,622
Water spinach,

237
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,702
ribbonfish,

238
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:11,062
lotus root and peanut soup.

239
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:12,501
Just these three, right?

240
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:14,381
And brown sugar glutinous rice cake.

241
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:15,662
Wait.

242
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,181
(Day 3)
Zhi!

243
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,461
Eat.

244
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,541
What to eat?

245
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:27,902
Your favorite fried small river shrimps.

246
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,102
The canteen doesn't have it.

247
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,902
Let's start.

248
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,301
Smells good.

249
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,742
(Day 4)

250
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,022
Dad, you haven't cooked yet.

251
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:45,102
Where are you going?

252
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,341
Today I don't have time.

253
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:48,542
Order takeout yourself.

254
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,501
I-I have to work overtime
at the hospital.

255
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,581
(Day 5)
I go for a run.

256
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:58,023
After that,

257
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,102
bring me
a serving of Fengxiang xiaolongbao.

258
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,016
(Day 6)

259
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:11,622
Dad.

260
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:13,461
What for dinner?

261
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:15,662
Don't rush me.

262
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,662
Skipping a meal won't starve you.

263
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:19,141
Wait a moment.

264
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,141
(Day N)
Dad,

265
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:25,782
I...

266
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:27,301
When will you go back to school?

267
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,541
Booking tickets early is much cheaper.

268
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,742
- Come on. Have a drink.
- Come on.

269
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:45,782
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

270
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,181
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see!

271
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:52,742
Just downed it in one?

272
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:53,422
Of course.

273
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:54,662
How are things lately?

274
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:55,582
- Absolutely!
- Fine.

275
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:56,582
- Pretty good.
- It's fine.

276
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:57,462
You're pretty good?

277
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,742
I'm okay for now.

278
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,782
Just a bit too tired lately.

279
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:04,421
- Don't mind me.
- Try that dish.

280
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,501
- Go ahead.
- Not bad.

281
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,421
- Eat this.
- Try this.

282
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:08,501
Hello, Zhi.

283
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,101
My boyfriend in Beijing,

284
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,581
you're not done yet?

285
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:13,942
I'm eating out.

286
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:15,022
I just didn't see it.

287
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,101
I'm eating this late.

288
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,181
Aren't you asking why?

289
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:22,782
If you don't love me anymore,
don't force it.

290
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,822
Stop teasing. I'm serious.

291
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,421
Xu has been acting weird lately.

292
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,142
Do you remember?

293
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:29,022
When I just got back,

294
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,421
he made me a new dish every single day.

295
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:32,663
But now,

296
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:34,301
I asked him what he was making.

297
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,022
He said skipping a meal won't starve me.

298
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:37,663
Today is weirder.

299
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:39,421
He asked me when I'll return to Beijing.

300
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:42,301
Don't overthink it.

301
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,501
Aren't parents like this?

302
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:45,662
Distance creates beauty.

303
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:48,141
Parents miss kids
when they're not around.

304
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,982
But get frustrated
when they're always there.

305
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:52,341
But now every day he

306
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:54,221
comes back later and later.

307
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:55,902
Once he returns, he heads to bedroom.

308
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,381
Zhi, you know what you're acting like now?

309
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,982
Like a bad guy hurts you.

310
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:01,982
You come find a backup for comfort.

311
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:05,381
No, Xu is really acting strange.

312
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:06,942
He got a call last night,

313
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,541
saying it was an emergency and left.

314
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,381
What kind of emergency in andrology?

315
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,221
There should be some, right?

316
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:16,102
Young, single guys

317
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:17,862
with a lot of curiosity.

318
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,622
They get themselves into trouble.

319
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,261
For example?

320
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,822
For example...

321
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:26,862
Why don't we order something else?

322
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,542
Someone just arrived said

323
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:29,341
BBQ is delicious.

324
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,342
- Not bad.
- Sounds good.

325
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:31,822
I haven't had seafood for long.

326
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:33,782
- Waiter.
- I really miss the crabs from Qingyi.

327
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:34,862
How many are attending?

328
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:35,942
Who's all there?

329
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,702
Ke, Zhang Yu,

330
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,221
and a few classmates.

331
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,022
See what else to add.

332
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:41,902
Ke,

333
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:42,863
don't order mine.

334
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,022
I'll be going back soon.

335
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,261
Wang Yue awaits me to revise the thesis.

336
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,221
You just came and you're leaving?

337
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,222
Yeah.

338
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,822
- It's rare for us to gather.
- Right.

339
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,141
Why are you revising thesis?

340
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:52,863
Do it tomorrow.

341
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:54,301
- Exactly.
- Ke will be with you.

342
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:55,261
I'll accompany you.

343
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,062
Zhang Yu,

344
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,982
he is leaving. Won't you stop him?

345
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:00,102
Chen Luzhou

346
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,341
is quite busy now
with the math modeling competition.

347
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,261
So don't hold him back, right?

348
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:05,261
Wait. You...

349
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:07,702
Don't imply anything
between Zhang Yu and me.

350
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,622
My girlfriend is still on the call here.

351
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:10,902
How do I explain this?

352
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,141
Honey is checking up on you.

353
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,702
Female desk mates?

354
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,022
What if I get jealous?

355
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,141
Stop it.

356
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,142
Student gathering.

357
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:22,261
Why would you be jealous?

358
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:26,022
Chen Luzhou, I'm jealous.

359
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:28,061
I originally wanted to tell you

360
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,102
I want to take back what I said earlier.

361
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,622
Because I really miss you in Qingyi.

362
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,662
But now I don't want to take it back.

363
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:37,301
Because I'm angry.

364
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,221
That's it.

365
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:39,381
Bye-bye.

366
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,822
I'll stay with you, okay?

367
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:46,501
I'm leaving.

368
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,221
Leaving now?

369
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:49,301
I'm going back.

370
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:50,421
- Take your time eating.
- Bye-bye.

371
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,101
- Okay.
- See you.

372
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:52,703
Okay.

373
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,421
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

374
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,461
Please come in.

375
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,542
There's an emergency.

376
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:02,222
I have to go.

377
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:03,622
You're going out again, huh?

378
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:04,942
I kept a bowl of wontons.

379
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:05,662
Have it.

380
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:06,742
Or it will be soggy.

381
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:30,782
Director,

382
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,301
my son is still lying here.

383
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:33,381
Why not take care of him?

384
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:34,903
Sir, he just has external injuries.

385
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,181
We've already treated him.

386
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,942
There are several
more serious cases now.

387
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:41,023
Ms. Wei's son is also in there.
He was hurt bad but gave up his bed.

388
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,902
What does her son have to do with me?

389
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,622
- My son is still lying here.
- Alright.

390
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,301
No fighting.

391
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,141
Enough.

392
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:48,782
We'll take your son to radiology

393
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:49,742
for a quick X-ray.

394
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:50,663
Rest assured.

395
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,702
Arrange it now, okay?

396
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:51,982
Okay.

397
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:52,823
Don't worry.

398
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:53,862
No problem.

399
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:54,502
- Go.
- Thank you.

400
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:55,622
Come on.

401
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,061
What's going on here?

402
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:57,862
So many people.

403
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:58,501
Perfect time.

404
00:16:58,622 --> 00:16:59,301
Listen.

405
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:00,501
Be mentally prepared.

406
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:01,943
Ms. Wei's son

407
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,181
just sent to emergency room.

408
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,581
It's that serious?

409
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:06,582
There was a fire
in boys' dormitory building.

410
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:07,662
Take a look.

411
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:10,101
Burns shouldn't be sent to our hospital.

412
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:10,942
Not burns.

413
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,381
He acted bravely.

414
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,982
He ran to save his classmates

415
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,622
and got hit by a load-bearing pillar.

416
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:17,622
Hit there?

417
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,782
Don't make everything about

418
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:20,862
your department,

419
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:21,422
okay?

420
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:22,582
I work for it.

421
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:23,702
Then what I should do?

422
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:25,862
He thought his mom

423
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,061
worked here as a doctor.

424
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:27,863
He came here

425
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:29,742
and used up the hospital's resources.

426
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:30,422
You know?

427
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:31,542
He wanted to give his bed

428
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:32,902
to one of his classmates.

429
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:33,623
He's arguing

430
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,221
about this matter with his mom.

431
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:36,341
I asked you to come here

432
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,581
to persuade them.

433
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,662
If I hadn't seen so many people,

434
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:42,461
I would think you were talking nonsense.

435
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:43,381
I...

436
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:45,221
I'm doing this for your good. You...

437
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:49,501
Everything else is fine, right?

438
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,581
It only hurts here?

439
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:51,822
It really hurts right here.

440
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,221
It might be a bone fracture.

441
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:54,301
You must have a check-up.

442
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:56,101
Look at you.

443
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:58,421
Didn't your school
have fire drills before?

444
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,101
You were outside perfectly fine,

445
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,341
but you ran into the fire.

446
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,421
What were you thinking?

447
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:04,782
There are firefighters
for saving people.

448
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:06,782
Did you really need
to play the hero here?

449
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:10,501
How is Lin doing?

450
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,301
Dr. Xu, you came too.

451
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,141
Mr. Cai told me
there was a major accident.

452
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,702
To avoid being short-handed,

453
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,022
he asked me to come.

454
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:19,382
We just said

455
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:21,421
this time it's actually quite dangerous.

456
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,501
Lin,

457
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:23,902
you are very brave.

458
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,782
Hello, may I ask
where Dr. Xu Guangji is?

459
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,102
He just seemed to go over
to the emergency ward.

460
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:38,581
Thank you.

461
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,022
He just knows how to play the hero.

462
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,622
What heroics did I perform?

463
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,022
My roommate is sleeping inside.

464
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,261
I can't watch them

465
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,142
be burned to death.

466
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:56,261
Exactly.

467
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:57,662
Exactly.

468
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:58,782
So you are here.

469
00:18:58,862 --> 00:18:59,743
It's fine.

470
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:00,902
No need to worry.

471
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,342
Dr. Xu,

472
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:03,702
I didn't mess up, right?

473
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:04,782
A real man.

474
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:05,581
This point,

475
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:06,862
I support you.

476
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,102
Take it easy.

477
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:09,542
The leg is injury?

478
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:10,622
I forgot.

479
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:11,382
Forget it.

480
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:13,261
- Let's talk outside.
- Okay.

481
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,942
Mom, say whatever
you have to say to my face.

482
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,102
I know you are dating.

483
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,662
Nonsense.

484
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,381
I already know. Don't pretend with me.

485
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:25,381
Just date.

486
00:19:25,742 --> 00:19:26,862
I'm not going to oppose.

487
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,341
Lin,

488
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:31,341
take good care of your injury.

489
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:32,862
After you are discharged,

490
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:34,862
I will prepare a big gift for you

491
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,461
to commend your bravery this time.

492
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:41,702
When you are discharged,

493
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:44,421
I'll give you a big gift.

494
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:46,542
Rewarding you for being so young

495
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:49,102
and staying in such a swanky room.

496
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:50,341
Okay?

497
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:02,461
Thank you, Dad.

498
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:03,622
You...

499
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,302
You brat.

500
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:05,461
Don't mess about. Lie down.

501
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,022
Anyway, it's just a matter of time.

502
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,261
Slow down.

503
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,261
Is that

504
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:19,062
your daughter?

505
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:25,102
Zhi.

506
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:27,301
Why are you here?

507
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,022
You left your phone at home.

508
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,942
I brought it over in case you needed it.

509
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:35,062
Hello.

510
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:37,181
T-This is Ms. Wei.

511
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:38,862
Hello, Xu Zhi.

512
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,381
Dad,

513
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:44,461
actually,

514
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,381
you could have just told me earlier.

515
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,622
It's okay.

516
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,541
Actually, I

517
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:52,301
was planning to tell you after a while.

518
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,461
It's okay. I'll head back.

519
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:55,421
Ms. Wei,

520
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:56,902
come over for a bite.

521
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:58,022
Let's meet up.

522
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:00,581
Okay, thank you.

523
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:01,742
I'm leaving.

524
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:02,902
By the way.

525
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,022
On your way back,

526
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:07,622
be careful.

527
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:08,742
Okay.

528
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:10,581
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

529
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:30,793
(Tickets Information)

530
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,942
I've prepared all the attachments
and proof materials.

531
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:38,943
Luzhou,

532
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:40,461
just attach them at the back.

533
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,022
Luzhou.

534
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,261
Hey.

535
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:53,782
What's wrong?

536
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:56,982
Zhi didn't answer the phone.

537
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:01,742
Don't worry.

538
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:02,742
She was jealous.

539
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:03,381
Yeah.

540
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,461
She might be mad at you.

541
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,421
My girlfriend does this often.
It's okay.

542
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:07,982
Right, her phone may

543
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:09,301
not be charged.

544
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:09,783
Normal.

545
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:10,902
Yeah. That's possible.

546
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:17,782
I'm listening.

547
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:19,622
She didn't answer. No one at home.

548
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:20,822
But don't worry.

549
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,022
I'll go nearby to search.

550
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:24,663
Alright then,

551
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,102
give me a call if you have news.

552
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:27,662
Okay.

553
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:37,022
I'll return Qingyi.

554
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:38,583
Don't worry.

555
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:40,181
I return before the competition, okay?

556
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:41,782
It's okay.

557
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:44,341
- Sorry.
- Stay safe.

558
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:15,582
Xu Zhi.

559
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:16,662
Xu Zhi!

560
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:18,022
You finally showed up.

561
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:18,983
Where did you go?

562
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,261
Why not answer the phone?

563
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,341
I didn't bring my phone.

564
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,421
It is charging.

565
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,982
Chen Luzhou has been going crazy
looking for you?

566
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:28,421
He has booked the air ticket.

567
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,702
Hurry up and call him back.

568
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,702
Really?

569
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,381
Hello,

570
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:56,461
where are you?

571
00:23:56,662 --> 00:23:57,982
I'm on the way to the airport.

572
00:23:58,461 --> 00:23:59,382
Competition will start.

573
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:00,782
What's gotten into you?

574
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:02,461
I should be asking you.

575
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,062
Why not answer my call?

576
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,822
You beat me.

577
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:13,541
What time is your flight?

578
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:15,141
1:30 AM.

579
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:16,702
I'm fine.

580
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:17,782
Go back quickly.

581
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:19,982
If the weather is bad,
you won't make it back.

582
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:22,141
Your effort this half semester
will be wasted.

583
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:30,381
Chen Luzhou,

584
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:33,742
are you worried that
I'll break up with you?

585
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:39,341
I-I don't know what to say.

586
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:42,822
Maybe I haven't seen you for long.

587
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:44,702
During this time,

588
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:45,942
I've been really busy.

589
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:47,541
We haven't had a good chat.

590
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:49,662
I'm just worried you...

591
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:57,982
Cai Yingying said

592
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:58,983
she couldn't reach you.

593
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,381
I feared you were in trouble.

594
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:03,102
I went to the hospital.

595
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:05,942
I hurried and forgot my phone.

596
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:07,062
Why went to the hospital?

597
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,301
Are you feeling unwell?

598
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,261
No.

599
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:10,221
It's my dad.

600
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:11,421
He took an emergency case

601
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:12,542
and went to the hospital,

602
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:13,462
without his phone.

603
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:14,622
So I brought it to him.

604
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,381
I happened to meet his girlfriend.

605
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:19,782
It took a while.

606
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:21,581
Girlfriend?

607
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:23,782
When did he have a girlfriend?

608
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:26,982
She's the chief at my dad's hospital.

609
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:35,501
Chen Luzhou,

610
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,301
now I only have you.

611
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:42,822
As long as you don't break up with me,

612
00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:44,381
we won't break up.

613
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:47,261
Wait for me at home.

614
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:48,902
I'll be back soon.

615
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:50,542
I'm fine.

616
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:51,622
I'm quite good.

617
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,581
I'm happy for my dad.

618
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:55,581
I understand.

619
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,662
Shy Boy Chen,

620
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:03,341
I'm a bit angry right now.

621
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,702
Because you were harsh to me.

622
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,902
I was really in a hurry just now.

623
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,942
How about this?

624
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,221
When I go come back, you...

625
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:12,662
You beat me up.

626
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:14,502
Do whatever you want.

627
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:16,662
If I dare to make a sound,
you can discard me.

628
00:26:17,102 --> 00:26:18,102
Is that okay?

629
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,301
That's more like it.

630
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:23,662
Alright, it's too late now.

631
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:24,742
Go back quickly.

632
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:26,461
Wang Yue and Li Ke are waiting for you.

633
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:29,341
Alright.

634
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:36,872

(I just rented it.)

641
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:53,822
(Two buildings away from you.)

642
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,742
(Our College Entrance Examination
scores are door codes.)

643
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,942
(I haven't arranged it yet.)

644
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,782
(You can arrange it as you like.)

645
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:03,381

00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:04,543
(if you want,)

(you can come to my place.)

648
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,381

652
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:18,702
(it's nice to have you.)

653
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,341
Come on. This bottle of wine is amazing.

654
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:48,662
I got this Nverhong

655
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:49,662
when she was born.

656
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:50,501
Today, let's

657
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:51,581
will finish it off.

658
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:52,782
Today?

659
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:53,583
Dad, you say

660
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:55,141
you'll drink it at my wedding?

661
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,422
Your wedding

662
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:57,862
will be ages away.

663
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,221
I've decided.

664
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,782
I'll be nicer to the two of us.

665
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:01,261
Open!

666
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,662
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

667
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:04,022
I'll bring a boy back tomorrow.

668
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:04,742
Do you believe?

669
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:05,623
Okay.

670
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:07,581
But it can't be that "pig".

671
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:09,101
Don't call him "pig".

672
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:09,783
You're a "pig".

673
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:11,301
I don't care what he is.

674
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:12,381
Anyway, it's not okay.

675
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:15,141
Then let's just drink.

676
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,261
Let's do it!

677
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,261
When pouring the wine,

678
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:20,982
indeed,

679
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:21,943
I feel emotional.

680
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:23,301
You see, this year,

681
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,702
we're all here.

682
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,421
Why this Spring Festival

683
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:27,702
passed a bit

684
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:29,782
different from previous years.

685
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:32,582
Actually, it's because they

686
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:34,221
have gradually all started school.

687
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:36,341
Yingying will start school
next year, right?

688
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:37,942
It'll be half a year

689
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:39,022
before she can come home.

690
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:39,743
So,

691
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:41,301
this year's reunion dinner

692
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:42,662
is meaningful.

693
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,022
It's okay.

694
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,381
As long as it's for studies,

695
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,742
I can meet her

696
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:47,822
once a year.

697
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:48,942
But it's no problem.

698
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:50,541
Don't have much pressure.

699
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,221
Forget those

700
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:53,421
top universities.

701
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:55,061
I don't have high expectations.

702
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,742
Just get into a first-tier university.

703
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:57,262
You sure?

704
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,622
(Did the competition end?)

705
00:28:58,702 --> 00:28:59,462
First-tier!

706
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,942
You're treating it like a trip
to the grocery store.

707
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:03,142
But fortunately,

708
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:04,822
I have potential.

709
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:06,381
And I'll get in

710
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:07,622
and become

711
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:08,862
a great host later.

712
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:10,022
Right, Zhi?

713
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:10,782
Alright.

714
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:11,862
Yes.

715
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:13,501
You've been "tearing down the walls"

716
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,181
for our family's arts and culture cause.

717
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,181
I knew you'd be unkind.

718
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,582
May your wishes come true.

719
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:19,543
Happy New Year!

720
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:20,742
- Come on.
- Happy New Year!

721
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,862
I'm going to deliver some food.

722
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:41,141
Are you going out?

723
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,582
Wear more clothes.

724
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:43,662
Okay.

725
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:46,421
Terrible tolerance.

726
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:50,341
Will your dad

727
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,902
choke himself with all that snoring?

728
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:53,822
I've never heard such loud snoring.

729
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:55,341
Better than your dad's drill.

730
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:56,822
It's your dad.

731
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:04,221
(This year's Spring Festival
saw a heavy snowstorm in Beijing.)

732
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,381
(Many workers couldn't reunite)

733
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:07,862
(with their family)

734
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:10,141
(for the construction
of the motherland.)

735
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:11,982
(The next program)

736
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,461
(will be performed by a special team.)

737
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:17,141
(They will express
their respect and longing)

738
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:19,542
(for these great workers)

739
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:20,662
(through songs and dance.)

740
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,582
(On this day of family reunion,)

741
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:24,742
(let us together)

742
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:25,663
(to those...)

743
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:27,181
There are fireworks, Zhi.

744
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:27,983
So beautiful.

745
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:29,102
So nice.

746
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:30,743
(Next up,)

747
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,221
(please enjoy Hope of Spring,)

748
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:34,301
(a dance brought by)

749
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:35,341
(the special team.)

750
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:35,823
Yes.

751
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:36,982
Let's set off fireworks.

752
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:38,181
But it's banned.

753
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:39,662
Not the big ones.

754
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:40,702
Just the sparklers

755
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:41,782
on a stick.

756
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:43,062
Very beautiful.

757
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:44,822
Go.

758
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:45,942
Let's go.

759
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,662
(It can also let those working outside)

760
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:53,301
(feel the care and blessings from home.)

761
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:54,381
Go.

762
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:01,301
Why don't you wear my shoes?

763
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,101
Yours are thin.

764
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:03,181
It's okay.

765
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:07,341
Yingying,

766
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:09,102
where to buy fireworks?

767
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,301
I brought her here.

768
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:14,381
Two meals.

769
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,982
It is worth ten meals.

772
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,181
You must miss him crazy.

773
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:32,501
I brought him to you.

774
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,221
Weren't you not going to betray me?

775
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:37,062
Wasn't it to give you a surprise?

776
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:39,061
Come on. Let's go play

777
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:40,408
- Go.
- I want to play this too.

778
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:42,622
What are you doing?

779
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:43,702
Please don't.

780
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,541
I'm sorry.

781
00:31:47,062 --> 00:31:48,062
I come back late.

782
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:49,581
You lied to me.

Xu Zhi.

788
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:07,982
Happy New Year,

789
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:09,062

Are you done being lovey-dovey?

794
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,221
We spent a whole day on a train.

795
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:26,301
We haven't eaten.

796
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:28,261
You took the train?

797
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:29,581
Owing to the snow,

798
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,341
flights and HSR are canceled.

799
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,102
Do you want to eat something?

800
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:35,501
Together?

801
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:36,301
I...

802
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:37,862
Let's go.

803
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:39,862
- Go.
- The restaurants are about to close.

804
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,581
Can you stop rushing?

805
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,341
Dr. Xu.

806
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:44,421
Mr. Xu.

807
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,742
During the New Year holiday,

808
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:47,221
why aren't you going home?

809
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,742
What are you doing?

810
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:56,542
I came to give Xu Zhi

811
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:57,622
something.

812
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:01,301
What?

813
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:03,341
What?

814
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,541
Books.

815
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,662
Borrowed in summer vacation.

816
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:13,062
This box is full of books?

817
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:14,102
Yes.

818
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:15,381
A box of books.

819
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:17,341
That must be heavy.

820
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:19,341
She can't lift it.

821
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:19,942
Come on.

822
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:21,062
I'll take it.

823
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,902
Loving to learn is a good thing.

824
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:28,581
Come on.

825
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:29,421
Alright.

826
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:30,501
Troublesome for you.

827
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,581
Why stand there stunned?

828
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,622
Go home and read.

829
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:38,662
Then I'm leaving.

830
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:40,381
The things in my box...

831
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:44,662
Stop messing around.

832
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:56,261
Is he at the same school as you now?

833
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:58,582
Once he got to Beijing,

834
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,141
he was then enrolled in our school.

835
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:03,541
Alright, sleep early.

836
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,381
Go visit your grandma tomorrow.

837
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:06,822
Why not the third day of lunar year?

838
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,221
I'm on duty that day.

839
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,301
Stay a few more days with her.

840
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:12,421
Then this box...

841
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,822
Pack the books and send it to him.

842
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:18,982
He needs it urgently?

843
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:20,181
No.

844
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,102
It's good.

845
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:31,982
You bad boy.

846
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:34,782
To pick you up I barely ate
New Year's Eve dinner.

847
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:35,862
Have you no shame?

848
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:36,823
Half an hour ago,

849
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,542
you sent me a picture of
a big pork hoof?

850
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:39,662
Are you a hungry ghost?

851
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:42,102
Wheel cakes.

852
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:43,782
Freshly made. Tasty and affordable.

853
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:45,141
Boss,

854
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:45,943
get me

855
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:47,181
five

856
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:48,421
taro ones,

857
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:49,381
five matcha ones,

858
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:50,942
and three meat floss ones.

859
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,862
- Okay.
- Are you a pig, eating so much?

860
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:54,501
That's the way it is, alright?

861
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:55,862
You're a cabbage. I'm a pig.

862
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:56,942
Isn't it fine?

863
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:57,982
What?

864
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:58,943
Others will only say

865
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,702
a good cabbage got chewed by a pig.

866
00:35:01,902 --> 00:35:02,982
Sir, two red bean ones.

867
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:03,542
Sure.

868
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,822
Didn't you never
eat red bean paste before?

869
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,022
Xu Zhi loves to eat it.

870
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:10,902
- I shouldn't ask.
- Sir,

871
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,622
do you have red bean ones?

872
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:14,862
Gu Yan!

873
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,702
You also came back for the New Year?

874
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,381
Your recent web series is quite popular.

875
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,662
I thought you'd
be busy promoting it everywhere.

876
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:23,221
I'm just a supporting role.

877
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,301
Not really.

878
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,421
Big star starts from small roles.

879
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,181
Right?

880
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:28,421
Right?

881
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,062
You remind me.

882
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:32,862
I'll look for the alumni book
you gave me.

883
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:34,942
In a few years,
it could sell for a high price.

884
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:42,542
I've been competing

885
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:43,622
and haven't watched it.

886
00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:44,982
No problem.

887
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,102
When the film I star in comes out,

888
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:49,581
I'll definitely ask you
to write a review.

889
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:51,461
Miss,

890
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:52,862
the last two red bean ones

891
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,062
have been bought by him.

892
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,221
You...

893
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:56,261
No problem.

894
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:57,461
Give them to her.

895
00:35:57,742 --> 00:35:59,061
That would mean waiting a while.

896
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,141
Taro-flavored one, okay?

897
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:01,982
No, just the red bean ones.

898
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:03,261
Alright, here you go.

899
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,622
Then I won't be polite.

900
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:10,581
Alright, happy New Year.

901
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,022
Bye-bye.

902
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,181
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

903
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:22,902
Is it warm? It's hot.

904
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:23,982
Be careful. It's hot.

905
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:26,501
Sir, is it okay?

906
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:32,421
Wait a moment.

907
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:45,341
Ours are ready.

908
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:46,141
Have to wait more.

909
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:47,061
Please hold them.

910
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:47,742
Thank you.

911
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:48,902
Pack two more.

912
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:52,181
Smells good.

913
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:54,942
It's almost midnight.

914
00:36:57,581 --> 00:36:58,581
I

915
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,381
have something to give you.

916
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:04,622
What is this?

917
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:05,863
It

918
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:07,102
is a safety charm.

919
00:37:08,702 --> 00:37:09,421
In the new year,

920
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,942
you'll make your dreams come true.

921
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:13,662
Thank you.

922
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:15,221
I also wish you a happy new year

923
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,301
and achieve your dreams.

924
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,541
Yingying.

925
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:48,421
What are you doing?

926
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:51,181
Actually, there are some words

927
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:52,622
that I've never said.

928
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:54,023
I originally planned

929
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:55,822
to tell you after you get to Beijing.

930
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:58,622
- At that time, you just stay quiet.
- But...

931
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,022
When I go to Beijing,

932
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:10,822
let me say it.

945
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:31,822
(I made the end table myself.)

946
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:33,181
(Be careful when you use it.)

947
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:34,862
(It might not be very stable yet.)

948
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,622
(Please don't knock it.)

949
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:56,421
(By the way, when you have time,)

950
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,622
(nail pictures on the wall.)

951
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:00,062
(I don't know
if the landlord allows nails,)

952
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:02,461
(so I just use something to stick them.)

953
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,541
(What did you do?)

954
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:15,102
(Crack walnuts.)

955
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,181
(Shy Boy Chen,)

956
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:19,622
(are you crazy?)

957
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,782
(Why crack walnuts during the new year?)

958
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,982
(I'm hungry.)

959
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:31,782
(Didn't you just go out to eat?)

960
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:33,221
(The shops are closed.)

961
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,141
(I only bought a few cakes.)

962
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:44,702
(There are two cans of cat food)

963
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:46,221
(left in the fridge.)

964
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,461
(Manage for one night.)

965
00:41:47,702 --> 00:41:48,702
(Be good.)

966
00:41:57,862 --> 00:42:00,541
(If you don't love me anymore,
then don't force it.)

967
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:30,982
How did you know here?

968
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:32,501
Zhi told me.

969
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:33,822
Room 903.

970
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,421
When did you two become so close?

971
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:37,421
Why not ask me directly?

972
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:39,902
Would you tell me?

973
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:42,102
Why not go home?

974
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:43,301
You fought with Dad again?

975
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,141
That house is so big.

976
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,501
It doesn't have atmosphere.

977
00:42:46,902 --> 00:42:48,022
I want to live with you.

978
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,622
It can't accommodate you.

979
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:50,702
Go home.

980
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,902
Luzhou,

981
00:42:53,221 --> 00:42:54,862
your house isn't small.

982
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:57,341
Why can't it accommodate me?

983
00:42:58,341 --> 00:42:59,982
I can pay you rent.

984
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:04,982
Open the door, Luzhou.

985
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:10,301
Luzhou,

986
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:11,822
how long has it been since

987
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:13,102
we last slept in the same bed?

988
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:15,101
It was probably since

989
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:17,461
I found out you were wetting the bed
in elementary school.

990
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:21,501
Luzhou, you have your own place now.

991
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:24,541
Does it mean you won't go back anymore?

992
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:30,942
Are you still my brother then?

993
00:43:32,982 --> 00:43:33,982
Don't be pretentious.

994
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:35,221
Go to sleep.

995
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:37,421
Why not reply to me?

996
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,782
You've called me brother
ever since you could talk.

997
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:47,102
That won't change.

998
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:48,862
Alright then.

999
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:50,742
Then at that time,

1000
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:52,862
I'll just not go back

1001
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:54,582
and move in to live with you.

1002
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:55,662
You wish.

1003
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,541
Go back obediently tomorrow.

1004
00:43:57,662 --> 00:43:58,662
Did you hear me?

1005
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,301
Your house is big enough.

1006
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:02,782
Why

1007
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:03,982
can't it accommodate me?

1008
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:09,461
Luzhou, don't worry.

1009
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:11,662
I will not disturb you and Zhi.

1010
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:13,462
I can go sleep on the couch.

1011
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:14,982
Shut up and sleep.

1012
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:17,461
Okay.

1013
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:22,581
Tuck yourself in tight.

1014
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:57,702
I heard you came back for vacation.

1015
00:44:58,822 --> 00:44:59,822
I just arrived yesterday.

1016
00:45:00,341 --> 00:45:01,942
Why didn't you tell me?

1017
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:03,902
It was Xingqi who told me.

1018
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:05,982
He's with me now.

1019
00:45:06,862 --> 00:45:07,942
I'll send him back.

1020
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:11,782
Do you want...?

1021
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,102
Want to come to my place
for the New Year?

1022
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,622
I'll go tomorrow

1023
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:17,062
to pick you up?

1024
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,501
No need.

1025
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:23,301
Luzhou,

1026
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:25,782
Happy New Year.

1027
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:30,141
Happy New Year, Mom.

1028
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:32,982
