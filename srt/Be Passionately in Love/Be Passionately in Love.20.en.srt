(I am Xu Zhi's Boyfriend)

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Senior.

19
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,841
I brought another batch over.

20
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:54,560
Take a look.

21
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,841
You can pick one.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
How about this one?

23
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,401
And this one.

24
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,721
I think it's nice.

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Okay?

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,480
Just get a corner for me.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Come on.

28
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,960
You've come many times.

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,921
I've told you,

30
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,600
you can't even get into

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,761
the freshman art exhibition.

32
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,160
Stop dreaming.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,881
Even if you beg me more,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
it's useless.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Senior.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Help me out.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,801
If the booth doesn't work,

38
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,721
can you get any open space

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,041
for me?

40
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,201
I can place it on the ground.

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Okay?

42
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you force me to tell you the truth?

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,000
I know the capabilities
of you freshmen well.

44
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,921
People like you who haven't much talent

45
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,841
are recruited
to boost others' confidence.

46
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:42,321
Here's my advice to you.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,281
Instead of wasting time on painting,

48
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,560
you might as well be a fitness coach.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Zhu Yangqi.

50
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,560
Zhu Yangqi.

51
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:10,321
You didn't get in the exhibition,

52
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,960
so you feel ashamed?

53
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:13,922
At least you got into

54
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:14,960
a first-tier university.

55
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:15,761
What about me?

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,201
I'm repeating a year.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
It's uncertain if I can get in.

58
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,520
Compared to you,

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
I should feel more ashamed.

60
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,881
I never said that.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Come on.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,600
What for?

63
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:31,841
Come over.

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Sit down.

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
I'll play you a song.

66
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:58,959
♪We are not afraid of
the complicated world♪

67
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:02,576

00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,960
♪Can beat the night♪

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,921
This is my favorite song recently.

70
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,560
During my art exam studies in Qingyi,

71
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,600
I always felt like I can do better.

72
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:17,201
After coming to Beijing, I realize

73
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,440
the gap between people

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,801
is really huge.

75
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,921
I can't distinguish
between front and back nasals,

76
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:26,560
while others are reciting
tongue twisters at triple speed.

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,841
But so what?

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
99 percent of people in this world

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,801
are here to be the participants.

80
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,322
But it doesn't prevent

81
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:35,881
us, the ordinary ones,

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,961
from working hard

83
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:38,440
to chase our dreams.

84
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,560
Don't compare with others,

85
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,881
but who you were yesterday.

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Zhu Yangqi,

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,921
if one day I look down on you,

88
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,600
it must be
because you gave up on yourself.

Want to make a bet?

92

This day next year,

93
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,881
I will attend a Beijing university.

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
And you

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,841
will hold a school exhibition.

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Do it or not?

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Yes.

98
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:20,724

00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:23,841

(watching Hachiko?)

104
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,201
(How ruthless are they?)

105
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,841
(Maybe they have emotional disorders.)

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,000
(Oh my, so cold-blooded.)

107
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,640
(Being in relationship
with someone like this is terrifying.)

(Shy Boy Chen)
(Crying is just a surface issue.)

109
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,761
(It's because your emotions
have always been suppressed.)

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,721
(When you encounter something upset,)

111
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:12,080

(Then you may find your spirit back.)

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,640
(Got it. Thank you, Professor Chen.)

114
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,080
Still couldn't cry?

115
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,640
Don't force yourself.

116
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,000
I told you

117
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:49,600
that you are not suited
to be an architect.

118
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,721
Why do you say that?

119
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,681
When you were young,

120
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,401
you couldn't even draw an egg properly.

121
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,361
You smashed the model I gave you

122
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,361
to pieces at the time.

123
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:04,761
You said

124
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
that the thing you hate most is houses.

125
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,361
I said that out of anger.

126
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,761
You stood me up at that time.

127
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,361
So you broke the gift

128
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,361
I gave to you?

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,841
This is how you are.

130
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,560
You never consider my feelings.

131
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,960
Do you think I want to be your daughter?

132
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,600
You made me give up
studying architecture.

133
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,682
Do you know how much

134
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:35,401
effort I've put in
to get where I am today?

135
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:37,841
You just left,

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,201
leaving me, Dad, and Grandma behind.

137
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,600
Have you ever considered us?

138
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:43,641
Since I was a kid,

139
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,681
I've never received your praise.

140
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:50,160
You were never satisfied with me.

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,721
Everything I do is wrong.

142
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,480
So what do you want from me?

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,080
Want me to die like you?

144
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,801
Come out.

145
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:15,960
Come out.

146
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:32,601
Morning.

147
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:34,721
Here's your egg burger

148
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
and triple concentrated hot Americano.

149
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:39,881
Thank you.

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
A bug on your head.

151
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,881
It's a sleepy bug.

152
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
Really?

153
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,882
So sleepy?

154
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,000
I've already put my sleepy bug away.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Didn't you sleep well?

156
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,521
No.

157
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,200
I dreamt of my mom again

158
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,921
and quarreled with her,

159
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,721
saying a lot of harsh words.

160
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,521
Listen.

161
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,320
Show me a photo of your mom,

162
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,280
I can try to dream of her.

163
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,801
And then beg her in the dream

164
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,080
to stop quarrelling with you.

165
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
You brat!

166
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,320
No one would do that.

167
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,121
But I can show you

168
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:20,240
how cool my mom was.

169
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,400
My mom participated in

170
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,561
a heritage building restoration project
in Europe.

171
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,521
She was the only Chinese girl
on the team.

172
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,000
She liked this photo so much,

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,481
and used it as her profile picture.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Cool.

175
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,481
Just like you.

176
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,521
I really miss her.

177
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,841
We have many misunderstandings
that were not resolved.

178
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,521
My dad said she left me a letter

179
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:53,921
before she died.

180
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,761
But that letter was accidentally

181
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,561
burned with my mom's clothes
by my grandma.

182
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:02,561
I really want to know
what was written in that letter,

183
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,160
but I might never know.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,120
(Ying)
Zhi, are you available this weekend?

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,801
I'll take the exam next month,

186
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:27,881
wanting to go pray.

187
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Want to come along?

188
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:30,681
Let's go together.

189
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:32,681
I want to pray too.

190
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Okay.

191
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,921
As long as
it's not the Fertility Goddess.

192
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,601
Cheers.

193
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:44,280
Eat up, or it'll get cold.

194
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,080
(Blessing tree)

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,841
What wish are you making?
You are so sincere.

196
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:09,441
Zhi, you're here.

197
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,120
Did you see

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,441
the shop selling wishing plaques?

199
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:13,761
Look, here.

200
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,841
Everyone,

201
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,521
do you want to buy wishing plaques?

202
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,001
Go straight over there,

203
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,881
and the shop is at the corner.

204
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,641
Then let's go buy some.

205
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,120
Okay.

206
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,601
Alright.

207
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,521
You go ahead. I'll look around.

208
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:26,801
I'll buy one for you.

209
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:27,360
Okay.

210
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,960
Alright. Let's go.

211
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Okay.

212
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Hello.

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,120
We only accept wishing plaques here.
No letters.

214
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:54,921
Really?

215
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:56,761
Sorry.

216
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,320
What did that person just tell you?

217
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:13,841
He said I have a talent,

218
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,721
asked if I wanted to sever worldly ties.

219
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:17,761
What did you tell him?

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,160
My minds are a jumble

221
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,601
and I'm too obsessed.

222
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
Just an ordinary person.

223
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,801
Let's go buy wishing plaques.

224
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,681
I thought you didn't go.

225
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
You didn't want to buy it.

226
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,881
Now you do?

227
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,841
We have made our wishes,

228
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:42,762
and hung the plaques.

229
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,000
It should work, right?

230
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,320
Definitely.

231
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Trust me.

232
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,160
Next year,
I will wait for you in Beijing.

233
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Okay.

234
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,400
I have to go back to finish my work.

235
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,320
I'll pay the bill.

236
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I'll do it.

237
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,761
No, sit down.

238
00:13:58,761 --> 00:13:59,160
Let's go.

239
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
You sit.

240
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,921
Okay. You do it.

241
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,641
Caught a cold?

242
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Wear my jacket.

243
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
It's colder outside.

244
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Let's go.

245
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:41,912
(Ms. Lin Qiudie.)

246
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,801
(Aunt Lin,)

247
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
(hello.)

248
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
(My name is Chen Luzhou.)

249
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,040
(I am Xu Zhi's boyfriend.)

250
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,320
(Xu Zhi said she quarreled
with you in a dream.)

251
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,841
(I am a bit worried,)

252
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,721
(so I took the liberty
to write you this letter.)

253
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,841
(I hope this won't bother you.)

254
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,360
(During the time I have been with her,)

255
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:21,841
(she has mentioned you several times.)

256
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,921
(I can tell from her words)

257
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,280
(that she has admired you greatly
since childhood.)

258
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,200
(Your death was a huge blow to her.)

259
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,481
(She has always wanted your approval.)

260
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,481
(Perhaps her grades
weren't good before,)

261
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,360
(but you might not know)

262
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,441
(she scored 738
in College Entrance Examination)

263
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,000
(and got into Huaguang University
as the first place.)

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,240
(She is now a student
of School of Architecture.)

265
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,521
(Her grades are excellent.)

266
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,801
(I wrote this letter only to tell you)

267
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,200
(that Xu Zhi is excellent)

268
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:53,721
(and loves you so much.)

269
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,841
(Just like you loved her.)

270
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,960
(You had been strict to her.)

271
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:00,681
(She loved playing water.)

272
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,841
(When she almost flooded
the living room,)

273
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,441
(she got a scolding from you)

274
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,601
(and lost her pocket money for a month.)

275
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,240
(I can tell you were very angry.)

276
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,400
(But your most proud work)

277
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,000
(was built on water.)

278
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,441
(Perhaps when you
drew the design drafts,)

279
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,681
(you were thinking of your daughter.)

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,441
(I want to ask you for a favor.)

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,080
(If she dreams of you again next time,)

282
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:28,000
(could you praise her)

283
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,921
(and say you love her?)

What is it?

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,641
I met your dad before coming to Beijing.

308
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,481
Young man.

309
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:25,881
Want pan-fried buns?

310
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:29,040
Just a moment.

311
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,881
One portion.

312
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Okay.

313
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,521
You won't

314
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,521
go abroad again, right?

315
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:03,641
Then you

316
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
and

317
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:06,561
Zhi...

318
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
I haven't contacted her.

319
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,681
H-Haven't contacted?

320
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,080
After returning,
I have things to handle.

321
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,801
I'm not forbidding you two from dating,

322
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
but

323
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:27,120
she's my daughter.

324
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm afraid she'll be deceived

325
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,521
or get hurt.

326
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,681
It's not that I don't trust you.

327
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,761
We are both men.

328
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:46,841
You know

329
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,601
men are no good.

330
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,200
My dad has never said these to me.

331
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:06,360
I guess so.

332
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,120
I planned to tell him about us

333
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,481
during the winter vacation.

334
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:12,881
Don't.

335
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:14,721
I think he's quite afraid of me.

336
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,080
For what?

337
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,360
Afraid I'll take his daughter away.

338
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,561
I didn't understand him before.

339
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,161
As a grown man,

340
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:25,681
why is he so dependent on you?

341
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,881
But after you told me about your mom,

342
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,360
I feel like he only has you now.

343
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,208
(Zhi)

344
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:05,368
(Zhi)

345
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,000
Hey, Dad.

346
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Hello?

347
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,481
Are you Dr. Xu's daughter?

348
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,521
You are...

349
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
I am his caregiver.

350
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,320
He has gone downstairs.

351
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:28,040
I thought you might have
an urgent matter, so I answered.

352
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:29,921
You're the caregiver.

353
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,400
What's wrong with my dad?

354
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,481
Is he not feeling well?

355
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Not at all.

356
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,280
It's nothing major.

357
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,120
Today, someone made a scene
at the hospital,

358
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,721
and something happened.

359
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:42,960
Your dad has a slight concussion.

360
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Nothing serious.

361
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,521
Mr. Cai asked him
to be admitted for observation.

362
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,400
Was he attacked?

363
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:49,521
No.

364
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,200
He was trying to break up a fight.

365
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,721
The floor was slippery
after being mopped,

366
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,080
and he was in a hurry,

367
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
so slipped right after stepping out.

368
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:58,801
Is he okay?

369
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,280
He's fine. Don't worry.

370
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,000
By the way,

371
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,881
Mr. Cai gave him

372
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,080
an award for bravery.

373
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,601
He went to receive the award.

374
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Okay.

375
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,641
It's good that he's fine.

376
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,801
I'm giving you a big award.

377
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,561
(Award for Attempting Bravely)

378
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:14,320
How do you feel? Happy?

379
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you think I can be happy?

380
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Explain it.

381
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,481
It is easy to understand.

382
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:25,160
Award for Attempting Bravely.

383
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,921
I was attempting bravely.

384
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,601
But you can't say so here.

385
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,120
Where's my prize?

386
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:33,400
By the hospital.

387
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,681
I've given you the award.

388
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,080
No prize.

389
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,200
I'll give you a fried bun.

390
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
How can you be so stingy?

391
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,441
For the hospital, I even

392
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:42,160
got a concussion. Feel it.

393
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,682
Back here.

394
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,080
There's even a bump.

395
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,761
See?

396
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:45,442
Feel it.

397
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:46,801
Let Ms. Wei feel it.

398
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,601
That won't do.

399
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,120
No prize, then...

400
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,841
Medical expenses.

401
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,521
No reimbursement.

402
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,521
What?

403
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,160
Then, sorry.

404
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,960
I can't take this.

405
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,160
This insults my dignity.

406
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:00,841
Okay.

407
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
I'll reimburse you myself.

408
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,441
Alright, come on.

409
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:05,681
You will reimburse me.

410
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:06,442
Be good. Take it.

411
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:07,641
I'll just hold onto this,

412
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:08,641
for you.

413
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Alright.

414
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:12,001
Tell me.

415
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,921
Have you told

416
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,080
your daughter

417
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:16,681
about your act of bravery?

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,601
What for? No.

419
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:19,160
Wait.

420
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:21,681
Aren't you now on good terms

421
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:23,601
with Ms. Wei?

422
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,521
You should tell your daughter about it.

423
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,681
She is studying out of town now.

424
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,481
She will come back

425
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,481
during holidays.

426
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,641
Hiding this from her is not okay.

427
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,761
Your daughter is at a sensitive age now.

428
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:36,921
What if

429
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:37,921
she disagrees?

430
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
So,

431
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,521
she doesn't come back much.

432
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,481
I just want to delay

433
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,360
a bit.

434
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,080
Besides,

435
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,200
she just started college.

436
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,120
I'll wait till she graduates
to bring it up.

437
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,360
You look a little embarrassed.

438
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:56,241
What?

439
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,641
Feeling embarrassed

440
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:59,240
towards your girl or Ms. Wei?

441
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:02,601
Well, it's hard to handle it.

442
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,721
It's okay. I understand you.

443
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,200
I understand you.

444
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:07,801
Are you okay?

445
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:09,921
I'm so mad.

446
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:11,601
Take a look.

447
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:12,200
Look.

448
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,601
What he gave me.

449
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,681
Well.

450
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,000
Award for Attempting Bravely.

451
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:20,080
I was so helpless. He...

452
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,200
He's just teasing me.

453
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,521
What kind of award is this?

454
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:25,882
Maybe many people

455
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:27,240
are laughing at me.

456
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,960
Do you think I'm useless?

457
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:32,801
No way.

458
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,761
That troublemaker was holding a knife,

459
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:36,841
standing in front of me.

460
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,801
So many people in the hospital,

461
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,681
only you stood out

462
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,441
to solve the problem.

463
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,801
You are a hero.

464
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
- This Mr. Cai.
- I've risked it.

465
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,120
I'll go argue with him.

466
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Don't.

467
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:51,080
I've got some compensation from him.

468
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,481
By the way,

469
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,761
your daughter called.

470
00:25:58,481 --> 00:25:59,881
She sounded quite anxious.

471
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:00,721
Did you answer that?

472
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:01,721
Yes.

473
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But rest assured.

474
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,601
I told her I'm your caregiver.

475
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,441
Sorry.

476
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
For me,

477
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:11,921
you even had to lie.

478
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:13,801
Not at all.

479
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,481
I know about your family's situation.

480
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:20,441
Xu Zhi is a very sensible
and well-behaved child.

481
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:23,360
And my son has just entered high school.

482
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,441
I hadn't thought about
reorganizing the family so soon.

483
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:33,120
We're taking care of each other now.

484
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,601
I have someone
to care about in my heart.

485
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,320
I'm pretty content.

486
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,001
Wait until the children

487
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,040
get a stable job and life.

488
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:43,481
It's time for us to discuss our future.

489
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,761
Alright.

490
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
As you wish.

491
00:26:57,921 --> 00:26:59,400
(Finished the call with my dad.)

492
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:07,761
(Shy Boy Chen)
(Raining cats and dogs,)

493
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,921
(she said she would always love me.)

494
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,641
The data report you want

495
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,441
has just been printed out.

496
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:21,601
Calculate again to see

497
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:22,200
if it's right.

498
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Okay.

499
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:32,248
(Rain cats and dogs)
(Finished the call with my dad.)

500
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:42,080
(Shy Boy Chen)
(How is Mr. Xu?)

501
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,960
(He is hospitalized,
but nothing serious.)

502
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,601
(He fell because of the slippery floor.)

503
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:47,960
(Got a mild concussion.)

504
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,521
(Go back early to keep him company.)

505
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,120
(What does the saying
in your profile mean?)

506
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
(I think you've already forgotten
what you said)

507
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
(before.)

508
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:16,801
(I hope in your days without me,)

509
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,320
(your world will still shine brightly,)

510
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,000
(teeming with flowers and applause.)

511
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:25,601
(As long as it still rains in Qingyi)

512
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:27,481
(and the puppy wags its tail,)

513
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,721
(someone will always love you.)

514
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,200
Chen Luzhou, come over and take a look.

515
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:54,360
(Stop here.)

516
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:56,280
(Li Ke is asking me
to finish the report.)

517
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,160
(You go to bed first. Good night.)

518
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,641
You are staying up so late

519
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,641
to work with me,

520
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
not chatting with Zhi.

521
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,040
If she knows, she won't be angry, right?

522
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Get lost.

523
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:14,441
By the way,

524
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,641
Zhang Yu asked me
to have a meal few days ago.

525
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,761
She asked me if you had time.

526
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,200
I told her you went

527
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
to date your girlfriend.

528
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,441
She asked me that,

529
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,601
and I said another day.

530
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:27,561
I remember that you two
had a good relationship.

531
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:28,841
But now you don't seem close.

532
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:30,360
Let me tell you.

533
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,040
We've discussed privately

534
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,360
that she probably likes you.

535
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:39,681
What do you mean?

536
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:41,441
Feeling regretful?

537
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:43,681
Are you an idiot?

538
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
We were desk mates,

539
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:47,960
and interactions are needed.

540
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,601
But she doesn't like me.

541
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,921
Are you sure?

542
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
She often mentions you to me.

543
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Now we're in college.

544
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,521
She still wants me to invite you.

545
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,400
Do you ever think of a possibility

546
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,960
that she likes you?

547
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,801
What? Me?

548
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:03,120
How is that possible?

549
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,801
If she liked me, I'd know.

550
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,521
You were such a blockhead back then,

551
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:09,521
only focused on studying.

552
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,360
You felt annoyed on playing.

553
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,320
How can you know she likes you?

554
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,200
Think it through.

555
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,000
During the final exams,

556
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,922
why did you

557
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:22,441
always have breakfast on your desk?

558
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
D-Didn't you buy it for me?

559
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm nice to you,

560
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:30,160
but not that nice.

561
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,801
Zhang Yu brought you.

562
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:36,761
Chen Luzhou.

563
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,521
Don't be kidding.

564
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:41,320
Don't mess with me.

565
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,441
I am serious.

566
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
It's the truth.

567
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,441
Besides, you're a top student

568
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:48,801
and very handsome.

569
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,681
Have some confidence, okay?

570
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,921
What's wrong?

571
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,481
Feeling regretful?

572
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Get lost.

573
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Tell me once you've done.

574
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,681
Hello, everyone.

575
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,120
Mr. Wan is busy today,

576
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,320
so I'll be substituting.

577
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,801
Some of you might not know me.

578
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,000
My name is Bai Jiang.

579
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
After this class,

580
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,240
I hope you all learn something.

581
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,841
Don't let my teaching go to waste.

582
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
That student,

583
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
aren't you grouped?

584
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:48,280
No.

585
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:49,801
Sit in the second row.

586
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:54,601
Did everyone get the teaching aids?

587
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,801
- Yes.
- Yes.

588
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:58,641
Today,

589
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:02,881
let's set the textbooks aside.

590
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,841
It's better to practice
than to only learn theory.

591
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:08,561
Look.

592
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:09,960
Today I will teach you

593
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:13,360
about sandbox simulation management.

594
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,441
Let me announce the results.

595
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,200
We have a total of nine groups today.

596
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,681
Only Group Two and Four
haven't gone bankrupt.

597
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,801
Now, let's have the two group leaders

598
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:02,881
introduce themselves.

599
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,561
Zhang Qikai, Class 2, Metalworking.

600
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:09,481
Group Four

601
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:11,841
relied on industrial upgrading
to become bigger.

602
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:15,721
It is unquestionably the first place.

603
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:16,721
It is worth encouraging.

604
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,441
Group Two.

605
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:25,841
Sir,

606
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:27,601
I'm not from your college.

607
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:28,681
I'm here just to audit.

608
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:30,280
Audit?

609
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,881
Yes.

610
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
I wanted to transfer

611
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:33,681
to economics next year.

612
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:35,921
Today,

613
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,841
your group

614
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:38,841
surprised me the most.

615
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,441
When everyone

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,080
was committed to

617
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,280
industrial upgrading,

618
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:45,641
yet you relied on

619
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,200
producing basic products

620
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:48,681
to survive.

621
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
Tell me what you thought.

622
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:53,721
When we were halfway
through the simulation,

623
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,360
we noticed
our deficit was already large.

624
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:57,000
Since the market

625
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,641
is largely driven by supply and demand,

626
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,481
rather than blindly expanding,

627
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:01,321
we might take a risk,

628
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,721
focusing on basic products.

629
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,921
The profit is low,

630
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,360
but its market is broad.

631
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,240
Maybe we can make up for the deficit.

632
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Well said.

633
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:12,400
Please sit.

634
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Thank you, Sir.

635
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,240
Everyone heard that?

636
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,801
Today's assessment

637
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,960
fully illustrates a point.

638
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:24,481
Theory says

639
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,360
success comes
only through industrial upgrading.

640
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,360
This path is crowded with people,

641
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,521
but there is more than
one path to success in reality.

642
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,641
Just like our lives,

643
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:41,000
there is not only one

644
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:42,721
standard answer.

645
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
See.

646
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,280
This is a competition.

647
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:59,801
Moreover, it concerns
the future of Chen Luzhou.

648
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,841
If he gets familiar with Professor Liu,

649
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,801
it'll help him switch majors and get

650
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
into grad school.

651
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:07,240
We should think for him, right?

652
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:09,522
But...

653
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:11,000
I appreciate your kindness.

654
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,400
But if it were me, I'd choose Bai Jiang.

655
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:16,120
I just audited his class.

656
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:17,960
And I read a few of his papers.

657
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,881
In terms of academic ability,

658
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,561
he's no worse than
those popular mentors.

659
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:23,721
And somehow,

660
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,641
I feel he suits us better.

661
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,442
Alright.

662
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,761
You get two votes now.

663
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,441
I'll contact Bai Jiang then.

664
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,801
Hold on.

665
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,240
You're from the Computer Science School.

666
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,761
Why do you have his WeChat?

667
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:42,841
You support him so much.

668
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,441
Is he your relative?

669
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Not yet. I suppose.

670
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:51,280
What do you mean?

671
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:55,960
Actually,

672
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,881
he's my girlfriend's dad.

673
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,481
Dad...

674
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,240
Wang Yue, you!

675
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,561
What?

676
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:02,561
For your own gain?

677
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,921
Luzhou also appreciates him.

678
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
At most, it's an accidental success.

679
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,360
Alright, just wait.

680
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,601
When Ke and I go to your wedding,

681
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,400
can we skip giving the wedding money?

682
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,881
You might get married quicker.

683
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,320
Looking at the two of you,

684
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,521
you could get married anytime.

685
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:20,921
Me and Xu Zhi?

686
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:21,960
- Yes.
- Who else?

687
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:23,921
Are we that clingy?

688
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,160
You just realized?

689
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
In the passion phase.

690
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:30,721
Please bear with us.

691
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,601
Tolerate it for a moment of calm.

692
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,960
Step back and I'll get angry.

693
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:38,561
Attack!

694
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:43,442
Come on.

695
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,960
Time to celebrate Cai Yingying
wrapping up her art exam.

696
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,721
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

697
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:47,721
Congratulations!

698
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,641
As long as you can
get last year's score,

699
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,681
you're set for first-tier.

700
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:54,641
Don't worry.
I'll study hard when I go back.

701
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:57,280
I'll study as hard as I can.

702
00:36:58,441 --> 00:36:59,441
When are you going back?

703
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:00,841
Tomorrow.

704
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,721
So soon?

705
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,921
Zhi, I'm going to miss you.

706
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,080
It's only for a few days, right?

707
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,441
It's winter vacation soon,

708
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:11,400
and we'll be going back.

709
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Alright.

710
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:13,681
By the way,

711
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,921
the date for the competition is set.

712
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,280
I won't go back.

713
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,521
No problem.

714
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:27,960
It's only for a few days.

715
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Zhi.

716
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,921
We need to move forward.

717
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,160
Chen Luzhou, you've got some nerve.

718
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,601
What are you two doing?

719
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,960
I'm the boss today.

720
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,522
Let's drink.

721
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:42,960
- Come on. Keep drinking.
- Cheers.

722
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,481
Cheers!

723
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,481
Cai Yingying,

724
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,921
I have to go prepare for my competition.

725
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:01,681
See you then, okay?

726
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:02,080
Alright.

727
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,641
Zhi, let's leave.

728
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,761
Zhi will leave with you?

729
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
She needs to go with me.

730
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:13,240
Okay, no problem. You guys go.

731
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:14,681
I'll accompany her.

732
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay.

733
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,360
Bye-bye.

734
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:16,881
See you.

735
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:24,881
Thank you, Stylish Zhu.

736
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:28,881
For what?

737
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,641
Thank you
for discovering a beautiful host.

738
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Beautiful host.

739
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,040
I'll take you somewhere.

740
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:48,120
Why being mysterious?

741
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,200
You'll know it.

742
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:52,521
Alright.

743
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,080
Close your eyes. Don't peek.

744
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:55,721
Go up two more steps.

745
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,562
Are we there?

746
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:58,000
Two steps.

747
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,561
Why being mysterious?

748
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,641
Move forward.

749
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,240
What is it?

750
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,201
Not yet. Move forward.

751
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,320
Anything here?

752
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,561
No, you'll know soon.

753
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:05,521
Turn right.

754
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,761
Turn right.

755

Five more steps.

756
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:10,481
- One, two, three, four, turn right.
- One, two, three, four.

757
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Alright.

759
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
How is it?

760
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:21,000
Zhu Yangqi's personal art exhibition?

761
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,521
You painted all these?

762
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:23,521
Of course.

763
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,761
Look, who is that?

764
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,801
That? That is me.

765
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:28,161
No way.

766
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:30,681
These legs need
to be 10 centimeters longer.

767
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,200
And make this waist slimmer.

768
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,321
Make the eyes bigger.

769
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,481
And make the head smaller.

770
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,121
No, no.

771
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:38,200
I'm a painter, not a retoucher.

772
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Okay?

773
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:41,561

I've started missing you.

807
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:46,761
Stop it.

808
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:47,842
You said you missed me,

809
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,521
but you got a full score in Calculus.

810
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,681
I don't believe your words.

811
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:53,481
It's up to you.

812
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,320
Remember to text me.

813
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:01,320
Let me give you a hug.

814
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Alright.

815
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,080
You better tell me everything.

816
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,882
Sure.

817
00:42:10,882 --> 00:42:13,280
So I'd know
if you faint in the bathroom.

818
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Bye-bye.

819
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,921
Take care.

820
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Okay.

821
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Let's go.

822
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,721
I told you to keep warm.

823
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:54,960
Look, your legs are bare.

824
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Are you feeling cold?

825
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:57,040
Give it to me.

826
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,160
I'll do it.

827
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:00,280
This new car is pretty.

828
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,160
It has promotion.

829
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:03,482
So I sold the old car

830
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:04,960
and added a bit of money

831
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,280
to get this new car.

832
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:07,681
You should've listened to me.

833
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,080
Keeping money means nothing.

834
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,801
