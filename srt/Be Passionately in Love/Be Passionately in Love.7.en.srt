00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,084
It's okay.

191
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,685
I'm so glad

192
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,645
to make friends with you.

193
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:43,204
I have good judgment.

194
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:45,364
You have a bright future ahead.

195
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:47,164
This is for you.

196
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:49,605
Thanks.

197
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,005
Another one is for Xu Zhi.

198
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,605
Her apexing impressed me.

199
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,016
Don't keep it for yourself.

200
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:59,084
Rest assured, I'll give it to her.

201
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,364
Buddy, you're very lucky.

202
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,605
This is a helmet with an autograph

203
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,084
of the future Grand Slam player.

204
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:06,244
Keep it well.

205
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,164
It will be very valuable.

206
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:09,404
Okay.

207
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:10,965
See you.

208
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,164
Yan Letong.

209
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,765
Wait for me.

210
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:21,845
Come on.

211
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:25,685
Luzhou, goodbye.

212
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:41,084
(If the walls in my heart collapse,)

213
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,725
(I'll build an even stronger fortress.)

214
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,204
(Xu Zhi's Moments)
(If all the rivers in the world dry up,)

215
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,885
(I will melt glaciers with my tears.)

216
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:52,885
(If the sun no longer rises,)

217
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,324
(I will try to light all the lamps.)

218
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:03,965
Zhi.

219
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:05,685
What did you post?

220
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,284
It's profound, I can't understand.

221
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:08,084
It's okay.

222
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:09,965
I'll give you a dictionary later.

223
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:11,885
Come on.

224
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,725
(I don't read much. Can't get it.)

225
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:17,645
Even Stylish Zhu can't understand.

226
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:19,324
Let me reply to him.

227
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,084
(Being uncultured is not scary.)

228
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,484
(I'll give you a dictionary later.)

229
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:25,725
Look.

230
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,484
(Very good and positive.)

231
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,005
(Cai Yingying)
(My first business failed.)

232
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:58,284
Why is Feng Jin with them?

233
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:01,244
Linshi?

234
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,005
Lucy is also in Linshi.

235
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,244
You're isolating me, aren't you?

236
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:09,965
You wish.

237
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,005
She's a star.

238
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:27,925
I heard there was a crew

239
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:28,765
in this hotel.

240
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:29,685
Turns out it's true.

241
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,124
Hello, check in.

242
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:41,605
Hello, sir.

243
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,645
Is your room booked with the crew?

244
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:46,084
Okay, wait a moment.

245
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,816
(Welcome the crew to stay)

246
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,484
Why are you here?

247
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,404
Doing post-production.

248
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:11,965
You going out?

249
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:13,084
Yes.

250
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,084
Yingying ate too much last night.

251
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,605
I'm going to buy digestive pills.

252
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:19,044
How is your leg?

253
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:21,565
It doesn't hurt now.

254
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,204
Just a bit bruised.

255
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,765
Why don't you come up with me?

256
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,204
I have digestive pills.

257
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:30,845
And I'll give you something.

258
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:31,805
Okay.

259
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:55,244
You go in first.

260
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:06,244
Thank you.

261
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,324
And this.

262
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,284
Yan Letong got this for you.

263
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,284
He said your apexing impressed him.

264
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,444
This is...

265
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:17,885
He asked me to tell you

266
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,525
that it's a signature
from a future Grand Slam champion.

267
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:22,645
Alright.

268
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,124
In this aspect of narcissism,

269
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:27,404
you've met your match.

270
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,484
You have nothing else to say?

271
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:34,685
What else?

272
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:36,965
(I mean the promised joke.)

273
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:38,525
Never mind.

274
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:39,805
And this.

275
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,164
I bought it on the way.

276
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,645
Remember to use it.

277
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:45,525
Thank you.

278
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:50,805
Are you paying me again?

279
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,044
If you do it again, we'll be strangers.

280
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,765
Why are you angry again?

281
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:02,685
It's not good for your health.

282
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,965
Then reflect on it,
and stop making me angry, okay?

283
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:08,484
Could you consider my feelings?

284
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:09,965
I took you to my workplace.

285
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:11,765
If something happened when you raced,

286
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,685
your dad

287
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:13,965
and Mr. Fu would kill me.

288
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,404
So, you're upset about this?

289
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:17,124
You don't have to worry at all.

290
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:19,805
If my dad finds out I crash my bike,

291
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:21,725
he'll definitely think I deserve it.

292
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:23,605
Then he'll take me to his hospital.

293
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:25,765
Mr. Fu will not blame you.

294
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:27,404
In his eyes,

295
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:30,004
you have to crash before you become

296
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:30,925
a professional.

297
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:32,725
It happened?

298
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:33,965
Yeah.

299
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:35,565
When he took me

300
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,044
for a ride in the practice field,

301
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:38,885
I didn't do the apexing properly

302
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,005
and directly fell.

303
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,725
Luckily, it was not serious.

304
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,685
But my knee was hurt,

305
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:46,484
which led to arthritis.

306
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,885
It hurts on rainy days.

307
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:50,084
It even creaks.

308
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,364
That's why I hate going out
on rainy days.

309
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:54,204
Listen.

310
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:56,765
Are you proud of it?

311
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:57,965
No.

312
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,605
Don't people always say

313
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,364
that what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger?

314
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:03,925
That was kind of a brush

315
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:05,605
with death, right?

316
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,404
I'll definitely succeed.

317
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,484
Are you still angry?

318
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:17,484
How about

319
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,685
I owe you another joke?

320
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:21,765
I owe you two jokes then.

321
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:22,765
What do you say?

322
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:25,965
You remember?

323
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,484
Of course.

324
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:30,124
I'll tell you one joke.

325
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:31,084
Okay.

326
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,364
Actually, it's not a real joke.

327
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:36,765
It's something new.

328
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:38,925
And it can also serve as a reminder.

329
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,685
My dad met a hot guy

330
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:41,805
in his department.

331
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,445
A very handsome boy.

332
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,324
But he's not very healthy.

333
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,284
He denied it.

334
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:48,925
He couldn't complete a test.

335
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:51,324
It's common among the young people.

336
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,525
They have bad habits, like smoking,
staying up late, and drinking.

337
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:58,488
The survival rate of reproductive cells
is less than 30 percent.

338
00:17:58,845 --> 00:17:59,404
Scary, right?

339
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,845
Your dad is an andrologist?

340
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,164
Chen Luzhou, right?

341
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:20,965
What's wrong?

342
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:22,605
Are you thirsty?

343
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:23,805
I'm not.

344
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:26,005
What else did your dad say?

345
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,605
What else?

346
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:32,444
He said,

347
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:36,004
"Zhi, when you have a boyfriend,"

348
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,845
"remember to take him for a check-up."

349
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:44,525
What's wrong?

350
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:49,845
Why are you nervous?

351
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:50,845
You're disciplined.

352
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,324
I don't think you have problems.

353
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,845
Of course, I don't have those problems.

354
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:03,525
Thank you.

355
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:08,925
Wasn't it funny?

356
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:11,565
I'll tell another one.

357
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:12,484
No need.

358
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:13,805
It was funny. Thank you.

359
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:25,725
Anyway,

360
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:27,284
be careful.

361
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:28,725
Don't get hurt again.

362
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,204
If people like Lv Yang

363
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,885
break their promise

364
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,164
and pester you, what then?

365
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:35,364
I'll call security.

366
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:36,404
Security guards

367
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:38,164
will come in handy, right?

368
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:42,324
Who is it?

369
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:43,284
No idea.

370
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:56,164
Could you tell me
which room Chen Luzhou is in?

371
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,164
CLZ.

372
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:58,845
Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't help.

373
00:19:58,925 --> 00:19:59,565
Just checked in.

374
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,725
You can call your friend.

375
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:01,284
Yingying?

376
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,164
Zhu Yangqi, what are you doing here?

377
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,164
All of you came to Linshi.

378
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:06,845
Can't I come?

379
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:07,885
I'm here for Lucy.

380
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:09,885
Lucy? Chen Luzhou?

381
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,005
He lives here too?

382
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,525
Yes, he just checked in.

383
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:15,124
Though I've called him for half an hour,

384
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:15,805
no answer.

385
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,525
She won't tell me which room he's in.

386
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:18,364
Zhu Yangqi.

387
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:19,685
Come here.

388
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:20,364
Gu Yan?

389
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:21,565
Why are you here?

390
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:23,324
Something happened.

391
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:25,725
What happened?

392
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:26,485
Look.

393
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:27,284
You guys go.

394
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:27,845
Okay.

395
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:31,364
I've already explained it.

396
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,885
My room was booked by the team.

397
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:35,645
The reception asked
if I was with the crew.

398
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:37,324
I thought it was the crew
of the car team.

399
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,284
Sounds like a real story.

400
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:42,204
You're lying.

401
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:43,725
I'll call the police.

402
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:48,765
Mr. Xu, it's a mistake.

403
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:49,885
She's that star.

404
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,005
He's my classmate,
a high school graduate.

405
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:53,765
He's not a paparazzo.

406
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:56,364
The equipment of high school graduates

407
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:57,364
is that professional?

408
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,404
He likes photography.

409
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,685
His parents support him.

410
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:03,404
His mom is a producer
at our city's TV station.

411
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:05,765
His dad is the boss of Bohui Studios.

412
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:08,324
So, he absolutely can't be a paparazzo.

413
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,044
It is a misunderstanding.

414
00:21:11,364 --> 00:21:13,525
The security guards
take it too seriously.

415
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,084
Sorry about that.

416
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,164
It's a mistake.

417
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,364
It's okay. They're friends.

418
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:21,084
It's a mistake.

419
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,124
Send my best to your dad.

420
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:25,244
Thank you.

421
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:29,005
You should thank Chen Luzhou.

422
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:31,885
I'm here to help him.

423
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:37,885
The air is tense.

424
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:39,565
Well,

425
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:41,244
we'll go buy drinks.

426
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:41,925
You guys talk.

427
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:43,484
See you.

428
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,084
What's the relationship between

429
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,124
those two?

430
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:51,244
She's like his simp.

431
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,404
You can see it.

432
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:54,525
She really likes him.

433
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:55,765
She's crazy about him.

434
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,525
Do you have a girlfriend?

435
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:03,005
No.

436
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,725
I really miss you.

437
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:08,565
Are you still mad at me?

438
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:09,765
Chen Luzhou.

439
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,005
I'm crazy about you.

440
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,444
She's not my girlfriend.

441
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,044
(So, it was her.)

442
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:20,525
Is Chen Luzhou

443
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,965
a playboy?

444
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:24,164
No, he's not.

445
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,005
Those girls have a crush on him,

446
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,284
but Lucy has been single since birth.

447
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:29,765
Zhi.

448
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:31,284
Don't worry.

449
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:33,364
What do I have to worry about?

450
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,284
It has nothing to do with me.

451
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,484
If Lucy hears this,

452
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:42,525
his heart will hurt.

453
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:50,164
Lucy.

454
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:54,284
Where is Gu Yan?

455
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:55,885
Back on set.

456
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,645
We bought her milk tea.

457
00:22:58,925 --> 00:22:59,885
You drink it.

458
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:00,605
Don't waste it.

459
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:01,845
You bought it for her?

460
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:02,685
Yeah.

461
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:04,244
She helped us.

462
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:05,284
Shouldn't I

463
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:07,164
do this?

464
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:11,284
You're so generous.

465
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:15,244
Look,

466
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:16,445
how about

467
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,725
we eat hot pot tomorrow?

468
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,164
Tomorrow? No.

469
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:20,765
Zhi and I will visit a temple.

470
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,404
We gained nothing on this trip.

471
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,164
We need to find a way
to change our luck.

472
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:27,124
And I will pray for good grades.

473
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:28,925
There's a Nanyin Temple nearby.

474
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:29,925
It's effective.

475
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:31,404
Do you want to go with us?

476
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:33,725
I have to work.

477
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:35,044
I won't go.

478
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:38,885
Let's meet again in Qingyi.

479
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:41,765
Why is he mad again?

480
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:43,364
I don't know.

481
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:47,444
Let's go.

482
00:23:57,223 --> 00:24:04,152
(Welcome the crew to stay)

483
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:24,364
(I just helped you.)

484
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:25,925
(How will you thank me?)

485
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,044
When you return to Qingyi,

486
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,244
Xu Zhi and I will treat you to a meal.

487
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:31,845
Xu Zhi?

488
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:33,645
The girl with you?

489
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:37,484
Do you have to invite her?

490
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:39,244
Can't you and I eat alone?

491
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:40,044
No.

492
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:41,565
Why?

493
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,044
You helped her and me.

494
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:44,605
We both have to treat you together.

495
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:47,885
So, you like her?

496
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:53,124
Got it.

497
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:55,885
Does she like you?

498
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:01,725
That's none of your business.

499
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:24,565
Dad.

500
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:26,324
You're back.

501
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:30,925
It smells so good.

502
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:33,685
Can you tell what it is by the smell?

503
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:35,525
It's love.

504
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,284
Are you tired?

505
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:41,484
What do you think?

506
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:45,605
Congratulations to you
on the failure of the startup

507
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:46,805
and returning in defeat.

508
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:49,124
How could you be so mean?

509
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:52,484
I'm encouraging you.

510
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,204
You're only 18, right?

511
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:55,845
You have a long road ahead.

512
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:57,004
Failing now means

513
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,725
that you're about to succeed.

514
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:01,244
(Gardenia Doesn't Want to Bloom)
(Who's tricking Zhi?)

515
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,204
(Some people are deceitful, you know.)

516
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:07,685
(I made a mistake.)

517
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:19,164
What?

518
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:20,364
There's this.

519
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,244
Say it.

520
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:25,044
If I pray to a child-giving god,

521
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:26,084
will it be an issue?

522
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,404
If this

523
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,484
is related to Chen Luzhou,

524
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:33,685
it'll be an issue.

525
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:37,124
How do you know it's related to him?

526
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:38,965
(Dan's Snack)
Sir, pan-fried buns.

527
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,404
Come on in and sit down.

528
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:43,084
Here's a side dish

529
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:43,965
for you.

530
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:45,044
Thank you.

531
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:45,965
You're new here.

532
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:47,765
Here's a souvenir for you.

533
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:48,404
Dan.

534
00:26:49,084 --> 00:26:49,525
Dan.

535
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,324
Two more bottles of beer.

536
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:52,645
You two.

537
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,324
You're not

538
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:00,484
working tomorrow? Drinking so much.

539
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:01,485
It's not much.

540
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:02,525
It's only six bottles.

541
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:03,404
Alright.

542
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:04,805
Don't get drunk.

543
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:05,284
Okay.

544
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:06,725
Join us later.

545
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:07,645
Alright, no problem.

546
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:10,685
So,

547
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,845
Chen Luzhou

548
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,124
is so bad, right?

549
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:18,044
Whether he is or not,

550
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:18,965
tell me one thing.

551
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:22,005
What did Zhi say?

552
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,324
She said

553
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,284
she did it willingly.

554
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:30,164
Whether

555
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,124
she did it

556
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:31,765
willingly

557
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:32,925
or not,

558
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:35,645
isn't Xu Zhi too young

559
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:37,404
for this?

560
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:38,204
So,

561
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,324
I just

562
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:41,645
grabbed a knife.

563
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:44,605
Did he go to Linshi with you?

564
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:46,725
Why did you hide it from me?

565
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:47,725
No.

566
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:49,845
Mr. Fu gave him a job,

567
00:27:49,925 --> 00:27:51,124
filming for a car team.

568
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,084
He happened to be in Linshi.

569
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,284
If you don't believe it, ask Mr. Fu.

570
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:56,725
Don't mention him.

571
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:57,765
Tell me

572
00:27:58,204 --> 00:27:58,965
about the god.

573
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:01,725
Here's the thing.

574
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:03,084
Yingying and I

575
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:04,525
wanted to pray for good grades.

576
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:06,164
Chen Luzhou

577
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:07,404
mentioned a temple.

578
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:08,364
So, we went there.

579
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,244
Turns out it's a child-giving god.

580
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,725
We made a blunder.

581
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,044
That's it?

582
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:15,484
Nothing else

583
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:16,765
about it?

584
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:17,645
Nope.

585
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:18,925
Good.

586
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:21,765
So,

587
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:25,484
isn't Chen Luzhou bad?

588
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:29,525
Can't you say it all at once?

589
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,765
You just made me worried.

590
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:34,124
Alright, isn't this just fine?

591
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,124
Anyway,

592
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:39,324
it's not what we thought.

593
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,204
Of course, it's not.

594
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,364
If it is,

595
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:44,845
I'll kill him.

596
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:45,965
Well,

597
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,845
don't worry then.

598
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:51,885
Zhi used to talk about everything

599
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,204
with me.

600
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:55,605
Now, every time I ask her
about Chen Luzhou,

601
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,605
she changes the topic.

602
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:00,484
Oh no.

603
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:01,885
It's not good.

604
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,645
There must be something fishy.

605
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:06,484
But if they really get together,

606
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:08,444
you should take extra precautions

607
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:09,965
early.

608
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:11,765
If they are

609
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,404
in a serious relationship,

610
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,044
it's okay.

611
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:19,565
If Chen Luzhou

612
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,244
cheats on Zhi,

613
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:25,685
I will...

614
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:29,765
Can you do that?

615
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,244
(He's young after all.)

616
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:46,164
(He's very healthy.)

617
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:49,005
Dr. Xu.

618
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,005
I...

619
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:53,685
The indices

620
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:55,525
are all fine.

621
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:56,885
Very good.

622
00:29:57,484 --> 00:29:58,284
You're healthy.

623
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:00,484
Even so,

624
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:02,565
take care of your health.

625
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,725
You're young and vigorous,

626
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:06,965
but don't act recklessly.

627
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:08,685
Be restrained

628
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:10,404
sometimes.

629
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:11,364
I am still a virgin.

630
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:13,765
What's wrong with you?

631
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:15,685
I didn't ask you that.

632
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:17,925
That's it.

633
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:19,005
You can leave.

634
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:19,565
Okay.

635
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:22,044
Wait.

636
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,525
I'll show you something.

637
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:28,565
Is this yours?

638
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,445
(Dr. Xu, it's a thank-you gift.)

639
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:32,885
You already know

640
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:34,925
how to buy a doctor off, huh?

641
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:35,964
(Zhu Yangqi, you fool.)

642
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:36,805
Guess what this is?

643
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:39,164
This is bribery.

644
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:41,965
Sorry. There won't be a next time.

645
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:43,284
No next time.

646
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:46,925
Go to the discipline office
on the fifth floor.

647
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:48,685
And take it back.

648
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:50,525
Goodbye, Dr. Xu.

649
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:54,965
What a troublesome boy.

650
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:58,084
Number 134.

651
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:00,244
Please proceed to the andrology room.

652
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:02,725
How did it go?

653
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:04,204
Did you manage

654
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:05,965
to change your image in front of Dr. Xu?

655
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:07,164
If you didn't mess it up,

656
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:08,284
I'd almost make it.

657
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,044
I told you not to give money.

658
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:10,965
I...

659
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:14,124
I thought he was asking you for that.

660
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:16,525
Wait, I'll go explain.

661
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:17,324
Stop it.

662
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:19,284
Don't go. You'll get things worse.

663
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:22,885
Does Xu Zhi know

664
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,005
about your check-up?

665
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:27,164
She probably doesn't.

666
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,164
Has she contacted you?

667
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:30,605
No.

668
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:31,885
Hey,

669
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:33,204
did you upset her?

670
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:35,084
Why hasn't she replied your comments?

671
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:36,204
Wait a moment.

672
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:37,204
Hello?

673
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:38,444
Basketball?

674
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:42,044
No. Lucy is injured and can't play.

675
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:44,605
Send me the address.

676
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:47,124
Are you still playing?

677
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,124
No trauma now?

678
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:49,805
Dr. Xu said

679
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:52,044
I need a re-examination next month.

680
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:53,204
Rehabilitation.

681
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:57,645
They really said so?

682
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:01,204
So, I advise you

683
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:02,685
to watch your language

684
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,404
in front of your patients.

685
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:05,565
Don't make them

686
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:06,965
overthink.

687
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:08,965
Indeed,

688
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:10,964
I was wrong.

689
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,885
Back then, all I was thinking about

690
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,484
was Zhi.

691
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:15,605
So, I just asked

692
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,444
more questions.

693
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,204
I understand.

694
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:20,324
Well,

695
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:22,805
did you ask your future son-in-law

696
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:24,164
what his family does?

697
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:26,845
His family does business...

698
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,044
Future son-in-law?

699
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:33,925
Don't have my tea.

700
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:34,685
What?

701
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:36,484
Are you speaking for him?

702
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:37,805
No, I'm not.

703
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:38,965
I mean, what if

704
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:40,124
you misunderstood him?

705
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:42,364
What if he's a nice guy?

706
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:45,685
The red envelope
was indeed a misunderstanding.

707
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,885
But I still have to test him.

708
00:32:48,244 --> 00:32:48,965
For example,

709
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,244
I must give him a whole check-up.

710
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,605
He must be a healthy person.

711
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:55,444
How about this?

712
00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:56,925
After you check him,

713
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:57,565
my turn.

714
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,044
I'll check his eyes.

715
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:00,484
His eyes are pretty good.

716
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,084
He definitely likes Zhi at first sight.

717
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:04,845
His vision is definitely fine.

718
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:09,005
Could you switch to better tea?

719
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:09,725
I'm leaving.

720
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:12,244
You can give me good tea.

721
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:14,925
Let's eat together later.

722
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:21,565
Isn't it good?

723
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:23,965
- Go.
- Ok.

724
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,885
Let's go for it.

725
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:31,124
Who's that? Never seen him.

726
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:32,925
He's a newcomer.

727
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:34,244
Go easy.

728
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:35,284
Come on.

729
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:36,484
- Come on.
- Start it.

730
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:37,525
- Come.
- Go.

731
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:46,765
Pretty good, huh?

732
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:47,965
Of course.

733
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:50,084
He's from the school team.
You're no match.

734
00:33:58,885 --> 00:33:59,685
Come on. Let go.

735
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:23,404
Good shot.

736
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:25,845
- Nice.
- Good shot.

737
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:33,965
Why is he so good?

738
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:36,284
Play harder later.

739
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:37,885
You changed your mind?

740
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:39,005
You told me to go easy.

741
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,324
The situation has changed.

742
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:44,044
A man can be killed but not humiliated.

743
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:46,565
I'm here for rehabilitation.

744
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,005
I'm not a sidekick,

745
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,925
and you're not my boss.

746
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:52,845
Come on.

747
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:56,364
If I'm not your boss, who then?

748
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:56,925
Xu Zhi?

749
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:58,805
I don't think she wants to be.

750
00:34:59,124 --> 00:34:59,845
You want a fight?

751
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,404
I won't team up with Zhu Yangqi.

752
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,725
Change teams, four against two.

753
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:05,565
No, no change.

754
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:06,685
Come on.

755
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,164
You play hard,

756
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:09,965
and I'll tell you where Xu Zhi is.

757
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,005
Who cares?

758
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:15,605
Second round.

759
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,164
Come on.

760
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:20,605
Restart it.

761
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:23,965
Come on!

762
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:24,725
First serve.

763
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:25,284
Start.

764
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:26,404
Defend.

765
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:29,404
Defend.

766
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:31,324
Come on!

767
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:33,124
- Nice shot.
- Nice.

768
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:35,404
It's okay. Block him.

769
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:35,925
Watch him.

770
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:37,845
Lucy.

771
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:41,765
Nice shot.

772
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:44,444
It's okay. Again.

773
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:51,364
Defend.

774
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:02,605
Try again.

775
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:03,284
Keep up.

776
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:05,645
Lucy, catch it.

777
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:09,725
Keep it up.

778
00:36:15,444 --> 00:36:16,204
What's going on?

779
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:17,324
You said four against two.

780
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:18,404
Don't be a fence-sitter.

781
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:19,044
Sorry.

782
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:20,645
Yangqi knows my weakness.

783
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:22,284
We'll crush him one day.

784
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:24,005
Lucy, catch it.

785
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:32,204
Keep it up.

786
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:42,164
- Nice shot.
- Good.

787
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,324
Luzhou, here's your water.

788
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:46,204
Thank you.

789
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,084
Two Americanos.

790
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:55,525
Want a screen protector?

791
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,685
Do you want a manicure, Miss?

792
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,404
No.

793
00:36:58,484 --> 00:36:59,525
Want a screen protector?

794
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:01,005
No.

795
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,445
(Manicure and Flowers)
It's been several days.

796
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:06,605
Yet very few customers.

797
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:09,164
Can we make money this way?

798
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,485
I don't know.

799
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,605
But at least we earn money
with a clear conscience.

800
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:13,444
We're not cheating.

801
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,885
But we're doing such a small business.

802
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:18,284
When can we

803
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:19,404
make a big fortune?

804
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:21,324
I think

805
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:23,284
we can make
a small fortune for milk tea.

806
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:27,672
(Phone Screen Protector)

807
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,164
How about we learn photography?

808
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:30,885
Maybe we can make good money

809
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:31,605
like Luzhou.

810
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,685
Don't you think
photography costs a lot of money?

811
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:37,204
We can't even afford

812
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:38,885
a lens with all the money we have.

813
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,725
Then I should do my small business.

814
00:37:43,204 --> 00:37:45,044
What has Chen Luzhou been up to?

815
00:37:46,124 --> 00:37:47,485
Probably preparing papers

816
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,845
for going abroad.

817
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,324
He commented on your Moments.

818
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:52,404
Yet you didn't reply.

819
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,444
Because he sent me
to the child-giving god.

820
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:57,765
I need to bench him.

821
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:02,485
Zhi, I'm going to buy a cup of milk tea.

822
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:03,324
You watch my stand.

823
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:08,364
Have a look.

824
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:11,565
Look.

825
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:14,164
Life is like flower seeds.

826
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:16,364
It doesn't have to grow into a rose.

827
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,725
Sunflowers can also
have their own pride.

828
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,284
As long as the goal is the same,

829
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:22,605
once you quit your job,

830
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,404
we will start a happy family.

831
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:25,044
Okay.

832
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:29,765
They are rose seeds.

833
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:31,685
They will eventually grow into roses.

834
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:32,685
Come on.

835
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,925
Can you be a bit logical
about your promises?

836
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:36,044
What do you mean?

837
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:36,925
You know it.

838
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:38,605
Could you play some new tricks?

839
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:40,925
You've come many times
in the past few days.

840
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:42,444
Always with a different girl.

841
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,725
You created a poem to rose seeds

842
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,084
and tricked them
into being full-time wives.

843
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:49,284
It was so cringy.

844
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:50,805
No, listen to me.

845
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:53,164
Keyi.

846
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:55,925
What's wrong with you?

847
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:58,484
I can smash your stand.

848
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:14,124
Who are you?

849
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:15,284
It's none of your business.

850
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:16,845
I'm her customer.

851
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:18,444
It's my business.

852
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:22,364
Hey, man.

853
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,244
This is a nail salon.

854
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:27,124
What's wrong? Can't I have a hobby?

855
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:34,645
Be creative.

856
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,725
Iron Man or Spider-Man is fine.

857
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:39,005
The Hulk is not okay.

858
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:43,484
Still here?

859
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,444
Waiting for a fight or the police?

860
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:50,885
I'm going.

861
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,685
Wait, it'll be done soon.

862
00:39:58,284 --> 00:39:59,525
Are you serious?

863
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:01,484
Isn't this what you asked for?

864
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:05,164
You're biting the hand that feeds?

865
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:06,645
No.

866
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:08,404
Just let me do this.

867
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:09,565
You're my first customer.

868
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:10,324
I'll do one nail.

869
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:11,324
Want rhinestones?

870
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,565
And this one is very beautiful.

871
00:40:21,444 --> 00:40:23,204
A freshman girl got plastic surgery

872
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:24,525
for her lover but was scammed.

873
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,885
She was even despised by her boyfriend.

874
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,484
Who wrote this article?

875
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:33,565
I've seen the original draft.

876
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:35,525
That girl had plastic surgery

877
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,084
to participate in a competition.

878
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:39,124
It has nothing to do with her boyfriend.

879
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,284
Why did you rewrite it like this?

880
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:42,885
To catch people's attention?

881
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:44,324
Sorry, Hui.

882
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:46,204
What era are we in now?

883
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:48,324
Stop writing about girls

884
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,324
doing everything for men.

885
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:51,885
Guess why I brought you

886
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:52,765
here?

887
00:40:52,845 --> 00:40:53,925
Let you find the news peg.

888
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:55,284

917
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:19,605
can you be my customer?

918
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:21,164
What do you do?

919
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:22,324
Screen protectors.

920
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:24,845
I've never put it on my phone.

921
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,084
Your phone is beautiful.

922
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:29,525
It deserves a screen protector.

923
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:31,965
I can't believe this.

924
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,164
Alright, do it.

925
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:37,084
Okay, one customer.

926
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:40,645
Heat it for a while.

927
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:44,925
You make full use of things.

928
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,284
You won't pack up
until you drain me dry, right?

929
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:48,965
I learned it from you.

930
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:50,765
The child-giving god.

931
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:52,324
I haven't made you pay for that yet.

932
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:53,725
Child-giving god?

933
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:56,244
Don't you know the Nanyin Temple
has a child-giving god?

934
00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:57,725
I don't know.

935
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:02,925
That's why you didn't reply to me?

936
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:10,164
I'll tell you a joke to cheer you up?

937
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:11,725
Don't trouble yourself, sir.

938
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,324
Everyone should watch closely.

939

News is all around us,

941
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:25,204
Open your eyes and look.

Hui,

943
00:43:29,324 --> 00:43:30,685
this is newsworthy.

944
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:34,164
A cool guy is actually doing a manicure
on the street

945
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,445
to please a girl.

946
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:36,164
