17
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:40,567
See.

18
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:41,807
How long have we

19
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:42,727
not eaten together?

20
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:44,967
I suddenly realized today that

21
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:47,207
being casual

22
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:48,407
is better than being an artist.

23
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,047
What do you mean?

24
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,767
Ever since you signed the contract,

25
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:55,807
you'd pull a long face

26
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:56,847
every time we meet.

27
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,447
You looked really depressed.

28
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:01,287
I think

29
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,287
it's more important to me

30
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:03,967
that you're happy

31
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:04,727
instead of

32
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:05,887
being famous.

33
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,047
We used to be

34
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:08,607
so carefree

35
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:09,607
hanging out together.

36
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:10,726
We didn't need to care about anything.

37
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:12,767
Anyway,

38
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,407
I, Sui Mingwei,

39
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:16,687
will support you

40
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,167
no matter what you want to do

41
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:20,727
and regardless of the outcome.

42
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,647
I won't let you fall.

43
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:09,607
Hello, Mr. Sun.

44
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:10,687
Miss He.

45
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,767
I want to provide news to you.

46
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:14,727
There's news again?

47
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,887
There are migratory birds
near the homestay?

48
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:21,927
Yes.

49
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:23,487
Okay.

50
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:24,047
I got it.

51
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,687
I'll let my superior know.

52
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,207
It's Mr. Sun again?

53
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:31,407
He's treating you as the hotline.

54
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:33,847
He's experiencing the stay in
Jifeng Homestay now?

55
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,247
He's experiencing for a week there.

56
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,087
He didn't experience much,

57
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:39,047
but he has given me

58
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,047
a lot of news.

59
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:41,967
I think

60
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:44,007
someone is teaching him what to do.

61
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,087
Okay.

62
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:47,287
Go take a look.

63
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,367
I think Mountain Linglong

64
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:49,847
is developing well these two years.

65
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,687
If there are migratory birds,

66
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:52,407
it means that

67
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:54,167
the ecosystem in Wusu is well protected.

68
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:56,047
Okay, I'll go there now.

69
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:56,567
Okay.

70
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,160
(Jifeng Elderly Homestay)

71
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,487
I saw it

72
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:03,807
this morning

73
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,327
when I was walking around here.

74
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:08,287
Where's the exact location?

75
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:09,687
I think it's here

76
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:11,967
or there.

77
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:14,647
There.

78
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:16,926
Mr. Sun,

79
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,166
you've pointed

80
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,127
at the entire homestay.

81
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:22,087
I'm old and I can't remember well.

82
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,487
Anyway, let Qi

83
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,207
bring you

84
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:26,887
to walk around.

85
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,047
You'll surely see something.

86
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:29,047
Look.

87
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,367
The view here is nice.

88
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,607
It's suitable for a walk.

89
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:33,927
Mr. Sun.

90
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:35,487
Mr. Sun.

91
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,007
Good morning.

92
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,487
I think Mr. Sun and the rest

93
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:50,967
have a strategist.

94
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,087
You're thinking too much.

95
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:56,687
Elderly people

96
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:57,527
like to gather around.

97
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:58,487
They

98
00:04:58,687 --> 00:04:59,847
just want you to visit them often.

99
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,447
Didn't you say that

100
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,887
we need to be more patient with them?

101
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:08,167
Are you thirsty?

102
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:09,167
Do you need some water?

103
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:11,567
I brewed this

104
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,047
kumquat tea this morning.

105
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,687
It's good for your throat.

106
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:18,727
No need.

107
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,247
Do you want it?

108
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,047
Just drink a little.

109
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,007
I'm not thirsty.

110
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:31,007
Are you tired

111
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:33,127
from working?

112
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,607
If you can stop

113
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,007
telling lies,

114
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,367
my job would be easier.

115
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:40,607
Listen.

116
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,407
It sounds like a bird flock.

117
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,487
Looks like Mountain Linglong's ecosystem

118
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:00,247
is really not bad.

119
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,847
There might really be

120
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:03,087
migratory birds migrating here.

121
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,687
Did you see
there are how many types of birds?

122
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,207
There were

123
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:11,927
sparrows.

124
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,167
And also...

125
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:16,247
The information says that

126
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,807
the primary level of
bird viewing is that

127
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,447
everything seems like sparrow to you.

128
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:27,927
Xiaoran.

129
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:31,727
We haven't been together like this

130
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:32,607
for a while.

131
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,007
Xiao Shangqi.

132
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:01,367
Don't frighten it.

133
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Okay.

134
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,087
That should be

135
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,407
Eurasian hoopoe.

136
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,247
It seems like there are
many migratory birds

137
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:25,847
here.

138
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,567
It's worth it for us
to research about this.

139
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,047
Let's take a look there.

140
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:34,647
Okay.

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,800
(New Wings Bridge)

142
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:56,327
Well,

143
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:57,567
you shouldn't

144
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:58,567
joke like that anymore.

145
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,167
I know.

146
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,927
We're close,

147
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:04,687
right?

148
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,487
When the atmosphere is right

149
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:07,487
and the emotions are stirred,

150
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,727
we could've done

151
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,327
something ridiculous.

152
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,687
But

153
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:13,247
we've known

154
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,087
each other for many years,

155
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:15,647
right?

156
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:16,207
We grew up,

157
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:17,647
ate and lived

158
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:18,807
together since young.

159
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:19,927
We know about

160
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:21,047
our past well.

161
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,567
We can't be

162
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:23,647
like that,

163
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:25,687
right?

164
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:41,287
Do you have feelings?

165
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,007
I do.

166
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,607
I admit that I was a little
impulsive that day,

167
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,047
but I went home

168
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:54,647
and gave it a thought.

169
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,167
I think I really

170
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,407
have fallen in love.

171
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,087
It's miraculous.

172
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,007
It doesn't really make sense.

173
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:12,647
We've kissed.

174
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:43,647
Why not

175
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:45,807
we be serious

176
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:50,567
and verify it?

177
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:31,247
Hui,

178
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:32,207
let's call it a day.

179
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,167
Take a rest first.

180
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:34,607
Okay.

181
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:24,320
(Sui Mingwei)

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
(Jifeng Elderly Homestay)

183
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:57,167
This batch of good is not bad.

184
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,087
Just send it to me

185
00:11:58,327 --> 00:11:59,007
when you're done.

186
00:11:59,607 --> 00:11:59,927
Okay.

187
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:00,887
No problem.

188
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:03,847
This is cucurbit flute.

189
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:04,847
Li Hui has promised to help them

190
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,047
to form an elderly band.

191
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,407
Mr. Xiao, you're quite influential.

192
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,127
Do you think

193
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,327
she comes here for me?

194
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,167
What are you trying to say?

195
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,807
I'll be waiting for He Xiaoran

196
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:19,607
until she says yes

197
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:21,007
to start the relationship
over again with me.

198
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:23,887
Why are you telling me this?

199
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:25,287
Are you still taking me

200
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:25,927
as your rival?

201
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,527
Li Hui came here today

202
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,047
after verifying

203
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,167
that you're coming.

204
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,527
I'm telling you that

205
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,167
I'll be waiting for He Xiaoran.

206
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:36,727
Yes.

207
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:37,407
But for Li Hui,

208
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:38,847
if you continue

209
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:39,927
delaying it,

210
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:41,647
I'm not sure if she'd wait for you.

211
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,607
Why is the suona broken?

212
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,367
Look at mine.

213
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,127
I don't know what you're talking about.

214
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,327
Mr. Sui.

215
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,007
Are you here to deliver fragrance?

216
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,367
Thank you, Mr. Sui.

217
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:55,727
We're discussing about

218
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:56,927
what program to rehearse.

219
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:57,767
Really?

220
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,047
What do you youngsters

221
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,207
like to hear?

222
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,367
I like old songs.

223
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:06,167
Like

224
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:07,847
Auld Lang Syne.

225
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:08,927
This song is nice.

226
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:09,927
I know this song.

227
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:11,047
Let me sing for you.

228
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,287
Should auld acquaintance...

229
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:14,207
Okay, carry on.

230
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,047
I'm leaving now.

231
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,687
Mr. Sui, I'm still singing.

232
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,087
Let them go as they're busy.

233
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,047
Let's...

234
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:23,367
Let's practice.

235
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,327
What song are we practicing?

236
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:44,567
Sui Mingwei.

237
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,127
You're not a boy

238
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:49,087
in your first love.

239
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,247
Why are you pretending?

240
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:51,847
You know if this feeling

241
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:52,647
is love or not.

242
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,767
You can't control it.

243
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:56,807
Well,

244
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,359
I do have something on
in the fragrance factory.

245
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,367
I've told Li

246
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:06,607
that I just want to be

247
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:07,567
a real musician.

248
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:08,447
He's agreed.

249
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:11,727
Isn't that great?

250
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,367
I've got to know some

251
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,847
new independent musicians.

252
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,927
We're having the same ambition.

253
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:23,647
Maybe

254
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,447
I'll leave Wusu for a while

255
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,087
and go out with them

256
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:28,847
to write some songs

257
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:30,167
and perform.

258
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:34,207
That's not bad.

259
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,607
Just go ahead.

260
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:36,887
We're good friends.

261
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:38,527
If you need me to do anything here,

262
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:39,367
just let me know.

263
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:44,807
Sui.

264
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,767
Do you really think it's not possible

265
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,007
for us to get together?

266
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:57,887
Li Hui.

267
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:00,527
You've never been on

268
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:01,847
my list of romance relationships.

269
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:04,647
You'll never be on that list.

270
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,007
Wei,

271
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,247
try this squab.

272
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,567
It's really nice.

273
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,127
I ordered this for you.

274
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,047
I'll eat this last.

275
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:58,487
Look at you.

276
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,167
You're always like this.

277
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,967
You always keep your favorite food

278
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,967
until the end.

279
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,807
Hui is different though.

280
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,247
She will eat her

281
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,167
favorite food first.

282
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:16,647
What a coincidence.

283
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:18,567
You both like to eat

284
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:19,887
the same food.

285
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,007
So, whatever you keep till the end,

286
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,527
she'll eat it all.

287
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:27,167
Wei,

288
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:29,247
I haven't seen Hui for a while.

289
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,087
What is she doing?

290
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:35,327
Mother.

291
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:38,007
Am I

292
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,647
not reliable at all?

293
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:47,327
Well,

294
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,767
did you fall out of love again?

295
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:54,367
There's something

296
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,247
that I've never thought of.

297
00:16:58,807 --> 00:16:59,967
I might not be able to take it.

298
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,727
What's it?

299
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,087
What's happened, Wei?

300
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,206
What's going on?

301
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,166
Do you need money?

302
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:07,727
It's okay.

303
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,007
I'll sponsor you,

304
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:09,446
okay?

305
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:22,166
Here.

306
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:23,767
Eat more.

307
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:31,447
We wanted to gather for your leave,

308
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:32,967
but Sui said he has
something on suddenly

309
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:33,847
and can't make it.

310
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:35,767
Look at you.

311
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,687
You're finally free

312
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:38,887
and Sui becomes busy.

313
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:40,847
He's avoiding me.

314
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,087
Such a coward.

315
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,127
Why is he avoiding you?

316
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:45,607
I kissed him.

317
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,167
Who did you kiss?

318
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,407
I realized I like him.

319
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,087
What's going on?

320
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,087
Tell me.

321
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,887
Look at how nosy you are.

322
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:03,807
What's going on?

323
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:05,567
A few days back,

324
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,487
I just realized that

325
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:09,327
Li signed me up as a singer

326
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:10,327
because Sui has gone

327
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:11,367
to many record labels

328
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:12,847
to deliver my demo.

329
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,647
I don't know why.

330
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,247
Maybe I was moved.

331
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,287
Maybe I was

332
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,127
impulsive.

333
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,327
So, I kissed him.

334
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,327
But actually when I think back,

335
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:34,687
isn't he my best friend?

336
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:36,927
We'd always step up

337
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:38,927
for each other.

338
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,487
But why did

339
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,207
I kiss him?

340
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:46,687
I don't understand.

341
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:51,367
I don't understand.

342
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,207
But the only thing that I'm sure of

343
00:18:56,007 --> 00:19:00,087
is the feeling of having goosebumps

344
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,127
can't lie.

345
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:02,727
I like him.

346
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,407
I like him very much.

347
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,127
Did you notice that

348
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,407
after he fell in love with you,

349
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:11,207
he has changed a lot.

350
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:12,847
Did you notice that

351
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:13,967
he's become so faithful

352
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,887
to life and relationship?

353
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,087
Sui and I

354
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:19,767
are...

355
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:20,807
Stop. I know.

356
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,847
I know you two are not together.

357
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,207
I'm not trying to talk about the past.

358
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:25,847
There's nothing going on with us.

359
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,047
Not even in the past.

360
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,087
Okay, I believe you.

361
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:29,407
I know.

362
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,087
I remember

363
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,727
a boy called me

364
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,967
Green Worm

365
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:38,847
when we were

366
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:39,807
in Grade six.

367
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:40,927
I was really angry.

368
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:42,327
The next day,

369
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:43,447
he received a lot of geometer moths

370
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,447
in his pencil case.

371
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:47,047
We were still talking about it

372
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:47,887
in the gathering few days back.

373
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:48,727
That boy

374
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:49,567
would avoid Chinese scholar trees

375
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,087
whenever summer is here.

376
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:52,647
Did Sui do that?

377
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,047
That sounds like him.

378
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:57,807
Also, when I was in my sophomore year,

379
00:19:58,887 --> 00:19:59,367
I started to

380
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,087
like rock and roll.

381
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:01,367
I wanted to get my hair dyed

382
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,047
but I messed it up.

383
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:05,447
So,

384
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,127
my classmates were laughing at me.

385
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:09,687
But then they stopped.

386
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:10,647
Guess what happened.

387
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,047
What happened?

388
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,287
Look at this photo.

389
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:17,567
He drew all the attention away.

390
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:18,927
The academic department found out

391
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:19,687
and punished him to

392
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:20,767
write a 1,000-word report.

393
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:21,567
Who would

394
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:22,687
get his hair dyed in green?

395
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:24,367
The green hair

396
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,567
is ugly.

397
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:32,847
Many times

398
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:34,367
I wanted to quit singing,

399
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:39,967
it's him who

400
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,207
encouraged me.

401
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:44,007
He's weird.

402
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:46,527
He'd enlighten

403
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:47,807
me right away.

404
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:52,927
You just understand at once.

405
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:54,807
Even his kindness

406
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,287
is easy to be seen.

407
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,447
Actually, I admire you.

408
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:03,447
You're always

409
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,327
straightforward

410
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:05,527
in relationships.

411
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,487
You never pretend.

412
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:09,847
I'm not straightforward.

413
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:12,247
He's been frightened by me

414
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,127
that he's run away.

415
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:16,967
What about this photo?

416
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:17,567
This one.

417
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,167
This one?

418
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:20,487
He lost to me on a bet

419
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:21,527
so I cut his hair.

420
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:22,887
That pinch of hair.

421
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,447
You're mean.

422
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:27,087
It took him a while to
grow his hair back.

423
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:32,527
Why is he not coming yet?

424
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,207
Is it Sui?

425
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:35,567
Where's he now?

426
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,047
He said the fragrance factory is busy

427
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:38,767
and he can't make it.

428
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:41,407
What?

429
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,487
Let me call him.

430
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:43,367
No need.

431
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:44,767
Even if he's coming now,

432
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:45,567
he won't make it.

433
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,447
It's okay.

434
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:50,927
Take care.

435
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:52,127
Take good care of yourself.

436
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,087
This is not life and death.

437
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:58,247
I'm just

doing what I like.

Okay.

467
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:08,287
Li.

468
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:10,847
Why didn't I see Chen Fei'er

469

in the meeting?

470
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:12,687
She's taken leave.

471
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:13,487
She's got something to do at home

472
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,487
so she went back to Hupu.

473
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:16,527
What happened?
How many days she'll be away?

474
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:18,007
About a week.

475
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:18,847
I heard that she's requested for

476
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,327
three months of advance payment.

477
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:20,967
Are you looking for her?

478
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:22,087
It's okay.

479
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:22,847
It's okay.

480
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:30,007
Who doesn't have anything happening

481
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:30,807
at home?

482
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:20,487
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:21,807
It's okay. Get back to work.

484
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:33,087
Coming.

485
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,887
Mr. Xiao Shangqi.

486
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:40,447
Taiyang.

487
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:41,807
Why are you here?

488
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,407
I need to go to Hupu.

489
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:44,487
It's weekend today.

490
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:45,847
Can you help me take care of him?

491
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:47,447
I've called He Xiaoran as well.

492
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:48,727
I'll be back

493
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:49,967
tonight or tomorrow.

494
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,047
Stay here with Mr. Xiao.

495
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:55,207
I'm leaving.

496
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:04,727
Taiyang,

497
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:07,727
let's have a weekend plan?

498
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:08,727
Okay.

499
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:09,647
Okay.

500
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:10,167
Let's go.

501
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:14,367
Why are you getting heavier?

502
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:18,847
You're hitting me.

503
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,367
You're sweating.

504
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:38,767
Look.

505
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:47,007
I wonder what happened

506
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:47,767
to Fei'er's family

507
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:48,927
and if it's solved.

508
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:50,967
No matter what happened,

509
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,247
I believe Chen Fei'er

510
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,367
can handle it now.

511
00:26:57,527 --> 00:26:58,247
She didn't tell us

512
00:26:58,447 --> 00:26:58,967
so she must be thinking of

513
00:26:59,127 --> 00:26:59,927
handling it alone.

514
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:01,687
But, Lin Zong is around.

515
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:02,967
It should be fine.

516
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:06,127
It's late now.

517
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:07,087
Taiyang,

518
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:08,287
we'll go to bed

519
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:09,167
after eating.

520
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:11,327
Are you going back with us?

521
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:13,567
Me?

522
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:16,327
Didn't you promise

523
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:18,247
to tell me a bedtime story?

524
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:19,607
Also,

525
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:20,927
weren't you

526
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:21,927
staying with

527
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,367
Mr. Xiao Shangqi before?

528
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:23,887
Taiyang,

529
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,407
don't you want to have a boy's night?

530
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:30,807
You can

531
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,287
watch a lot of animations,

532
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,127
play with many toys,

533
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:35,367
and drink many drinks.

534
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:38,167
Really?

535
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,007
But my father told me that

536
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:43,567
kids can't drink too much drink

537
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,847
and watch too many episodes
of animation.

538
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,327
It's bad for the eyes.

539
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:48,567
I want to listen to

540
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:50,527
Madam Xiaoran's story.

541
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:56,127
Taiyang.

542
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:57,887
Actually, I can

543
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:58,447
tell you a story, too.

544
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,887
My father told me before he left that

545
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:02,367
Madam Xiaoran's story

546
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:03,327
is the best.

547
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:08,767
Okay.

548
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:10,727
Why not

549
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:12,287
I go back with you

550
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:13,967
and put him to bed first?

551
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,167
I'll tell you a story, okay?

552
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:16,807
Okay.

553
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:18,567
Dig in.

554
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:19,367
We'll go back after this.

555
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:33,807
It's okay.

556
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,127
It's okay, son.

557
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:38,167
I've transferred the money.

558
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:53,327
Fei'er.

559
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:54,887
Luckily, you're here.

560
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:56,647
Otherwise, they would've
killed your brother.

561
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:57,247
That's right.

562
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:58,207
They're rough.

563
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,447
Look at how they hit your brother.

564
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:00,767
Look.

565
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,287
Fei'er,

566
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:05,567
where have you been?

567
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,007
Your brother is badly injured.

568
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,807
His medical fee...

569
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:12,127
This is the last time.

570
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,367
What last time?

571
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:15,767
He's your brother.

572
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:16,407
That's right.

573
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:17,207
Would he have borrowed money

574
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:18,367
everywhere if you didn't

575
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:19,847
lose his house?

576
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:20,807
That's right.

577
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,087
Why did you give birth to me?

578
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:24,407
What...

579
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:25,687
What

580
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:26,807
are you talking about?

581
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:27,847
I remember

582
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:28,727
you've never

583
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:29,767
shown me any care.

584
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:32,447
When you were in a bad mood,

585
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:33,967
you'd beat me up and scold me.

586
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:35,407
When you were tired and frustrated,

587
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:37,127
you'd get me to look after your son

588
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:37,967
and the mahjong centre.

589
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,247
Even when you paid for

590
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,167
my tuition fee,

591
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:42,887
you asked me to sign an IOU

592
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:44,487
to pay you back 10 times.

593
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,127
But, I still thank you.

594
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:49,607
If you didn't ruin

595
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:50,727
that hilarious wedding,

596
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,167
there won't be today's Chen Fei'er.

597
00:29:54,487 --> 00:29:56,487
So, what I did

598
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:58,207
to help your son

599
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:00,687
is the last gift I have for you.

600
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,327
Fei'er.

601
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:35,407
Why did you turn off your mobile phone?

602
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,007
I've taken a week's leave.

603
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,367
It's not over yet.

604
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:47,927
My brother gambled

605
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,167
and he's in a huge debt.

606
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,407
He got beaten up badly.

607
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:51,527
Did they beat you?

608
00:30:53,247 --> 00:30:54,687
Do I look like I got beaten up?

609
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:56,887
It's okay.

610
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:58,727
Any problem that can be solved
with money

611
00:30:59,007 --> 00:30:59,887
is not an issue.

612
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,047
Go back with me.

613
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:02,607
I...

614
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:04,327
I don't have my ID.

615
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:06,487
My parents have taken away my bag

616
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:07,287
to get me to

617
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:08,567
pay the medical fee.

618
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:10,127
I'll go back tomorrow.

619
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:14,087
Wait for me.

620
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:20,047
What are you doing?

621
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:21,807
What's wrong with you?

622
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:23,287
Fei'er,

623
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:24,527
you have no conscience.

624
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,407
(Actually, sensing happiness)

625
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,127
(is a great ability.)

626
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,527
(This is neither luck)

627
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:04,727
(nor fate.)

628
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:06,567
(One day,)

629
00:32:07,247 --> 00:32:08,767
(you can create it yourself.)

630
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:13,207
(You're not just)

631
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:15,647
(better looking than her.)

632
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,247
(Say,)

633
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:24,607
(if you can live up to 100 years old,)

634
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,327
(one fourth of your life)

635
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:28,567
(is only until here.)

636
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:30,767
(When you're here)

637
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,807
(passing this short corner,)

638
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,327
(you still have)

639
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:35,367
(a long way to go.)

640
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,727
(You can live anyhow you want.)

641
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:46,087
Come here.

642
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:00,207
Does it hurt?

643
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:07,607
You're silly.

644
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:08,527
So what

645
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:10,127
if they have taken all these?

646
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,287
I can go to the police station

647
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:12,367
to replace these.

648
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,327
Even the bank card can be replaced.

649
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:15,847
It's not about the bag

650
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:17,047
and the ID.

651
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:18,087
I can't let them

652
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:18,847
bully you.

653
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:19,807
I have to let them know

654
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:21,047
someone would step up for you

655
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:22,327
and you have someone to rely on.

656
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:33,407
Well.

657
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:36,887
Didn't you say that

658
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:38,087
I'm used to being a father.

659
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:42,287
If anyone

660
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,247
bullies Taiyang,

661
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:45,207
I'll have to support him

662
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,847
as his parent.

663
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:51,527
Do you want to be my parent?

664
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,007
I want to be your family.

665
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,687
The buns out here

666
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:18,726
are not as nice as the ones you made.

667
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:24,167
Let's

668
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:26,847
go back to Jifeng tomorrow.

669
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:49,766
Okay.

670
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,246
The piglet kept crying.

671
00:34:56,246 --> 00:34:57,727
But after crying,

672
00:34:58,127 --> 00:34:59,527
it wiped away its tear.

673
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:01,127
Holding the book, it said gently

674
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:02,687
"Thank you.

675
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,567
You've protected me.

676
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:06,287
I'll not forget that.

677
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:08,727
We cry,

678
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:10,327
laugh

679
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,527
and chat together.

680
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:14,927
I'll never ever

681
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:16,327
forget that."

682
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:20,407
The leaves on the snow

683
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:21,687
are blinking

684
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,047
under the sun.

685
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:25,367
Then...

686
00:36:05,447 --> 00:36:06,367
(I dropped this recorder)

687
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:08,487
(on that rainy day.)

688
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:17,767
(Why didn't he give it back to me?)

689
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:25,207
(It's 30th today.)

690
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,127
(Friday.)

691
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:27,807
(There are seven nursing homes)

692
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:28,807
(in Wusu.)

693
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,007
(Currently,)

694
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:31,327
(they're not fully occupied.)

695
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:33,167
(I need to check on
the price difference)

696
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,207
(and the environment.)

697
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,007
(It's 28th today, Wednesday.)

698
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:39,727
(Remember to cover)

699
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:40,727
(Wenwen's news)

700
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:41,887
(about the veterinary clinic.)

701
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:43,167
(Dogs are innocent)

702
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:44,247
(and shouldn't get involved
in personal grudges.)

703
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,927
(It's 27th today, Tuesday.)

704
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,047
(Remember to transfer the rental)

705
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:50,927
(to Li Hui and buy electricity.)

706
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:52,007
(She loves to drink beer.)

707
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,127
(Only one left.)

708
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:55,207
(There's promotion in
the convenience store.)

709
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:56,487
(I can go get some.)

710
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:58,527
(The information
for the 3 p.m. interview)

711
00:36:58,767 --> 00:36:59,687
(is as below.)

712
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:02,567
(First day of the month.)

713
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,687
(A new month has started.)

714
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:07,767
(I'm needed suddenly to do an interview
at the flooded road.)

715
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:09,047
(Remember)

716
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,327
(to wear boots next time
when it's raining.)

717
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:15,247
(Xiaoran.)

718
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:18,527
(He Xiaoran.)

719
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:20,967
(Xiaoran.)

720
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:23,767
(Xiaoran.)

721
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:28,287
(He Xiaoran.)

722
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:43,407
Taiyang is sleeping now.

723
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:47,127
Xiaoran,

724
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,047
don't go back tonight.

725
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:54,127
The cleaner has been cleaning

726
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,247
your room upstairs.

727
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,327
The bed is clean.

728
00:37:58,927 --> 00:37:59,487
Also,

729
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,287
when Taiyang wakes up in the morning,

730
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:03,927
I don't know how to take care of him.

731
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:05,887
If he's looking for Lin Zong,

732
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,007
I don't know what to do.

733
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:07,447
Okay.

734
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,607
I'll go back to my room now.

735
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:14,207
Good night.

736
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:17,647
Okay.

737
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:30,167
Brush your teeth.

738
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,087
Brush the upper teeth.

739
00:38:32,487 --> 00:38:33,367
Brush the upper teeth.

740
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:44,127
Good morning.

741
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:45,127
Good morning.

742
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:46,727
You came so early.

743
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:47,927
We took the earliest train

744
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:48,407
to come back.

745
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:48,967
We're afraid

746
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,127
that you can't handle it.

747
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:51,687
It's okay.

748
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:53,927
You made breakfast?

749
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:55,847
We also bought some.

750
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,087
There'll be more to eat.

751
00:38:57,527 --> 00:38:59,047
Father. Madam Fei'er.

752
00:38:59,447 --> 00:38:59,927
Baby.

753
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:00,687
You're up.

754
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:01,887
Did you miss me?

755
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:04,247
Come.

756
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:05,927
Let me carry you.

757
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:06,967
Sit here.

758
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:07,767
Okay.

759
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:09,727
So many tasty food.

760
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:11,367
Did you buy the buns
from Zhang's?

761
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:12,887
Yes.

762
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:13,967
We bought it when we were passing by.

763
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:14,847
It's not easy to buy it.

764
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:15,927
The line was long.

765
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:23,007
Xiaoran,

766
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:24,567
which one do you want to eat?

767
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:29,967
Taiyang, try this.

768
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:31,407
The bun is tasty.

769
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:32,127
Your father bought it.

770
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,247
The line was long.

771
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:34,647
Slow down.

772
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:35,767
How is it?

773
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:48,367
Dig in.

774
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,007
Did you settle the issue

775
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:50,927
back home?

776
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:53,807
There's no end

777
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,007
to their problems.

778
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:56,407
But, I've figured it out.

779
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:57,847
We all have

780
00:39:58,167 --> 00:39:59,527
our own battle to fight in life.

781
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:01,527
They need to figure out

782
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:02,287
their lives, too.

783
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:06,567
I can accept that

784
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:07,847
I was born in that family,

785
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:08,647
but I'll

786
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,767
never live for others anymore.

787
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:19,607
Well,

788
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:20,927
I didn't get to

789
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:21,807
view and appreciate.

790
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,047
When I was coming in,

791
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:23,967
I noticed that the plants

792
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,207
are really beautiful.

793
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:26,527
Xiaoran.

794
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:27,687
When are you free

795
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:28,807
to pick a few with me?

796
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:29,967
Teach me how to plant flowers.

797
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:30,767
Okay.

798
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,327
I'm a little busy lately.

799
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,527
I need to go to Mountain Linglong
two days later

800
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,207
to do a research on the ecosystem.

801
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:36,647
When I'm done,

802
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:37,807
I'll go to the flower market with you.

803
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:40,647
Mountain Linglong?

804
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:42,527
Because of the migratory birds?

805
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:45,607
When I went there for a recce,

806
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:47,247
I managed to take
the photos of many rare birds.

807
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:47,967
This time,

808
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,247
we want to do a series cover.

809
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:59,207
I'm doing an interview near
the homestay two days later.

810
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:00,527
Will you be free at noon?

811
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:02,927
Okay.

812
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,047
I'll wait for you.

813
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:25,327
Mother.

814
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:26,487
The lake

815
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:27,047
was surrounded by so many people.

816
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:28,167
Did something happen?

817
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:30,727
I seemed to have heard
someone calling the police.

818
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:32,887
A female journalist fell into the lake.

819
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,207
Where is it?

820
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:36,767
To the south of the homestay.

821
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:49,927
Yes.

822
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:50,607
Yes.

823
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:51,807
It's a female journalist.

824
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,047
Xiaoran!

825
00:41:57,927 --> 00:41:58,287
Move aside!

826
00:41:59,287 --> 00:41:59,847
He Xiaoran!

827
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:03,807
What are you doing?

828
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:05,127
He doesn't know how to swim!

829
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:06,047
Save him!

830
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:06,367
Move aside!
