Xiao Shangqi knows how
to play basketball?

18
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,589
I haven't seen him play
after graduation.

19
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:58,629
Not sure what happened

20
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,509
to him today.

21
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:03,589
When you two were together,

22
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,909
I was far away from you.

23
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,029
But you?

24
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,149
What did you do?

25
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:08,069
Since you've chosen to give up on her,

26
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,069
stay far away from her.

27
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,709
Who do you think plays better?

28
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,749
You're only looking at Xiao Shangqi.

29
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:37,389
If I score three points,

30
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:39,109
you have to stay away from He Xiaoran

31
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:40,469
and stay away from her life.

32
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:03,309
I'm done.

33
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,309
The winner is not decided yet.

34
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,149
I can't do what you said.

35
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,349
Xiao Shangqi,

36
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:10,469
since you chose to give up on her,

37
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:11,549
you have no right to love her.

38
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,069
Enough.

39
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:14,829
I'm bored watching you.

40
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,309
Play next time. Let's go.

41
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:17,749
Bye.

42
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,469
Put this on.

43
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:22,349
What are you doing?

44
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:25,869
Wipe it.

45
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,989
You've been reinstated.

46
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,389
Mr. Sun has gone back?

47
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:47,229
This matter

48
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,429
was done by Zhao Mingxuan,

49
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:50,629
but all the blames

50
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:51,509
have been taken by the person

51
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:52,309
on the official account.

52
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,029
Stop investigating.

53
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,909
He's meticulous in doing things.

54
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,989
There won't be any outcome.

55
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,389
What do you plan to do?

56
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:04,189
You've met each other's parents so soon?

57
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:07,469
Sui and I

58
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:08,749
are not like what you think we are.

59
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:10,909
Furthermore,

60
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,229
it has nothing to do with you.

61
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,389
Where did you get this?

62
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:53,069
From the trunk.

63
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:56,749
Here.

64
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,229
This is the first time

65
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,069
a girl opens the bottle cap for me.

66
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,589
You're worthy to be kept.

67
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:12,389
I saw how you didn't finish drinking.

68
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:13,389
Don't waste it.

69
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,069
Why did you take this bottle?

70
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:19,949
Don't touch my stuff anymore.

71
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,029
Sui Mingwei,

72
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:25,029
are you venting your anger on me?

73
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:26,349
I have no time for that.

74
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:27,429
Are you venting your anger on me?

75
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,349
I have no time for that.

76
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:28,749
Listen, Li Hui.

77
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:29,229
Did I give in

78
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:29,829
to you too much?

79
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,469
Did I make you too willful now?

80
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:32,029
Listen.

81
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:32,909
I have no time for you,

82
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,469
Hui.

83
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:34,949
My bad.

84
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:35,789
I admit defeat, okay?

85
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,029
What do you mean?

86
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,709
This is the one He Xiaoran bought.

87
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:46,429
It's the first time a girl

88
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:47,509
opened a bottle cap for me.

89
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:48,869
I keep it for remembrance.

90
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,549
Look at you.

91
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,509
What comes around goes around,
my friend.

92
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,189
Not bad.

93
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,920
(Acquisition contract)

94
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,349
It's done.

95
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:24,829
Mr. Zhao,

96
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,269
I didn't expect that Qingshan

97
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,669
has come back to

98
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:28,869
Deju after so long.

99
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,429
What do you plan to do

100
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:32,309
with the elderly?

101
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,109
It's not easy after

102
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,749
what happened.

103
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:38,269
You don't have to worry about that,

104
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:39,189
Mr. Wang.

105
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:40,429
Yes.

106
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,829
I just

107
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,109
want to solve this
as soon as possible.

108
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:45,869
I'm leaving now.

109
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,389
Please stay, Mr. Zhao.

110
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:56,069
Mr. Zhao,

111
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,509
you suddenly

112
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:58,709
used the fund

113
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,029
that's meant to expand
the foreign market.

114
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,109
The shareholders were shocked.

115
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,109
They asked when are
you going back to Hupu?

116
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,069
I'm too lazy to explain

117
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,869
to all the old guys.

118
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,309
Seize time.

119
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,189
Get the procedure done.

120
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,229
After getting the approval

121
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,269
to start the project,

122
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:19,909
do the rest

123
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:21,909
as I said.

124
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:23,309
Yes.

125
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,450
(Qingshan Nursing Home)

126
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:35,629
Listen,

127
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,509
what dishes are you cooking?

128
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,469
I can't even find some minced meat.

129
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:40,189
Are you feeding pigs?

130
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,429
This is worse than feeding pigs.

131
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,989
It's considered not bad that

132
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,109
you're able to eat some warm food.

133
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,149
I've been busy working
since the morning.

134
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,669
I didn't even drink water.

135
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,109
You...

136
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,629
What attitude is this?

137
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:55,789
Sun,

138
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,909
look at this.

139
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,349
Look at this new manager.

140
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,869
He's nothing like Mr. Xiao

141
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,149
who's straightforward.

142
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,109
I heard that

143
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,309
the caretakers in the third zone
have all left yesterday.

144
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,829
Even the medicine was
not given on time.

145
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,229
They said they're giving us time

146
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,389
to find a way out.

147
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:14,909
Actually, they're black-hearted people.

148
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:16,909
They're using all

149
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,069
the wicked tricks.

150
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:19,829
They're trying to chase us away.

151
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:20,869
Yes.

152
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,149
They're renovating every day.

153
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:25,149
They've removed all

154
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,349
the flowers and plants

155
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,869
in the garden.

156
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,589
They said it's meant to be renovated.

157
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:30,749
But now,

158
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,429
there's not even a place to walk around.

159
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:34,709
We're so bored here.

160
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,668
Listen to the electric drill sound.

161
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:37,908
It's so noisy

162
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,429
from day to night.

163
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:40,469
It's so annoying.

164
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:41,429
I can't even sleep.

165
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,028
Whoever can stay with their children

166
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,749
have moved out.

167
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:44,989
Luo has moved out, too.

168
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,789
I'm planning to go

169
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:47,989
look for my daughter.

170
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:49,549
Sun,

171
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,549
what do you plan to do?

172
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:53,469
What can I do?

173
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:54,429
I can only endure it.

174
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:55,989
You know well about

175
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,469
my family.

176
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:00,749
I don't want to trouble them.

177
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:02,349
I'm not staying here anymore.

178
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,509
I'm not staying here anymore.

179
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:05,669
I might die

180
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:06,669
if I continue to stay here.

181
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:07,429
What's wrong?

182
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,709
Talk slowly.

183
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,989
The bed sheets and pillowcases
have been changed.

184
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:13,509
It's printed with
yellow and white chrysanthemums.

185
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:14,629
What?

186
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:15,909
Rascal.

187
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,269
Also,

188
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,509
the bed.

189
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:19,949
They put

190
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,629
the black and yellow cloth flower

191
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,869
used for the hearse on it.

192
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:25,429
So evil?

193
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:26,749
These rascals.

194
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:27,989
Is this a bed?

195
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,389
This is a grave! This is a coffin!

196
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:30,669
They want us dead!

197
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,909
How can we sleep on this bed?

198
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:32,749
Yes.

199
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:33,669
I'm not staying here anymore!

200
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:34,589
I'm leaving!

201
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:37,509
Let's complain to someone.

202
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:38,629
Why do not

203
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,069
look for the media again?

204
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:41,789
After what happened these few days,

205
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,309
can't you tell

206
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,309
this was done to go against us?

207
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:46,349
No one can help us.

208
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,629
After you solved this,

209
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:48,629
there will be

210
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,469
new problems.

211
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,029
Will they come every day

212
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,029
to help us solve the problems?

213
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:51,829
No way!

214
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:52,789
Sun.

215
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:53,669
Think of a way

216
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,549
for all of us quickly.

217
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,949
We can't sleep on this bed.

218
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:56,749
This is too much.

219
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:57,349
Let's go.

220
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,829
Let's go.

221
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:58,509
Let's go take a look.

222
00:09:58,669 --> 00:09:59,309
Let's take a look.

223
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:00,229
This is too frustrating.

224
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,309
Let's go.

225
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,629
Look at this. This...

226
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,500
(Investigation report regarding
Damang Mountain development)

227
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,349
Look at how terrible this was.

228
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:14,509
I thought

229
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,589
you have to walk around
Damang Mountain.

230
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:18,789
I heard that Deju

231
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:20,109
has bought over Qingshan Nursing Home,

232
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,669
and is preparing to develop it.

233
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:23,589
Really?

234
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,629
This is what I think.

235
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:26,549
If you're interested in

236
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,789
this project,

237
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,229
I'll pass you the news of

238
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,709
the Damang Mountain Development Zone.
What do you think?

239
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:32,589
The Development Zone
is about to go into

240
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:33,789
a fast developing period.

241
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,469
The promotion will be great.

242
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,029
I guess you're familiar with that place

243
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:37,989
because of the incident in Qingshan.

244
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:39,189
All the departments and enterprises

245
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:40,709
will work with you.

246
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,509
Mr. Xiao has withdrawn from the battle.

247
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,109
You don't have to worry anymore.

248
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:52,149
I know.

249
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:54,229
From now on,

250
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,229
there's nothing I should avoid.

251
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:58,709
Okay, stop looking.

252
00:10:58,869 --> 00:10:59,589
Let's go for the gathering.

253
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:00,589
They're all there.

254
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,149
Are you not going?

255
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:04,109
I was called by Mr. Zhang.

256
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:04,989
Go ahead.

257
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,349
Give the bill to me.

258
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,900
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

259
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:27,749
(Zhao Mingxuan,)

260
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,189
(what are you trying to do?)

261
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,949
(You sold Qingshan at a cheap price,)

262
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,669
(and you're buying it back now?)

263
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,829
(Did you do this at all costs)

264
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,589
(to suppress Xiao family)

265
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:39,469
(or to cover some secret?)

266
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,000
(Acquisition contract)

267
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:47,749
Sir, thank you.

268
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,869
Madam Wang.

269
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,909
Mr. Sun.

270
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:57,149
Why are you here?

271
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,269
Miss He, you're here.

272
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,509
You have to help us.

273
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:02,589
Miss He.

274
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:03,829
We...

275
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:05,549
Calm down.

276
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,469
Let's talk slowly.

277
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,100
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

278
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:09,709
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Madam Wang,

279
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:10,909
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
you're staying in this room.

280
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,149
Mr. Sun is living next door.

281
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,669
These two rooms are on the same floor.

282
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:14,229
Okay.

283
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,149
It's convenient to come in and go out.

284
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,229
It's also nearer to the counter.

285
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:16,989
This...

286
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,509
This is the place I'm staying?

287
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,669
It's high class.

288
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:22,189
Sun, look.

289
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,789
The bed sheets.

290
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,469
Look.

291
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,909
Did Mr. Xiao really agree

292
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,309
to do what he said earlier

293
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,469
that before we found

294
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,269
a new nursing home,

295
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:33,749
we can stay here for free?

296
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:34,589
Yes.

297
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:35,789
Mr. Xiao has nothing to do

298
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,309
with Qingshan anymore.

299
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:38,469
Don't worry.

300
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:39,669
I've asked him.

301
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,069
Some rooms in this floor

302
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,509
were prepared for you.

303
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:43,269
Look.

304
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:44,709
The bedding has been changed

305
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:45,829
to warm colours.

306
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:46,989
The protector cotton has been

307
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:48,189
put on the edges.

308
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,189
Even the toilets

309
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,229
have anti-slippery mats now.

310
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,269
The hot water kettle

311
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:52,589
has been changed to a thermos.

312
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:53,909
Mr. Xiao asked us to

313
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,749
arrange these beforehand.

314
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,269
We should've come

315
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:57,389
earlier.

316
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,309
Just come and stay here.

317
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:00,549
I'll get things solved

318
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:01,789
in Qingshan

319
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:02,869
and find you

320
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,029
a new nursing home.

321
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:05,309
Miss He,

322
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:06,909
thank you so much.

323
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:08,669
We treated you badly,

324
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:10,469
and you're still helping us.

325
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,349
Yes, Miss He.

326
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,509
Thank you so much.

327
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,389
You and Mr. Xiao are good people.

328
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:19,589
Why is Mr. Xiao so meticulous?

329
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:20,709
He's so good at taking care of others.

330
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,029
At home, he must be

331
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:22,989
a filial son.

332
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,029
I envy his parents.

333
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,300
(Jifeng's elegant and natural)

334
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,669
The elderly have been settled down.

335
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:38,709
They're really thankful to you.

336
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,549
I'll look for a new nursing home

337
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:41,709
as soon as possible.

338
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:43,869
How could Zhao Mingxuan force

339
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:44,989
them to the corner?

340
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,869
He's used all sorts of ways
to irritate them.

341
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:50,869
They ought to think a lot

342
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,109
at this age.

343
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:53,309
They even changed their bed sheets

344
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:54,509
to black and yellow colours.

345
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,189
How do you think

346
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:56,709
they can stay there?

347
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,949
Sometimes, emotional damage

348
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:02,469
is more torturing than

349
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:03,629
physical pain.

350
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,549
What's wrong? Lost your soul?

351
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:33,749
I'm thinking that

352
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,549
Zhao Mingxuan is crazy.

353
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,029
I'm worried that Xiao Shangqi

354
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,709
will become mad because of him

355
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,269
and do something ridiculous.

356
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,189
Why are you still worried about him?

357
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:46,189
You've been meeting him

358
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,869
quite frequently this week.

359
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:48,989
What's your feeling

360
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:49,989
for him now?

361
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,829
I know what you're saying.

362
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,309
It's not like what you think.

363
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,429
Actually, I know him well.

364
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,229
I know he and I are not

365
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:00,109
getting back together.

366
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,029
His responsibility is great.

367
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,749
He has no extra strength

368
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:07,829
to accept a romance relationship.

369
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:08,949
And I...

370
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:09,869
It's impossible for me as well

371
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:10,949
to be like a saint,

372
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,389
advising him to let go of the grudges

373
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:13,909
and the responsibilities.

374
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:15,869
I think he should do

375
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:16,709
what he wants to do.

376
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,029
Also, from the beginning,

377
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:20,469
he's decided

378
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,469
to complete this alone.

379
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,709
I think you understand it well,

380
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,709
but I don't understand

381
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:27,869
why you must get involved

382
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,149
in the trouble?

383
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:31,509
Must you interfere with
Qingshan's matter?

384
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,069
I'm helping Mr. Sun,

385
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,069
not him.

386
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:38,109
You're going to

387
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,549
face this situation more often.

388
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,789
Are you going to

389
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:41,709
help every one of them?

390
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:42,309
Yes.

391
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,469
I'll help within my capacity.

392
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:45,909
Do you think I should

393
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:47,629
stay out of this

394
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:48,349
even though I know

395
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:49,389
there's something wrong with

396
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,509
Qingshan?

397
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,229
No, that's not what I meant.

398
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:54,389
I didn't say you shouldn't help.

399
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:55,389
Neither did I stop you
from investigating.

400
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,109
I just want you to stay away
from Xiao...

401
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:01,549
Forget it.

402
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:02,709
Okay.

403
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,189
From now on,

404
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:05,749
if there's anything to do with Qingshan,

405
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:07,149
bring me along as your bodyguard,

406
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:07,749
okay?

407
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,269
I agreed with Sui Mingwei on this.

408
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,149
Didn't you say that

409
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:12,029
Zhao Mingxuan

410
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:12,909
is a bad guy?

411
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:15,989
Don't worry.

412
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:17,829
I know what to do.

413
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:27,229
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Mr. Sun, you don't have to do this.

414
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:27,869
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Take a rest.

415
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,869
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Let me do it.

416
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,469
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
It's okay. It's really okay.

417
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,029
You've been busy the whole morning.

418
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:33,389
Take a rest. Let me do it.

419
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,309
It's okay. Listen.

420
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:40,109
Give it to me.

421
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,309
It's okay.

422
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,309
Hello, my bosses.

423
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,069
Mo, what's going on?

424
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,629
He has almost become

425
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,069
a part-timer in the hotel.

426
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,109
He said he and Madam Wang

427
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,149
can't stay in our hotel for nothing

428
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:56,589
so he's helping around.

429
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:57,309
Well...

430
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,469
The young people are trying hard
to stay idle

431
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:00,149
yet the old people

432
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,349
are not willing to rest.

433
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,108
But, it's not good

434
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:05,549
if the guests see it.

435
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:07,068
If this is posted online,

436
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:08,348
they'll say

437
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,429
we treat the elderly poorly.

438
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:11,909
Let him come with me.

439
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:16,269
(Qingshan Nursing Home)
(Mr. Zhao,)

440

(we know the wetland in Damang Mountain)

441

(will become a holiday resort
in the future.)

(plan to do in the future?)

00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,829
(We'll restructure the use of the land)

459
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:43,989
has been to

460
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,229
many shows lately.

461
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,229
Deju's advertisements are everywhere.

462
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,629
He's become
our station's valuable client.

463
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,709
The hotel hasn't been built,

464
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,909
but he's already making it popular.

465
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,029
He's shameless.

466
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,269
He'll get it one day.

467
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:59,189
Are you serious?

468
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:01,669
I just don't like

469
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:02,749
such hypocrites.

470
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,189

00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:17,629
Lili.

472
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:20,829
Okay, get back to work.

473
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,269
Why wasn't my topic approved?

474
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:26,629
You told me to

475
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:28,309
follow up on

476
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:29,709
the Damang Mountain
Development Zone's news.

477
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:31,109
Ever since Qingshan Nursing Home

478
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:31,749
has got its

479
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,109
manager changed,

480
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:34,149
the quality of the facility

481
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,269
has dropped drastically.

482
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:36,469
They even torture

483
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:37,909
the elderly mentally.

484
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:39,069
I know

485
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:39,869
that Deju

486
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:40,869
is our valuable client now,

487
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:42,309
but the righteousness of news

488
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:43,829
shouldn't bow down to benefits.

489
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:44,709
If

490
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:45,909
we dare not expose them,

491
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:47,509
what's the meaning of this job?

492
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,429
You've been talking since you came in.

493
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,989
Is this a stand-up comedy?

494
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,789
Can't you listen to my explanation?

495
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:54,629
Who told you just because Deju

496
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:55,909
is our valuable client

497
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,229
that we dare not expose them?

498
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,389
Why then?

499
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:59,749
I have witnesses.

500
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,029
I think this matter

501
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:02,309
is worthy to be explored.

502
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,509
I got the news in the morning.

503
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,949
The last elderly

504
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:08,829
has left Qingshan Nursing Home

505
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,629
a day before yesterday.

506
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:12,709
Qingshan Nursing Home is closed.

507
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:14,549
They've got the permit to demolish

508
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:15,509
to start their work.

509
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:16,989
Why are you still reporting on this?

510
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,189
So fast?

511
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,629
He Xiaoran.

512
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:20,509
Yes.

513
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:21,149
I asked you to cover

514
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,549
the news at Damang Mountain area,

515
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:23,949
but I didn't

516
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:24,949
ask you to

517
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:25,669
focus on

518
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:26,909
Qingshan Nursing Home alone.

519
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:28,069
Furthermore, this nursing home

520
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,789
has no longer existed.

521
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:31,269
But...

522
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,189
But what?

523
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:33,349
Yes,

524
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,429
as the media,

525
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:35,389
we need to monitor the society

526
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,309
and expose the truth

527
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,509
to the public,

528
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,629
but we're not heroes.

529
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,109
In our industry,

530
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,509
we just can't help it.

531
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:43,789
We can find out

532
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:44,709
about many things,

533
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:45,589
but we can't

534
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:46,269
solve everything

535
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:47,709
that we find.

536
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:49,189
Do you understand?

537
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:58,829
The yard is not bad.

538
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,069
Are you staying here alone?

539
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,629
You know how to live well.

540
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,429
I'm talking about these.

541
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:07,789
I wonder if you can rescue

542
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,109
all the plants for me.

543
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,789
It's simple.

544
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,149
You young people

545
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,789
are weak at execution.

546
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:14,909
We used to

547
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,269
make our own furniture.

548
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,429
Get some water here.

549
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,109
Look at me.

550
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,709
I'm here to help,

551
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:46,989
but I'm ordering you around.

552
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:49,549
It's okay.

553
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:57,589
Miss He?

554
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,029
Did you...

555
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:04,389
We broke up.

556
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,909
Where's the photos on the wall?

557
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:09,309
They're burned.

558
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,189
The leaking has caused
the rebar to rust.

559
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,509
The building's shape has changed.

560
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:39,429
The rain is so heavy.

561
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:40,509
Thanks for coming here.

562
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,429
Why do we come here suddenly?

563
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,309
What can we investigate
since it's raining so heavily?

564
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,349
The construction stops
when it's raining.

565
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,109
We can get in easily.

566
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:49,869
They're rushing to
demolish the building.

567
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:51,389
I suspect that
the building has an issue.

568
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:53,189
Did I disrupt you from working?

569
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:54,349
No.

570
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:55,349
I'm a boss.

571
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:56,109
I have nothing else

572
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:57,109
but freedom.

573
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:57,949
I can go anywhere

574
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:58,789
I want.

575
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:00,269
I've owed

576
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:01,389
you a lot.

577
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,189
Why are you saying this?

578
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:05,909
If I'm able to find

579
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:07,509
some important evidence tonight,

580
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:09,029
will I be

581
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,029
the top contributor?

582
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,709
Just remember

583
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:12,949
to return the favour.

584
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:14,589
Okay.

585
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:16,269
No matter if we could find

586
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,509
any clue or not,

587
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:18,909
I'll surely

588
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:19,989
return you a favour.

589
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:21,069
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

590
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:22,909
Be careful.

591
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:23,949
Are you going out?

592
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,749
Bring an umbrella with you.

593
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,509
It could just rain at any time.

594
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:28,709
Be careful.

595
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:31,109
That is Ms. Zhou.

596
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:33,629
Ms. Zhou, it's raining heavily.

597
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:34,189
Ms. Zhou.

598
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:35,149
You didn't bring your umbrella?

599
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:36,269
We came out

600
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:37,709
to buy coffee for everyone.

601
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:38,909
We didn't know it'd be raining.

602
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,269
Quickly get an umbrella for Ms. Zhou.

603
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:42,469
One will do.

604
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:43,469
Your umbrella is big.

605
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:44,469
We can share it.

606
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:45,349
Give one to

607
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,069
Miss He.

608
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:47,189
We know each other.

609
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:48,429
He Xiaoran is not in the station.

610
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:49,429
She went to Damang Mountain.

611
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:51,269
Why did she go there?

612
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,389
The nursing home is being demolished.

613
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,589
She went to check it out.

614
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:55,829
But, the rain is heavy today.

615
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:57,349
I guess she won't be able to check it.

616
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

617
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,629
The demolition is too quick.

618
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,429
This place is really suspicious.

619
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,349
Let's split up.

620
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:25,629
I'll go there and you'll go there.

621
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:27,749
It's not safe.

622
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:29,309
It's faster this way.

623
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:30,589
If someone is here,

624
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:31,309
they'll

625
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:32,309
throw us out.

626
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:33,269
Hurry.

627
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:35,109
Be careful.

628
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:10,989
Who is there?

629
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:13,789
Who is there?

630
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:20,069
Mr. Zhao said

631
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:21,149
no one is allowed to come in.

632
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:25,749
Hold it right there!

633
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:26,749
Hold it right there!

634
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:27,989
What are you doing?

635
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:34,269
What are you doing?

636
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:35,669
(Boss,)

637
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:37,389
(a guy was taking photo at level four.)

638
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:38,309
(We didn't manage to catch him.)

639
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:38,909
(He ran away.)

640
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:39,909
Tell me

641
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,989
if that's your accomplice.

642
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,109
What photo did you take?

643
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:44,469
Take out your phone.

644
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:46,189
I

645
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:47,589
am taking a tour.

646
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:06,909
Bring it on!

647
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:14,269
Stop it. What are you doing?

648
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:16,789
Sui!

649
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,069
I'm telling you.

650
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:19,549
I've called the police.

651
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:21,589
Just wait, you two.

652
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:22,749
Let's go.

653
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:26,989
Xiaoran.

654
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:28,669
Sui.

655
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:30,829
Look for the mobile phone.

656
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:38,509
Mobile phone.

657
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:45,069
Send her to the hospital.

658
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:45,909
What about you?

659
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:47,349
I'll go back and get her mobile phone.

660
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,149
There'll be more people
when you go back.

661
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:50,669
No one will know
if you die inside there.

662
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:53,589
You'll know, right?

663
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,029
Call the police for me.

664
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:56,469
Xiao Shangqi.

665
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,829
Go south.

666
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:03,549
Hello?

667
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:05,109
110? I want to make a police report.

668
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,109
Hurry, someone is fighting
in the construction site

669
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:08,189
of Qingshan Nursing Home.

670
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:08,749
Yes.

671
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:09,469
Someone's injured.

672
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:10,789
Come here quickly.

673
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,100
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)

674
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:27,029
You're awake.

675
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:32,789
My mobile phone.

676
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:34,149
What?

677
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:37,189
I need to look for my mobile phone.

678
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,349
I've hidden my mobile phone.

679
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,989
Something is wrong with
the construction site in Qingshan.

680
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:42,949
I took some photos.

681
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:44,429
It's important.

682
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,069
You and Sui have been to
the construction site.

683
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:48,469
They must be on alert now.

684
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:49,909
If there's any secret

685
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,109
that they don't want to expose,

686
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,069
going back like this is very dangerous.

687
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,509
They're not

688
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,029
normal construction workers.

689
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,789
They wanted to beat us up
as soon as they saw us taking photo.

690
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,589
Don't you think they're feeling guilty?

691
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:05,709
Well, where's Sui?

692
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,309
- Is he okay?
- I'm okay.

693
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:10,709
Are you injured, too?

694
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,709
Just some minor injuries. I'm okay.

695
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:17,469
Sorry, I've caused you to get hurt.

696
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,349
I'm okay.

697
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:21,989
I went there to feel the excitement.

698
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,269
But you

699
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:24,669
were beaten up and you fainted

700
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:25,909
to get some evidence.

701
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,269
I was frightened as you fainted.

702
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:35,269
I'll go get some water for you.

703
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:43,549
Xiaoran,

704
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:46,389
I didn't manage to find
the mobile phone.

705
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,869
The evidence is gone.

706
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,949
Is the meal to return my favour

707
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:51,349
still on?

708
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:53,589
Of course.

709
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:57,829
What should we eat then?

710
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,029
I didn't have any fun these few days

711
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:01,189
for doing this.

712
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,309
Why not you hang out
with me for a day?

713
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,309
Sure.

714
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:06,949
Let's ask Li Hui

715
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:07,749
and Feng as well.

716
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:08,469
We'll go out together.

717
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:09,349
Why should we ask them?

718
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:10,429
They didn't contribute to this.

719
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,829
Just the two of us,

720
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:12,869
okay?

721
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:18,189
Okay.

722
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,189
The construction workers were arrested,

723
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:27,749
but it's not a big deal.

724
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:29,109
I've asked them.

725
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,509
The mobile phone was surely damaged.

726
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:35,189
Don't bother them.

727
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,029
Keep demolishing the building.

728
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:42,109
But, listen.

729
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,429
You need to hurry.

730
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:47,629
Do you understand?

731
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:49,109
Yes.

732
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:10,709
How did it go?

733
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:12,909
If I stand here,

734
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:13,989
I do look like a successful

735
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:14,749
person, right?

736
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:17,309
I thought you're bringing me
to somewhere else.

737
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:19,029
So, you've brought me
to the fragrance factory.

738
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:21,469
Didn't we all say

739
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:22,589
the man who is working diligently

740
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:23,509
is the most charming?

741
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:24,589
Right?

742
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,389
After coming out from Dajiabang,

743
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:28,109
I realised that

744
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,789
the fragrance is good
at helping us fall asleep.

745
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:30,789
So, I started working

746
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:32,109
in my mother's factory. I was thinking

747
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:33,229
if I should make one, too.

748
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:34,949
But, they don't sell individual products.

749
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:36,109
So,

750
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,189
I made a fuss.

751
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:38,869
I got to produce

752
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:39,789
my retail.

753
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:40,989
Let's check it out.

754
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:42,309
Check it out.

755
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:43,629
Let's go.

756
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:07,669
This is where I have been researching

757
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:08,669
the sleeping fragrance

758
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,269
for you in the past few months.

759
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,109
This is the

760
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,469
semi-finished product tester
I've prepared for you.

761
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:18,949
I guess it won't be able to

762
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:20,949
help you sleep.

763
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,509
Just pick one that you like.

764
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,549
I'll market it

765
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,869
and close the project.

766
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:33,509
Sui.

767
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:34,589
Hurry.

768
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:35,909
After this,

769
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,149
we need to go to another place.

770
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:44,949
This one.

771
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:46,789
Your favourite dark green.

772
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:57,109
Okay.

773
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:12,989
Why did you think of coming here?

774
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:15,069
There's no market event lately.

775
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,389
Only a few shops are opened.

776
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:18,589
What flavour is this?

777
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:21,629
Five in one super luxurious version.

778
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:23,669
Five in one?

779
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:25,269
Why is there no mango flavour

780
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,429
for five in one?

781
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:28,269
You don't like mango.

782
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:32,389
I know

783
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:34,589
you always bought mango cake

784
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:35,509
because of me.

785
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:38,469
I also know that you can't drink much.

786
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,109
You can only drink orange juice

787
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:42,829
without the pulp.

788
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:45,429
You don't like rainy day.

789
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:46,709
You like dark green.

790
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,749
I asked you to choose your favourite.

791
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:53,189
Why did you choose my favourite?

792
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:56,229
You know me so well.

793
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:57,669
Let me tell you something
that you didn't know.

794
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,949
Three years back,

795
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,509
it was your first day
coming to Dajiabang.

796
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:07,749
It was me who ran into you.

797
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,000
(Dajiabang For Everyone)

798
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,189
Are you trying to run away again?

799
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:21,189
Dajiabang, here I am to report duty.

800
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:24,989
The recycle station has a newcomer.

801
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:27,349
What crime did you commit

802
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,149
to be assigned here?

803
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:29,709
Everywhere is the same.

804
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,149
You must be He Xiaoran.

805
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:32,749
Your seat is over there.

806
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:34,069
Thank you.

807
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,349
He Xiaoran.

808
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:38,469
Hi, I'm Li Hui.

809
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:39,709
Hi.

810
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:41,069
Ever since then,

811
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,469
I think you're interesting,

812
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,189
real and straightforward.

813
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,589
Although you seem like
you're not interested

814
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:49,309
in anything,

815
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:53,149
the details tell me that

816
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:54,429
you know how

817
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:55,389
to live your life well.

818
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,309
Mrs. Zhang from the next door

819
00:32:58,589 --> 00:32:59,909
is crazy.

820
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,069
Who is it?

821
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,829
It must be the old lady

822
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:07,029
from the next door

823
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:07,869
who threw rubbish into

824
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:08,829
the pond of my garden.

825
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:09,629
Who are you talking about?

826
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:10,749
Whoever that responded to my word.

827
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,749
The wind must have blown it

828
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,509
in there two days back.

829
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:24,789
Get ready, run!

830
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:27,589
You...

831
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,109
I'm not sure

832
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:32,869
when

833
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:33,989
I fell in love with you.

834
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:37,829
You rejected me

835
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,189
on Li Hui's birthday.

836
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:42,189
I wasn't feeling to

837
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:43,869
fight for anything.

838
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:45,629
I was thinking

839
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:48,709
before our feeling is gone,

840
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:50,869
your relationship with Xiao Shangqi

841
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:51,869
would've been gone earlier.

842
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:58,629
But very unluckily,

843
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,989
the feeling is always around.

844
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:06,269
When you came back from Hupu,

845
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:08,509
I've decided that

846
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,148
I must be able to keep you.

847
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,549
No matter what happens,

848
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,029
I must not lose this chance.

849
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:15,668
But I know

850
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:18,549
you haven't let it go.

851
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,269
I was thinking to

852
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:24,549
keep you company during
this period of time.

853
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:27,349
But before

854
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,749
you're recovered from the hurt,

855
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,269
Xiao Shangqi came in first.

856
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:37,069
Sui Mingwei.

857
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:39,949
I'm sorry.

858
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:43,589
Don't say sorry too fast.

859
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,228
I have something that I regretted it

860
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:49,749
and I wish to finish it with you.

861
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,320
(I want to confess to someone)

862
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,400
(I want to confess to someone)

863
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,300
(I love you, He Xiaoran)

864
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:20,109
Okay,

865
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,509
I've said everything I wanted to say.

866
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,509
I have no regrets anymore.

867
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:28,429
Someone is confessing.

868
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,200
(I want to confess to someone)

869
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:34,829
Xiaoran,

870
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:37,509
I might not

871
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,189
be able to date you anymore,

872
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:42,429
but I hope

873
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:44,149
you can choose

874
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,509
what you like

875
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,349
and the man you love.

876
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:50,149
I wish you all the happiness.

877
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:57,149
One last thing.

878
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:00,389
I saw Xiao Shangqi

879
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:01,549
at the construction site that night.

880
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:06,589
There'll be more people
when you go back.

881
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,309
No one will know
if you die inside there.

882
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:10,989
You'll know, right?

883
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,549
Call the police for me.

884
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:13,629
Xiao Shangqi.

885
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:15,029
Go south.

886
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:18,949
Hello?

887
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,069
Hello, 110?

888
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,869
(Emergency)
Pick up the call.

889
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:24,709
Sui, what's going on?

890
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:26,829
Thank goodness. Are you okay?

891
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,189
I'm okay.

892
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:29,869
How's He Xiaoran?

893
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:31,909
She was just sent to the hospital.

894
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:32,749
What about you?

895
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:35,309
Luckily, the police came in time.

896
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:38,069
(Are you injured?)

897
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:40,669
Just some minor injuries.

898
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:42,989
No need to tell He Xiaoran.

899
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:47,629
What happened?

900
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
(Emergency)

901
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,869
He found your mobile phone.

902
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,709
He said it's just some minor injuries.

903
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:12,789
Sui Mingwei, I remember this now.

904
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:13,789
Just wait.

905
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:29,429
Xiao Shangqi,

906
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:32,589
giving her to me for one day

907
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,429
isn't too much, is it?

908
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:36,549
Let me be selfish once.

909
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:50,549
(He's in the hospital.)

910
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,589
(He didn't allow me to tell you.)

911
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,069
But, you found out anyway.

912
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:58,149
Yes,

913
00:37:58,389 --> 00:37:58,949
I didn't know what happened.

914
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,549
He has rib fracture
and soft tissue damage.

915
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:02,549
(I'm coming over now.)

916
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:04,869
Now?

917
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,589
It's too late now.

918
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:07,309
The visiting hour

919
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:08,309
is over.

920
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,349
It's okay. I'll wait in the hospital.

921
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:22,429
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)
Mr. Xiao,

922
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:23,549
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)
we need you to fill in the information

923
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:24,269
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)
for the MRI scan.

924
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:26,749
Is your family here?

925
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:29,029
No.

926
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,549
It's better to get someone with you

927
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:31,669
for doing MRI scan.

928
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:32,949
If your family has no time,

929
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,189
you can get a friend.

930
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:36,709
No need.

931
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:37,669
Thank you.

932
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:39,069
Please wait for a while.

933
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,160
(Sui Mingwei: Today is worth it to drink some wine.)

934
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:51,189
(Today is worth it)

935
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:52,149
(to drink some wine.)

936
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:54,709
He Xiaoran.

937
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:56,709
You have no conscience.

938
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,349
(Xiao Shangqi)
If I knew you're so heartless,

939
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:00,389
(Sui Mingwei)
I wouldn't have saved you.

940
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:02,229
No.

941
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:05,669
I shouldn't have asked
that rascal to help you.

942
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,029
You're laughing so happily with him.

943
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:14,549
You acted on yourself.

944
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,149
How dare you blame me?

945
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:26,109
Do you know how dangerous this is?

946
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,749
You even told Sui that
it's just a minor injury.

947
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:32,309
No worries.

948
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:34,189
No surgery is needed.

949
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:36,349
I just need to rest in the hospital.

950
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:42,909
How did you find the mobile phone?

951
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,109
Sui Mingwei told me where you went.

952
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:47,309
I just followed the road,

953
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:49,149
but the mobile phone was damaged.

954
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:51,189
I've asked Lin Zong to get it fixed.

955
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:52,909
We'll see if we can get the photos

956
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:54,069
and information back.

957
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:56,149
Actually, I'm not sure

958
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:57,069
if the photos in the mobile phone

959
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:58,029
are useful or not.

960
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:00,069
I knew earlier that

961
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,429
Zhao Mingxuan has started
the reconstruction,

962
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,349
but I didn't know that

963
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,509
he wanted to demolish
the entire building.

964
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,589
Deju has planned way ahead

965
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:12,189
about the resort in Damang Mountain.

966
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:13,709
If the land in Qingshan

967
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,469
is included

968
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:15,469
and redesigned,

969
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:16,709
the changes are great.

970
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:18,949
Changing the plan

971
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:20,709
will need more

972
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:22,029
investments.

973
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:24,669
I wanted to

974
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:26,469
buy Qingshan

975
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,949
and take the opportunity

976
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:30,709
to lure Zhao Mingxuan to Wusu.

977
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:32,909
If he thinks that
I'm just trying my luck

978
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,029
to go against him not knowing my place,

979
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:35,469
he'll surely come.

980
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:37,349
During the process,

981
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:39,229
he'll surely keep tricking me

982
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:41,269
by getting me to spend all the funds

983
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:42,269
I have in Jifeng

984
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,229
and causing me to lose everything.

985
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:45,829
What I didn't expect is that

986
00:40:47,149 --> 00:40:48,669
he went against

987
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,149
Deju's objection at all costs

988
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:52,789
to get this done quick

989
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:53,909
and bought Qingshan.

990
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,029
This is not his usual self.

991
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:58,229
But it seems like

992
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:01,309
he's getting a bit panicked.

993
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:10,309
Where is he?

994
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:10,909
There.

995
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:13,189
He didn't say anything and

996
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,349
he ordered so many dishes.

997
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:15,309
He keeps eating.

998
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,869
He'll die if he keeps eating like that.

999
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:28,269
Here you are.

1000
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,509
Hao asked you to come?

1001
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:33,269
Order whatever

1002
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:34,229
you want to eat.

1003
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:39,069
You're just falling out of love.

1004
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:40,669
Do you need to do this?

1005
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,949
Here's my shoulder.

1006
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:44,189
Do you want to cry on me?

1007
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,269
Don't try to use your technique
to coax a man

1008
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,309
on me,

1009
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,149
okay?

1010
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,149
I didn't know I can say this back

1011
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:58,549
to you

1012
00:41:58,709 --> 00:41:59,429
in a few months' time.

1013
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:01,869
Isn't it easy to advise others

1014
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:03,109
what to do?

1015
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:05,589
But, we're confused
when we're in the problem ourselves.

1016
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:08,229
I'm just not in a good mood.

1017
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:10,229
Didn't He Xiaoran say

1018
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:13,349
eating is the best cure?

1019
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:14,589
I've been eating a few days,

1020
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:15,749
but it's not effective.

1021
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:23,749
I've watched this news before.

1022
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:25,429
A man

1023
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,509
was eating a lot for a few days.

1024
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:30,469
Then he was having severe stomach pain

1025
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,269
and he was sent to the hospital.

1026
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:33,149
In the end,

1027
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:34,229
he died of acute pancreatitis.

1028
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:35,589
Wait.

1029
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,509
Don't curse me.

1030
00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:43,509
Drink two glasses of wine
if you're troubled.

1031
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,109
If you keep eating like this,

1032
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:46,589
your stomach can't take it.

1033
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,189
Drink two glasses of wine?
