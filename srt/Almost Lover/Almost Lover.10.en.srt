It's tasty.

19
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:42,223
The cake is tasty.

20
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:45,423
Mr. Xiao Xian.

21
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:47,663
This is...

22
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:49,703
All the rooms are fully booked today.

23
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:50,503
I brought

24
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,423
the colleagues from
the housekeeping department

25
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:52,103
for a celebration here

26
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,143
to reward everyone.

27
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:55,463
You bought a cake today.

28
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,063
Will you be giving out money tomorrow?

29
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,543
Are all the expenses

30
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,343
on your tab?

31
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,623
Only flour and eggs were used.

32
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:05,423
How do we count that?

33
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:06,583
So, can the resources in the kitchen

34
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:07,943
be used simply?

35
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:10,343
Dismiss.

36
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:12,663
Dismiss.

37
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,343
Dismiss? Stay.

38
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:16,743
Building of the culture
of shared principles

39
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,303
is given a certain amount of budget.

40
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,343
Yunlan likes to spend money

41
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,623
on the top management

42
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:23,183
in some pretentious cocktail parties.

43
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:24,743
However, here in Jifeng,

44
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,663
we like to mingle around
with the junior staff.

45
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:28,303
Xian,

46
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,623
are the wines that you opened for
the top management

47
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:32,503
counted in details?

48
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,223
There should be a standard.

49
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,983
Setting the standard is my mandate.

50
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:39,823
It has nothing to do with Lin Zong.

51
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,183
Okay.

52
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:46,983
Mr. Xiao, do what you want to do.

53
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:56,063
Why are you staring?

54
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:57,823
Keep eating.

55
00:02:58,983 --> 00:02:59,863
- Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
- Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

56
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:00,703
Eat now.

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,260
(Ledi Kindergarten)

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,980
Hey.

59
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:32,983
How did you know I'm here?

60
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:36,143
(Ledi Kindergarten)
You went out

61
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:36,263
(Ledi Kindergarten)

62
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:37,943
(Ledi Kindergarten)
without telling me on a holiday.

63
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:39,703
(Ledi Kindergarten)
I guessed you'll be here.

64
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,063
She didn't get to see Taiyang.

65
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,303
She'll surely come again.

66
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:44,423
So, I came to take a look.

67
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:46,743
What about Lin Zong?

68
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,063
Are you planning to terminate him?

69
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,143
I've never wanted to

70
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,183
to fire Lin Zong.

71
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:52,143
I wanted to

72
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:53,423
wait until Xian leaves,

73
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,183
then I'll hire Lin Zong back.

74
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:57,183
But it's just like what
my girlfriend said,

75
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,103
Jifeng is Lin Zong's home.

76
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,383
How can he be fired

77
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:01,343
by his home?

78
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:02,943
It's not suitable even if it's fake.

79
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,343
What do you plan to do?

80
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,823
I'll push this thing in a logical sense
and then try to cheat.

81
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:09,943
There are always ways.

82
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:15,263
Shouldn't you be punished

83
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,023
for misunderstanding

84
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:18,303
your boyfriend?

85
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:19,783
Be punished?

86
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,982
What punishment is this?

87
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:26,302
Enough.

88
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:27,063
The children are in there.

89
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,223
What are you doing?

90
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:30,503
Okay.

91
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:32,063
I'll wait with you in the car.

92
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:39,783
Let's go.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,650
(Employee 360 appraisal)

94
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,183
This is not a promotion.

95
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,943
Why do we need to do
an anonymous appraisal?

96
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,183
Mr. Xiao Xian

97
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:52,303
wants to fire Mr. Lin.

98
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:54,703
It's the fight among the top management.

99
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,223
Let's not engage with them.

100
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:02,863
Days ahead are not easy.

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
(Employee 360 appraisal)

102
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:13,223
As for Lin Zong's 360,

103
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:14,743
just update in the system will do.

104
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:15,263
No need to show me.

105
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,223
I don't know how to use this.

106
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:18,463
I'll be frank.

107
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:21,103
I've worked in many hotel restaurants.

108
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,943
Jifeng is the purest.

109
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,823
I don't care where you come from.

110
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:28,223
If you ruin

111
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:29,543
the clean

112
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:30,383
atmosphere here,

113
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:32,183
I'll quit.

114
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:53,943
Mr. Lin is the best leader

115
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,663
I've ever seen.

116
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,383
I've worked in four hotels before.

117
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,863
I couldn't stay for half a year
in any of them,

118
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:01,783
but I've stayed in Jifeng

119
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,023
for three years.

120
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,223
All of us here are really close.

121
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:12,183
Are you done?

122
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:18,463
I got it.

123
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:39,863
You can't fire Mr. Lin.

124
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:43,063
If you need to fire someone,

125
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,223
fire me.

126
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:51,583
Okay.

127
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:12,303
Taiyang's mother.

128
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,623
Are you sure you want to do this?

129
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:33,543
She's settled down

130
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:34,103
overseas

131
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:35,583
with the man she loves.

132
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,623
She just wanted to see
the child before leaving.

133
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:39,463
The request is not too much.

134
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:41,743
Also,

135
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,183
she is not meeting me

136
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,223
and she's not telling him
who she is.

137
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,663
She's probably just here to see him.

138
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,583
You're quite calmed.

139
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,583
What if she

140
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:55,303
tells him who she is

141
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:56,703
and wants to bring Taiyang away?

142
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,143
But, even if that's the case,

143
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:03,143
I'll respect

144
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,103
Taiyang's will.

145
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:07,183
After all, he wants to stay with his mother.

146
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:09,063
I understand that.

147
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:12,303
Don't worry.

148
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,943
If I were Taiyang,

149
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,143
I'd choose you.

150
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:21,543
Taiyang,

151
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:23,623
didn't you say you wanted to eat cake?

152
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,303
These are all cakes.
Choose for yourself.

153
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:26,383
Go ahead.

154
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,143
Can I eat the strawberry cake?

155
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:33,023
Sure, let me take it for you.

156
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:43,983
I'll buy it for you, okay?

157
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:49,702
I want two, please.

158
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:50,423
Okay.

159
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,863
Let's sit down over there.

160
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:00,103
What else do you like?

161
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:07,663
Chocolate, cheese cake,

162
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,263
sandwich cookie,

163
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:11,303
and the kitchen of our hotel.

164
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:12,583
I like father, too.

165
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:18,583
I want all of these.

166
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:19,423
Okay, please hold on.

167
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:28,263
Hello.

168
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:30,143
It's RMB 308 in total.

169
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,383
Okay, thank you.

170
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:43,903
Can I hold you?

171
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,063
No.

172
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,303
This is right.

173
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:54,383
This is right.

174
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,463
You can't be too close to a stranger.

175
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,143
But, I can shake hands with you.

176
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:33,623
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:46,743
Take care of Taiyang.

178
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:56,863
Taiyang.

179
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,023
You're here.

180
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:00,903
A lady

181
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:02,823
bought these for me just now.

182
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:07,583
They look so tasty.

183
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,703
Is that my mother?

184
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,423
How did you know she's your mother?

185
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:26,703
Normally, no one would

186
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:28,863
do strange things like that.

187
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:30,583
Taiyang,

188
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:32,623
do you know who is the one

189
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:33,663
I envy the most?

190
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,463
It's you.

191
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:39,983
Actually, when I was your age,

192
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:42,103
I was staying in a hotel, too,

193
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,463
but that hotel

194
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,223
is nothing compared to Jifeng.

195
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,263
That's why I envy you.

196
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:50,983
You have a great father.

197
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:52,423
You have so many family members in Jifeng.

198
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:55,583
And your mother.

199
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,583
At least she can still come see you

200
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,183
and buy you so many

201
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:00,863
nice foods.

202
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,623
My mother

203
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,143
died of sickness many years ago.

204
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,663
I can never see her again.

205
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,263
Aren't you so much happier

206
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,303
compared to me?

207
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,263
Is father abandoning me?

208
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:22,503
Why would you think like that?

209
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,183
Why was he hiding then?

210
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:30,543
He's just afraid that

211
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,023
you're worried that he'll get jealous.

212
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:33,903
Jealous?

213
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:34,503
Yes.

214
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:36,743
Some parents would

215
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,023
get jealous

216
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:39,943
for their children,

217
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:42,223
but I've only heard of it

218
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,343
and have not seen it.

219
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:44,943
They want to love their children

220
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,783
more than their spouse.

221
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,183
You're so lucky.

222
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:52,543
All right.

223
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:54,903
Take your food

224
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:55,863
and look for your father.

225
00:12:58,863 --> 00:12:59,343
Let's go.

226
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,023
You bought so many nice foods.

227
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,783
Father, don't be jealous.

228
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:10,143
I love you the most.

229
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:18,303
Taiyang,

230
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:20,063
I just want to tell you...

231
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:21,263
I'll bring these foods

232
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,823
to the school tomorrow

233
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,303
and share with my friends.

234
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,063
I'll tell them

235
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:26,903
my mother bought these for me.

236
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:30,463
I'll ask Meng

237
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,543
to make a few boxes of snacks

238
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:32,823
for you to bring to school tomorrow.

239
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,263
I can't lose to your mother.

240
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,063
Father, don't worry.

241
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:37,823
You're the best in the world

242
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,303
in my heart.

243
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:41,543
I want to be with you forever.

244
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:49,903
We'll be together forever.

245
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:02,503
Let's go and have fun.

246
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:04,343
I'm going now.

247
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:07,583
Let's go.

248
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:10,103
Let's go.

249
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:17,543
Wait.

250
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:24,023
Don't you want to meet Lin Zong?

251
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,623
I have nothing to say to him.

252
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,543
I just want

253
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,183
to come see Taiyang

254
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,183
and check if they're well,

255
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:35,703
and I'm at ease.

256
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,903
I can go overseas in peace now.

257
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:40,023
You just want to reduce

258
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,343
your guiltiness.

259
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,583
Taiyang has been a knot in my heart.

260
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,863
After all, I made a mistake back then.

261
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,223
Don't ever say that
the child is a mistake,

262
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:50,663
okay?

263
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,623
Yes, it's my fault.

264
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:54,663
But, I saw how

265
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,303
he was waiting for me

266
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:57,543
and my heart was softened.

267
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,743
I was thinking that
I should just accept him.

268
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,263
But, day in, day out,

269
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,983
I noticed that I was wrong.

270
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Love can't be pretended.

271
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:07,103
If I had stayed,

272
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,903
it's bad for the three of us.

273
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:10,583
If I leave,

274
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:13,943
I get a chance to be happy.

275
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:18,943
I shouldn't have

276
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,623
chosen him
for the second best of choice.

277
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:22,703
Second best of choice?

278
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:24,223
That's what you think

279
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,183
about your relationship with him?

280
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,823
There will only be one person
that you love.

281
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:33,263
The rest of them are not important.

282
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,743
Shame on you.

283
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:24,863
Mr. Xiao Xian.

284
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:28,783
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:30,503
Taiyang, come here.

286
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:33,623
Apologize to Mr. Xiao Xian.

287
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,223
Mr. Xiao Xian, I'm sorry.

288
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,703
It's okay. Is he your son?

289
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:40,623
He's cute.

290
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:41,983
But now,

291
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,703
your father should be working.

292
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:44,783
Why did you ask him

293
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:45,623
to hang out with you?

294
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:49,023
Today is Mr. Lin's off day,

295
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:50,903
so he's taking care of his son here.

296
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:53,543
You're resting in the hotel.

297
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:55,903
Taiyang,

298
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:57,823
go and wait for me

299
00:16:58,023 --> 00:16:58,623
in the office.

300
00:16:58,863 --> 00:16:59,223
Go.

301
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:00,743
No. Who are you?

302
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:02,263
Are you trying to bully my father?

303
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:03,623
Don't be rude.

304
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:04,823
It seems like

305
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:06,183
it's not his first time here.

306
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,383
Since Jifeng has its owner changed,

307
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,823
all the rules and regulations

308
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:11,343
should follow Yunlan's.

309
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,623
In Yunlan, family members

310
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,463
are not allowed to enter
the hotel as they wish.

311
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:17,183
Anyone who violates that
will be terminated.

312
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:18,863
Xian,

313
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,303
when Lin Zong started working here
four years ago,

314
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:22,543
he's entitled to these benefits.

315
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,663
Really? Is there a supportive document?

316
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:30,943
Standardized management

317
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:32,703
is the fundamental of a stable business.

318
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:34,623
I remember Mr. Lin

319
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,983
was working in Deju, right?

320
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,503
I'm sure you'll understand.

321
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:42,783
Of course.

322
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:43,463
Okay.

323
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:46,423
I'm afraid that you'll need to

324
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,383
find a new job.

325
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:50,823
Qi, get the finance

326
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:53,263
to pay Mr. Lin.

327
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,463
Well,

328
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,583
we can pay him more compensation.

329
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:25,663
You're quick

330
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:26,743
at this kind of things.

331
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:31,623
I'm thankful to you

332
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:33,343
for what's been happening,

333
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,263
but that's enough.

334
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,903
Don't fight with your brother anymore.

335
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,903
Actually, ever since
Jifeng was taken over,

336
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:41,703
I've prepared myself

337
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:42,703
to leave.

338
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:45,383
Whoever taking over

339
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,063
is not going to keep

340
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,463
the original manager.

341
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,743
Don't worry about this.

342
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,823
I don't want you to worry about this.

343
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:54,943
Taiyang is growing up.

344
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:56,503
I can work somewhere else.

345
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,343
Didn't you check on me?

346
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,463
I was the youngest director
in Deju back then.

347
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,503
Put aside other things,

348
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:04,543
just look at my resume.

349
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:06,343
There are many hotels in Wusu.

350
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:07,943
I can go to any one of them.

351
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,703
But to Taiyang,

352
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,263
Jifeng is not a hotel but home.

353
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:22,463
Since it's his home,

354
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:23,903
don't keep saying you want

355
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:24,903
to leave.

356
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:28,783
Don't worry. I'll figure this out.

357
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,543
I've been staying in hotels since young.

358
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,303
After staying in so many hotels,

359
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:38,063
Jifeng does give me the sense of home.

360
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:39,903
All right.

361
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:42,863
Don't impose that on me.

362
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:44,063
You feel like it's home here

363
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:45,783
because of the hostess, Xiaoran.

364
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:46,663
No.

365
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,623
It's because of Xiaoran, the journalist.

366
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:54,183
You're right.

367
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:57,623
If I've left,

368
00:19:58,303 --> 00:19:59,383
I can't show you

369
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:00,663
how faithful I am.

370
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:03,623
Faithful?

371
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,023
All right, show me.

372
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:10,103
Thanks for taking care of Taiyang.

373
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,183
Do help me to

374
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,743
thank Xiaoran.

375
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:15,303
Okay.

376
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:21,263
Next month,

377
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,583
ask Qi to come back and help me

378
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:25,183
with the opening
of Yunduan Hotel in Deju.

379
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:26,583
I also

380
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:28,143
need him to plan my wedding.

381
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,023
I don't trust anyone else but him.

382
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,423
I want to launch

383
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,183
a single parent benefit policy in Jifeng.

384
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:47,863
As for Lin Zong...

385
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,263
I'll stay out of Lin Zong's matter.

386
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:53,303
Just keep him if you want to.

387
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:57,383
Actually, I'm more curious

388
00:20:57,543 --> 00:20:58,703
about why you're staying here.

389
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:03,143
Honestly, in just a few months' time,

390
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,703
you've changed a lot.

391
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,223
I heard that you're not living

392
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:07,823
in the hotel,

393
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,103
but renting a house out there, are you?

394
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:11,943
Xian.

395
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:13,503
You don't go back home in Hupu.

396
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:15,503
Are you settling down in Wusu?

397
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:17,583
Xian,

398
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,463
why does it even bother you?

399
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,543
Yes, also,

400
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,303
everyone knows about you

401
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:24,303
going out with Miss He.

402
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:25,943
I learned some details.

403
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:28,143
She was your
high school classmate, right?

404
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:32,023
If I'm not mistaken,

405
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:33,783
her name is

406
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,983
He Xiaoran, right?

407
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:42,383
Yes.

408
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,703
She's now my girlfriend.

409
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,703
(There will only be one person
that you love.)

410
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:14,663
The rest of them are not important.

411
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:31,903
Are you tired today?

412
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:35,943
Well, Xian said he wants to meet you.

413
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,183
He wants to meet me?

414
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,143
He said he wants to meet my girlfriend.

415
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,703
I think there's nothing

416
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:43,743
to avoid.

417
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:45,303
After all, if we keep seeing each other,

418
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:46,863
you'll have to meet him one day.

419
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:48,983
Do you

420
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:50,503
want to go?

421
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:55,263
It's fine if you don't want to meet him.

422
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:56,183
No forcing.

423
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,143
Does he prepare something nice to eat?

424
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:09,663
I remember in high school,

425
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,343
Qi always went to your house.

426
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:13,703
I didn't expect you two to...

427
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:17,983
It's a little sudden.

428
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:20,743
Can I ask you a question?

429
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:23,063
Why did you choose

430
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:24,863
to work in a small city?

431
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:26,503
As I remember your academy result

432
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:28,743
was the best among all of you.

433
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:29,303
Also,

434
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:30,623
you were enrolled in Qi's school.

435
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:31,583
I was thinking to myself

436
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,263
if this girl

437
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:34,943
made a mistake in her exams.

438
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:36,303
Xian,

439
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:39,343
how did you get to know all these?

440
00:23:39,823 --> 00:23:41,143
Not telling me doesn't mean that

441
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,743
I don't care about your growth.

442
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:45,903
We had some misunderstanding before,

443
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:47,423
but we've settled that now.

444
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:48,303
Really?

445
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:50,863
If it's settled,

446
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:51,583
why would two people from Hupu

447
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:52,543
be hiding here

448
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:53,303
for dating?

449
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,103
Xian.

450
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,143
I'll use the washroom.

451
00:23:57,823 --> 00:23:58,303
Excuse me.

452
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,623
You're staying here because of her,

453
00:24:03,823 --> 00:24:04,143
right?

454
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,343
It doesn't matter.

455
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:09,463
At least it proves that

456
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:11,063
you've let go of

457
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,063
Chen Fei'er.

458
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:13,263
Not bad.

459
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:26,463
Scram!

460
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:58,543
Are you okay?

461
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
(Younger Chen Fei'er)

462
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:45,263
That's a deal for us.

463
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:46,343
Seven years later,

464
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,103
on this day when we're 25 years old,

465
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:50,103
we'll come here to take
the time capsule.

466
00:25:50,263 --> 00:25:51,983
We must come no matter what happens.

467
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:52,623
- Okay.
- Okay.

468
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:54,023
It's a deal.

469
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:55,503
It's a deal.

470
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:27,463
What are you doing?

471
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,703
You're not full eating from the dinner?

472
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:30,983
I'm full.

473
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:32,023
I'm too full.

474
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:33,063
So, I don't want to sleep too early.

475
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:34,063
That's why I'm doing something.

476
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:34,983
I can just

477
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,383
wash the new plates.

478
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:38,783
Did Xian

479
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,303
say something to upset you?

480
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:42,023
No.

481
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:43,823
Well,

482
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:45,383
do you know

483
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:46,063
how Fei'er is doing?

484
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:48,783
I didn't contact her.

485
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:54,703
Are you okay?

486
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:56,423
It's brand new.

487
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:56,823
Does it hurt?

488
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:58,783
I'm fine.

489
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:02,943
Throw it away.

490
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:07,263
Keep it. Don't throw it away.

491
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,023
It's a shame.

492
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:09,263
The plates and bowls we bought

493
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:10,543
are in pairs.

494
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:11,823
What should we do

495
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:12,423
after throwing one away?

496
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:13,783
It's okay.

497
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,463
I can just be careful when I use it.

498
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:24,663
Xiaoran.

499
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,143
I'll pick up a call.

500
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:29,703
Hello.

501
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:37,343
Okay, see you tomorrow.

502
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:56,063
Did you see the wedding proposal?

503
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,663
I planned to get Qi back

504
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:03,503
to hold it for us.

505
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:05,383
Do you mind about that?

506
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:08,143
Why should I?

507
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:10,383
After so many years,

508
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:11,863
he should've let it go.

509
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,143
Miss Chen, here's your gown.

510
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:24,823
Mr. Li's wife will be here, too.

511
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:25,823
Go and

512
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:27,343
talk to her.

513
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:29,823
I got it.

514
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:32,143
I'll get changed first.

515
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:32,943
Okay.

516
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:03,503
(Why is the main character not here yet)

517
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:04,143
(to respond?)

518
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:05,183
(Already left the country?)

519
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,823
(I've taken the shot.)

520
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:07,623
(Xiao Shangqi,)

521
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:11,503
(I've loved you)

522
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:13,543
(for so long.)

523
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:16,023
(If we're to count it,)

524
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,463
(it should be starting from high school.)

525
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,463
(It has been)

526
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:21,383
(five years and four months now.)

527
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:25,743
(I know, after graduation...)

528
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,223
Everyone is talking about me.

529
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,183
I'm scared.

530
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,900
(Exit, Institution of Foreign Studies
Future Star, Hupu Chat Group)

531
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,500
(Zhao Mingxuan)

532
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:41,943
(Mingxuan,)

533
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:43,503
(can you lend me some money?)

534
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:46,583
(Wang Yang)
(Why did you leave the group?)

535
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:48,583
(What happened yesterday?)

536
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:52,503
If you still take me as your friend,

537
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:53,783
stop mentioning that matter.

538
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:00,983
How are you?

539
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:02,663
Feeling better?

540
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,423
How do you feel today?

541
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,023
How do you feel today?

542
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:41,423
The doctor has given

543
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:42,503
a few follow-up treatments.

544
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,503
Of course, one surgery for stitching

545
00:30:45,063 --> 00:30:45,583
can't solve it at once.

546
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:48,143
We'll talk outside.

547
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:49,863
Rest for a while.

548
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:57,503
It can't

549
00:30:57,703 --> 00:30:58,423
get the best outcome.

550
00:30:58,663 --> 00:30:59,423
We need some time.

551
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:01,143
You've been staying in ICU.

552
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:02,223
The fee is quite high.

553
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:03,103
I personally suggest

554
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:04,543
to transfer to normal ward.

555
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:07,543
No need, just stay in ICU.

556
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:08,463
Okay.

557
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:21,703
Well,

558
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:24,263
I want to increase

559
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:25,703
my temporary credit card's limits.

560
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,023
It's a supplementary card.

561
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:33,063
Okay.

562
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:38,423
I'm sorry.

563
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:56,383
It's okay.

564
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:09,263
I know you don't like

565
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:10,303
a crowded place.

566
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,103
So, I purposely

567
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,063
booked the whole place.

568
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:21,423
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

569
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:27,823
Don't call me Mr. Zhao.

570
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:29,503
Just call me Mingxuan.

571
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:34,223
Carry on.

572
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:35,983
I need to use the washroom.

573
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:37,183
Okay.

574
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:11,183
Whose birthday is today?

575
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:15,063
Your surgery went well.

576
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,343
I believe you'll become

577
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:18,383
prettier and prettier.

578
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:22,303
If we really need a reason

579
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:23,943
for eating a cake,

580
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:27,223
let's make today

581
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,263
the day of your rebirth.

582
00:33:30,823 --> 00:33:32,983
I must make a wish then.

583
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:33,663
Okay.

584
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:41,343
What wish did you make?

585
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:42,343
You're so serious.

586
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:45,943
I wish when I go back,

587
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:48,143
I can find a nice job

588
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:49,663
and pay Shangqi back

589
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:51,863
the medical fee.

590
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:55,863
What kind of job

591
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:57,863
do you want to do?

592
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:04,103
I wanted to become a journalist.

593
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,103
A war correspondent.

594
00:34:08,223 --> 00:34:09,703
If I can't stop the war,

595
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:11,303
let me tell the world

596
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,423
the truth of the war.

597
00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:16,183
That's great.

598
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:18,383
I want to make a wish, too.

599
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:21,303
How can you make a wish
together with me?

600
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:25,183
I wish the world will be at peace.

601
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:26,743
Miss Chen Fei'er

602
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:27,903
will stay in Hupu then.

603
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:28,863
She'll stay in

604
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:29,943
some place where I can see her.

605
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:53,503
Thank you, Mingxuan.

606
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:59,062
Most welcome. Come on.

607
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,063
You're going back so soon?

608
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,103
Won't you come with me for
the consultation tomorrow?

609
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:34,863
I need to go back to the country.

610
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:40,343
I don't feel secured without you around.

611
00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:44,103
Did I do something

612
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:44,783
that upset you?

613
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:45,303
No.

614
00:35:48,383 --> 00:35:49,103
Shangqi,

615
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:51,183
I've delayed you so much.

616
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,463
I'll look for you again once
you're done with your work.

617
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:55,143
No need.

618
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:58,663
What's going on?

619
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
Or

620
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,223
you were not happy about me being with

621
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:03,343
Mingxuan yesterday?

622
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:05,823
When did you start

623
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:07,783
to have this dream of being
a war correspondent?

624
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:13,783
I was just continuing the topic.

625
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:14,383
Don't...

626
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,063
Okay. Take a rest for now.

627
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,023
I wish you all the best.

628
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:40,343
What are you looking at?

629
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:42,783
You didn't contact him at all?

630
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,810
(Xiao Shangqi)

631
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:48,263
(Xiao Shangqi)
I don't know what you're worried about.

632
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:50,503
If I like him,

633
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:52,103
shouldn't I have...

634
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,303
Are you so proud of yourself?

635
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:03,343
I just want to say,
when I didn't know about

636
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:04,743
a single thing,

637
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:06,143
I didn't fall in love with him.

638
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,423
Now, I'm together with you.

639
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,663
How will I fall in love with him?

640
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:18,143
For me to stand straight

641
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,383
next to you,

642
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:21,703
you've given me the best packaging,

643
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:22,823
and the best life

644
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,623
that others can never have.

645
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,823
Before meeting you, I didn't know that

646
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:30,583
someone can actually do these things.

647
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:33,943
Mingxuan.

648
00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:36,183
Ever since

649
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:37,503
I've decided to marry you,

650
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:39,303
I've been living my life

651
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,663
only for you.

652
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:49,743
Fei'er,

653
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:52,743
after our wedding,

654
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:54,543
I'll give you some shares

655
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:56,303
so that you can enter

656
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:57,183
this circle.

657
00:37:58,503 --> 00:37:59,383
I'll also make you

658
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,703
the woman everyone envies.

659
00:38:06,943 --> 00:38:07,343
Thank you.

660
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:12,943
How about

661
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:13,863
the bridesmaid?

662
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:15,863
If there's no one suitable,

663
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:16,983
just

664
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,143
get the wedding planner to find

665
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:18,823
a professional bridesmaid.

666
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:21,903
I'll do as you say.

667
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:24,543
Why did Mr. He

668
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,823
choose the topic

669
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:26,823
of first love?

670
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,623
I can't deny that it's going
to be a great topic.

671
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:30,743
It'll get attention for sure.

672
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,463
I have Internet datas as reference.

673
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:35,663
What a nice couple.

674
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:36,503
Why must you

675
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:37,983
cause trouble to them?

676
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:39,783
Since you're thinking
about your first love,

677
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,223
don't come out and hurt others.

678
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,223
No one wants to be

679
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:43,503
a replacement of others.

680
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:45,103
Journalist He, why do you

681
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,383
go back to us?

682
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:49,023
She's here for me.

683
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:50,863
You should all leave now.

684
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:00,983
What's wrong?

685
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,903
Weren't you curious about

686
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:04,743
why Xiao Shangqi and I

687
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:05,463
didn't get together

688
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,063
after so long?

689
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:10,943
Actually, the one he'd been loving

690
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:11,743
was not me.

691
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:16,063
It's his first love that
he couldn't be together with,

692
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:16,943
Chen Fei'er.

693
00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:21,823
That's why

694
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:23,343
your reaction was like that just now.

695
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:26,023
There's this

696
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:26,663
irritating character

697
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:28,183
between you and Xiao Shangqi.

698
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:31,743
When her name was mentioned yesterday,

699
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,743
I realized that

700
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:34,703
I didn't let go of

701
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:35,823
the past.

702
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,303
She and Xiao Shangqi

703
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:41,103
went overseas on the year we graduated.

704
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:43,343
They were dating?

705
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:45,303
I'm not sure

706
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,423
and I dare not ask.

707
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:49,783
I'm scared that

708
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:51,663
I might get to know something
that I don't want to hear.

709
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:53,703
I'm also scared that

710
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,503
Xiao Shangqi will think of her again.

711
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:58,623
Why did you become

712
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,343
so not confident?

713
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:07,743
After all, I've seen and participated in

714
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:09,383
the entire process of him

715
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,063
pursuing Chen Fei'er

716
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:12,943
in high school.

717
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:19,103
Well,

718
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:20,743
where's his first love now?

719
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,863
She should be in Hupu.

720
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:24,663
I don't know.

721
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:29,303
What?

722
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,383
You're not like He Xiaoran now.

723
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:33,223
Do you know that?

724
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:35,223
Xiao Shangqi is now staying

725
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:36,463
in Wusu for you.

726
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,823
Stop thinking about

727
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:38,423
his first love.

728
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:39,463
Isn't she in Hupu now?

729
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:40,063
She's nowhere

730
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:41,343
near you two now.

731
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:42,943
Why are you worried?

732
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,063
Yes, maybe she's married

733
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,903
with children now.

734
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:50,943
Yes.

735
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:53,623
Well,

736
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,463
did you buy the tickets that

737
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:56,023
I asked you to buy for me?

738
00:40:59,263 --> 00:40:59,583
Here.

739
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,383
It's not easy to get them.

740
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:05,943
I know.

741
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:09,103
I'll buy you a meal.

742
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:10,983
I'm leaving now.

743
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,943
Let's have a meal in the loft
two days later.

744
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,983
I think this is an old tree.

745
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:29,183
I remember we had one

746
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:30,023
in our yard before.

747
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:32,543
You were climbing that
when we were young.

748
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:34,943
You remembered it wrong.

749
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:36,783
The tree that I was climbing

750
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:37,823
was an orange tree.

751
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:39,423
It blocked the lighting from
shining into your room,

752
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,583
so it was chopped off.

753
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,223
I'll be back in Hupu in two days.

754
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:48,663
Since you hardly come to Wusu,

755
00:41:48,783 --> 00:41:50,103
why not you go out and walk around?

756
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:50,863
You're that busy?

757
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:54,623
Don't you know

758
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:56,063
what's the most important thing now?

759
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:57,983
Speaking of this,

760
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:58,743
I'll not bother about

761
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:00,983
Lin Zong's matter anymore,

762
00:42:01,743 --> 00:42:04,343
but regarding the mission
given to me by father,

763
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:06,463
when are you going to do it?

764
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:09,383
Yunduan is busy with the opening.

765
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:11,223
Father and I can't handle it on our own.

766
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:13,023
You're idling here alone.

767
00:42:13,503 --> 00:42:14,943
Do you think that's appropriate?

768
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:16,183
Let me think about it.

769
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,063
Qi,

770
00:42:20,383 --> 00:42:20,743
everyone in the circle

771
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:22,263
is spreading the rumor about

772
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:23,183
you banishing yourself

773
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:24,823
to Wusu.

774
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:27,263
I think you're enjoying

775
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,903
your life here.

776
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:32,263
But since you're so scared
of going back to Hupu,

777
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:35,543
are you guilty of something?

778
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,823
I've never done anything bad to anyone.

779
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:40,583
Why should I be guilty?

780
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:43,663
Okay.

781
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:44,943
Since that's the case,

782
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:49,263
just take this as a work trip,

783
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:50,223
okay?

784
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:51,343
Come back and help us

785
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:52,423
to share the burden.

786
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:53,423
Also, think about it.

787
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:55,223
Maybe once you show yourself,

788
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:56,223
the rumor

789
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:57,463
will end by itself,

790
00:42:59,143 --> 00:42:59,703
