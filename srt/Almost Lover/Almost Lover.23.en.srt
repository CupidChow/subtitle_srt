17
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,710
Hui,

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,110
are you really

19
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,990
planning to be a resident singer

20
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,950
here for the rest of your life?

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,950
Is it meaningful to make petty money

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,270
as a part-timer?

23
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,790
Are you sick of my singing,

24
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,510
so you want to replace me?

25
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,630
No, don't overthink it.

26
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,430
It's surely not.

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,430
I think

28
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,990
you're quite talented.

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,910
It's a waste of talent
singing at my place.

30
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,390
Is it a waste of talent

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,590
singing at your place?

32
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,390
What a joke.

33
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,110
No.

34
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,910
Give it a good thought.

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,830
I mean it.

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,750
See you, Hao.

37
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,830
Well,

38
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,910
Hao is right.

39
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,870
How long do you want

40
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,350
to work as a part-timer here?

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,390
I sing some songs and
earn money by doing so.

42
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,510
Are you jealous

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,590
of my carefree days?

44
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,910
You're funny.

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,750
How much can you possibly earn here?

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,070
Just enough for me to spend will do.

47
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,390
You're right.

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,110
If you're short of money,
you still have me.

49
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,870
You still have me, too.

50
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,470
I'm so happy.

51
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,470
I got my paycheck today!

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,870
I'll buy you a meal.

53
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,110
It just so happens you're nominated
as Newsmaker of the Year.

54
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,390
I'll treat you both to anything.

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,950
If anyone's treating, it should be me.

56
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,510
Don't try to fight with me.

57
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,990
How about this?

58
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,470
She's Newsmaker of the Year,

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,790
right?

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,750
Isn't it worth celebrating
three times in a row?

61
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,750
I'll treat you both today.

62
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,750
You'll treat us tomorrow.

63
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,510
Then, you'll treat us
the day after tomorrow.

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,310
Let's go for a meal!

65
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,710
Sui Mingwei,

66
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,750
help me get my guitar.

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,430
Not a bad suggestion.

68
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,360
Let's go.

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,120
How despicable.

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,640
Engaging in psychological tactics
with the lonely and widowed elderly.

71
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,360
I don't get it.

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,800
Has he always been so lustful

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,040
and I was blinded and
didn't see it before?

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
Or did he suddenly become like this?

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,280
It's not entirely bad.

76
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,280
You can also let go of your past

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
and seek justice without distractions.

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,400
Did any of them show interest in

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
the nursing home's information
that we gathered?

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,760
No one contacted me.

81
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,640
Considering the fuss Mr. Sun made,

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,840
I think everyone's just watching still.

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
The two groups are something else.

84
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,560
One group is racing against time
to drive people away

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,040
while the other group is pretending
to be sick and hospitalised,

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,160
and won't leave.

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,360
What's going on?

88
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
Mr. Sun is going to Lizhen.

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,320
He's moving out tonight.

90
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Remember to visit us often.

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Sun.

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,720
Pay us a visit often.

93
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
You forgot to take

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,280
the precious belonging under your bed.

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,280
In one's life,

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,200
be it wealth

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360
or possessions,

98
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,360
it doesn't matter.

99
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,480
One won't be able to
bring it to the afterlife.

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,240
But this good wine is an exception.

101
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Before I die,

102
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,360
I'll definitely finish it.

103
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,320
Sun,

104
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,240
why have you

105
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,080
become the first to move out?

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,850
Wasn't I hospitalised?

107
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,650
I was taught a lesson by my nephew.

108
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,450
I wanted to stay no matter what happens.

109
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,290
That's right.

110
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,210
But my nephew's wife is pregnant.

111
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,810
I'll have to find a place

112
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,290
that'll give them privacy.

113
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,970
A single bed

114
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,050
in a room

115
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,090
where I can take care of the baby.

116
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,410
My life is complete.

117
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,810
That's right.

118
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,010
You have a happy family.

119
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,370
You're right.

120
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,770
If you continue to stay here,

121
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,050
one day you will

122
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,370
cause trouble to your family.

123
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,130
Won't that cause trouble
to the young ones?

124
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,490
Didn't the information sheet show that

125
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,410
Lizhen is RMB 500

126
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,890
more expensive than Qingshan?

127
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,250
It's not a small sum.

128
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,210
They've reduced the price.

129
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,490
It's the same as the current one now.

130
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,970
That's great.

131
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,530
I'll pay a visit and accompany you.

132
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,130
I'll go ahead first

133
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,610
and stay for two days.

134
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,170
If it's great there,
let's all move in together.

135
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,770
Sure.

136
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,850
Wang,

137
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,050
you'd better come along.

138
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,330
You'd get

139
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,290
senile sometimes.

140
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,050
At least I'll be able to help you out.

141
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,490
Sun,

142
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,290
I'm not senile today, all right?

143
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,330
You're not.

144
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,090
You're not.

145
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,410
That's interesting.

146
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,810
It's time for me to leave.

147
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,810
Please go back in, everyone.

148
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,770
Don't drink too much.

149
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,610
That's right.

150
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,930
Remember to visit us.

151
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,170
Mr. Xiao,

152
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,650
both the designs are designed

153
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,410
according to your requirements.

154
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,770
All right.

155
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,330
Mr. Xiao,

156
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,490
this closet

157
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,730
now takes up space on the picture.

158
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,330
It's too big.

159
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,570
It's better to edit it away.

160
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,290
Mr. Xiao.

161
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,090
- Mr. Xiao.
- There'll be a difference this way.

162
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,130
After Mr. Sun signed this,

163
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,410
the elderly are not that tense anymore.

164
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,940
We just got another
two contracts signed.

165
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,940
But we have to

166
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,940
spend a lot of money

167
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,460
to make up the difference every month.

168
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,020
So, it turns out that Mr. Xiao

169
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,340
is the mastermind here.

170
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,980
That's not entirely true.

171
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,300
Mr. Sun changed his mind himself,

172
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,140
but his family

173
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,340
is unwilling to pay the extra RMB 500.

174
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,780
That's why Mr. Xiao

175
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,020
pulled some strings behind the scene.

176
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,860
Tell them that

177
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,100
those who are willing to
leave before the severance day

178
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,700
will be compensated
an additional RMB 3,000.

179
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,060
(Transfer contract)
All right, leave it to me.

180
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,100
Strike while the iron is hot.

181
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,020
Lin Zong.

182
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,700
Do you think I behave
like Zhao Mingxuan?

183
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,980
What are you talking about?

184
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,180
Someone said that about me.

185
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,660
Maybe she's right.

186
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,100
Who...

187
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,620
Was it He Xiaoran?

188
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,540
Don't be ridiculous.

189
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Mr. Zhao's not the kind

190
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,780
that does good deeds behind the scene.

191
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,100
Oh, right.

192
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,060
I went to work opposite
the radio and TV station that day.

193
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,820
They're holding

194
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,380
Annual Journalist
Commendation Conference

195
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,500
on the day after tomorrow.

196
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,980
He Xiaoran's name is

197
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
on the nomination list.

198
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,980
She's becoming better.

199
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,900
She looks like
a war correspondent now.

200
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,900
Jifeng Hotel will
be changing fragrance soon.

201
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,740
Your company's

202
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,220
the first one I thought of.

203
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,980
You should give me a friendship offer.

204
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,180
I only handle the retail now,

205
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,300
the household fragrance.

206
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,590
Isn't your company

207
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,870
mainly catered for hotels?

208
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,110
Now, you're even doing retail?

209
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,910
After all, you don't
need me in your business.

210
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,910
Oh, right.

211
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,470
How's Xiaoran doing lately?

212
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,270
She's not coming

213
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,070
to our place anymore.

214
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,950
I happen to have some news

215
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,030
to tell her.

216
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,350
Forget about that person's news.

217
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,830
The qualified ex-boyfriend

218
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,870
should have perished earlier

219
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,230
and never appear again.

220
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,310
Basically, that's about it.

221
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,270
Finally,

222
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,990
I got in touch with the needs

223
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,990
of Qingshan Hotel.

224
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,710
After a period of time,

225
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,270
I'll take some samples and visit them.

226
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,190
I've arranged for Wei
to handle Qingshan.

227
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,630
Wei?

228
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,310
His childish retail idea

229
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,710
hasn't come to fruition yet.

230
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,550
This big order for our company

231
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,550
might be too hard

232
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,590
for him, no?

233
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,750
Fei.

234
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,110
You've dominated the business
of major customers

235
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,270
for so long.

236
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,710
You should let go a little

237
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,750
to let the young ones
have a chance at it.

238
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,590
I said I won't do it.

239
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,710
Also,

240
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,550
don't lay a hand on Qingshan's business.

241
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,510
Why is that?

242
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,190
Didn't you see the news?

243
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,390
Didn't Mr. Xiao

244
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,870
handle it pretty well?

245
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,670
He turned a crisis into a sensation.

246
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,550
How brilliant was that?

247
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,670
Wei.

248
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,030
You burned the company's funds

249
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,790
for the retail R&D.

250
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,190
Let's put aside how much you've earned,

251
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,430
but I'm sure you at least

252
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,030
have self-awareness, right?

253
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,030
If we got a hold of Qingshan,

254
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,720
there'll be enough funds for you to
toss around for a few months.

255
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
Who said there's no profit?

256
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,600
I've even introduced Fei

257
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,160
to two new nursing homes.

258
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,360
Wei.

259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,040
I was just helping you
connect with others.

260
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,400
With just those two,

261
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,400
it's not enough to cover

262
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
even our lowest procurement threshold.

263
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,120
Once you get your retail idea going,

264
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,680
all will be given back to you.

265
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
Son.

266
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,480
Let me tell you this.

267
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,760
As a man,

268
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,880
you should have a career no matter what.

269
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
You'll attract people this way.

270
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,640
Do you get it?

271
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,370
(Lizhen Nursing Home)

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
Sun, what happened to you?

273
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,210
Xiaoran.

274
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,410
- Why are you here?
- Going to Lizhen?

275
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,210
Let's go together, then.

276
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,810
You don't have to work today?

277
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,410
I need to expand my business.

278
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,650
Let's go.

279
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,930
You're He Xiaoran, right?

280
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,090
I saw

281
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,170
the photo on the screen.

282
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,970
You're nominated as

283
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,050
Newsmaker of the Year?

284
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,890
Hello, how can I help you?

285
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,810
What terrible place did you recommend?

286
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,890
Do you know that
my uncle just stayed there for a day

287
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,410
and he's got hospitalised?

288
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,650
I'll give you a gift.

289
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:00,970
What are you doing?

290
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,490
It's none of your business!

291
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,570
Hold still!

292
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,210
Who was that?

293
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,210
How immoral.

294
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,210
He's too mean.

295
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,090
Xiaoran.

296
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,130
Are you all right?

297
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,730
How mean.

298
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:28,970
Excuse me, nurse.

299
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:29,970
How's

300
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,210
the patient inside doing?

301
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,410
Who are you to him?

302
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,770
We're his family members.

303
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,970
Myocardial infarction.

304
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,330
Any later

305
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,290
and it'll be too late.

306
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,490
How could you be so irresponsible?

307
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,450
You put an old man in a nursing home

308
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,450
and left him to himself?

309
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,780
The old man is already admitted

310
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,580
and you didn't keep an eye on him.

311
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,260
What's going on?

312
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,940
It's our fault.

313
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,180
Can we go in

314
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,900
and visit him now?

315
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,460
The patient just slept off.

316
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,820
Which one of you will follow me

317
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,140
to pay for the hospital fees?

318
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,780
Didn't the people from
Lizhen Nursing Home come?

319
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,740
Lizhen said they've stated in

320
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,740
the admission contract clearly

321
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,220
with the escort process.

322
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,060
The elderly who are hospitalised
due to illness

323
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,460
will need to be responsible
for their own medical expenses.

324
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,420
Li Zhen's exempted from any liability.

325
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,180
There was a person
who came this morning.

326
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,700
He said he's the patient's nephew.

327
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,700
He left after taking a look.

328
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,340
You're a family, right?

329
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
You stay here and
look after grandfather.

330
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,660
I'll follow you to pay the fees.

331
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,700
Where do we do that?

332
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,220
Follow me.

333
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,520
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)

334
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,180
Sui.

335
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,180
Do you think that

336
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,460
Sun got sick because of me?

337
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,260
He's already in his senior years.

338
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,340
For him to move out suddenly,

339
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,140
it must be hard to adapt.

340
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
Don't listen to his nonsense.

341
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,100
You have nothing to do with this.

342
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,270
You should go home and get changed.

343
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,190
No need.

344
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,190
I'll accompany you here.

345
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,630
Madam, let me help you.

He Xiaoran.

347
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,030
Is it not enough that you're
being played on the screen?

348
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,710
You've now put a medal

349
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,030
right outside the company door.

350
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,990
This idea's not bad. It's eye-catching.

351
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,790
You won't miss it when you pass by it.

352
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,190
Let's go.

353
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,030
Thank you.

354
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,800
That guy

355
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
must be too upset.

356
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,400
He doesn't know where to direct it.

357
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,800
There are plenty of people like him.

358
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,080
I was thinking

359
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,800
if I could've done more

360
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,200
or lesser

361
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,720
so that the situation wouldn't have

362
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
escalated to what it is today.

363
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,000
To be frank, being a journalist

364
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,800
is quite radiant and righteous.

365
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
But for any profession,

366
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,040
there'll be boundaries.

367
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,400
You can't take care of everything.

368
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,000
Even more so,

369
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,680
be responsible for everything.

370
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,240
Of course, boundaries

371
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,240
are hard to maintain.

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
However, I personally think that

373
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
if you give it your all

374
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
and have no regrets,

375
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,800
that's enough.

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
You called?

378
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,320
What are you trying to do?

379
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,360
I've asked the director.

380
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,640
Your uncle had myocardial infarction

381
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
and broke a bottle of good wine.

382
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,240
But that particular year's wine
is too hard to find.

383
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
So, I've just bought two bottles.

384
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Wait until your uncle's discharged

385
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,930
and give it to him.

386
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,410
Okay.

387
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,330
Also,

388
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,570
this has nothing to do with Miss He.

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,050
Can you stop harassing her?

If there's any issue,

391
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,130
come look for me.

392
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,370
You give me these two bottles of wine

393
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,970
and expect me to let things slide?

394
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,210
Let me tell you this.

395
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,050
No way.

396

If my uncle couldn't wake up,

397
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,050
I'll blame everything on

398

399
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,170
Don't think about
getting away from this.

Hello, Mr. Pan.

I'm He Xiaoran.

It's like this.

413

If your uncle

414
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,970
is having any trouble
with the hospital fees,

415

No.

Please don't.

418

Look,

419
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,850
actually, I was reckless the other day.

420

get your hand hurt?

Do you know how terrible that guy is?

for his child.

You really don't spoil things.

Before these things expire,

451
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,030
you consume them again.

453
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,790
It hurts.

454

(No.3 Blue Dream)

514
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,010
(No.3 Blue Dream)
Are they here?

515
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,010
(No.3 Blue Dream)
They are.

516
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,660
(No.3 Blue Dream)

517
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,170
Let's meet them.

518
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,970
When was

519
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,370
the paint cleaned?

520
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,010
The staff from Jifeng hotel
came yesterday.

521
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,530
You're back.

522
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,330
I was afraid you wouldn't make it

523
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,290
for the Commendation Conference.

524
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,690
So, how's everything?

525
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,730
Has everything settled?

526
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:44,810
Look.

527
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,890
Now that the paint's also cleaned,

528
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,850
you can confidently

529
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,970
step inside to receive your award.

530
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:48,650
Let's go.

531
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,730
Before we came up,

532
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:51,890
(Nomination of the Newsmaker
of the Year, He Xiaoran)

533
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,170
I took her phone

534
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:53,770
and took a peek

535
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,890
at your Moments.

536
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,290
Come on, Mr. Zhang.

537
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,050
Have I blocked you for nothing?

538
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,330
You blocked me just to complain

539
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,370
how the interview was rejected,

540
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,570
manuscript was sabotaged,

541
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,970
no leave periods,

542
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,810
and long working hours.

543
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,650
Someone from Qingshan
came to pay the hospital fees.

544
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,690
They even paid us
three months' allowance.

545
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,210
When was

546
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,490
the paint cleaned?

547
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,330
The staff from the Jifeng hotel
came yesterday.

548
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,890
Let's present our most
honourable journalist

549
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,330
with News of the Year award.

550
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,650
- All right.
- All right.

551
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,620
Please welcome

552
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,980
He Xiaoran.

553
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,340
Xiaoran.

554
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,380
It's your turn to receive the award.

555
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,260
He, congratulations.

556
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,100
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

557
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,180
Even though you're a new journalist,

558
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,220
you've really

559
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,100
done well.

560
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,300
Also, you write articles masterfully.

561
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,020
To be a good journalist,

562
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,900
you have to keep working harder.

563
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,860
Mr. Zhang's starting his speech again.

564
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,300
Well said!

565
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,620
Keep it up.

566
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,020
Lili.

567
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,540
I suddenly remember I have something on.

568
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,660
I'll have to take my leave for a while.

569
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,700
Can you take this

570
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,580
back for me?

571
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,340
Of course.

572
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,300
All right, thank you.

573
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,300
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

574
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,980
Xiao Shangqi.

575
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,780
You're the one who confronted Mr. Pan.

576
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,620
You also asked for
the paint to be cleaned.

577
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,540
Why?

578
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,060
What answer do you want to hear?

579
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,620
Everything I've done

580
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,340
was for the sake of
the elderly in Qingshan.

581
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,220
It has nothing to do with you.

582
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,380
Furthermore, as a journalist,

583
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,180
when pursuing truth and justice,

584
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,740
whatever problems that I'll face,

585
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
it should be me
who's responsible for it.

586
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,060
I don't need your

587
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,140
hypocrisy.

588
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,180
Hypocrisy?

589
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,100
He Xiaoran.

590
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,700
You're thinking too much into it.

591
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,820
If it wasn't for you,

592
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,540
the discharge will not go so smoothly.

593
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,270
Just treat it as

594
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,470
my gratitude for your help

595
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,150
and that's why I did all those.

596
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,150
Also,

597
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,470
I told you to stay out of it
but you refused.

598
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,910
Now, you've created the mess

599
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,190
for yourself.

600
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,990
In fact, those problems

601
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,630
can be solved with money.

602
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,750
What you could do to help them

603
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,510
are not necessarily better than
what I could do.

604
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,430
Are you aware that you're…

605
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,830
I know what you're going to say.

606
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,630
Getting more and more
like Zhao Mingxuan, right?

607
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,670
Why has that got
anything to do with you?

608
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,630
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

609
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,390
Xiaoran.

610
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,270
What's up?

611
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,470
Nothing.

612
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,790
Just finding trouble for myself.

613
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,110
Why are you here?

614
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,310
That's right.

615
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,070
Shouldn't you be at
the fragrance factory?

616
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,390
What brings you here?

617
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,950
Xixi Fragrance

618
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,790
will never collaborate

619
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,710
with Xiao family.

620
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,990
They're not compatible.

621
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,150
Will your personal opinion

622
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,870
affect the fragrance factory's decision?

623
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,230
That's my family's factory.

624
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,790
Fragrant No.3 that your family sent

625
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,030
is exceptionally good.

626
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,310
When the time comes,

627
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,790
I'll personally contact Miss Fan Xixi.

628
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,190
What a shame.

629
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,830
That's my own fragrance

630
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,990
from the retail line.

631
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,390
I won't let you have it

632
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,070
and you won't get the formula.

633
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,310
Because I've made it specially for

634
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,270
He Xiaoran.

635
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,920
Xiaoran.

636
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,840
Other than work,

637
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,120
do you have any other
personal relationship

638
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
with Mr. Xiao?

639
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,120
Xiaoran. Lili.

640
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,160
Come with me.

641
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,120
All right.

642
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,760
A complaint?

643
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,040
What's going on?

644
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,930
(Business and media collusion,
journalist taking rebate)

645
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,940
(Informant's letter)

646
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,840
Mr. Zhang.

647
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,480
That's fake news.

648
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,160
I've never added

649
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
the WeChat of Lizhen Nursing Home's
finance advisor.

650
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,040
Not even to mention receiving
rebates from them

651
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,560
to get rid of the elderly from Qingshan.

652
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,800
No matter this is fake or true,

653
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,720
we have initiated internal
investigation procedures

654
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,120
in accordance with the system.

655
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,440
Suspend your work for the time being.

656
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,840
Wait for further news at home.

657
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,560
So, no matter

658
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,320
what misinformation was given,

659
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,960
we must be suspended from our job?

660
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,760
Others do not believe us,

661
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,800
but won't you believe us?

662
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,000
What is your relationship with

663
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,680
Qingshan's buyer, Xiao Shangqi?

664
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,520
Mr. Zhang,

665
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,880
I am aware of this.

666
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,450
Lili.

667
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,250
As her direct superior,

668
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,970
depending on the results
of the investigation,

669
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,410
you are jointly and
severally responsible.

670
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,610
Remove He Xiaoran from

671
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,770
the Public News Figure first.

672
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,730
We'll wait until everything is clear.

673
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,050
Also,

674
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,570
report this news

675
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,810
to everyone.

676
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,730
We must be ask the rest to be alert.

677
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,410
Mr. Zhang,

678
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,970
I'm responsible for my own actions.

679
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,810
What I've done is purely

680
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,370
to help the elderly
in the nursing home.

681
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,490
I haven't done anything wrong.

682
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,290
As for Xiao Shangqi, we know each other,

683
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,690
but this does not affect

684
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,690
the impartiality of my report.

685
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,410
I'll get back to work.

686
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:15,890
You…

687
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,410
Xiaoran.

688
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,250
Xiaoran.

689
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,010
Don't be too rash.

690
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,970
Go back home first.

691
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,250
Go through the whole thing and

692
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,090
submit a report to
the investigation team.

693
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,740
(Newsmaker of the Year, He Xiaoran)

694
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,900
(Newsmaker of the Year, He Xiaoran)

695
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,530
(Wicked journalist colluding
with businessman for an act)

696
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:52,810
Mr. Xiao,

697
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,690
have you read the trending news?

698
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,570
There's a new trend.

699
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,410
It states that a wicked journalist
is colluding with a businessman.

700
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,970
A conscientious journalist
collected money from both sides

701
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,210
to get rid of the elderly from Qingshan.

702
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,050
This dirt has been thrown to

703
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,210
you and He Xiaoran directly.

704
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,850
The speed of this discriminatory

705
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,970
material

706
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,610
doesn't seem normal.

707
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,170
It came quickly.

708
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,540
How did it come about?

709
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,060
Let's go to Qingshan.

710
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
Call both
the public relations department

711
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,140
and the preparatory team.

712
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,900
Damang Mountain

713
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,220
is the key development zone

714
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,180
of Wusu in the future.

715
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,060
We, Deju, are also very optimistic

716
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,820
about the future
development prospects here.

717
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,380
I invite you all to come here today

718
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,740
because I want to set up

719
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
the Damang Mountain Hotel Alliance.

720
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,900
From the start of construction
to the future operation,

721
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,660
we can jointly

722
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,820
build a system

723
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
of our own.

724
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,700
We can jointly build a

725
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,540
good competitive environment.

726
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,340
And I also believe you all

727
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,180
have seen how Xiao Shangqi,

728
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,980
the current person in charge

729
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,460
of Jifeng,

730
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,260
used some negative news

731
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,660
to build momentum for himself

732
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,340
through Qingshan's project.

733
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,220
I think this approach

734
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,180
is immoral.

735
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,900
We should collectively resist him.

736
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,220
That makes sense.

737
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,940
They stole the limelight

738
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,020
before their launch.

739
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,780
If Damang Mountain

740
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,180
is taken advantage of by them,

741
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,460
what good can we have

742
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,660
from then on?

743
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,900
I agree.

744
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,940
All right, everyone.

745
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,020
Let's make a toast.

746
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,140
The earliest news

747
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,940
on the Internet

748
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,950
was posted at 4 p.m.

749
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,350
Then it spread in all directions.

750
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,070
Let the official party respond
as soon as possible

751
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,470
to clarify the matter

752
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,710
has nothing to do with the journalist.

753
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,910
Mr. Li.

754
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,750
Identify

755
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,270
the channels that are spreading this.

756
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,910
I need to find the entry point.

757
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,590
But Mr. Xiao,

758
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,750
aren't we clarifying the content

759
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,150
to protect ourselves?

760
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,030
The discharge is a normal process.

761
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,390
We offer them money
for humanitarian reasons.

762
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,790
The problem is from Lizhen

763
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,790
and we should direct

764
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,670
public opinions to its care.

765
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,190
Bail the journalist out first.

766
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,270
We'll have to prolong the crisis

767
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,030
and it'll affect the date of discharge.

768
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,070
Mr. Xiao.

769
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,030
Mr. Wang is here.

770
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,310
Mr. Xiao.

771
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,870
Let's speak outside.

772
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,790
You want to violate the contract?

773
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,950
That's not what I meant.

774
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,910
Let's not sign

775
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,790
the contract first.

776
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,470
Handle this matter first.

777
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,430
Or they will point

778
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,710
their fingers at me soon.

779
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,790
If that happens, my business

780
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,830
in Wusu will be affected.

781
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,990
Another thing is,

782
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,150
the day after tomorrow is the day
to discharge them.

783
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,350
It's not appropriate to

784
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,150
drive them away now.

785
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,070
How about this?

786
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,350
However many days it will take

787
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,470
to clam the public opinions

788
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,670
will be the period of days

789
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,790
we postpone this.

790
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,350
Mr. Wang,

791
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,070
has anyone contacted you?

792
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,710
Has anyone contacted me?

793
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,430
Mr. Xiao,

794
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,230
I've handed over

795
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,230
Qingshan to you.

796
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,110
Your people are

797
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,350
all working in there.

798
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,430
No one contacted me.

799
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,790
I'll deal with the public opinions.

800
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,590
But think clearly.

801
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,870
Can you afford the liquidated damages?

802
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,870
Let's go.

803
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,710
He's over there.

804
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,430
You're overthinking, Mr. Xiao.

805
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:04,750
Let's go.

806
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,600
Over there.

807
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,560
- He's over there.
- Let's go.

808
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:07,960
He's over there.

809
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,880
- Hurry, it's him.
- Hurry.

810
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,040
Hurry.

811
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
I'm not moving out.

812
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't want your bonus.

813
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,880
We don't want it.

814
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,440
We don't want your money.

815
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,320
Take it back.

816
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,320
Keep it properly.

817
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,600
We've given back everything to you.

818
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,400
In order to make money for you,

819
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,080
Mr. Sun almost lost his life.

820
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,560
The contract has been signed.

821
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,000
It's an invalid contract.

822
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,680
We learned what your intentions are

823
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
from the news.

824
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,400
Also, that journalist who
goes by the surname He.

825
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
Under the impression
of being nice to us,

826
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,680
we don't know where

827
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
we'll be sent to.

828
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,600
Don't even think about it.

829
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,440
We're not going.

830
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,240
We're not moving out.

831
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,280
We're not moving out.

832
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,680
Look.

833
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,080
We're not moving out.

834
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,560
Forget about it.

835
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880
We're not going anywhere.

836
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,830
(Business and media collusion,
journalist taking rebate.)

837
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,230
(Local Qingshan Nursing Home was
transferred and the elderly discharged.)

838
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,120
(Wicked journalist He Xiaoran
colluding with businessman.)

839
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,560
Come in.

840
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,680
Newsmaker of the Year.

841
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,320
Why are you alone in the room?

842
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,800
Come on, let's go for barbeque.

843
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,480
Let's go.

844
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,240
I'm not hungry. You both can go ahead.

845
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,360
Xiaoran,

846
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,240
no matter what others say,

847
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,400
you're always the best journalist

848
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,480
in my heart.

849
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,730
Just let them investigate.

850
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,970
Once the results are out,

851
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,410
those who have wronged you

852
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,690
would be frustrated.

853
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,050
They'll hate themselves

854
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,090
for not knowing what's right or wrong.

855
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,450
But the elderly people
are really terrible.

856
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,210
It's better not to care about them.

857
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,570
That's right.

858
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,250
If you have anything to rant,

859
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,570
just rant to the both of us.

860
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,250
You'll feel better
once you vent it on us.

861
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,090
I think

862
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,330
I've overestimated myself.

863
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,970
Initially, it'd be fine
if I just reported the news.

864
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,570
But I couldn't mind my own business.

865
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,810
I was too nosy.

866
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,450
This doesn't sound like what you'll say.

867
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,730
I agree.

868
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,490
Anyway, instead of waiting
at home for the results,

869
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,810
why don't we go out to
have fun for the next two days?

870
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,210
All right.

871
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,650
Then we'll leave you alone.

872
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,850
After doing so much for them,

873
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,690
she is questioned by others about

874
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:46,930
her professional ethics in the end.

875
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,250
Anyone would be frustrated.

876
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,290
We should help her.

877
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,860
(Mr. Xiao,)

878
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,140
(aren't we clarifying the content)

879
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,180
(to protect ourselves?)

880
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,180
(The home shall be discharged
and transformed on 10th of November)

881
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,500
(The discharge is a normal process.)

882
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,860
(We offer them money
for humanitarian reasons.)

883
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,620
(The problem is from Lizhen)

884
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,540
(and we should direct public opinions)

885
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,460
(to its care.)

886
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,060
(Bail the journalist out first.)

887
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,180
(We'll have to prolong the crisis)

888
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:24,013
(and it'll affect
the date of discharge.)

889
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,860
(Father,)

890
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,620
(am I doing the right thing?)

891
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,660
Hello.

892
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,340
Hello.

893
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,100
I'm calling from building A1.

894
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,900
Why is the power out?

895
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,780
Power is out?

896
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,380
I didn't receive
any power outage notice.

897
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,020
Have you run out of electricity at home?

898
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,980
Do you have the electricity card?

899
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,180
You can pay directly by

900
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,260
entering your card number
on your mobile phone.

901
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Electricity card?
What if I don't have one?

902
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Then you can only consult

903
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,580
the power supply bureau.

904
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,500
All right, then. Thank you.

905
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,340
You're welcome.

906
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,940
(Are you going to bed?)

907
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,380
(Where's the electricity card?)

908
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,270
He's been discharged?

909
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,670
Did you know where he went?

910
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,710
Hello, Sui.

911
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,230
What's up?

912
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,070
Xiaoran, where are you?

913
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,070
I'll go look for you.

914
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,110
I'm discussing some matters with her.

915
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,470
Call her later.

916
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,030
Hello?

917
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,790
Hello?

918
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,150
You've been suspended.

919
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,070
Give me back my mobile phone.

920
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,670
Miss He,

921
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,030
we're on the same boat now.

922
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,390
You want to know the truth.

923
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,510
I want to know the truth, too.

924
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,590
If it's not clarified
as soon as possible,

925
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,390
Qingshan's acquisition plan

926
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,630
will also be affected.

927
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,870
Do you have any other ideas?

928
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,510
Have you eaten?

929
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,600
I'm hungry.

930
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,120
Let's talk while eating.

931
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,680
You've caused her to be suspended.

932
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,280
Why aren't you leaving her alone?

933
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
(Sorry.)

934
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,200
(The number you have dialled)

935
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,760
(is temporarily unavailable.)

936
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,400
(Please dial again later.)

937
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,880
I've transferred you the money
for my meal.

938
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,480
That won't be necessary.

939
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,480
Mr. Sun's nephew was bribed.

940
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,800
I also suspected that
in the beginning that

941
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,280
you bribed Mr. Pan.

942
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,040
You took care of
the most stubborn elderly.

943
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,320
The others would slack off.

944
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,480
I thought of doing that.

945
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,720
But it wasn't me.

946
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,560
Someone used Mr. Sun's hospitalisation

947
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,600
as a bargaining chip.

948
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,560
Who?

949
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,120
Zhao Mingxuan?

950
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,010
Two sides are competing for benefits.

951
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,050
It made the elderly, media and

952
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,850
the entire society restless.

953
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:31,930
But according to your

954
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,410
current style of doing things,

955
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,170
just putting all the blame on me

956
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,090
and Lizhen, and then

957
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,290
pointing the finger towards me
for taking the rebate

958
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,170
will solve the issue.

959
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,250
But you didn't get a rebate.

960
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,330
How would you know?

961
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,610
I know

962
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,570
you well.

963
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,050
It's been three months.

964
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,170
A lot has changed.

965
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,210
But there are things that won't change.

966
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,530
Let us go on our own ways.

967
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,370
I'll go to Mr. Pan's

968
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,450
workplace to take a look later.

969
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,330
I've been there.

970
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,690
He has resigned.

971
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,570
Not only that,

972
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,650
the emergency contact person

973
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,970
left by Mr. Sun in Qingshan's system

974
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,170
is his old comrade-in-arms.

975
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,930
That person passed away last year.

976
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:18,770
Miss He,

977
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,970
I know that you have

978
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,890
plenty of views about me.

979
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,730
But this time,

980
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,210
just treat this as business

981
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,610
and let's clarify the facts together.

982
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,610
If you want to find some clues,

983
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,330
you'll have to start from Qingshan.

984
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:32,850
What do you think?

985
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,620
That day,

986
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,140
it was you?

987
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,420
It can't be fixed,

988
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,700
but I met a good person

989
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,540
who so happens to be
going back to the city

990
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,780
and is willing to tow us along.

991
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,220
It's just a little effort.

992
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,740
Hello, Sui.

993
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,420
Where are you?

994
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm fine.

995
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,940
What happened?

996
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,100
Is there something important?

997
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,100
You called me so many times.

998
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
Your phone was taken away earlier.

999
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,700
I was worried.

1000
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,220
I'm fine.

1001
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,140
I'm going to investigate something now.

1002
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,460
I'll contact you again later.

1003
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,500
Xiaoran.

1004
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,220
Xiao…

1005
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,270
Brothers, I need your help.

1006
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,670
Look for those

1007
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,230
whom Miss He has helped

1008
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,630
and interviewed previously.

1009
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,550
Ask them to record a short video.

1010
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,070
All the meal time and
the medicine intake records

1011
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,270
(Record of Nursing)

1012
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,790
(Record of Nursing)
are here.

1013
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,070
The internal department

1014
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,470
has reviewed it several times.

1015
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,710
There isn't any problem.

1016
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,470
I'll let the public relation department
post it out.

1017
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,790
This is really terrible.

1018
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,230
And the payment transfer?

1019
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,230
It's all made up.

1020
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,990
With the current situation,

1021
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,790
(Meal record)
we're really pacified.

1022
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,190
Lizhen won't take in
any of them anymore.

1023
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,270
Also, Mr. Xiao,

1024
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,990
let's terminate

1025
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,430
our contract.

1026
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,750
What contract?

1027
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,470
You two are not from the same group?

1028
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,190
The few hundred-yuan difference

1029
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,750
of our place compared to Qingshan

1030
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,990
was paid off by Mr. Xiao.

1031
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,110
Okay, I have another meeting.

1032
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,790
I just wanted to spend some money
to clear the home early.

1033
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,030
I understand.

1034
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,590
Lizhen's nurse didn't make a mistake.

1035
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,950
At least it means the place that
they settle down is

1036
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,710
fine.

1037
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,110
Mr. Sun's myocardial infarction
was an accident.

1038
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,350
Now, we need to find Mr. Pan

1039
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,630
and find out

1040
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,030
who instructed him to do so.
