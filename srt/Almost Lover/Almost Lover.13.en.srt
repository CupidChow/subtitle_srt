Don't worry about me.

19

You don't have to pay

20
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:47,927
my medical fee.

21
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,367
No matter what medicine we're using

22
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:52,407
and how long the treatment is,

23
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:56,247
my face is disfigured.

24
00:01:58,927 --> 00:01:59,487
Don't worry.

25
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,247
Take it slow.

26
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,647
It's going to recover.

27
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,287
How slow do I need to take?

28
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,487
Until when I'm old and frail?

29
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:14,927
Fei'er,

30
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:17,407
you're beautiful enough.

31
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,447
Does the little wound

32
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:19,607
mean so much to you?

33
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,007
You're not me.

34
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:26,727
You don't understand

35
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,567
what it means

36
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:32,047
for this to happen

37
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:33,207
in my family.

38
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,927
I took a vow at 13 years old.

39
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,167
I must leave that family.

40
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,207
I took every step carefully

41
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:49,287
and seriously.

42
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,207
I was worried something goes wrong.

43
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:57,967
But,

44
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,207
I can't never leave that family anymore.

45
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:13,847
Luckily, we've done

46
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,087
the Visa beforehand.

47
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,487
I'll buy the tickets now.

48
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:19,647
We'll leave tonight.

49
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:21,767
I'll find

50
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:23,287
the best plastic surgeon to treat you.

51
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:25,807
Tonight?

52
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:27,567
Fei'er.

53
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:29,727
Don't worry.

54
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,847
Even if your wound can't be treated,

55
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,847
I'll marry you.

56
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:04,087
Xiaoran,

57
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,047
I have something on later.

58
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,087
Go back first.

59
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,207
I need to get changed.

60
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,367
The driver is waiting for me.

61
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:11,767
Xiaoran.

62
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:12,647
We should be able to

63
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:14,207
meet more often.

64
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:15,207
See you next time.

65
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:38,087
Xiaoran.

66
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:40,127
Xiaoran.

67
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,007
Xiaoran.

68
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,247
Can you calm down

69
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,167
and listen to me?

70
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,727
You found out about it?

71
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:56,727
About what?

72
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:57,687
For so many years,

73
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:58,607
I didn't know anything

74
00:04:58,767 --> 00:04:59,527
like a fool.

75
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,047
Actually, things happened

76
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:02,327
too suddenly.

77
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:03,647
We were panicked.

78
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:05,767
After we settled down

79
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:06,847
overseas,

80
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:08,887
I couldn't reach you anymore.

81
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,247
You can at least tell me

82
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,047
in Wusu.

83
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,207
Xiaoran,

84
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,567
this is not a pleasant incident.

85
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,247
She doesn't want others to know.

86
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:20,407
As her friend,

87
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,687
I should keep it a secret.

88
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,007
But I guarantee you,

89
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,247
besides visiting the doctors overseas,

90
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:24,967
I didn't do anything else

91
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:25,647
with her.

92
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,007
What about the wedding?

93
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:31,847
That's what I wanted to

94
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:32,727
tell you yesterday.

95
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:34,807
I was worried that you might overthink,

96
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,927
so I want to tell you face-to-face.

97
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:38,727
But I didn't expect

98
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,207
you just

99
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:41,327
appeared in front of us.

100
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:44,807
So, it's my fault?

101
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:45,807
No.

102
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:47,327
It's all my fault.

103
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:48,727
Xiaoran,

104
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,047
you wanted to surprise me,

105
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,087
but I've frightened you.

106
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:55,847
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,167
I don't understand.

108
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:58,567
Why do you need to

109
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,007
organize her wedding?

110
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:02,087
Not her,

111
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:05,807
but Zhao Mingxuan.

112
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,007
He has been giving a hard time
to my family.

113
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,287
When I came back, I realized

114
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:14,087
the situation here

115
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:15,327
is much more complicated.

116
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,127
This wedding

117
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:19,247
is an embarrassment given to me

118
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,287
by Zhao Mingxuan,

119
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:22,647
but I'm ready to accept it

120
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:23,927
and fight with him.

121
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:25,647
I don't understand.

122
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,367
Xiaoran.

123
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:31,087
I admit that

124
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:31,687
many things here

125
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,087
are beyond my control,

126
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,087
but I promise

127
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,807
it has nothing to do with
whether Chen Fei'er

128
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:38,687
is the bride or not.

129
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,647
You've been alone in Hupu
these few days.

130
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:50,727
Are you tired?

131
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:02,447
You're willing to believe me now?

132
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:04,847
Do you know what I was

133
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:05,607
so angry about?

134
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,367
You were hiding things from me.

135
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,487
You'll have a probation period.

136
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:18,727
Okay.

137
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:20,927
I'm okay with that.

138
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:26,687
Xiaoran.

139
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,127
You might not believe

140
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,087
what I'm about to say,

141
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:32,607
but being overseas for so many years,

142
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:35,447
the person that I always thought of,

143
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:36,367
is you

144
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:37,567
because we've shared

145
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,607
each other's growth.

146
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:44,767
Maybe I was too used to it.

147
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:46,487
I've neglected the warmth

148
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:47,887
and goodness you've brought me.

149
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:50,927
But now, as I think back,

150
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:53,807
you've long become a part of my life

151
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,287
that I can't live without.

152
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:12,767
Let's go.

153
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:21,047
Let's go.

154
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:24,167
Don't be angry anymore.

155
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:28,527
Let's go.

156
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,567
So, you will stay in Hupu

157
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:39,247
for a month?

158
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:42,726
Great.

159
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,007
Once their wedding is done,

160
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:46,687
we can go back to Wusu together.

161
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:53,407
It has been a while
since I last came here.

162
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:55,727
I'll see you in.

163
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:56,447
No need.

164
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:57,487
Leave first.

165
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:58,527
Don't let my parents see you.

166
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:01,127
Is Journalist He

167
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,447
afraid of something?

168
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:06,887
Do your parents still love gardening?

169
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:08,887
When I came back,

170
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,087
I saw there are

171
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,207
tomatoes and strawberries

172
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,607
on their balcony.

173
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,207
I'll let you try when there's fruit.

174
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:16,047
How long will it take?

175
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:17,447
I don't know.

176
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,407
Few days? 10 days? Few weeks?

177
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:21,327
You want to eat it so much?

178
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:23,407
No.

179
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,327
I'm thinking

180
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:28,807
if we should

181
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,007
think about

182
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,487
telling others about our relationship.

183
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:38,847
What are you doing?

184
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:40,927
Come on.

185
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:46,367
Xiao Shangqi?

186
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:47,607
Mrs. He.

187
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:49,847
Why are you here at this hour?

188
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,847
Are you looking for Xiaoran again?

189
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:52,927
No.

190
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,567
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

191
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,567
Xiaoran doesn't want to see you.

192
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:57,807
Although I don't know

193
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,527
what happened to you two,

194
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,247
many years

195
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,527
have passed,

196
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:03,167
just let her live her life well.

197
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,807
Don't come and
bother her anymore, okay?

198
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:10,847
Mother.

199
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:14,967
You...

200
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:20,087
Who is it?

201
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:26,087
Mr. He.

202
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:38,727
After listening to you,

203
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:39,847
why do I think that Chen Fei'er

204
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,087
is up to no good?

205
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:42,727
She's about to get married.

206
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:44,127
Why did she mention the past to you?

207
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:45,887
Isn't she trying to mock you?

208
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:48,527
I don't know.

209
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,247
I'm not sure.

210
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,767
Do you think Xiao Shangqi

211
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:53,967
can let it go?

212
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,527
Or

213
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:57,447
he's only letting go

214
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,967
after Chen Fei'er got together

215
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:00,647
with Zhao Mingxuan.

216
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:01,647
And he'll choose the second best

217
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:02,767
and get together with me.

218
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:03,727
You're thinking

219
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,167
way too much.

220
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,447
No matter how long it has been,

221
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:07,967
it's passed.

222
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,367
It'd be great if Xiao Shangqi

223
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:12,047
is as decisive as you.

224
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,687
Why are you talking about me?

225
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,207
(Hao)
(Urgent. Come to the bar.)

226
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:18,887
(Hao)
That's it.

227
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:19,567
I have something on.

228
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:20,727
I'll call you later.

229
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:21,567
Bye.

230
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:36,847
Hao,

231
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:38,727
what's so urgent?

232
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:41,127
Hui, don't blame me.

233
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,687
Someone needs my favor.

234
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:43,887
He has begged me for days.

235
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,087
I can't help it.

236
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:48,087
Hui.

237
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:51,487
I just want to talk to you.

238
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:52,247
Let go.

239
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:58,687
Li Hui.

240
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,727
I'm leaving soon.

241
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,447
When you threw away the guitar,

242
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:07,767
I had this feeling.

243
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,407
I just want to tell you that

244
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:12,967
you're the Muses in my heart.

245
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,647
Even we broke up.

246
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,367
Today, I want to sing a song

247
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,727
belonging to us

248
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,767
to remember our relationship.

Why are you here?

254
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,447
He Xiaoran called me.

255
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,687
She's worried about you.

256
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:50,567
He's indeed here.

257
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:51,647
What's he trying to do?

258

♪The beginning of parting is running

259

I have to admit that

260
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:01,287
he's quite confident.

261
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,567
Are you thinking of forgiving him?

262
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,167
No way.

263
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,727

Good morning.

267
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:32,927
You're up.

268
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:34,487
Come and eat breakfast.

269
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:40,687
Father, what flower are you planting?

270
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,487
I'll stop planting.

271
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,807
I'll dig them all out one day.

272
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,167
I don't want my effort

stolen by others.

275
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:56,527
What's wrong with my father?

276
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:00,167
Tell me what's happened to you.

277
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,047
What's going on with you and Qi?

278
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,807
There's nothing going on with us.

279
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:05,687
We just

280
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,807
met in Wusu.

281
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,567
He's your new housemate?

282
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,007
You two are living together?

283
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,047
He's been angry for a night.

284
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,647
You all should

285
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:38,007
have some conscience.

286
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,367
Listen up.

287
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:41,087
No matter who is going

288
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:41,887
to pick you,

289
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:42,727
you must remember

290
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,527
it's Mr. He and Mrs. He

291
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:45,407
who brought you up.

292
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,607
They kept you well and beautiful,

293
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:48,087
understand?

294
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:51,367
Father,

295
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:53,087
my boyfriend

296
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,727
is handsome and smart.

297
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:56,687
He's perfect.

298
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:58,727
Why are you so angry?

299
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,567
Didn't you say that

300
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:05,807
he's like your own son?

301
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:06,927
How can it be the same?

302
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,007
Of course it can.

303
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,047
Tonight,

304
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,607
Xiao Shangqi will have a meal here.

305
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:12,287
You

306
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:13,967
can just treat him like how

307
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:14,647
it was.

308
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:15,487
No.

309
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:16,767
You need to treat him better.

310

The savory crepe selling in front of the school.

312
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:39,887
I passed by there

313
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:40,887
so I bought you one.

314
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,647
It was your favorite.

315
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:53,967
You haven't eaten it in years, right?

316
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:55,567
Thank you.

317
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:05,807
Fei'er,

318
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:08,287
I really didn't know

319
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,607
what happened to you.

320
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,207
I asked Shangqi not to tell you.

321
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:16,847
Well,

322
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:18,927
if you two really took me

323
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,767
as your best friend,

324
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,367
you wouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

325
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,327
We were friends,

326
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,807
but you didn't tell me

327
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,247
about your important confession.

328
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:35,247
Xiaoran,

329
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:37,407
since you're back,

330
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:38,167
can you at least

331
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:39,807
walk with me

332
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,167
on this road that's close to happiness?

333
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:51,487
Be my bridesmaid,

334
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:52,247
okay?

335
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,247
I have everything now.

336
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:02,487
But, I'd always think about

337
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:03,327
the time the three of us

338
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,847
were together.

339
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,167
We were happier

340
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,407
and purer.

341
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,087
No matter what,

342
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:12,927
you and Shangqi

343
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,766
were my best friends.

344
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,127
You saw it yesterday.

345
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,766
For me who is flawed

346
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,407
to be at where I am today,

347
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:23,687
I had to use

348
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,286
some fake packaging.

349
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,687
But, I hope

350
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:29,127
there's something real

351
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,007
on my wedding.

352
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:44,887
You're still the same.

353
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,287
Your shoe laces are always untied.

354
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:47,727
I've taught you how to

355
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:49,607
tie it double back.

356
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,207
I'll do it myself.

357
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:54,967
During our high school sports day,

358
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,167
I'd tie all your shoe laces.

359
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,367
You said all these

360
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,407
hoping that

361
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:03,487
I'll be your bridesmaid?

362
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:05,327
Sure.

363
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:26,487
For now,

364
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:27,647
we're collecting

365
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:28,567
the guests' preferences

366
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:29,847
and dietary taboos.

367
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:30,767
This Friday,

368
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,407
the food and beverage department
will come out with

369
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,167
the whole new wedding banquet menu.

370
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:35,687
As for parking,

371
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,287
to avoid the traffic

372
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,367
at the entrance and exit,

373
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,047
the guests will come in
at different times.

374
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:42,607
The actual procedure

375
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:43,807
will be improvised step by step,

376
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:44,487
Mr. Zhao.

377
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,407
How many VIP guests

378
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,167
are there?

379
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:50,607
180.

380
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:52,887
They're more important.

381
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:54,527
Make no mistake

382
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:56,567
when we send them the invitation letter.

383
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,207
I'll give out

384
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,167
the invitation letter by myself.

385
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:02,207
By yourself?

386
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,087
Can you make it in time?

387
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,767
They're all VIP guests.

388
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:06,807
It's not easy to meet them.

389
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:08,367
It's okay.

390
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,127
Qi is good at

391
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:11,687
doing this.

392
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:12,767
Yes.

393
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,247
I've selected a few candidates for

394
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,207
Yunduan's operational manager.

395
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:16,087
Please take a look.

396
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:17,607
A few again?

397
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:19,487
Are you filtering them

398
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:20,607
or do I need to filter them?

399
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:24,127
Okay, I'll simplify it.

400
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:31,167
Okay, everyone.

401
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:32,367
Dismiss.

402
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:43,767
Qi,

403
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,167
stay here.

404
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,087
Fei'er told me that

405
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,087
the bridesmaid is your girlfriend.

406
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:54,807
You and your girlfriend

407
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
will have to work hard

408
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,527
for our wedding.

409
00:19:58,487 --> 00:19:58,807
Thank you.

410
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,447
You've found out?

411
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:25,727
What's going on?

412
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,527
It's not a big deal.

413
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,407
She just wants me

414
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,727
to be her bridesmaid.

415
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:32,727
I said yes to it.

416
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:33,847
Don't force yourself.

417
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:35,047
I'll reject it for you.

418
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:37,647
Why should I force myself?

419
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:38,927
You're not the bridegroom.

420
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:43,407
It's okay.

421
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,487
We were friends for years.

422
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:48,207
I give her my blessing for her wedding.

423
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:50,407
But,

424
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:52,087
I'm on the training as well.

425
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,167
I guess I'll be very busy.

426
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:58,567
If you face

427
00:20:58,647 --> 00:20:59,607
any difficulties,

428
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:01,367
you must tell me.

429
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:03,967
I do have one thing

430
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,887
troubling me now.

431
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:06,127
What's it?

432
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:07,487
Later, let's go to

433
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:08,247
a convenient store

434
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:09,087
to get something.

435
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:10,727
Get something?

436
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:13,927
A placebo.

437
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:15,847
Let's go.

438
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:19,647
What placebo?

439
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,607
Father, mother, I'm back.

440
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,007
Mr. He, Mrs. He, greetings.

441
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:24,967
Qi.

442
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:26,167
Do I need to take off my shoes?

443
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:27,007
No need.

444
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:29,487
You're here. Let's eat.

445
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:30,807
Mr. He,

446
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,367
I've bought some red wine for you.

447
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,127
It must be Xiaoran's idea.

448
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,087
Do you like it or not?

449
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,447
The conclusion will be the same.

450
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,087
My daughter likes it.

451
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,447
How can I not like it?

452
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:47,647
Take a seat.

453
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:48,447
Okay, sit down.

454
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:53,727
When you have a daughter,

455
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,247
you need to go through this, too.

456
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:56,567
How's it?

457
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,247
It's been a while since you ate at home?

458
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:00,447
Yes.

459
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:04,567
You had an argument

460
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:05,607
on the graduation day.

461
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:06,727
Have you talked it out?

462
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:07,607
Father.

463
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:09,887
You insisted on going to Wusu.

464
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:11,607
Weren't you hurt by him?

465
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,047
That's a misunderstanding.

466
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,207
It's all my fault.

467
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,287
Mr. He, Mrs. He, don't worry.

468
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:18,167
I promise it will not happen anymore.

469
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:29,687
Can you drink?

470
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:30,887
Yes.

471
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:38,727
Father.

472
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:39,767
You know what?

473
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:42,047
Your sweet and sour pork ribs

474
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:43,567
are listed in

475
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,007
Shangqi's hotel's menu.

476
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:46,807
I can eat it in Wusu
whenever I want.

477
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:50,047
Can my cooking skill

478
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,047
be copied so easily?

479
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:54,127
No way.

480
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:56,567
But, sweet and sour pork ribs

481
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:58,007
are a popular dish

482
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,487
in Jifeng Hotel.

483
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,087
I'd like to invite you

484
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,767
to guide our chefs.

485
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,887
Listen.

486
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,327
To successfully make

487
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,967
sweet and sour pork ribs,

488
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,127
the key is the gravy.

489
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:14,567
You need to...

490
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,207
Enough.

491
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,207
Let's eat first.

492
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:19,447
When there's a chance,

493
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,447
we'll go to Qi's

494
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,407
Jifeng Hotel

495
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:22,967
and try it out.

496
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:23,647
Right?

497
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:24,127
Okay.

498
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:25,527
That works.

499
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:26,287
Let's eat.

500
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:26,927
Okay.

501
00:23:37,887 --> 00:23:38,567
Eat the dishes.

502
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:43,247
Nothing much has changed.

503
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,207
This book is still here.

504
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,007
We used to read this book

505
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:55,967
at school during breaks.

506
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,487
Didn't you say

507
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,287
it's hard to buy this book?

508
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,367
I even lent it to you before.

509
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,287
This is weird.

510
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,247
Why is there an autograph

511
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,087
in this book as well?

512
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:22,447
Didn't you give it back to me?

513
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:26,647
This is yours.

514
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,287
I was in love with you.

515
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:33,687
I saw how you like this book so much

516
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:34,967
so I read it for a week.

517
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:36,527
I think it's meaningful

518
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,127
so I asked for it from you

519
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:39,007
and kept it.

520
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:40,327
And I bought a new one and
returned that to you.

521
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,247
But, the book you returned

522
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,287
has an autograph on it, too.

523
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:45,367

We measured here when we were young.

529
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:57,287
Measure it now.

530
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:58,647
Let's see if there's any changes.

531
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:05,087
You're shorter than three years back.

532
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:07,167
I'm not standing straight.

533
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:11,287
I lied.

534
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:12,287
It's the same.

535
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,407
Come here. Let me measure it for you.

536
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:16,007
Okay.

537
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:19,567
Let me see if you've grown taller.

538
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:25,927
I'll measure like this from now on.

539
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:28,247
You're one finger shorter than my chin.

540
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,007
How could it be?

541
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:31,647
I'm taller than your shoulders.

542
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,127
Can you follow me back today?

543
00:25:44,247 --> 00:25:44,647
No.

544
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,607
Where are you going?

545
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:52,567
You must come back before 11 p.m.

546
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:54,687
That's the time you should be home.

Xiaoran,

597
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:53,287
I need to control my weight.

598
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,527
Can you try it for me?

599

Red bean.

602

It's sweet and sour.

603
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,847
There's small particulate inside.

604
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,007
It should be chestnut.

605
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:17,807
It's a little sweet.

606
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,007
What fruit is this?

607
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:23,367

sweet.

609
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:31,167

00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,167
can you be serious?

613
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:38,567
feeling now is

614
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:39,287
I'm sick of this.

If you want me to

616
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:41,967
eat all these,

617
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:42,647
maybe

618
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:44,367
I'll have no taste anymore

619
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:45,567
and I can't describe anything anymore.

the names of cakes?

627
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:10,167
How would I know

628
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:11,407
which one I've eaten?

629
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,047
I'll just count for you.

630
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:15,447
I ate four just now.

Xiaoran,

632
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,407
which dress do you think is the nicest?

633
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:39,967
It's all not bad.

634
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,287
Which dress do you like?

(matches my suit.)

640
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:00,967
I'll choose the previous dress.

641
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,567
I'd also like to look at the gifts.

642
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:03,167
Okay.

643
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:04,287
Please hold on.

644
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:05,367
We'll prepare

645
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:06,447
the gift catalogue and samples.

646
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:07,327
Thank you.

647
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:13,967
Why did you choose the third dress?

648
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:15,567
Don't you prefer this?

649
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,327
Maybe you don't know about the brands.

650
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,367
The third dress

651
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,367
is a well-known designer's dress.

652
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:24,927
Of course it's better.

653
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:27,167
I don't get it.

654
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:29,447
Well,

655
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:30,767
you have yet to tell me.

656
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:32,167
How did you get

657
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,607
together with Xiao Shangqi?

658

You guess.

660
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,087
The men's cufflink as gift

661
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:56,767
is not enough.

662
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:57,887
Don't forget about that.

663
00:30:58,567 --> 00:30:59,887
Tomorrow,

664
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:00,967
you should come by yourself.

665
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,007
There's more for tomorrow?

666
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,687
We still need to try another dessert.

What? Are you tired?

670
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:17,887
The preparation for wedding

671
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:19,687
can't be done in one day.

672

673
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,607
why not you look for others?

I'm here in Shanghai for training.

675
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:26,007
I'm too busy for this.

676
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,767
I don't have others.

677
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:35,927
I only have you.

678
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:39,527
Stop it.

679
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:40,407
I don't buy it.

As my bridesmaid,

683
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,327
the more you do,

684
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:47,887
the more burdens you can
take off from him.

685
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:55,567
Luckily, you only get married once.

686
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:57,567
What do I need to do next?

687
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:02,007
I haven't taken everything.

688
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:02,807
The staff is getting it.

689
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:03,807
Just wait here.

690
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:05,087
Where are you going?

691
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:06,087
I'll get the driver to send you.

692
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:06,687
It's okay.

693
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:07,807
Xiaoran.

694
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:09,807
Why are you here?

695
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:11,327
I'm here to pick you up.

696
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:13,847
Shangqi,

697
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:15,847
I heard that you're very busy

698
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:16,807
with my wedding.

699
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:17,807
Thank you.

700
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:18,847
No problem.

701
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:19,847
I'm taking it as a preview.

702
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:22,367
Are you tired today?

703
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:23,687
I'm okay.

704
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:26,287
Come and change your shoes.

705
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:28,687
How did you know

706
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:29,647
I'm wearing high heels?

707
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:31,447
Didn't you post it on Moment?

708
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:32,687
I saw the photos.

709
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,287
What time is it tomorrow?

710
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:40,167
Any time after 3 p.m.

711
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:41,287
Got it.

712
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:42,647
Let's go.

713
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:52,527
Come in.

714
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:54,367
Not for today.

715
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:55,567
I still have something on.

716
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:58,887
Fei'er said you're busy lately.

717
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:00,087
Yes.

718
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:02,207
I'll need to personally

719
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:03,767
send 180 invitation letters.

720
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,127
I'm short of time.

721
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,207
180 invitation letters?

722
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:08,767
How can they do this

723
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:09,767
to order you around?

724
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,567
I asked for it.

725
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:13,967
Actually, this is a good chance

726
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:14,807
for me to

727
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:15,647
meet Deju's core partners.

728
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,447
If 10% of them

729
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:18,007
have the desire

730
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:19,247
to collaborate with Yunlan,

731
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:20,047
our sales will be

732
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:20,927
doubled.

733
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,047
By then,

734
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,007
we can move the work to Wusu.

735
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:26,687
You're indeed my boyfriend.

736
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:28,727
Well,

737
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:30,007
don't come and pick me up anymore.

738
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:31,527
I can handle Fei'er's matter.

739
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,247
I'm afraid I'll be busier.

740
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:37,367
So, I want to meet you

741
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:38,527
more often

742
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:39,727
while I can.

743
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:43,207
I'll cheer for you.

744
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:43,847
I'm leaving.

745
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:21,127
I'm going in.

746
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,007
The crisis you faced

747
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,167
in your company was settled, right?

748
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,527
My idea was not bad, was it?

749
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:36,207
Mr. Lan.

750
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:36,846
Mr. Xia.

751
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:38,087
Mr. Xiao.

752
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:40,366
Nice to meet you.

753
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:43,207
Look at you.

754
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:45,087
You have to pass us
the invitation letters in person.

755
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:46,567
I was saying the same.

756
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:48,207
But since Mr. Lan is here, too,

757
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,326
I rushed here at once.

758
00:34:50,846 --> 00:34:51,167
Here.

759
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:54,406
Mr. Xiao,

760
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:55,207
you and your brother

761
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:56,127
are so loyal

762
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,447
to Deju.

763
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:59,847
We're determined to serve

764
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,527
all our clients well.

765
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:03,407
Yunlan has started to serve clients

766
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:05,287
besides Deju?

767
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:06,247
Yes.

768
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:07,807
In the industry,

769
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:08,967
everyone thought

770
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,087
we're tied together,

771
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:11,847
but actually, Yunlan

772
00:35:12,047 --> 00:35:12,607
has other businesses

773
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:13,807
besides Deju.

774
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:15,807
I'm not sure if you know

775
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,727
about Jifeng Hotel in Wusu.

776
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:19,687
Jifeng Hotel?

777
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,007
I know.

778
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:21,687
I heard that

779
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,327
they've started earning money

780
00:35:23,607 --> 00:35:24,847
within three months.

781
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:27,207
Actually, Mr. Lan,

782
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:29,527
this may sound offensive,

783
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:30,767
I don't know if you want to hear or not.

784
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:32,207
Go ahead.

785
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:33,887
From what I know,

786
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:34,647
your company's

787
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:36,087
operating fund in East China

788
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:37,967
is 30% higher than average,

789
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,927
but your sales performance

790
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,527
didn't show any drastic increase.

791
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:43,127
I don't know

792
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:43,887
if you've found an operator

793
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:45,327
for your

794
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,447
four-star brand chain store?

795
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,447
Interesting.

796
00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:54,207
What do you have in mind?

797
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:55,127
Tell me.

798
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,047
Okay.

799
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,400
(Xiao Shangqi)

800
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:12,767
These are the new

801
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:13,647
gift samples.

802
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:14,407
Thank you.

803
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
(Xiao Shangqi)

804
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:24,727
Mr. Zhang.

805
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,447
This is Mr. Zhao's wedding invitation.

806
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:28,367
I'm Xiao Shangqi.

807
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,047
You can call me Xiao.

808
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,450
(Xiao Shangqi)

809
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,500
(Xiao Shangqi)

810
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:44,847
Don't frighten me.

811
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,647
It's not fun by just listening.

812
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:52,607
You need to play it live.

813
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:54,687
You need to air it on radio, too.

814
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:55,367
I'm telling you.

815
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:56,127
Come on.

816
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:57,127
Mr. He has got a chance for you

817
00:37:57,247 --> 00:37:58,647
to perform on the music festival.

818
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,167
I said

819
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:02,807
Mr. He has got a chance for you

820
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:04,407
to perform on the music festival.

821
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:06,487
I'm not going.

822
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,127
Why did you start
to listen to crosstalk?

823
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:34,687
Come here.

824
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:36,687
Play a song for me.

825
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:37,247
Get lost.

826
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,007
Am I a free record player?

827
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:40,487
Go out if you want to listen to songs.

828
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:42,047
I want to hear you play.

829
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:43,367
Are you crazy?

830
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:44,047
Hurry up.

831
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:49,647
Stop playing around.

832
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:06,887
It's out of tune.

833
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:07,847
It's okay.

834
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:08,687
It's not out of tune.

835
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:36,447
Maybe next time.

836
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:47,287
What do you mean?

837
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:47,887
Did you do it on purpose?

838
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:48,847
Enough!

839
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:52,967
I can't play anymore.

840
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:54,527
Isn't this what you want to hear?

841
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:00,607
What do you mean?

842
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,847
My rock and roll dream
was given to me by Tang Yan.

843
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:06,927
This guitar was bought by him.

844
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:08,807
He taught me how to play it, too.

845
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,207
He's now gone.

846
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,247
My belief is gone, too.

847
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,487
You don't have to do this
for a terrible guy.

848
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:21,367
I think so, too.

849
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,367
But now,

850
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,607
I feel sad looking at the guitar.

851
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,247
It hurts me when I touch the strings.

852
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,127
It's physiological response, you know?

853
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:35,127
I hope you understand.

854
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:36,687
Thank you.

855
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,527
After all, you're done.

856
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:44,967
Lovelorn sequel

857
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:45,887
doesn't suit you.

858
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:47,167
Hui.

859
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:55,007
(Hupu Radio & TV Group)
I was checking on

860
00:40:55,127 --> 00:40:56,247
(Hupu Radio & TV Group)
the town's income growth.

861
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,447
I just got the information.

862
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:58,607
This is Team B's topic.

863
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:00,207
We might need to change the topic.

864
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:06,847
Why did you finish it so fast?

865
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:09,087
You're not feeling well?

866
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:10,847
You don't know

867
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:12,407
how tiring

868
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:13,087
the wedding preparation is.

869
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:16,247
Normally, it's tiring for the bride.

870
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,527
How come the bridesmaid is tired?

871
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:27,367
Hello?

872
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,167
Do you want to have dinner
with me tonight?

873
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:30,727
I can't.

874
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,527
My meeting will end very late.

875
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:33,887
After that, I need to go

876
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:34,807
to the bridal shop with Fei'er.

877
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:35,767
The weather forecast says

878
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:36,927
it's going to rain tonight.

879
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:38,327
It's not easy to get a taxi.

880
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:40,207
I'm still working.

881
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:41,927
I'll send a car to pick you up.

882
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:43,807
Okay.

883
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,407
I found one.

884
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:57,207
Here.

885
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:58,527
This direction is good.

886
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,967
(Business proposal)
We've drafted the prospect.

887
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:00,967
This new brand

888
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:02,367
will be widely promoted

889
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,327
nation wide

890
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:05,647
in the coming year.

891
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:07,367
Yunlan is going to make a lot of money.

892
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:09,327
Okay.

893
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,087
I'll show this to my legal department.

894
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,247
If there's no other problem,

895
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:14,847
we'll proceed to the next step.

896
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:15,967
Great.

897
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,887
Yunlan has some reputation

898
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,207
in the industry,

899
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,207
but do you know

900
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:24,727
why we've never worked

901
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:25,847
with Yunlan

902
00:42:26,007 --> 00:42:27,007
all these years?

903
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:28,327
Why?

904
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:33,367
We didn't get to drink
this glass of wine.

905
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:35,927
Your brother, Xiao Xian,

906
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:36,927
doesn't even drink

907
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:38,447
during the meeting.

908
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:39,687
I don't know how many

909
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,127
business opportunities he has missed.

910
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:42,207
To be honest,

911
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:43,927
he's lame,

912
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:45,607
so he can't go to many circles.

913
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:48,447
Your father was right to move you

914
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,287
to the front line.

915
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:50,967
When you've expanded the business,

916
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:52,607
you'll be better than Xiao Xian.

917
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:54,367
By then,

918
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:56,087
Yunlan will be yours for sure.

919
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:58,087
Don't forget

920
00:42:58,447 --> 00:42:59,487
that I've helped you today

921
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:01,179
by that time.

922
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:03,247
We're leaving.

923
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:05,447
Take care.
