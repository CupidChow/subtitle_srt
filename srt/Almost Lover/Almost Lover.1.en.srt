17
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:06,441
I'm He Xiaoran, a war correspondent.

18
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,441
I'm now located at

19
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,561
Ajia City, Li Country.

20
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,641
Just now, this place was

21
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,281
bombed.

22
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,481
My colleague and I have lost contact.

23
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,241
The second round of bombing
is beginning.

24
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,361
It has been a while

25
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,521
since I last had such an exciting dream.

26
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,201
Let's continue.

27
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:57,339

(ICBC: Miss He Xiaoran, happy birthday.)

29
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,900
(China Post: Miss He Xiaoran,
happy birthday.)

30
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,441
My dear,

31
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:12,481
happy birthday to you.

32
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,361
Did you eat

33
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,121
longevity noodles today?

34
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:17,881
You must eat it.

35
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,841
You can't bite it off

36
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,841
when you're eating.

37
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,041
You can't cut it off
with chopsticks, too.

38
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:22,921
The best way is

39
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,961
eat the handmade noodles.

40
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,761
After eating longevity noodles,

41
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,321
you'll have a great year ahead,

42
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:30,081
okay?

43
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:48,001
(Hello, He Xiaoran.)

44
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:49,841
(This is the time capsule)

45
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:50,881
(from the past.)

46
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,921
(First of all,
I'd like to congratulate you.)

47
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,680
(You must have fulfilled your dream)

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,201
(House-sharing rules)
(to become a war correspondent,)

49
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,841
(walking through the battlefield)

50
00:03:58,881 --> 00:03:59,801
(with all the gunfights.)

51
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:00,681
(Hurry!)

52
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:01,801
(Jungle!)

53
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,481
(Jungle! Hold him!)

54
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,961
(Dear, lower your voice.)

55
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:05,841
(Don't let He Xiaoran)

56
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:06,641
(hear you.)

57
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,121
(Did you not pay her?)

58
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,401
(Why are you scared then?)

59
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,561
(I just asked you to lower your voice.)

60
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,641
(Why are you not listening?)

61
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,201
(It's okay.)

62
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,081
(Hurry, go for jungle!)

63
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:17,121
(Come.)

64
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,121
(What's this?)

65
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,721
(Walk past it.)

66
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,841
(If you can't stop the war,)

67
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,121
(tell the world)

68
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,321
(the truth.)

69
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,601
(Record the cruelty of war as it is.)

70
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,641
(Let me remind you.)

71
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,721
(Take care of yourself.)

72
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:42,041
(After all, when the world is peaceful)

73
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:43,801
(and we don't need
a war correspondent anymore,)

74
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,441
(you have another wish)

75
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,161
(waiting to come true.)

76
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:51,521
Okay, thank you.

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,200
(Hupu)

78
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:19,841
(Let's make a deal.)

79
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:21,521
(On this day seven years later,)

80
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:22,721
(no matter where we are,)

81
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,161
(we have to come back)

82
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,361
(and dig out the time capsule.)

83
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,081
Seven years now.

84
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,281
It seems like someone

85
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,881
didn't keep her promise.

86
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,721
Sorry.

87
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,521
I've got many customers.

88
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:12,841
So, I was late coming from
the last customer's place.

89
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,161
No worries.

90
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,681
Please help me check

91
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,281
if this can be repaired.

92
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,801
No way.

93
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,161
There's no more accessory.

94
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,001
Where can I buy this accessory?

95
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,081
You can't find it in the whole Hupu.

96
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,441
What about other places?

97
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:31,561
It's tough.

98
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,041
I'm leaving.

99
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:47,340
(Xiaoran's birthday reminder)

100
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:50,480
(He Xiaoran, happy birthday.)

101
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,880
(Your message is blocked.)

102
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,629
(Xiao Xian)

103
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:15,641
Good job.

104
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,441
Carry on.

105
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:22,561
I need to drink water.

106
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:23,201
Okay.

107
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,081
(Pass the ball.)

108
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,041
Is Qi here?

109
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,481
He said he has something on.

110
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,521
Seems like he's delayed.

111
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,681
I know why you're here today.

112
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,521
You're asking me to

113
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,161
pay the operating fund of Xicheng.

114
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:43,321
You know

115
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,041
that the economy this year is not good.

116
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:46,761
My pressure on the funds

117
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,721
is huge.

118
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:49,721
In Wusu,

119
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,161
we're running a four-star hotel.

120
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:52,161
It's called Jifeng.

121
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,481
I'll give that to you, Xiao family,

122
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,561
to pay off the money.

123
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,441
Look at us.

124
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,161
We're running hotels.

125
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,201
To be frank,

126
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,321
I'm working for

127
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:03,081
the property owners like you.

128
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,521
Now, you want me to start
my own business

129
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,721
and run a hotel.

130
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,481
I'm afraid I can't handle it.

131
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,121
Don't be too humble.

132
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:12,601
Is there anything that you,

133
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:14,361
Xiao Xian, can't do?

134
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,001
I'm not humble.

135
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,201
Xian,

136
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,081
help me pick the ball up.

137
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:19,921
Don't you know Xian's

138
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:20,841
legs are not strong?

139
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:26,801
Okay.

140
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:28,161
Please wait.

141
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,880
Mingxuan, I'm back.

142
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,401
You're back in the country.

143
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:52,521
Why didn't you contact us?

144
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:55,241
I was traveling. I can't help it.

145
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,121
What do you plan to do
after coming back?

146
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:57,241
Let me arrange for you.

147
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,201
I have the say in Deju.

148
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:00,281
You people

149
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:01,761
keep talking

150
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,241
about business.

151
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,281
I

152
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:05,961
just want to play basketball.

153
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,921
You're so immature as usual.

154
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:08,801
You only care about having fun.

155
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,081
Let's go.

156
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,601
Let me tell you all.

157
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,121
Qi is like my own brother.

158
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,041
Better know your place.

159
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,281
Take care of him.

160
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:29,201
Good ball!

161
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:32,161
Good ball!

162
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,081
Mingxuan, you're tired already?

163
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,441
Mingxuan...

164
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,801
Don't refuse about Jifeng.

165
00:09:58,361 --> 00:09:59,521
I'll get the people to
work on the procedure.

166
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:00,761
Well...

167
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,201
Look at how Qi hit me just now.

168
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,121
Xiao family

169
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:04,321
is so aggressive on the court.

170
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:05,641
You can do everything well.

171
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,121
Mingxuan,

172
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:08,841
what about Jifeng?

173
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,321
Just give it to him.

174
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,281
Otherwise, he'd just idle around

175
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,241
every day.

176
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,001
Have you been to Wusu?

177
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:18,521
I'll get the secretary to arrange

178
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:19,761
for you to become

179
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:20,601
the general manager.

180
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,721
Just play basketball.

181
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,721
Don't force yourself.

182
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:28,561
Do you like

183
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,481
to pick up the ball for others?

184
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,321
Are you aware of Jifeng's

185
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,401
situation?

186
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,601
Deju took over that old hotel

187
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,161
from the developer in advance

188
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,841
when Wusu wanted

189
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,001
to develop the place.

190
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,161
It's been losing money for years.

191
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:45,081
I kept

192
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,281
wanting to refuse it,

193
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,161
but you agreed to take it in so easily.

194
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,641
Whether it's a good or a bad business,

195
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:51,761
it's my business.

196
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,081
It's none of your business.

197
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,041
Qi,

198
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,601
when can you become more mature?

199
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:00,241
Don't you understand

200
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:01,601
why father asked you to come back?

201
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,721
And Zhao Mingxuan as well.

202
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,161
Do you think he's still

203
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,321
the same brother that he used to be?

204
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:07,761
No way.

205
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:09,921
He just got promoted,

206
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,481
and he always gives Yunlan a hard time

207
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,481
to build his reputation.

208
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,321
Let me remind you.

209
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,121
We asked you to come back
to help out in Yunlan,

210
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:19,841
not for you to mess around.

211
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,601
Fine.

212
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:25,041
I don't come near you all.

213
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,561
That's the biggest help.

214
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:31,961
Where are you going?

215
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:33,921
Wusu.

216
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,603
(Wusu Radio & TV Group)

217
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,161
Have you heard of that?

218
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,081
Dajiabang

219
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:08,281
is ending today.

220
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:09,721
Isn't that the host, He Xiaoran?

221
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:11,321
Look at her.

222
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:12,881
I wonder where she'll be going tomorrow.

223
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,601
This is the last episode.

224
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:24,201
Are you getting ready
for the farewell meal?

225
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:28,441
He Xiaoran,

226
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,801
(Dajiabang)
can you say something nice?

227
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:32,281
Is the script ready?

228
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,401
I sent my family member
into the jail for stealing.

229
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,721
My sister-in-law and I have
something to talk about.

230
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,401
We don't have enough audience.

231
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:40,681
We're using recordings to fill in.

232
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:41,801
Can't we talk about

233
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:42,841
some better-quality topics?

234
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,801
Say, quantum mechanics.

235
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,161
Good idea.

236
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,241
Do you think our listenership

237
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,441
can be reduced anymore?

238
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:52,721
The data shows

239
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:53,841
that none of the episodes

240
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,481
were more than 0.02%.

241
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,041
Mr. Liu said

242
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,201
today's the last day

243
00:12:58,201 --> 00:12:58,721
of the month.

244
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:00,441
If there's no improvement

245
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,921
in our program,

246
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:04,201
we're done.

247
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:05,321
After today,

248
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:08,081
maybe no one can hear

249
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,441
He Xiaoran's voice in
radio wave anymore.

250
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:12,321
You sound like

251
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,121
many people have heard my voice before.

252
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,081
Who took my cake back here?

253
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:18,641
Great that you're here. Come with me.

254
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:20,361
What's going on?

255
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:21,801
We went to record something
for the program just now.

256
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:22,681
It happened that City Traffic's

257
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,641
crews were recording
for their program, too.

258
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:25,521
Is that weird?

259
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:26,961
They do that every time.

260
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:27,921
Let them record first.

261
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:28,561
We can wait.

262
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:29,961
We can't wait.

263
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,961
If they do that until 9.30 p.m.,

264
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:31,961
and we need to start at 10 p.m.,

265
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,001
it's going to be late.

266
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:34,481
You're right.

267
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,761
If we fail

268
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:37,641
the last episode,

269
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,401
it's going to be bad.

270
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,401
Open up the cake for me.

271
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:41,521
What are you doing?

272
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,801
Treat them to a birthday cake.

273
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:44,641
We can't eat

274
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:45,441
in the recording studio.

275
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:45,841
Once they come out,

276
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,601
we can go in.

277
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:47,881
Why are you treating them

278
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:48,721
to a birthday cake?

279
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,641
Let's not cause any trouble.

280
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,241
Don't try this trick.

281
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,761
No one wants to eat your cake.

282
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,001
It's first come, first served
for the recording studio.

283
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,441
You should come early next time.

284
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:05,721
Well,

285
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,641
I heard that you've got
no next time.

286
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,201
Why are you still preparing then?

287
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,001
Exactly because there's no next time

288
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,121
that we want to have

289
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,281
a perfect farewell.

290
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:14,801
Why do you want to fight over us

291
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:15,961
even on a farewell?

292
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:17,241
A perfect farewell?

293
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:18,921
Dajiabang For Everyone

294
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:19,921
is a gathering place for losers.

295
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,401
You should've dismissed it earlier.

296
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:22,921
"Perfect" has nothing

297
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:24,041
to do with you.

298
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:26,521
How could you say that?

299
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:27,801
Is the host of a morning program

300
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:28,801
greater than us?

301
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:29,641
Sui Mingwei,

302
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,441
are you trying to beat the ladies?

303
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:35,921
They're having a birthday celebration.

304
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:36,761
Why not we...

305
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,281
Just forget it!

306
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,161
Stop fighting!

307
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,001
Let go!

308
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,281
- Dadong!
- No!

309
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:45,201
Stop fighting!

310
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:48,401
Enough!

311
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:49,881
Let go!

312
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:51,521
Stop fighting, Dadong!

313
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:52,481
Stop fighting!

314
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,721
You want to use the studio?

315
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:04,481
What are you doing?

316
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:05,441
There are rules to

317
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:06,481
use the recording studio.

318
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:07,521
Just because

319
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:08,441
your program is on the golden time,

320
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,441
you took our pre-booked schedule,

321
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,481
and that's more than once you did that.

322
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:11,161
We let it slide normally,

323
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:11,801
but today,

324
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:12,761
we must go in.

325
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:13,881
No one can stop us.

326
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,601
He Xiaoran, are you crazy?

327
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,761
You want to use the studio?

328
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:18,161
Go through the procedure!

329
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,401
Apply for the spare keys

330
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:20,921
and you might need to
wait until late midnight.

331
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:23,801
Okay.

332
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,401
You locked the door.

333
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:26,881
You should apply for the spare keys.

334
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:27,761
Also,

335
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:28,801
you're making a scene.

336
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:29,801
Just wait.

337
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,041
Wait for your punishment.

338
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,361
Let's go.

339
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,281
Crazy.

340
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,361
You care not about the consequences.

341
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:41,401
It's my first time seeing it.

342
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:43,561
No problem.
I'll take the responsibility.

343
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,921
What should we do now?

344
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:48,081
I asked you not to fight here.

345
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,201
I didn't.

346
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:57,121
What's going on?

347
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:58,761
What did you throw away just now?

348
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,361
My house key.

349
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:03,761
You're something else.

350
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:04,961
Not bad.

351
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,201
You normally look weak,

352
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,961
but you're able to fight well.

353
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:09,641
It's nothing.

354
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,001
Who dare throw away the keys

355
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:11,681
to get punished?

356
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:13,361
I think you do.

357
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:14,521
I think so, too.

358
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:16,241
Okay, start the recording.

359
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,401
I'll handle this.

360
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:18,681
I'll book a room for you.

361
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,361
Take a shower.

362
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,001
Let us handle the recording.

363
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:22,681
No need.

364
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:23,641
Just go.

365
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,541
(Booking succeeded)

366

The ZiX Hotel across the road?

367
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:29,721
Although that hotel

368
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:30,241
is so-so,

369
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,521
washing my hair there

370
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:32,681
is too luxurious.

371
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,081
The price has reduced so much.

372
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,201
It's not luxurious.

373
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:36,761
Go ahead.

374
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:37,401
Okay.

375
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:38,121
I'll be quick.

376
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,401
Don't let Mr. He know.

377
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:40,601
I already knew.

378
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,881
Don't go with nothing.

379
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,441
Give these out as well.

380
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,921
Listen to your heart.

381
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,801
Solve your loneliness.

382
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,201
Comfort your soul.

383
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,161
Can I say no now?

(ZiX Hotel)

386
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:28,721
Hello.

387
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:31,601
Okay, I'll be there.

388
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:34,641
Hi.

389
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:37,921
Hi, sir.

390
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,241
Are you here for traveling?

391
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,281
Do you have any reservation?

392
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,001
No.

393
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,721
What kind of room
would you like to have?

394
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,001
I want to stay in

395
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,401
a non-smoking room facing south.

396
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:46,721
Not facing any garden.

397
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:47,841
I'm allergic to pollen.

398
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,241
Not ground floor.

399
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,481
Not near the lift.

400
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:51,041
Not the corner

401
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,361
and not the end of the corridor.

402
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:53,361
Also,

403
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,401
keep my room number and name

404
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:55,761
a secret.

405
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:58,641
Also,

406
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,321
my car is parked at the hotel's

407
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,521
hall entrance and it ran out of petrol.

408
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:03,881
Please help me out.

409
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,961
The tank is completely empty?

410
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,041
It can't even start?

411
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,961
The room is a bit messy.

412
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,201
Make the room clean

413
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:51,961
within 10 minutes.

414
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,081

Blackout.

418
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,281
I haven't finished eating.

419
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:35,641
I'm sorry.

420
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:37,761
We're checking

421
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:38,241
the reason of the power outage.

422
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:38,841
What's going on?

423
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:39,641
What's going on?

424
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,001
How can there be a power outage
at this hour?

425
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:42,281
Suddenly there was a blackout.

426
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:43,641
I don't know.

427
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:44,641
What attitude is this?

428
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,041
No, you don't have to be

429
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:46,761
angry with me.

430
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:47,681
I can't generate electricity.

431
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:48,321
The power is out at night

432
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,321
in your hotel.

433
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,601
Is something wrong?

434
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:51,641
Hello, what's going on?

435
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:52,641
Where are the workers
in the electrical room?

436
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:53,801
No one is in there.

437
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:54,881
I'm trying to contact them.

438
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:55,481
How much longer will
the spare electricity

439
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:56,441
be activated?

440
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:57,201
What's going on?

441
00:19:57,201 --> 00:19:57,961
Why is there a blackout?

442
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,401
Did something happen?

443
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,001
No, I...

444
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:01,921
I don't know.

445
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:04,841

This is just cooked.

450

I haven't started eating it.

451
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,841
There was a blackout
before I could take a shower.

The luosifen was almost

453
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:25,481
spilled on me.

454
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,241
Luckily I got rid of it.

Today could be the last episode

463
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:10,841
of our program.

464
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,801
Why not we come together

465
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,121
and talk about farewell?

466
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:18,361
We hardly have any chances in life

467
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:19,681
to wait for us to get ready

468
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:20,801
to face losing something.

469
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,721
Sometimes,

470
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,561
we'd choose to

471
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:25,641
lose contact.

472
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,161
The so-called farewell
when we say goodbye.

473
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:32,161
Although we'll be sad

474
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,001
and sorrowful,

475
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,801
according to the conservation law,

476
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:38,601
maybe after

477
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:40,161
losing something,

478
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,041
we'll gain something new.

479
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:43,281
What's going on?

480
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:44,401
The blackout is too long.

481
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,321
The main power switches of the lobby

482
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:46,721
and the rooms were switched off,

483
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:47,721
but the rest

484
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:48,241
is fine.

485
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:48,961
Isn't the electrical room

486
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:49,921
locked all the time?

487
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:51,281
Mr. Lin.

488
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:53,001
We've checked the CCTV.

489
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:54,281
I know that person.

490
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:55,881
A new guest who checked in today.

491
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,081
A fussy person.

492
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:58,241
He's been making a scene

493
00:21:58,321 --> 00:21:59,281
ever since he arrived.

494
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:01,241
Now, he even switched off the power.

495
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,361
Do you think he's sent by the competitor

496
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,401
to cause us an issue?

497
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:05,361
Do you think Jifeng is performing well?

498
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:06,681
Do we even have any competitor?

499
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,321
Are they crazy?

500
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,841
You're right.

501
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,321
That's him!

502
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,121
Sir.

503
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,161
I've stayed in many hotels.

504
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,761
This is the first one

505
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,121
that can't even solve a small issue.

506
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:22,961
Normally, a hotel can activate
the spare electricity

507
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:23,761
in five minutes.

508
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:24,961
How long did your hotel take?

509
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:27,321
Not more than 10 minutes.

510
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,881
There's no one in the electrical room.

511
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:31,401
Everyone was in the lobby

512
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,881
walking around.

513
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:33,921
Come here.

514
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:35,921
Smell my jacket.

515
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,201
No need.

516
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:38,321
The staying experience is terrible.

517
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,361
Take it off.

518
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:40,361
I'll take it to the laundry.

519
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:41,161
No need.

520
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:45,841
No.

521
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:47,921
Didn't you switch off the power?

522
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:48,881
Who are you?

523
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,401
Xiao Shangqi.

524
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:52,241
I don't know you.

525
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:54,281
We know him.

526
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:55,481
Know who?

527
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:56,921
Xiao...

528
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:59,521
So what with the surname Xiao?

529
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,401
In the evening,

530
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,361
the group sent us a transfer memo about

531
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,121
Jifeng being taken over by Yunlan.

532
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:08,081
Yes.

533
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:08,681
Xiao family will run the hotel.

534
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:10,361
Yes.

535
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,081
Do you get it now?

536
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:13,481
So, he's Mr. Xiao.

537
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,761
Hi, Mr. Xiao.

538
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:15,881
Hi, Mr. Xiao.

539
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:16,161
Well,

540
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,201
how come you're here so soon?

541
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:18,321
Well,

542
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:18,921
we didn't expect that.

543
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:19,921
If you think the hotel's light

544
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:20,641
is too bright,

545
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,081
you can let us know.

546
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:22,921
Will I become like this

547
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:24,521
if it's not for the uncivilized people

548
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,161
coming in and out of the hotel?

549
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:28,281
Uncivilized?

550
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:31,321
Listen to your heart.

551
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:32,921
Solve your loneliness.

552
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:34,161
Comfort your soul.

553
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:36,081
This is impossible, Mr. Xiao.

554
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:37,081
What's so impossible?

555
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:38,161
This towel

556
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,161
was left behind by that lady.

557
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:41,681
Did she do anything to you?

558
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:44,481
What are you thinking?

559
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,121
I met her in your hotel lobby.

560
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,401
Mr. Xiao.

561
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,361
Mr. Xiao, look.

562
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,601
It's the broadcasting.

563
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:54,976
(Wusu traffic broadcasting, FM78.8,
Dajiabang For Everyone, 10 p.m.)

564
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:56,481
Who knows if it's a fraud?

565
00:23:58,801 --> 00:23:59,841
Hasn't it started?

566
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,361
We'll know after listening to it.

567
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,201
- Yes.
- Got it?

568
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,441
This is Wusu's traffic broadcasting,

569
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,881
FM78.8.

570
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,041
Dajiabang For Everyone.

571
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:12,841
I'm He

572
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,641
who is helping you to
solve your problems.

573
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:15,761
Let's take in

574
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,001
the next call.

575
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,681
How do I address you, sir?

576
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,441
Do you have anything

577
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,561
to share with everyone?

578
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:22,841
I'm Liu.

579
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,241
Miss He,

580
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,081
I love you so much.

581
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,081
Every day when I wake up,

582
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:28,921
I'd imagine that

583
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:30,521
you're by my side.

584
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,041
We'd go for a walk,

585
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:33,081
eat,

586
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:34,081
shop,

587
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,121
and chat together.

588
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:36,881
Especially at night,

589
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:38,321
I'd miss you

590
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:39,921
until I lose my sleep.

591
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:41,721
Mr. Liu,

592
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,841
imagination can help your brain

593
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:44,961
discrete dopamine

594
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:45,881
and make you happy.

595
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:46,961
I understand that.

596
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:47,761
But

597
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,841
this kind of happiness is short term.

598
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:50,561
You need to be back

599
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:51,761
in the reality.

600
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,001
Miss He,

601
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,521
I think you're the only person
in the world

602
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,561
who can understand me.

603
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:58,881
Where's the recording?

604
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,561
We are lack of fake audiences.

605
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:01,481
But, the number of people

606
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,921
in our online discussion is increasing.

607
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:04,521
Don't worry.

608
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,161
I won't give up.

609
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,321
We must find a chance to meet up

610
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,161
and talk.

611
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,281
Mr. Xiao.

612
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:09,721
Mr. Xiao.

613
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:11,881
Where are you going?

614
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,727
(Jifeng Hotel)

615
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:17,121
(Miss He,)

616
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,201
(are you even)

617
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:18,881
(listening to me?)

618
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,521
Go to the radio station.

619
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:20,241
(I heard you.)

620
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,241
Go to the radio station. Now.

621
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:23,561
(Hiding behind the hotline)

622
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:24,481
(to humiliate women,)

623
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:26,401
(and trying to get the attention)

624
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:27,401
(will only prove that)

625
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,561
(you're a loser.)

626
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:29,761
(Using this)

627
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:30,521
(despicable way to)

628
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,201
(gain the sense of achievement)

629
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:33,081
(and sense of belonging)

630
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,441
(will only make me feel)

631
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:35,641
(you're a pitiful person.)

632
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,761
(What are you talking about?)

633
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:38,881
(Mr. Liu,)

634
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,201
(your action)

635
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:42,001
(can be conveyed)

636
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,321
(to our audiences that)

637
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:45,761
some people like to harass,

638
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,201
trail and even monitor others

639
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:49,401
in the name of a fan.

640
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:50,681
Everyone, please remember.

641
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,401
The love that can't be felt

642
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,681
is not love.

643
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,401
Can't you walk across the road?

644
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:08,161
Last episode.

645
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,321
Let's pick up another call.

646
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:17,897
(Audience)

647
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:18,841
Hello, my friend.

648
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:20,561
Do you have any farewell story

649
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:21,841
to share with us?

650
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:23,161
Xiaoran,

651
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:24,881
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

652
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:28,801
(There was a boy.)

653
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,321
(He's been staying in the hotel
since young.)

654
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,561
(Sometimes, he'd feel lonely,)

655
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:37,601
(but he's bright and easygoing.)

656
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:39,841
(So he's attracted a lot of people.)

657
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,761
(I know.)

658
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:43,481
(After graduation,)

659
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:46,241
(we'll walk on separate paths.)

660
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:49,321
(We might go further away
from each other.)

661
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:02,641
Fun on weekend.

662
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,441
Care not about
improving our relationship.

663
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:05,721
I just want to get everything straight.

664
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,001
An answer will be enough.

665
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,240
(To: Xiao Shangqi)

666
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:19,601
Let's go. The "failing" tree.

667
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:20,481
If we get hit by

668
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:22,161
the flower of this tree,
we'll fail the subject.

669
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:23,961
Block it for me.

670
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,920
(The next song is for Wang Yang,)

671
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,400
(from Liu Min.)

672
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
(Secret Words.)

673
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,441
Why are you so blurred there?

674
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,521
We're under the "failing" tree.

675
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:40,441
It's the second round of the exam
of the TV station tomorrow.

676
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:41,361
Do you want to fail it?

677
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:53,441
Thank you.

678
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:35,921
Why are you laughing?

679
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:37,961
It's okay.

680
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:39,801
I'll send you to the exam tomorrow.

681
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:40,881
You'll pass for sure.

682
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:42,721
Are you sure?

683
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:43,801
Of course.

684
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,281
By then,

685
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,481
I'll be standing at the entrance
of the TV station,

686
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,081
waiting for you to come out.

687
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,721
Then I'll buy you a meal.

688
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:50,841
If I fail,

689
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,241
it's the fault of your weak aura.

690
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:52,721
Okay.

691
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:55,801
Well,

692
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:57,121
didn't you say you want
to give me something?

693
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:57,881
Give it to me now.

694
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:58,881
He Xiaoran,

695
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:00,561
your broadcasting station

696
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:01,441
should stop jeopardizing

697
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:02,321
innocent boys like me.

698
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,801
I've retired.

699
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,241
No.

700
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:06,961
The graduation
confession song dedication

701
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,281
was started by you last year.

702
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:09,361
Initially,

703
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,521
we can still greet each other,

704
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,321
but now I have to avoid her.

705
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:13,121
But this kind of

706
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:14,281
stuff that tells everyone
on the broadcast

707
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:15,481
is forcing others to do
what they don't like.

708
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,801
It's not necessary.

709
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:19,241
Let's go for a meal now.

710
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:20,121
Okay.

711
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:22,281
Well,

712
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:24,241
didn't you say you want
to give me something?

713
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:25,681
Give it to me now.

714
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:29,841
It's a coupon.

715
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:30,601
I forgot to bring it.

716
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:31,521
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

717
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:34,721
Quickly get the Visa done.

718
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:35,681
We've got it done.

719
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:36,841
By then,

720
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,241
don't delay the graduation trip.

721
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:40,041
Let's go.

722
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:47,604
(To Xiao Shangqi)

723
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:53,896
(Youth Never Ends)

724
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:54,641
Xiaoran,

725
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:56,801
professor asked you to go over.

726
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,361
I'm about to start here.

727
00:29:58,721 --> 00:29:59,361
Just go over.

728
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:00,241
I'll help you.

729
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,921
The materials are all on the desktop?

730
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:04,161
Just going according to

731
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:05,161
the number of the program list

732
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:05,801
will do.

733
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:06,281
Okay.

734
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:06,841
I'm going now.

735
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:35,921
We're the next program.

736
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:36,561
The video should be aired

737
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:37,281
from the 12th second.

738
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:37,961
Don't forget.

739
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:38,641
Okay.

740
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,921
(To Our Four Years)
To us.

741
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,361
(To Our Six Years)
To us.

742
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:52,921
(There was a boy.)

743
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,681
(He's been staying in the hotel
since young.)

744
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,481
Professor thinks highly of you.

745
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,281
He even told you in advance
the tips for the exam.

746
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,121
What's going on?

747
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,081
It's so lively.

748
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,161
- What's going on?
- (Xiao Shangqi.)

749
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:08,241
I don't know.

750
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,201
(I've loved you for so long.)

751
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,081
(If I want to count,)

752
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,041
(it should be starting since high school.)

753
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:19,481
(Until now,)

754
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:20,801
(it has been five years and four months.)

755
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,281
He Xiaoran is confessing in the public.

756
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:24,961
(I know.)

757
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:25,841
Where's Xiao Shangqi?

758
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:26,961
(After graduation,)

759
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:30,001
(we'll walk on separate paths.)

760
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:33,041
(We might go further away
from each other.)

761
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,800
Big-scale embarrassment.

762
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:55,601
He Xiaoran,

763
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,241
your love confession in public

764
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:59,081
is worse than
the confession song dedication.

765
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:00,081
Xiao Shangqi was scared by you

766
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,121
and went overseas overnight.

767
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:08,121
Xiao Shangqi.

768
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:13,721
Miss He,

769
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:20,481
why don't you understand

770
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,121
what I said on the phone?

771
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,001
You're Mr. Liu?

772
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:28,801
Let's talk.

773
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,401
I don't mean anything else.

774
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,521
I... Let go of me.

775
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:34,801
- What are you doing?
- Listen to me.

776
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,201
Don't run!

777
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:48,681
Forget it.
Don't chase after him anymore.

778
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:50,241
No?

779
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:52,601
Leave him alone.

780
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,401
Let's not stir up any trouble.

781
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:07,121
It's been a while, Xiao Shangqi.

782
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,321
It's been a while.

783
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:15,561
What a coincidence that we met here.

784
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,361
I have something on. I need to go.

785
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:19,161
He Xiaoran.

786
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,841
We were classmates and we met again.

787
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:23,760
Shouldn't you treat me to a meal?

788
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,961
What's the weird smell on your body?

789
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,481
You often met that kind of people?

790
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:45,240
The red swamp crayfish they sell

791
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,361
comes with 13 spices. It's very tasty.

792
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:47,121
Try it.

793
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:47,921
You always work until

794
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:48,681
this hour?

795
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,921
It's been a while.

796
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,760
Here.

797
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:52,601
Drink some.

798
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:54,201
Why are you in Wusu?

799
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:56,361
Can't you tell?

800
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:57,081
I'm working.

801
00:34:57,641 --> 00:34:58,161
Okay.

802
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,521
Even though you've found this job,

803
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:03,521
does this job need to be kept a secret?

804
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:05,441
Do you need to block me?

805
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:08,121
Xiao Shangqi,

806
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:11,081
we haven't met in three years.

807
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,961
We were classmates and we met again.

808
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:14,961
Can we not talk about

809
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:16,081
the things in the past?

810
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:16,921
Talk about something happy

811
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:17,881
and have a nice meal.

812
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:18,841
Do you still remember that

813
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:19,641
we were classmates?

814
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:20,841
I think I'm the same as

815
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:21,601
that guy.

816
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:22,721
We can only reach you

817
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,681
by calling the hotline.

818
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:26,521
Is wrapping yourself with a towel
in the hotel

819
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:27,241
and giving out brochures

820
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,401
the life that you want?

821
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:35,761
Are you staying in Jifeng?

822
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:37,081
Can you be serious?

823
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:38,481
What about your ideal?

824
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:39,841
You used to hate the bad people.

825
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:40,961
Last time, you'd say

826
00:35:40,961 --> 00:35:42,041
we should get involved more.

827
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:45,241
What happened last time?

828
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:47,281
Aren't you talking eloquently

829
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:48,601
in your program?

830
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:49,361
Xiao Shangqi.

831
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:53,841
Do you remember

832
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,001
it's my birthday today?

833
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:57,241
Of course I know.

834
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:58,481
Let alone my birthday,

835
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,361
I'm afraid you've forgotten

836
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:03,041
who was the one that

837
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,241
drew a line between us.

838
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:06,481
My mother said

839
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,961
I need to eat longevity noodles
on my birthday

840
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:10,801
for all things to go well.

841
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:12,961
I tried to save the trouble

842
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:13,761
and only ate cup noodles.

843
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:15,601
I didn't expect today to be

844
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,321
so tough and twisted.

845
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:19,681
I was blow-drying my hair
and there was a blackout.

846
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:21,401
I was giving out brochures

847
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:22,961
and you got it.

848
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,881
How high was the possibility?

849
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:27,801
You know what?

850
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:30,001
Today is the last episode of

851
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,321
my program.

852
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:35,161
If you were late for a day,

853
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:38,881
maybe you can never

854
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:40,641
hear my voice anymore

855
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:41,841
over the radio wave.

856
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,561
Will you then have the chance

857
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:47,401
to interrogate me here today?

858
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:52,001
It's your birthday today.

859
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:53,521
Let's go to another place.

860
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:54,521
Let's go.

861
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:56,001
Why can't we eat this?

862
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,481
The red swamp crayfish is RMB 10 each.

863
00:36:59,081 --> 00:36:59,721
I only eat it once

864
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,041
in a season.

865
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,281
It's only because of you
that we're here.

866
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:05,801
Normally, I only

867
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,561
eat the one which is RMB 8 each.

868
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:10,121
He Xiaoran,

869
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:13,281
is this the life you want?

870
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:17,561
What?

871
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,281
Yes.

872
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:20,561
To you,

873
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:21,681
my current life

874
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:23,441
is terrible,

875
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:25,161
but I like this kind of life

876
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:26,801
that's full of trivial matters.

877
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,281
If something nice happens,

878
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,201
I'll be very happy

879
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,521
like on cloud nine.

880
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,161
Don't stand there

881
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:32,721
judging me,

882
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:33,881
and disturbing my life.

883
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:38,361
This is the least manner

884
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,201
and respect,

885
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:40,001
understand?

886
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,441
It's 12 o'clock. I wish you stay
18 years old forever.

887
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,481
Here, light up the candle.

888
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:48,361
Light up the candle and sing a song.

889
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,841
Happy birthday to you.

890
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,121
Happy birthday to you.

891
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,841
Happy birthday to you.

892
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:03,521
Happy birthday to you.

893
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:04,721
But since

894
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,081
you came to me,

895
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,201
it's not too much to

896
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,481
ask for a present, right?

897
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:41,681
I'm drunk.

898
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,041
I'm too much.

899
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:49,841
It's late now.

900
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,001
I should go home now.

901
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:52,401
No worries, keep eating.

902
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:54,721
No need to see me off.

903
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,401
He Xiaoran.

904
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:03,416
(Jifeng Hotel)

905
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,121
Mr. Lin,

906
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,761
who is he? He's arrogant.

907
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:09,201
Xiao family has two sons.

908
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:10,881
The elder son is Xiao Xian.

909
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:12,521
He's mature and capable,
running all the businesses by himself.

910
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:15,401
The younger son is playful.

911
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:17,081
After graduation,

912
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:18,241
he came back after having fun
for three years.

913
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,601
I think he's sick of
having fun out there.

914
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,881
Now, he's back to make fun of us.

915
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,281
We're under him from now on,

916
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:26,441
not Deju?

917
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:27,561
It's said Deju's business
was mainly established

918
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,161
with Xiao family's help.

919
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,161
It looks like the owner has changed,

920
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,561
but it's back to someone has built it.

921
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:35,321
Right.

922
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:37,201
Mr. Xiao.

923
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:37,841
Mr. Xiao.

924
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:38,841
You came back late.

925
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:40,281
You're not familiar with the place.

926
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:41,881
You should just order us.

927
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:43,521
You're familiar with the place?

928
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,681
Check this person out for me.

929
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:46,521
He Xiaoran, a host.

930
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:50,001
Tell me once you find something.

931
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,601
How did he find me here?

932
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:26,721
Miss He.

933
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:32,201
Your current identity

934
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:33,801
needs to be covered?

935
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:34,641
I'm feeling cold.

936
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:37,721
Your breakfast?

937
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:39,161
It was.

938
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,201
Let's have a meal.
Let me buy you a meal.

939
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:43,521
No need.

940
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,801
Are you feeling guilty?
You dare not face it?

941
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:51,641
I've learned how to

942
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:52,561
face it over the years.

943
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,175
(Jifeng Hotel)

944
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:07,281
Although Wusu isn't too big,

945
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,121
you don't have to

946
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:09,761
stay opposite our radio station.

947
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:11,321
Mr. Xiao, good morning.

948
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:12,201
Good morning.

949
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:20,841
Is this...

950
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:22,721
This is my hotel.

951
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:24,321
He Xiaoran,

952
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:25,801
I'm afraid you can't expect me

953
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:26,641
to leave so soon.

954
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:36,801
Why are you in Wusu?

955
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:41,721
Didn't you go to Hupu TV Station?

956
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:42,921
Listen to you.

957
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:44,561
I had to pass the exam.

958
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:45,841
Didn't you pass the exam?

959
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:47,361
Wasn't the professor taking care of you?

960
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,321
He recommended you,

961
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:49,601
and you passed
the first round of interview.

962
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,281
The second round
was just a show.

963
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,881
Come on.

964
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,801
Don't mention what
shouldn't be mentioned.

965
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:57,361
I didn't pass the exam.

966
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:58,521
Why?

967
00:41:58,601 --> 00:41:59,121
Well,

968
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:00,281
does that have anything to do with you?

969
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:02,401
Someone who left without saying anything

970
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:03,241
is asking me instead.

971
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,001
Just because I left in a hurry

972
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:08,841
without telling you,

973
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,201
you blocked me overnight?

974
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:10,961
Can't you wait for a day?

975
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:12,881
Would there be any changes
if I had waited for a day?

976
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,281
Xiao Shangqi,

977
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:20,401
you came to stop me in the morning

978
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:21,321
just because I kissed you

979
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:22,361
last night?

980
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:27,361
No mark was left behind.

981
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:29,121
If you feel bad about it,

982
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:30,281
why not kiss me back?

983
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,241
What's wrong with you?

984
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:33,721
I'm talking nicely...

985
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:34,281
Xiao Shangqi,

986
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:35,121
you just came back

987
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:35,921
so you might not know.

988
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,521
The breakfast in your hotel

989
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,201
is known to be awful.

990
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:40,521
The porridge is leftover
from last night.

991
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:41,521
The noodles are soggy.

992
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:43,441
There are more scallions than meat
in the bun.

993
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,161
You shouldn't be

994
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,561
interrogating me here.

995
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:51,801
Enough.

996
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:54,801
I treated you to a meal yesterday.

997
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:55,921
You treated me to a meal today.

998
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:56,921
Now, we're even.

999
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:57,801
No one owes anyone anything.

1000
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:00,841
Also,

1001
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:02,361
don't look for me anymore.

1002
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:03,121
Otherwise,

1003
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:04,561
I'll kiss you every time I see you.
