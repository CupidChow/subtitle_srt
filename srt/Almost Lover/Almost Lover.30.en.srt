17
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:40,373
I was really

18
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,693
used by Zhao Mingxuan.

19
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,453
I didn't know about this.

20
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:45,053
But no one is willing

21
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,333
to trust me no matter what I say.

22
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,613
No one trusts you

23
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,213
so you came to Xiaoran.

24
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,813
I have nowhere to go now.

25
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,893
Zhao Mingxuan has found me.

26
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:55,893
I don't know what

27
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:57,733
this madman will do to me.

28
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:04,933
Come here.

29
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:16,293
What should we do?

30
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:19,533
I'll look for Xiao Shangqi

31
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:20,573
and find out what happened.

32
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,413
Let her sleep in my room.

33
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,733
Okay.

34
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:03,893
You're back.

35
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:07,333
Why are you here?

36
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,133
Lin Zong told me

37
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,493
that you're on your back here.

38
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:14,653
So, I came and waited for you.

39
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,413
Okay.

40
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,333
Thank you for coming.

41
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:47,933
Here.

42
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:48,613
Thank you.

43
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:58,653
Fei'er said she was not aware.

44
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,693
I think she wasn't lying.

45
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:02,573
Where is she now?

46
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:03,733
The loft.

47
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:05,053
Li Hui is with her now.

48
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,333
Zhao Mingxuan must have met her

49
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:08,773
and pressured her.

50
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:11,893
If she was sent,

51
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,133
she should be

52
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:14,373
able to go back now.

53
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:16,893
It's my fault.

54
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,733
I was in a hurry to defeat
Zhao Mingxuan

55
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,253
and I wasn't careful enough.

56
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,173
How's Yunlan?

57
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,013
We lack of a lot of funds.

58
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:27,973
Xian is not in a good shape.

59
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:30,533
This incident

60
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,893
has got many people involved.

61
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,213
What do you plan to

62
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,013
do next?

63
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:42,973
Are you worried about me?

64
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,493
I'm afraid that

65
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,133
you'd suddenly be depressed again.

66
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,013
No worries.

67
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:55,293
As long as you're by my side,

68
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,493
I'll be able to handle this.

69
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,333
Xiao Shangqi,

70
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:14,853
I didn't come

71
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:15,813
- because of...
- I know.

72
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,213
I'm happy enough that you're here.

73
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:20,613
I dare not ask for more.

74
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,693
If we can keep Yunlan,

75
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,573
then we can gather related information.

76
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,173
An inadvertent

77
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:29,973
clue

78
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,133
will lead us to the truth.

79
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,053
Even if a bad deed was done secretly,

80
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:35,013
it can't be invincible.

81
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,653
One day,

82
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:40,733
I'll catch Zhao Mingxuan's tail.

83
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,653
Where are you going?

84
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:52,333
I need to record songs.

85
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:54,573
Don't leave me here alone.

86
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,053
Zhao Mingxuan might find me.

87
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:57,693
I've called someone here.

88
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:00,973
You're late.

89
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,653
It's good enough that I came.

90
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,693
Look at you.

91
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,613
You just let anyone stay here.

92
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,013
You're quite busy.

93
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,613
What are they asking you to do?

94
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:15,853
Show me the contract.

95
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,253
- I'll get someone...
- I'm leaving now.

96
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,733
Are all the men in Wusu so long-winded

97
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:22,853
and nosy?

98
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:24,933
Is she your girlfriend now?

99
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,013
Mind your own business.

100
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,373
You said, the more information we have,

101
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:33,773
the easier we can get his flaw.

102
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:34,493
So, I looked for

103
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,813
Susu from Hupu TV Station

104
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:36,773
to help me gather

105
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,693
Deju's news in the past few years.

106
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,333
I've gathered those

107
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:41,333
related to Zhao Mingxuan.

108
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:43,133
See if there's any clue.

109
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,213
I've sent it to you. Take a look.

110
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:45,933
Okay.

111
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:46,933
Let me take a look.

112
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,013
Why did I fall asleep?

113
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:52,733
Did you find anything?

114
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:54,853
Not yet.

115
00:07:58,453 --> 00:07:58,813
I've watched all day,

116
00:07:58,973 --> 00:07:59,733
but I can't remember anything.

117
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:01,653
I only remember a few faces.

118
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:03,493
What faces?

119
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,333
Zhao Mingxuan, his secretary

120
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:06,653
and the guy with the spectacles.

121
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:07,733
I don't know who he is.

122
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:09,453
Three of them are

123
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,533
involved in all the projects.

124
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:35,132
Xian,

125
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,093
check this guy out for me.

126
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,252
I've sent it to you.

127
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:41,413
He looks familiar.

128
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:43,132
Where did I see him?

129
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:09,933
What are you doing?

130
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,453
Come down.

131
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,053
What?

132
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,213
Okay, I'll go get the door.

133
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:30,813
Is Fei'er here?

134
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:32,413
She's upstairs.

135
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:57,493
Miss Chen, come back with me.

136
00:09:58,253 --> 00:09:59,053
It's safer there.

137
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,253
Didn't you think I set you guys up?

138
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,093
I was just asking.

139
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,373
You left without

140
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,133
answering me.

141
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:09,453
Okay,

142
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:11,093
I suspected you.

143
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:12,653
But after I gave it a thought,

144
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:13,973
if you were here

145
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:14,893
to set us up,

146
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:15,533
we're

147
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,293
experienced enough

148
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,333
to tell.

149
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:18,613
I'm sure you were

150
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:19,573
not aware.

151
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,613
You were used by the cunning

152
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,253
Zhao Mingxuan.

153
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:23,173
You really know how to talk.

154
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,533
Stop staying here.

155
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,373
Go back with Lin Zong to Jifeng.

156
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,293
Our place is not a hotel.

157
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,453
Taiyang has been looking for you
the whole morning.

158
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,453
Jifeng is not in peace

159
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:35,133
due to this matter.

160
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:36,293
Mr. Xiao and I have to check the account

161
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:36,973
in the afternoon.

162
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:39,373
My son is alone.

163
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:41,293
Just help me

164
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:42,933
to keep Taiyang company.

165
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:52,493
Qi,

166
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:53,533
I've checked.

167
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,693
He's Deju's CFO,

168
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:56,733
Jia Wen.

169
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:58,133
He died two years back.

170
00:10:58,573 --> 00:10:59,973
He's no longer in the company.

171
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,573
What happened to him?

172
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,773
I need to find out more.

173
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:11,973
I remember who he is now.

174
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,173
Madam Wang's son, Wen.

175
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,253
(You're not her family?)

176
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,573
(Her son was in Hupu, too.)

177
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:20,533
(Maybe he's working)

178
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:21,653
(in a hotel, too.)

179
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,960
(Lizhen Nursing Home)

180
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:40,773
Madam Wang.

181
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,293
Madam Wang.

182
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:44,133
Someone is here to visit you.

183
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,053
Madam Wang.

184
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:51,493
Wen.

185
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:52,933
You're here.

186
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,133
Madam Wang.

187
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:56,893
I'm not Wen.

188
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:58,733
Madam Wang,

189
00:11:59,173 --> 00:11:59,733
look.

190
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:00,933
Is this Wen?

191
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:14,813
Who are you?

192
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:16,093
Madam Wang,

193
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:16,773
I'm He Xiaoran.

194
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:18,093
I'm the journalist

195
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:18,893
who helped you before.

196
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:19,693
Don't you remember?

197
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:21,373
We're here

198
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,093
to ask you about Wen.

199
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,333
Was he working in Deju?

200
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:26,613
When...

201
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,053
I don't know!

202
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:28,853
I don't know!

203
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,373
Don't look for me anymore!

204
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,573
Madam Wang.

205
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:33,013
Madam Wang, we don't mean evil.

206
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:33,853
It's okay.

207
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,173
Jia Wen was driving after drinking
two years back.

208
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,093
He died in the car accident.

209
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:42,573
Madam Wang has been

210
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,213
feeling guilty about it.

211
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:46,733
So, she sold the house

212
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:47,613
in Hupu.

213
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,533
She gave some money

214
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:51,933
to her son's girlfriend.

215
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,653
The house was on fire

216
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,333
before it was sold.

217
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,253
It was sold at a low price.

218
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:01,053
Madam Wang said

219
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:02,813
Qingshan's construction

220
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:04,613
was the biggest project

221
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:05,933
handled by her son.

222
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,173
So, she

223
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:09,333
sold her own house in Wusu

224
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,133
as well

225
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,213
and moved to Qingshan Nursing Home.

226
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:15,373
Maybe this

227
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,293
is another kind of companion.

228
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:19,333
Mr. Xiao,

229
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:20,333
the case that you asked me
to investigate.

230
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,133
Jia Wen was driving after getting drunk.

231
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:24,333
His car went out of the highway

232
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:25,533
and exploded.

233
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:28,413
Was there any CCTV footage?

234
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,693
That part of the road
was being repaired.

235
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:32,093
No CCTV was installed.

236
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:36,973
Got it.

237
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:05,373
Shangqi,

238
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:06,933
please believe me that

239
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:07,973
I really didn't know

240
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,333
that it was a trap set by Zhao Mingxuan.

241
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:10,413
Sop blaming yourself.

242
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:12,653
Meng,

243
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:13,773
prepare some food

244
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:14,373
for Miss He.

245
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:15,413
Okay, right away.

246
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:30,653
Thank you.

247
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:32,333
Thank you.

248
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,133
I met Jia Wen once

249
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,333
in Deju.

250
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:42,493
It was the newbie training.

251
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:43,533
He and I was in the same group,

252
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:44,173
but we didn't

253
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,053
contact each other after that.

254
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:45,893
I remember

255
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,053
he's a careful person.

256
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,853
Why would he drive after drinking?

257
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:51,293
I remember Mr. Sun said that

258
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:53,493
he was doing well in Hupu

259
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:54,693
and was earning a lot of money.

260
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:56,453
Promotion in Deju

261
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,413
comes with raise cap.

262
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,253
He won't become rich suddenly.

263
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:03,453
Zhao Mingxuan cutting corners

264
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:04,613
was just the surface.

265
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,573
He did it for money.

266
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,253
How did he use the illegal money

267
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:10,213
legally?

268
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,853
As Deju and Zhao Mingxuan's

269
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,133
closest CFO,

270
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,373
he knew everything.

271
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:18,253
I think

272
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:20,413
the car crash was not an accident,

273
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:22,173
but man-made.

274
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,133
What else can we check

275
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:26,173
in Hupu?

276
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,333
It's best if we could
find his belonging,

277
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,053
but his house was sold

278
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:31,573
and burned.

279
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:34,613
Now, whenever Madam Wang

280
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:35,773
mentions her son,

281
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:36,693
she'd get agitated.

282
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,013
It's hard for us

283
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:38,893
to ask her about anything.

284
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,013
Didn't Madam Wang say

285
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,133
you look like her son?

286
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:45,253
She mentioned a few times.

287
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,373
Well, I think so, too.

288
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:48,573
Your body shape and height

289
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:49,573
are similar to his.

290
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,453
If you force her to remember

291
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,653
the painful incidents,

292
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,493
of course she'd be agitated.

293
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,373
But what if you act as her son

294
00:15:58,853 --> 00:15:59,533
and recall

295
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,213
Jia Wen's details with her?

296
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,300
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

297
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:19,973
Are you waiting for Shangqi?

298
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:30,933
Anything?

299
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,653
Thank you for taking me in yesterday.

300
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,173
You're welcome.

301
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:40,653
Xiaoran,

302
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:44,533
can we still be friends?

303
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:49,653
All these years,

304
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,373
have you ever taken me

305
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:52,533
as your friend?

306
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:58,253
Would you believe me

307
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:00,053
if I say yes?

308
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:04,293
It's just that my definition for friends

309
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,653
is not as simple as yours.

310
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,573
Before I left the family,

311
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,013
I used you all

312
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,733
to protect and support myself.

313
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:14,212
In my original plan,

314
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:15,973
I was supposed to step on you two

315
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,573
to get happiness.

316
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:19,973
But now, I realised that

317
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:21,452
I was wrong.

318
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:24,692
Taking every step carefully

319
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,653
and taking life as mathematics

320
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:28,613
will not make me happy.

321
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:30,093
I don't want to

322
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:31,413
live like that anymore.

323
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:33,773
Xiaoran,

324
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:35,333
I apologise to you

325
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:37,853
for all that I've done before.

326
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:39,453
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:52,093
But what I said the other day

328
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:52,933
was from the bottom of my heart.

329
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:54,493
Look at me.

330
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:55,573
I really hope

331
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,093
you two can be happy.

332
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:09,693
Fei'er.

333
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:14,333
Your new hairstyle looks good.

334
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,133
Taiyang said the scar looks cool.

335
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:23,493
It looks like a hero in

336
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:24,533
the animation.

337
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:26,493
After hearing that,

338
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:27,773
I suddenly thought that

339
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,333
it doesn't look that bad.

340
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:31,213
I don't have to hide it all the time.

341
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:58,893
What were you talking about?

342
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:00,453
Nothing.

343
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:21,253
You're not sleeping yet.

344
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:24,613
You're back.

345
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:34,173
What are you doing?

346
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,613
What's this?

347
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:39,933
The songs that I wrote in the past.

348
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:41,813
I think if

349
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,493
the 15-year-old me knows that

350
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:44,573
the melody

351
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,293
and the feelings

352
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:47,373
she simply wrote down

353
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,613
can be composed as a song

354
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:50,853
10 years later,

355
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:53,493
I'd be so happy that
I can't fall asleep.

356
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:00,333
Did Xiao Shangqi

357
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:01,413
get a

358
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:02,693
huge blow?

359
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:05,693
He's better than what I imagined.

360
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,133
He has also found new clues.

361
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:10,493
But we don't know what

362
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:11,373
to do next.

363
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,093
What about the Princess of Yunduan?

364
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:19,933
She's back in Jifeng.

365
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,333
I think she has changed after

366
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:24,773
experiencing so much.

367
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,813
A good change.

368
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,093
Most of my songs here

369
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,573
were written

370
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,213
when I wasn't feeling good.

371
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:39,053
But after so many years, I realised

372
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:41,293
the melody of these songs

373
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:42,333
is the best.

374
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,013
Sometimes, hardship

375
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:45,693
could be a kind of blessing.

376
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:16,533
The scent is nice.

377
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,613
Does it really help us to sleep better?

378
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,093
The ingredients can help
one to sleep better,

379
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,573
but each person is different,

380
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:24,093
it might not work on everyone.

381
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,213
If you want to sell it,

382
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:26,613
sell it as normal fragrance.

383
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:27,933
I'll get a bottle then.

384
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:29,453
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:30,493
Mr. Sui

386
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,013
is very honest.

387
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:33,573
He is.

388
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:34,773
Well,

389
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,653
we'll buy a little first

390
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:38,533
and sell it in our store.

391
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:39,933
Great.

392
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,093
Thank you.

393
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:45,693
No way, Mr. Sui.

394
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:46,613
I didn't know your

395
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:47,573
straightforwardness

396
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,373
works wonder.

397
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,533
I need to learn from you

398
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,613
and change my style.

399
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:54,653
This is nothing.

400
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:56,493
There's a creative brand

401
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:57,413
in Maocheng.

402
00:21:57,613 --> 00:21:59,453
They want to do a crossover fragrance.

403
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:01,213
We'll fly over there to take a look.

404
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:02,373
Okay, I'll do as you say.

405
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,053
Let's go.

406
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:04,173
Let's go.

407
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:09,293
Tang Yan?

408
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:10,653
Looking forward to working with you.

409
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:11,453
I'll get back to work.

410
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:16,813
Mr. Sui.

411
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:17,853
Mr. Sui.

412
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:33,133
Where's he?

413
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,453
Li Hui.

414
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:41,813
Quickly show me

415
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:42,653
the contract.

416
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:43,613
I'll get my legal department

417
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:44,253
to check it for you.

418
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:45,213
Sui.

419
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,133
You're usually

420
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,493
a carefree person.

421
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:48,093
Why are you so concerned

422
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:49,293
about my matters?

423
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:51,173
It's like I've always been cheated.

424
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,493
I need to meet the composer.
I have no time for you.

425
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,213
Listen.

426
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:55,813
I saw the producer

427
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,053
was with Tang Yan.

428
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:01,973
The music industry is small.

429
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,893
It's normal that he knows Tang Yan.

430
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,013
It's not normal, Li Hui.

431
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:09,413
Are you crazy about getting famous?

432
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:11,053
So happens someone wants to sign you.

433
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,579
So happens he knows Tang Yan.

434
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:13,653
Is the music industry

435
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:14,653
that small?

436
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:16,733
Sui Mingwei,

437
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,533
do you think that

438
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,053
it's not possible that

439
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,853
someone thinks my music is good?

440
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,173
Are you deaf? Is that what I meant?

441
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:27,413
What do you mean then?

442
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:30,653
I don't doubt

443
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:31,773
your talent in music.

444
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,413
If working in this industry

445
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,093
is easy,

446
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:35,773
you don't have to

447
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,933
work in the restaurant.

448
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,013
Didn't I tell

449
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:42,853
you already?

450
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:45,253
This record label

451
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:46,533
has never done any

452
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:47,573
good music.

453
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:48,573
It's terrible.

454
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:49,453
No, it's awful.

455
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,253
You should just sing at

456
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:51,093
Hao's restaurant.

457
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:52,173
Thank you.

458
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:54,053
Good advice won't sound nice to hear.

459
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:54,973
Do you know what it means?

460
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:56,853
You've just signed a contract

461
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,293
and you can't differentiate
good from bad?

462
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:02,253
Li Hui, I'm going out
for a business trip soon.

463
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:03,333
Li Hui.

464
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:25,013
Hello, Mutou.

465
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:27,293
Help me check on a person.

466
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,890
(Museum of Pastel Art)

467
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:33,973
Eat more.

468
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:34,813
You're so thin.

469
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:36,373
Come on.

470
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:37,293
Let's celebrate that Hui

471
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:38,653
has composed all her songs.

472
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:40,453
We wish Hui to be famous.

473
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,173
Cheers!

474
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:46,733
Hui,

475
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:48,173
if you've written any nice songs,

476
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:49,053
you must give it to us

477
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:49,853
at once.

478
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:51,093
Yes, Hui.

479
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:52,573
Let me think about it.

480
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,213
Jie,

481
00:24:57,853 --> 00:24:59,173
do you know Tang Yan?

482
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:00,813
Yes.

483
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:02,293
I knew him long ago.

484
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,453
He's been looking for me for a job.

485
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:05,733
I didn't bother him.

486
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:07,693
Really?

487
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,773
I need to use the washroom.

488
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:10,973
Okay.

489
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:14,693
Hui, let's drink.

490
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:15,853
Cheers.

491
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:19,853
Keep it up.

492
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:20,653
Keep it up.

493
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:21,733
Coming.

494
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:23,693
Eat more.

495
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:25,173
Cheers.

496
00:25:25,453 --> 00:25:27,213
Cheers.

497
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,053
Tang Yan's call.

498
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:46,773
I guess he's asking for a job again.

499
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:47,613
No need to bother him.

500
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,093
Call him back.

501
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,333
What if he has something urgent?

502
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:52,333
Okay, I'll do that.

503
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,093
You two are not bad.

504
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,253
You know it's him based on the numbers.

505
00:25:58,373 --> 00:25:59,293
I know you two were dating before.

506
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,493
Don't worry.

507
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,093
I'll not show him any mercy.

508
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:10,853
Hello, Tang Yan?

509
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,693
How many times have I told you?

510
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:13,413
Stop looking for me.

511
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:14,493
I don't have a job for you.

512
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:15,613
Stop disturbing me!

513
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:16,533
Stop pretending here.

514
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,013
Who are you?

515
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:17,493
It's none of your business.

516
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,933
- What are you doing here?
- Go away.

517
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,213
You've collaborated

518
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,133
with Tang Yan three years back.

519
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:22,253
I've checked your background.

520
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:23,613
You're owing others a lot of money.

521
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:24,453
Did you lie to her?

522
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:26,973
No.

523
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:28,573
I...

524
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,093
I...

525
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:32,773
Yes, I owe others money.

526
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:33,773
But, it's also true

527
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:34,853
that I value Li Hui's talent.

528
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:35,813
I...

529
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,133
If Li Hui becomes popular,

530
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:37,853
my company

531
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,773
will become successful.

532
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:40,293
It's killing two birds with one stone.

533
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:41,293
Stop framing me.

534
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,373
Stop your nonsense!

535
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:44,173
Sui Mingwei, what are you doing?

536
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:45,693
Are you

537
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:46,933
too free?

538
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:48,773
Stay out of my business.

539
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:50,733
Stay out of my business!

540
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:52,133
Go now.

541
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:56,613
Be at wherever you want.

542
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:01,573
Fine.

543
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:25,533
Jie.

544
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,213
I'm sorry about what happened.

545
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:29,733
Are you okay?

546
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,013
I'm okay.

547
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:32,413
He doesn't know what's going on.

548
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:33,293
Have a seat.

549
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:38,573
Huihui,

550
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:40,573
I care more about your feelings.

551
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:42,053
I think if we want to collaborate,

552
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:43,773
we need to trust each other.

553
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:44,893
If you don't trust me,

554
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:45,813
we can't make

555
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:46,773
good music.

556
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:50,573
Let's not talk about this.

557
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,133
Your first EP

558
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:54,213
has been published

559
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:55,013
on QQ Music.

560
00:27:58,013 --> 00:27:59,533
I got a phonograph record
engraved for you

561
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:01,013
as a memory.

562
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,880
(Hui, Forever Love)

563
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,373
Do you like it?

564
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:17,053
Yes.

565
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,093
Well,

566
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:20,133
I remember you said

567
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:20,933
you wrote a few songs

568
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:21,933
in university.

569
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:23,373
Ke and the rest are interested.

570
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:24,213
Why not you talk to them

571
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:25,813
and try out the retro style?

572
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:26,853
Sure,

573
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:29,893
but I have never tried that.

574
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,373
If I don't do it well...

575
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,333
No problem.

576
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:33,453
As long as you pay attention to it,

577
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,053
you can handle all kinds of style.

578
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,870
♪Finally got it, it's you♪

579
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,053
She really did it.

580
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:45,813
I think we

581
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,253
can try online selling.

582
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,293
The KOL

583
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,133
that I'm in touch with

584
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:49,733
is willing to

585
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:50,493
try it out for us.

586
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:52,293
Mr. Sui,

587
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:53,053
how's the search with

588
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,013
the offline counter?

589
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:55,413
Stop your work.

590
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:56,413
Take out your phones

591
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:58,133
and open up QQ Music.

592
00:28:58,453 --> 00:28:59,373
(Hui)
Play this song.

593
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:00,693
Listen and save it.

594
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:01,773
Go now.

595
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:03,013
Ask all your friends

596
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:04,093
to listen to it.

597
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:06,373
Who is this singer?

598
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:07,573
She's quite famous.

599
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,373
Hui published her EP.

600
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:10,573
Mr. Sui's childhood friend.

601
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:11,693
Hello, Ergou.

602
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,293
Hui's published her new EP.

603
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:14,573
Get everyone

604
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:15,653
to listen to it.

605
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:17,893
Then...

606
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:19,053
This one.

607
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:21,093
Change the background song in your shop

608
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,453
to this song.

609
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:23,893
You're great.

610
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:24,613
Okay.

611
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,413
They're investigating Jia Wen's case?

612
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,573
They just won't give up.

613
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,133
I'm not drinking.

614
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,013
I drove today.

615
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:48,093
Mr. Zhao,

616
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,373
I came here today to...

617
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,133
Driving is not an excuse.

618
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,213
I'll get Li

619
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:53,973
to send you home.

620
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:07,373
Wen,

621
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,493
I've thought a lot

622
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:11,813
about this matter.

623
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:14,533
You've done so much

624
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:16,013
for this matter.

625
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:18,133
I think

626
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,333
I want to pay you more.

627
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:21,973
Mr. Zhao,

628
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,213
I didn't come here to ask for money.

629
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:25,613
I can even pay you back

630
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,533
all the money I've taken.

631
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,053
I really don't want to

632
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:30,253
do this anymore.

633
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:32,213
Cutting corners.

634
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:33,333
What should I do

635
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,213
if someone died?

636
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:41,973
Wen.

637
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:44,253
Mr. Zhao,

638
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,493
I've made up my mind.

639
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:47,693
I want to resign.

640
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,773
You can't decide that yourself.

641
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,213
This matter is that simple.

642
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,493
I'll pay the price for my mistake

643
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:57,973
and my greed.

644
00:30:58,293 --> 00:30:59,053
How do you do that?

645
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:02,053
Put me in trouble with you?

646
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:02,733
No.

647
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,293
Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

648
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,173
I promise

649
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:06,213
I'll tell no one.

650
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:07,173
I'll give you back

651
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:08,333
- all my money.
- Wen.

652
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,133
Your kindness

653
00:31:10,773 --> 00:31:11,813
is your strength

654
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,133
as well as your weakness.

655
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:15,213
I understand

656
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:16,293
what you were saying,

657
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:17,973
but I need to think about

658
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:19,133
how to arrange this.

659
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:20,653
Enough.

660
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:21,933
Go back first.

661
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:23,053
Mr. Zhao.

662
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:24,253
Li.

663
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:25,813
Send him back.

664
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:26,693
Okay.

665
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:27,813
Please.

666
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,093
We handled it well

667
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,213
and cleaned things up.

668
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:04,573
Jia Wen didn't leave anything behind.

669
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:06,453
I remember

670
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,253
his mother is still alive.

671
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:11,253
Where's she now?

672
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,253
I'm not sure.

673
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:15,053
Look for the old lady.

674
00:32:15,573 --> 00:32:16,213
Make it quick.

675
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:17,333
Okay.

676
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:29,813
Be careful.

677
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,213
Madam Wang, look.

678
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,453
Wen and Xiaomei

679
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:36,613
are here for you.

680
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:38,933
Wen, are you busy?

681
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,613
Did you eat well?

682
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:43,493
I'm taking you out for a walk.

683
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:45,413
Okay.

684
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:46,813
What do you want to eat?

685
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,093
Anything is okay.

686
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:48,813
Madam Wang,

687
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,093
where are you going?

688
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,853
My son is taking me out.

689
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:54,253
Well, you're blessed.

690
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:55,333
Go ahead.

691
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:57,253
Come on.

692
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:58,613
Be careful.

693
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:04,053
Okay.

694
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:04,773
I'm closing the door.

695
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:06,573
Mr. Sun, we're leaving now.

696
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,653
Come and eat.

697
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:20,453
Come.

698
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:21,373
Here, Xiaomei.

699
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:23,453
This is coarse grains,

700
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:24,333
fruit corn.

701
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,173
It suits a lady like you.

702
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:26,813
Thank you, Madam Wang.

703
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:27,693
Wen,

704
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:28,573
you should eat, too.

705
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:31,173
You two always come home

706
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:32,093
every week,

707
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:33,453
but

708
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,613
why do I feel like
I haven't seen you for a while?

709
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,933
I'm so happy today.

710
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:43,733
What are you thinking?

711
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:46,613
Nothing.

712
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:47,653
Eat now.

713
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:48,853
I'm thinking that

714
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:51,373
my mother should be treating her

715
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:52,973
daughter-in-law like this, too.

716
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:55,053
What are you talking about?

717
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,093
Xiaomei is my daughter-in-law.

718
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,293
Right, Xiaomei?

719
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:03,973
Why did your hairstyle change?

720
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:14,933
You young people

721
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,732
like to change your hairstyle.

722
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,653
But it looks great.

723
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:21,453
Right, Wen?

724
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:25,133
Wen,

725
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,173
how's your work lately?

726
00:34:27,853 --> 00:34:28,933
Let me tell you.

727
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:30,933
When you're dealing with money,

728
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:33,893
you need to be extra careful.

729
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:36,413
Did I tell you about

730
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:37,413
what issue

731
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:38,732
I've been facing at work?

732
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:40,453
Look.

733
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:42,573
You're facing an issue.

734
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:44,732
I can tell you've been

735
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,252
spending a lot of money.

736
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,413
Tell me honestly.

737
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:48,252
Did you use the money

738
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:49,573
that you're not supposed to be using?

739
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:50,653
No.

740
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:52,613
Have you heard of

741
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,693
a person named Zhao Mingxuan?

742
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:03,133
Are you okay?

743
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:03,973
What's going on, Madam Wang?

744
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:04,933
Are you not feeling well?

745
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:06,293
I'm having headache.

746
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:08,613
Maybe I'm a bit tired.

747
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:09,773
I'm okay.

748
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:11,093
Who are you talking about?

749
00:35:11,293 --> 00:35:12,773
Is that someone from your company?

750
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:17,453
Come here.

751
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:21,253
Drink some water.

752
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,333
If we keep forcing Madam Wang

753
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:34,573
to recall the past,

754
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,133
isn't it considered as

755
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,253
harming her?

756
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:39,573
I thought if

757
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:41,293
we could get

758
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:42,213
some clues,

759
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:44,253
we could help Madam Wang

760
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:46,133
to know the truth of Wen's death.

761
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:47,973
Even if we can't get anything,

762
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:50,253
we're keeping her company

763
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:52,853
like making a dream with her.

764
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:56,213
She will wake up from the dream one day.

765
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:57,933
How long can we pretend like this?

766
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:01,573
You're right.

767
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,253
If we continue digging,

768
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:15,893
we'd touch the painful memory

769
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:17,013
that she doesn't

770
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:17,773
want to remember.

771
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:19,973
Maybe forgetting this

772
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:20,973
is her self-protection.

773
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:23,493
No matter it's for me

774
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:25,053
or for the truth,

775
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:26,893
we shouldn't

776
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:28,213
hurt an innocent person.

777
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:31,173
Then...

778
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:32,213
No worries.

779
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,333
I'll think of another way.

780
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:37,093
Let's go.

781
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:42,933
Where am I now?

782
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,253
Who are you?

783
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:48,853
Why am I here?

784
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:50,813
Madam Wang, what's wrong?

785
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,173
You're not Xiaomei!

786
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:53,133
Madam Wang.

787
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,613
You're not Wen either!

788
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,613
Why am I here?

789
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:57,493
You...

790
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,093
Madam Wang, don't be scared.

791
00:36:59,293 --> 00:36:59,893
Calm down.

792
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:00,773
We're not bad people.

793
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:02,053
Why am I here?

794
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:03,333
Let's go back first.

795
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:04,773
You...

796
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:05,373
Don't be scared.

797
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,570
(Lizhen Nursing Home)

798
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:07,853
(Lizhen Nursing Home)
My son, Wen,

799
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:10,213
will never come back anymore.

800
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,893
Wen.

801
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:15,173
Madam Wang.

802
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:16,653
Wen.

803
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,453
They did it for your son's sake.

804
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:21,053
They suspect that the car accident
was not that simple.

805
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,493
Are you saying that

806
00:37:31,493 --> 00:37:32,853
my son was

807
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:33,853
killed.

808
00:37:34,973 --> 00:37:35,653
Madam Wang.

809
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:39,813
I suspected so

810
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,173
because my father

811
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:44,973
was facing the same situation.

812
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:51,733
Madam Wang.

813
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:52,493
Miss!

814
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,533
Miss!

815
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:54,173
Madam Wang.

816
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:56,173
Madam Wang, what's wrong?

817
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:57,693
Madam Wang.

818
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:01,293
Please go out first.

819
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,173
Madam Wang.

820
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,213
Are you having a headache?

821
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:13,053
I hope Madam Wang is fine.

822
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:14,973
Why did it turn out to be like this?

823
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:16,213
I'll spend some time

824
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:17,853
to visit her more.

825
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:21,293
Then...

826
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:22,013
Hold on.

827
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,173
Madam Wang asked you two
to come back in.

828
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:47,733
I've suspected about

829
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:50,053
my son's car accident as well.

830
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:51,813
He didn't really drink.

831
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,413
How would he be driving after drinking?

832
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:58,333
I remember something now.

833
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:00,253
On the day that he met the car accident,

834
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,413
he gave this to me.

835
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:06,733
He came home and asked me that day

836
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:08,093
about how he'll resign

837
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:09,853
and bring Xiaomei back to Wusu

838
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:12,213
and find a new job.

839
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:13,653
I was quite happy.

840
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:14,733
Mother.

841
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:18,933
Here you go.

842
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:19,813
What's this?

843
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,373
Open it and see.

844
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:26,653
Why did you buy this?

845
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:28,773
Wen.

846
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:30,013
Listen.

847
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:31,613
No matter where you're working,

848
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:32,413
as long as it's related

849
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:33,413
to money,

850
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:35,013
you must guard yourself.

851
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:36,853
Start from not spending money simply.

852
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:39,973
Mother.

853
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:41,333
Let me put it on for you.

854
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:42,413
This is

855
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,373
not expensive.

856
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:47,693
I'll wear it when I go home.

857
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,053
Let me put it on for you now.

858
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:50,453
Now?

859
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:52,053
Look at you.

860
00:39:58,093 --> 00:39:58,853
Look.

861
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:01,973
It matches your style.

862
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,213
It looks good.

863
00:40:05,093 --> 00:40:06,093
Don't simply spend money anymore.

864
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:06,853
Okay.

865
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:07,533
I won't spend money anymore.

866
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,053
Mother, I'll pick up a call.

867
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:17,293
Hello.

868
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:19,773
Did you receive

869
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:20,573
my message?

870
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:22,653
Tonight.

871
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:26,613
No problem.

872
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:32,053
Mother,

873
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:33,293
I need to go back to Hupu.

874
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:34,293
There's something to do in the company.

875
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:35,533
You're in such a hurry?

876
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,573
Eat something first.

877
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:37,373
I'll be late.

878
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:38,533
I'm not eating.

879
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:42,133
Drive carefully.

880
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,013
No worries.

881
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:47,613
Drive carefully.

882
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:57,053
This is the gift that he gave you

883
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:58,493
on the day he met the accident?

884
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:01,533
He put it on for me.

885
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:04,453
I've been wearing it

886
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:07,493
in memory of him.

887
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:12,293
Other things

888
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:13,973
have been burned

889
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:15,493
in that fire.

890
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:18,253
This is the last thing he had.

891
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:20,293
If you think it's useful,

892
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:21,693
take it.

893
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,373
Madam Wang.

894
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,573
Thank you for trusting us.

895
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:37,253
I'll get to the bottom

896
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,093
of the matter.

897
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:40,653
For the sake of Wen,

898
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:42,333
you

899
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:45,413
and my father.

900
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:55,053
What clue can we get from this?

901
00:41:58,413 --> 00:41:59,973
Can you lie with me one more time?

902
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:01,453
Again?

903
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,493
Maybe we can't find
any useful information

904
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,693
through this necklace,

905
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:10,453
but when the truth has come to light,

906
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:12,253
we'll tell Madam Wang

907
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,533
that this necklace has helped us.

908
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:26,133
This is not working.

909
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:27,293
I wonder when we can

910
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:28,413
find any clue.

911
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:34,373
Xiaoran.

912
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:37,533
Thank you for helping me

913
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:38,893
and keeping me company.

914
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:40,013
I'm not.

915
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:44,613
I've been meaning to tell you

916
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:46,373
I did all these

917
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:47,373
because

918
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:48,333
I want the wicked Zhao Mingxuan

919
00:42:48,453 --> 00:42:49,573
to be arrested,

920
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:50,493
and that's all.

921
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:00,733
What do you plan to do next?

922
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:03,013
Let me send you home first.
