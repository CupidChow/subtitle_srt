Mo.

18
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,457
Did you see my Moment?

19
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,657
Let me check now.

20
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:49,457
You're talking about this?

21
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:50,457
I saw it in the morning.

22
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:52,617
Why didn't you click like?

23
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,777
Are you collecting likes now?

24
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:00,777
You have to tell me.

25
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:01,897
Otherwise, we won't know.

26
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:03,497
What collecting likes?

27
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:09,217
He posted another one.

28
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:11,577
He's even collecting likes.

29
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,377
He Xiaoran.

30
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,337
Throat lozenge?

31
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,177
It will heal you.

32
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,817
This brand is rare.

33
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:27,297
This is nothing.

34
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:28,417
I haven't had any

35
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,057
hardships in my life.

36
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:31,777
Except for...

37
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:33,857
Help me take a look.

38
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,017
They asked me to edit it,

39
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,257
but I think it's not bad.

40
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:38,977
Drink some water first.

41
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:40,857
Look.

42
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:42,617
I think it's good now.

43
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:51,257
(Waiting period after your confession.)

44
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:52,057
(You can trace)

45
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:53,017
(your conversation with her,)

46
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,017
(what you did together,)

47
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:54,977
(or some special moments)

48
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:56,337
(between you two)

49
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,657
(to remind her of how much
she admires you.)

50
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,137
Mr. Meng just told me

51
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:02,377
the red swamp crayfish is
about to be marketed.

52
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,177
They asked if we want to add them

53
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:04,337
on our restaurant's seasonal menu

54
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,457
as a main dish.

55
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,337
This is a lot.

56
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,017
Sui, I'll go ahead and eat now.

57
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:22,617
It's tasteless.

58
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:24,297
No seasoning?

59
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:25,657
I asked for it.

60
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:27,057
Why do you want it so salty?

61
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:28,257
From today onwards,

62
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:29,857
we'll go less on salt and less on oil.

63
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:31,377
Xiaoran's throat is not well today.

64
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:32,577
Let's eat something plain.

65
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,057
Just eat like this.

66
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:55,097
Hello, Mo.

67
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:58,577
Panulirus?

68
00:03:58,897 --> 00:03:59,497
Yes.

69
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:00,337
Jifeng has prepared

70
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:01,017
the food tasting

71
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,177
for your show.

72
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,337
I came here to deliver this.

73
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:04,537
I don't want.

74
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,177
Ridiculous.

75
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,457
What happened?

76
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:13,577
I don't know what he wants.

77
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:15,137
Didn't I make myself clear?

78
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:16,337
Why did he give me Panulirus?

79
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:17,777
Is he trying to tease me?

80
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:22,417
Mr. Xiao,

81
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:24,537
Miss He insisted that she won't take it.

82
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,057
She even sounded a bit upset.

83
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:28,897
I think it's too spicy

84
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:29,617
for her.

85
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,817
Her throat is inflamed

86
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,377
and she's not feeling well.

87
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,377
Got it.

88
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:36,297
Okay.

89
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:47,297
(You have to do)

90
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:48,257
(something unexpected)

91
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,097
(to be in front of her)

92
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,377
(to break her daily routine,)

93
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:53,937
(surprise her and make her heart beat.)

94
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:55,697
(When she thinks of
your confession again,)

95
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:57,057
(she'll be moved.)

96
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:58,777
Are you looking for me?

97
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:00,777
Come on.

98
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:02,177
Let's talk about the plan
for the program.

99
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:03,817
Did I hear you wrongly?

100
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:06,417
If you don't know,

101
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:07,417
I'll talk to someone

102
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:08,577
who knows.

103
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,217
What?

104
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:12,817
Xiaoran, good that you're here.

105
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:13,857
Mr. Xiao is asking me

106
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:15,377
about the development of the program.

107
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:15,937
Tell me about it

108
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:16,937
and I'll pass the information to him.

109
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,977
You can ask Mr. He about the content.

110
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,297
Let's go.

111
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:22,817
What's wrong with your throat?

112
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:39,377
If you don't want to

113
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:40,497
hear any more rumors,

114
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:42,017
stop sending me red swamp crayfish.

115
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:43,257
Draw a clear line

116
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:44,937
to stop the rumors.

117
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:46,257
Please walk away from me

118
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,177
when you see me next time.

119
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,217
This is your answer?

120
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:50,617
Didn't I make myself

121
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,817
clear last night?

122
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,497
Let me repeat.

123
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,217
What you've done has crossed the line.

124
00:05:59,137 --> 00:05:59,937
Did you take your medicine?

125
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:01,337
You're sick.

126
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,537
(It's not working?)

127
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:14,937
(Try this last resort.)

128
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:16,617
(You didn't manage to pursue her
after so long.)

129
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,497
(You should just disappear.)

130
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:19,897
(Disappear)

131
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:21,457
(to make her realise)

132
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:22,937
(the importance of your presence.)

133
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,417
(It seems like you're taking
a step back, but you're progressing.)

134
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:29,417
Xiaoran,

135
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:31,457
it's given to me by the guard.

136
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:32,617
A gift from the fan.

137
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:39,457
(Miss He, you're having a sore throat.
This is for you. Speedy recovery.)

138
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,897
Such a heart-warming fan.

139
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:42,537
Could it be Mr. Xiao?

140
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,977
He's more straightforward than this.

141
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,831
(Miss He, you're having a sore throat.
This is for you. Speedy recovery.)

142
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:57,737
You cooked the meal

143
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,137
and now you're brewing the tea.

144
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:03,017
I think you don't want to
be the general manager.

145
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,257
You want to take

146
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:04,977
my position.

147
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,497
I dare not.

148
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,097
Mr. Meng,

149
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:10,417
do you think this formula will work?

150
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:12,537
I'm sure it works,

151
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:16,337
but she has to drink it.

152
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,417
You went anonymous,

153
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:21,497
but the drink has got no label,

154
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,017
would you dare drink it if it was you?

155
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:27,937
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

156
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:29,657
Give me your phone.

157
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:31,937
Why?

158
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:33,657
Register an account on WeChat.

159
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:34,777
I told you

160
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,177
I don't use that.

161
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,657

you might not dare drink)

(the tea from a stranger,)

168

(Midnight Diner)
(Is your throat getting better?)

174
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,377
(Your voice was a little husky)

175
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:52,417
(on the program.)

176
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:53,617
(Rest more.)

177
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:25,928
(Only three days of Moment are shown.)

178
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:50,337
Lately, you've been standing here

179
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:51,057
at this hour.

180
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:52,497
What are you looking at?

181
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:56,417
It's about done, right?

182
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,897
I've put the documents on your desk.

183
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:12,537
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Are you free?)

184
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,577
What are you waiting for?

185
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:07,537
A bus.

186
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:12,497
Why not we make a bet?

187
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,297
Bet on what?

188
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:17,377
Let's see if the bus 7202

189
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,417
will be here within a minute or not.

190
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:20,777
If it comes,

191
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,337
bid farewell to your past

192
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:23,297
and go home.

193
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:24,217
If it doesn't come,

194
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,217
walk across the street to Jifeng

195
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:28,377
and tell him you're in love
with him again,

196
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:29,577
and look at his response.

197
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:33,897
How did you know?

198
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,097
Will you bet?

199
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:39,777
You can just laugh it off.

200
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:42,777
The bet is huge to me.

201
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:44,737
If the bus comes,

202
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:46,137
I'll leave my motorcycle here

203
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,937
and go home with you by bus.

204
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,177
I'll count one minute for you.

205
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:02,857
Please be safe at all times.

206
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,177
Turning right.

207
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:07,497
Please be safe at all times.

208
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:10,777
Turning right.

209
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,417
Please be safe at all times.

210
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:14,817
Turning left.

211
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:16,817
Please be safe at all times.

212
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:34,617
122?

213
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:49,927
(Tow: 0106-3281655)

214
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:03,897
Confession?

215
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,097
My confession plan

216
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,017
is all ready.

217
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:07,737
My friends will be helping.

218
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:08,777
You just play and sing a love song

219
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:10,537
to enlighten the atmosphere.

220
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:11,737
No way.

221
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:14,977
You're terrible.

222
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,937
Is it hard to sing a song?

223
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:19,377
Did something hit you?

224
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:24,537
He Xiaoran,

225
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:26,697
I love you!

226
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:32,537
What did you say?

227
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:38,377
Who said confession is a white flag?

228
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,737
The one who confesses first
is the loser?

229
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:43,217
I was young and ignorant.

230
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,617
There's no winner or loser in love.

231
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,537
True love means give it all.

232
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:51,297
Okay.

233
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:53,897
I take it as yours is true love,

234
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:55,577
but I'm sure

235
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:56,657
He Xiaoran is not going to use

236
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:57,537
a new relationship

237
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,377
to forget another relationship.

238
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:00,697
So, before she's totally

239
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:01,937
let go,

240
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:03,697
she'll never agree to be with you,

241
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:04,697
do you understand?

242
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:08,137
When did you become

243
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,417
so discouraging?

244
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,097
Only idiots will help you now.

245
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,537
I won't stop you to confess to her.

246
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:15,297
I just don't want to

247
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:16,337
be in this mess.

248
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:18,337
Li Hui.

249
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:19,257
Li Hui.

250
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,617
If you don't help me,

251
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,297
just wait.

252
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:22,817
I'll be waiting.

253
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,977
I'm done drawing. This is my father.

254
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,057
So ugly.

255
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:41,217
What are you drawing?

256
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,777
An egg with a face.

257
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,697
Do you like to eat eggs?

258
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:48,937
What do you know?

259
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,377
This is arts.

260
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,097
You're really weird.

261
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:53,577
Don't we all like to draw

262
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:55,417
something that we like?

263
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:56,857
I love my father

264
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:58,897
and Uncle Mo the most.

265
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:01,817
You're a boy.

266
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:03,977
You always talk about love.

267
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:04,977
Don't you feel shy?

268
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,097
My father told me
that love is nothing bad.

269
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,217
If we hold it in,

270
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,297
we'll feel sick.

271
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:14,297
Teacher told me
the most important thing is heart.

272
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:20,777
The most important thing is heart.

273
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:24,257
Yes.

274
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,777
Since the most important thing
is heart,

275
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:28,177
why do we

276
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:28,817
need so many skills

277
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:29,817
for the circuitous tactic?

278
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,497
Mr. Xiao,

279
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:35,337
I've done what you asked me to do.

280
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:35,817
Look.

281
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:36,857
You're here in time.

282
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:37,537
Help me take care of him.

283
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:38,497
I need to go out.

284
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:39,457
Okay.

285
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:47,617
Where are you?

286
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,017
I'm at the creative market.

287
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:50,217
Anything?

288
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:51,577
Yes.

289
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,017
Something important.

290
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:56,177
Who is it?

291
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:58,857
Xiaoran.

292
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,297
I heard that there's a drone performance

293
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,457
at night here.

294
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:02,537
Since you're here,

295
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,017
let's watch together.

296
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:05,737
Here.

297
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:13,017
You hurt me!

298
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:15,017
You hit me actually.

299
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:16,537
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:17,777
Let's go now.

301
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:18,777
Wait.

302
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:20,217
Girl,

303
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:22,377
where did you get the balloon?

304
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:23,897
I told you not to simply take it.

305
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:25,137
It's all flown away.

306
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:26,577
It belongs to whoever gets it.

307
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:33,417
Xiaoran,

308
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:35,057
I'm going to the washroom.

309
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:36,297
Wait for me here.

310
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:48,297
Why did the children

311
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:49,737
take away my balloons?

312
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,657
Will my climax have any trouble?

313
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,377
No, let me show you the effects.

314
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:54,977
Tell you what.

315
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,057
When everyone

316
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:57,057
is watching the show,

317
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:57,977
suddenly

318
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,177
the love declaration

319
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,817
appears on your screen.

320
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:01,457
How about that?

321
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,417
Look at the effects.

322
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,977
He Xiaoran, I love you.

323
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:07,577
Isn't it romantic?

324
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:10,777
How's my motorcycle team?

325
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:11,617
The motorcycle team?

326
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,696
Here they are.

327
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,456
L and O.

328
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:18,537
Where's V?

329
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,017
Are you okay?

330
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:45,817
Are you okay?

331
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:47,497
He's here.

332
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:48,497
V is here.

333
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:56,657
Don't worry.

334
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:00,417
Take a seat here.

335
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:01,737
I'll buy you something cold

336
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:02,657
to put on it.

337
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:08,577
Are you not feeling well?

338
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:10,377
I didn't sleep well lately.

339
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,057
My head was hit, too.

340
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:13,977
I'm a bit dizzy.

341
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:16,337
Why did you go around
without sleeping well?

342
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,817
Is there anything urgent
that you looked for me?

343
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,657
That night,

344
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,617
why did you turn around and leave?

345
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,217
We were fighting.

346
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,497
It'll only get worse if I had stayed.

347
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:33,337
That's the only reason?

348
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:36,777
So, you didn't hear what I said?

349
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:37,977
What?

350
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:42,937
Xiaoran,

351
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:44,697
I...

352
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:45,857
(Here's a missing person announcement.)

353
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,377
(Here's a missing person announcement.)

354
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:48,697
(Lele,)

355
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:49,577
(please come to the entrance)

356
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:50,457
(once you hear this.)

357
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:52,057
(Your parents are waiting for you.)

358
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:53,257
(If anyone sees)

359
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,977
(a little girl with a T-shirt)

360
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:56,817
(with greyish pink image,)

361
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:58,057
(black sports pants)

362
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:58,697
(and white sports shoes,)

363
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:00,217
(please contact the management.)

364
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,617
(The parents are worried.)

365
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,377
It sounds like the little girl just now.

366
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:07,817
Let's look for her.

367
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:10,697
Wait for me.

368
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,057
Okay, I got it.

369
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:15,017
The management

370
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:15,897
wants to borrow our drone

371
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,097
to look for the missing child.

372
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:18,097
What about the performance

373
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:18,937
and the climax at night?

374
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:19,657
I don't know.

375
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:20,857
Forget about that now.

376
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:21,857
We need to find the girl.

377
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:22,497
Go now.

378
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:26,657
My friends,

379
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:27,897
find her

380
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:28,977
with your motorcycles.

381
00:19:29,217 --> 00:19:29,777
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:30,697
Be careful.

383
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:33,457
Help me out.

384
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:36,977
About 10 minutes ago,

385
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:37,977
I was at stall 18

386
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:38,857
and I met two children.

387
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:39,657
I even picked up her

388
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:40,577
children watch.

389
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:43,457
It's out of battery.

390
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:44,657
Do you have the map?

391
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:46,777
(Use the spot that)

392
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,977
(we last saw the child 10 minutes ago)

393
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:48,737
(as the starting spot.)

394
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:50,217
(An adult)

395
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,417
(can walk about 800 to 1,000 metres)

396
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:52,537
(in 10 minutes.)

397
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,057
(The child shouldn't have gone too far.)

398
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,177
(Now, it's the best time to look for her.)

399
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,697
(Here's a missing person announcement.)

400
00:19:58,897 --> 00:19:59,697
(In the creative market,)

401
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,137
(a six-year-old girl went missing.)

402
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:02,657
(All the cars nearby, please take note.)

403
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,417
This is Hubin Street.

404
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,097
Many cars are flashing double signal

405
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:08,897
to look for the girl.

406
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:10,937
(Dajiabang)
This is interesting.

407
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:13,537
Who started this?

408
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:14,417
It's now

409
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:15,577
3.41 p.m.

410
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:17,017
16 minutes ago,

411
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,137
a six-year-old girl

412
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:19,897
was separated from the parents
in the market.

413
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:20,977
The management has begun

414
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,617
to look for her immediately.

415
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,777
Police and firefighters are involved.

416
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,497
The management has also connected with

417
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:27,417
the radio station,

418
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,177
hoping that more people

419
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,297
living near Hubin Street will

420
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:31,177
take note of this matter.

421
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,457
The drone that was about

422
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:33,657
to perform tonight

423
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,497
is also used

424
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:36,137
to search for the girl from the sky.

425
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,737
Local police have come to the market

426
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:38,657
at once.

427
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:39,897
The emergency searching

428
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,057
is now going on.

429
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,217
We hope that we can find
the little girl as soon as possible

430
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:45,217
with the help of science and technology

431
00:20:45,297 --> 00:20:46,137
and people's highly efficient search

432
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,337
in the sky and on the ground.

433
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:54,377
Great.

434
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:56,577
Let's go and look for the girl.

435
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,017
Okay.

436
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:02,737
Wait.

437
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:03,697
- What's this?
- Where?

438
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:04,777
Zoom in this.

439
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:05,417
Let me see.

440
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:09,017
Zoom in more.

441
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,491
(Pusu Art)

442
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:19,377
Xiaoran.

443
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:20,937
Did you find her?

444
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:21,857
No.

445
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:26,977
Hello.

446
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:27,817
Xiaoran,

447
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:29,257
I've found the little girl.

448
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:31,417
She's at the rooftop opposite
the art museum.

449
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:34,417
I'm downstairs.

450
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:36,137
Slow down.

451
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:05,457
Lele.

452
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:07,897
Lele, what are you doing?

453
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:10,177
Are you trying to take the balloon?

454
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:11,417
Come down first.

455
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:13,017
I'll help you, okay?

456
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:17,217
Come down first,

457
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:18,097
okay?

458
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,417
Come down. Be careful.

459
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:33,457
Xiaoran!

460
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:42,737
Hang in there!

461
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:43,977
Hold tight!

462
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:45,897
Hold tight!

463
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:47,137
What's going on?

464
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:50,217
Come on.

465
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:53,337
Use your legs!

466
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,577
Hold tight, girl!

467
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:56,857
- Don't let go!
- Never let go!

468
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:57,737
Hold tight!

469
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,617
Yes, come on!

470
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:00,257
Climb up!

471
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:01,137
Come on, girl!

472
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,457
Don't ever let go!

473
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:03,657
Come on, girl!

474
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:04,617
Hang in there!

475
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,457
Climb up! Hold tight!

476
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:09,577
Keep it up!

477
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:10,937
She's up!

478
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:14,257
- Great!
- Great!

479
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,123
Are you okay?

480
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:22,603
Lele, you're fine now.

481
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:23,603
What about you?

482
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:24,603
Come here. It's okay. Don't be scared.

483
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:26,043
Don't be scared.

484
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,083
Thank you.

485
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,123
Were you frightened?

486
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:30,963
Xiaoran.

487
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:31,883
Don't cry anymore.

488
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:33,843
Actually, I wanted to tell you...

489
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:34,523
Is this how you take care
of your sister?

490
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:35,123
I'm telling you.

491
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:36,363
If she's gone,

492
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:37,443
you don't have to come back anymore!

493
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:38,923
I went to buy some water.

494
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,083
I asked her to wait for me.

495
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,883
Stop talking!

496
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:42,803
Do you know that

497
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:43,803
she's very young?

498
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:44,763
How can you leave just because

499
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,163
you're thirsty?

500
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,363
Where were you two then?

501
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:49,523
It's none of your business.

502
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:51,043
It's none of our business.

503
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:52,363
It's none of her business either.

504
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:53,643
Your eldest daughter

505
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,683
is a minor, too.

506
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:55,883
The child went missing.

507
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:57,203
It's the responsibility of the parents.

508
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,363
- Are you asking for trouble?
- I...

509
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:00,283
Let me tell you.

510
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:01,563
No child is born

511
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:02,603
in this world

512
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:03,403
to take care of another child.

513
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:06,843
They're the child's parents.

514
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:08,083
What's wrong with you?

515
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:08,923
Both of them

516
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:09,683
saved your child,

517
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:10,963
and you're arguing with them?

518
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:14,283
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:15,483
Thank you.

520
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:16,603
- Let's go.
- Come on.

521
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:17,883
Come with us

522
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:18,843
to explain the situation.

523
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:24,963
Let's go, Qi.

524
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:32,515
(Younger Xiao Shangqi)

525
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:33,483
(His leg)

526
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:35,563
(Younger Xiao Xian)
(is going to be handicapped.)

527
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:37,003
(I'm afraid)

528
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:38,523
(he needs to use crutches.)

529
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,843
Xian.

530
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:22,123
Enough, stop looking.

531
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:33,323
The love that your family
didn't give you

532
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:35,163
will be made up to you

533
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,123
in other ways.

534
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:37,723
At least

535
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:39,883
I had been protecting you for years.

536
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:48,203
Even now?

537
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:53,483
Xiaoran,

538
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,043
I love you.

539
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:02,683
Xiaoran.

540
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:19,883
Can you stop following me?

541
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:21,603
Why?

542
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:24,763
We both are

543
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:25,563
not calmed now.

544
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,763
Let's calm down on our own first.

545
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:30,403
I don't want to lose you anymore.

546
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:33,163
Xiaoran,

547
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:35,523
can we not be friends anymore?

548
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,643
Are you drunk?

549
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:39,883
I didn't drink.

550
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:40,963
Then your head was hit

551
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:41,963
just now?

552
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:42,843
I'm sober.

553
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:47,323
I just don't understand

554
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:48,403
why it's so sudden.

555
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:49,643
- Just few days back...
- Is it sudden?

556
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:52,563
I think besides you,

557
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:55,483
everyone else knows I love you.

558
00:27:14,443 --> 00:27:15,083
Xiaoran,

559
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,003
I love you.

560
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:22,963
What about you?

561
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,123
If you don't talk,

562
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,123
then I think you love me, too.

563
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:43,643
Right?

564
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:51,483
Yes.

565
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:02,843
I'm sorry.

566
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:06,203
I've used eight years

567
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:08,883
to come to you.

568
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:14,283
I won't let go this time.

569
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:45,443
Sui.

570
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:46,683
It's about time.

571
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:47,883
We should start.

572
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:52,963
Let's start.

573
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:53,883
Okay.

574
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,923
Okay, get ready. We're about to start.

575
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:57,283
Come on.

576
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,720
Someone is confessing.

577
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:15,803
Someone is confessing.

578
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,483
Is this a proposal?

579
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:18,483
It is a proposal.

580
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,003
So romantic.

581
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:21,523
It's too romantic.

582
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:24,243
Look.

583
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,440
(I want to confess to someone.)

584
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:44,923
I hope he makes it, too.

585
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:09,800
(I love you.)

586
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,080
(I love you, He Xiaoran.)

587
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,360
(I love you, He Xiaoran.)

588
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:29,723
(I love you, He Xiaoran.)
Let's go for a meal.

589
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,720
(I love you, He Xiaoran.)

590
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:57,963
Okay.

591
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,283
Okay.

592
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:00,283
Don't worry.

593
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:02,483
No problem.

594
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:03,403
Yes.

595
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:08,723
Yes.

596
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,003
He Xiaoran is our hostess.

597
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:11,203
You can contact

598
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:12,403
our advertising department.

599
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:13,683
Our platform

600
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:14,963
has gained more followers.

601
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:16,603
Xiaoran is famous now.

602
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:17,723
The entire comment section

603
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,043
is flooded with Miss Hanging.

604
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:20,083
Good morning.

605
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:21,523
Good morning.

606
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,883
Miss Hanging is here.

607
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,323
I was lucky.

608
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:26,883
That's not luck.

609
00:31:27,523 --> 00:31:29,163
Today, the station manager
asked to see you.

610
00:31:29,643 --> 00:31:30,603
He praised you for

611
00:31:30,843 --> 00:31:32,083
your performance that day.

612
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:33,763
He said not only you've saved

613
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:34,683
a child,

614
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:36,803
you've saved a family.

615
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,643
You're the positive vibe of the society.

616
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:40,883
You're the role model for the youths.

617
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:42,723
You can take the praises.

618
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:44,283
Is he going to do something practical?

619
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:45,563
Say, adjust

620
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:46,643
our airing time.

621
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,123
Speaking of being greedy,

622
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,403
you're really greedy.

623
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:50,923
There's no such thing.

624
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,323
But in a couple of days,

625
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:55,163
the station wants to do a series report.

626
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,363
It's going to be using our airtime.

627
00:31:58,403 --> 00:31:59,603
Hereby, I announce

628
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,723
we'll have two days off.

629
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,203
This is the best time and season

630
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,363
to go to Mountain Linglong.

631
00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:09,443
I can go.

632
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,083
I'm not going with

633
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:13,083
you young people.

634
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:15,083
Xiaoran, what about you?

635
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:17,283
Mountain Linglong.

636
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:18,843
Can I bring my family?

637
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:21,083
It's not too convenient.

638
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:24,643
But, if you're inviting

639
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:26,923
the hero of the rescue, Mr. Xiao,

640
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:28,083
it's fine.

641
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:32,363
Sui,

642
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:33,523
what about you?

643
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,883
I'm fine with anything.

644
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,283
Stop hiding. I saw it.

645
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:58,483
I didn't expect that

646
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:00,843
He Xiaoran looks like a tiger

647
00:33:00,883 --> 00:33:01,883
when she's in love.

648
00:33:03,643 --> 00:33:05,083
Don't laugh at me.

649
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,123
Both of us

650
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,323
have delayed this for years.

651
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:08,763
Now, we've met again.

652
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,123
Do you know how I feel?

653
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:12,243
I'm all ears.

654
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,283
It's like, if this is a dream,

655
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:17,843
I'd rather sleep until I die
than waking up.

656
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,523
I walk rather carefully

657
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:20,963
than usual,

658
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:22,723
not wanting to hit something
and wake up.

659
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:24,963
It's been so long.

660
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:28,323
How can a dream be so long-lasting?

661
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:30,963
After so many things have happened,

662
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:32,523
do you think

663
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:34,923
he's just acting impulsively?

664
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,963
Well, you should love him
with all you can

665
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:39,403
as long as you can.

666
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:40,763
If one day you don't love him anymore,

667
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:42,323
it's all worth it.

668
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:44,803
You're right.

669
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,123
All in all, I must make sure

670
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,323
he can't regret it

671
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,243
even if he wakes up one day.

672
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:57,883
Sui is not happy lately.

673
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:00,523
What's wrong with him?

674
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,563
He'll be fine in a few days.

675
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:03,243
It's his regular response.

676
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:05,963
Isn't he always like this?

677
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:10,523
Carry on.

678
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:15,723
Bless you.

679
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:25,723
Wait, I'll call for a taxi.

680
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:29,002
The weather today is good.

681
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,002
It must be nice to take a photo.

682
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,443
Is this the taxi you called?

683
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:39,562
What a nice car.

684
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:40,843
Not bad.

685
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:41,603
No.

686
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:42,283
Sui,

687
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,123
you're spending too much on this.

688
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:52,203
Didn't you say you're working

689
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:53,683
and will only come later?

690
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:56,723
I worked overtime last night
and got the job done.

691
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,083
I wish to see you earlier.

692
00:34:58,522 --> 00:34:59,283
Okay.

693
00:34:59,883 --> 00:35:01,203
For the sake of this car,

694
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,843
it's worth to see how close they are.

695
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:04,323
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

696
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,123
Load the stuff.

697
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:07,283
I'll do it.

698
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:09,523
I'll do it.

699
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:16,963
You're the driver, right?

700
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:18,203
Here's the car key.

701
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:26,763
What do you mean?

702
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:29,763
I'm not familiar with the roads

703
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:30,563
in Wusu.

704
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:32,683
Mr. Xiao, I'm leaving now.

705
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:39,363
You should drive.

706
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:42,843
I've brought

707
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:43,723
all your favorite food.

708
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:44,683
Does it feel like

709
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:45,763
the high school spring trip?

710
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:47,923
Try it.

711
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:49,603
You haven't washed it.

712
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:50,963
After staying living independently,

713
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:51,603
I've learned

714
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:52,443
this life knowledge.

715
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:54,003
A fruit that's not washed
is the tastiest.

716
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:55,043
Try it.

717
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:56,683
This is fresh strawberry.

718
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:57,683
I'll eat it if you don't.

719
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,443
It's really tasty.

720
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:05,523
Not bad.

721
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:06,363
Is it sweet?

722
00:36:06,963 --> 00:36:07,523
Yes.

723
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:11,123
Are you okay?

724
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:12,403
Sui.

725
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:18,883
Sui.

726
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:22,723
- What are you doing?
- It's all spilled.

727
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:23,483
Yes.

728
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:24,603
I understand your feeling,

729
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:27,083
but driving like this is not
only dangerous,

730
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:28,603
you're helping him, too.

731
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:30,763
This is tasty.

732
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:32,043
Let's go.

733
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:33,443
It's messy before we reach there.

734
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:43,203
This is Mountain Linglong.

735
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:46,323
One of the social influencers'
favorite spots in Wusu.

736
00:36:47,283 --> 00:36:48,043
Where's the mountain?

737
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:49,883
There's no mountain here.

738
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:51,523
The so-called Mountain Linglong

739
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:53,003
is the lake in front of us.

740
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:55,523
We're here.

741
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,643
Mr. Xiao,

742
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:57,763
you don't like water?

743
00:36:58,963 --> 00:36:59,683
I do.

744
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:01,123
That's great.

745
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:02,843
Don't just stand there
since you're here with us.

746
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,243
It's not fun.

747
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:05,683
Let's go, my friends.

748
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,603
We shall go to the lakeside
to feel the wind

749
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,443
and the nature.

750
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:09,723
Let's go.

751
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:11,443
Then Xiaoran and I

752
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:12,843
will set up the canopy.

753
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:15,483
Since Mr. Xiao has his senses

754
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,643
to serve his family,

755
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:17,603
we should just let him do it.

756
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:18,163
Here you go.

757
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:21,803
Thank you.

758
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:22,923
Let's go.

759
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:23,483
Let's go.

760
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:35,283
So, you don't know how to do this?

761
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:38,523
Who said I don't?

762
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:40,203
It's just been a while,

763
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:41,843
so I've forgotten how to do it.

764
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:43,683
Why not we ask Sui to help?

765
00:37:43,883 --> 00:37:45,123
I'm sure he knows what to do
since he bought this.

766
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,003
No.

767
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:48,643
Both of us combined

768
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,043
is around 50 years old.

769
00:37:50,283 --> 00:37:51,283
We can handle this.

770
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,323
No problem.

771
00:37:53,363 --> 00:37:55,163
Okay, let me help you.

772
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:15,043
It's Li Hui's.

773
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:19,363
Isn't this your bag?

774
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:21,963
Are we setting up the canopy?

775
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:26,723
Yes.

776
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,483
Come on.

777
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:31,763
I'll keep taking photos.

778
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:32,883
You can choose it on your own later.

779
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,403
Okay, just send to me later.

780
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:43,483
Xiao Shangqi,

781
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:44,883
let's take some photos by the bridge.

782
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:48,212
♪Honey honey honey♪

783
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:49,290
♪It has been a while♪

784
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:55,048
♪My love has you in the future♪

785
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:00,726
♪Sometime in the past♪

786
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,039
♪I'd like to share the sweetness♪

787
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:12,281
♪It makes my heartbeat different♪

788
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,523
So beautiful.

789
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:30,003
There's fish in here.

790
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:31,523
Xiao Shangqi, come and have a look.

791
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:32,483
What fish is this?

792
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,203
It should be a big fish.

793
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:38,083
You're just saying that.

794
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:39,363
Come here and take a look.

795
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:40,203
I...

796
00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:40,723
Look.

797
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:41,443
I...

798
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:42,283
There.

799
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:43,843
There.

800
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:47,003
Where did it go?

801
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:49,323
So weird.

802
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:58,763
Qi,

803
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:00,243
hang in there!

804
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:01,203
Qi!

805
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:04,243
Xian, save me!

806
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:04,723
Don't be scared!

807
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:06,083
I'm coming to save you!

808
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:14,803
What's going on?

809
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:15,843
Are you not feeling well?

810
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:18,763
I'm fine.

811
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:23,323
Your stomach is not well?

812
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:24,883
Did you eat something wrong?

813
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:27,123
No.

814
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:29,963
I just thought of

815
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:32,363
some bad memory.

816
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:35,083
What's it?

817
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:41,363
When I was seven years old,

818
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:43,443
my family and I went to the sea
for fishing.

819
00:40:44,723 --> 00:40:45,723
I was playful.

820
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:47,763
I was lying down near the boat
to look at the fish.

821
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:49,923
I fell off into the sea accidentally.

822
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:51,843
My brother didn't think much

823
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,163
and jumped into the water to save me.

824
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:56,123
He was 15 years old.

825
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,923
His leg was injured.

826
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:05,763
After that incident,

827
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:09,243
my father didn't say anything,

828
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:12,403
but from his eyes,

829
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,203
I knew

830
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:15,763
he's blaming me.

831
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:20,123
The crutch is

832
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:23,683
like poking

833
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:25,483
our hearts.

834
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:34,883
You were only seven years old.

835
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:37,603
It's lucky for you to have survived.

836
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:39,763
That's not your fault.

837
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:41,323
Also, your brother's leg injury

838
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,003
is not your fault either.

839
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:48,683
This is the first time

840
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:49,923
I'm hearing from others

841
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:53,043
that it's not my fault.

842
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:54,883
Of course it's not.

843
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:58,203
That's just an accident.

844
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:04,003
But, you've never

845
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:05,883
talked about this before.

846
00:42:08,563 --> 00:42:09,843
No matter how close we are,

847
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:11,683
there's some bad experience

848
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:12,723
that we never wanted to share.

849
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:18,123
However,

850
00:42:18,843 --> 00:42:20,763
before someone whom you want to
spend your entire life with,

851
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:22,643
it can't be hidden.

852
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:30,003
You can't hide anything from me
from now on.

853
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:32,603
Otherwise, you'll get it from me.

854
00:42:33,123 --> 00:42:33,843
I promise.

855
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,243
Li Hui said Sui's having a stomachache.

856
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,363
She has sent him to the hospital.

857
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:53,683
She'll come back and pick us up later.

858
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:57,763
The sun is about to go down.

859
00:42:58,763 --> 00:42:59,883
When they're back,

860
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:01,123
I'm afraid it's a bit too late.

861
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,683
Yes, it's late.
