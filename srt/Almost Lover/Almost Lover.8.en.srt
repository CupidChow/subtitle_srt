Xiao Shangqi has really matured.

18
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:46,599
I thought he'd come in.

19
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,359
It violates
the house-sharing rules.

20
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,199
Who made the rules?

21
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,799
Don't you think

22
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,599
our home is

23
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,599
a lot more comfortable

24
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,719
without someone with the OCD

25
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,079
and tidiness?

26
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,839
Sui, look.

27
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,679
Li Hui is back.

28
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,199
She bought a lot of food

29
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,799
and your favorite duck head.

30
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,439
Give me a break.

31
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,878
You bought it all, didn't you?

32
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,919
I don't like to eat these.

33
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,199
Ducks are cute.

34
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,999
I don't eat them.

35
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,839
I see you buy duck meat
every time you go

36
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,599
to the supermarket.

37
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,519
Anyway, I don't like it.

38
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,959
Just eat.

39
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:27,959
Don't waste food.

40
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,759
Li Hui.

41
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:34,479
No way.

42
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,119
She knows the password.

43
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,239
Why haven't you left yet?

44
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,239
I went to buy some fruits.

45
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,239
Can I

46
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,119
stay at your place

47
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,319
tonight?

48
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,799
Here.

49
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,719
This is not a hotel,

50
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,559
buddy.

51
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,999
Doesn't your family own a hotel?

52
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,999
Jifeng Hotel's rooms

53
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
are being commissioned
for the night today.

54
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,519
Then go back to

55
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,839
your fancy little house.

56
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,119
The management said the water was off.

57
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,119
What a coincidence.

58
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,119
So, what do you like

59
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,599
about our humble loft?

60
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,119
This living room is not bad.

61
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,199
I can sleep on the sofa.

62
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:35,919
Sui, are you sleepy?

63
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,159
Why?

64
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,839
Am I too much of an eyesore?

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,639
The night is still young.

66
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,119
What do you want to do?

67
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,719
Eat some fruits.

68
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:50,879
Taste the fruits

69
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,359
specially brought by Mr. Xiao.

70
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,479
Why is he so hyper?

71
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,719
He's hospitable.

72
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,279
He's just glad to see you here.

73
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,519
Which one do you want to eat?

74
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,359
The biggest one.

75
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,999
I can eat this until late night.

76
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,799
It looks good.

77
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:15,239
Thank you.

78
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,039
Eat up.

79
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,279
Listen.

80
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,079
You should

81
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,319
spend time thinking about

82
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,079
how to persuade Li Hui back.

83
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,199
Refusing to receive

84
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,159
someone's boyfriend's parcel

85
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,678
is just absurd.

86
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,199
Who wants her back?

87
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,639
I refused to receive it

88
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,079
purely for her safety.

89
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,719
Childish.

90
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,879
What about you?

91
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,439
Look at this raw

92
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,039
and unpalatable fruit.

93
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:44,479
I wouldn't reject it

94
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,239
if I were you.

95
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,319
I will send her a parcel

96
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:48,599
even if I don't have one

97
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,279
and ask her to come back for it.

98
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,679
Exactly.

99
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,079
Buy a gift

100
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:54,919
and call her

101
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,359
to come back and sign for it.

102
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,519
This should be

103
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,599
the right way to solve it.

104
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,279
Scheming little devil.

105
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,639
If you cherish this friend,

106
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,719
you should act early.

107
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,359
Women can easily

108
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,599
draw a line with others.

109
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,079
She'll just block you forever.

110
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,959
You brought up old scores again.

111
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,199
I'm not talking about you.

112
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,279
I'm just advising him.

113
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,399
Here.

114
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,599
Eat some watermelon.

115
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,759
I already have one.

116
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,159
Come on.

117
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,319
This watermelon is so sweet.

118
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,079
Not as sweet as you.

119
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,199
Why are you still up?

120
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,679
I can't fall sleep.

121
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,319
Who made you come

122
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,519
and sleep on the sofa?

123
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,439
Do you think I'm petty?

124
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,519
A little bit cute.

125
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,359
Cute?

126
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,639
What is so cute about me?

127
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,039
In any way.

128
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,239
Get up.

129
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,759
You know what?

130
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,599
Sui and Li Hui

131
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,759
were childhood friends.

132
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:53,959
They've known each other

133
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,719
longer than we have.

134
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,759
As Li Hui said,

135
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,919
they have witnessed

136
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,079
each other's rebellious days,

137
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,799
first love

138
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,839
and also

139
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,359
their whole life of study.

140
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,239
Now they're colleagues again.

141
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,559
Don't you think this connection

142
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,799
is rare?

143
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,119
Okay.

144
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,039
I understand

145
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,599
your feelings of wanting to stay.

146
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,039
After all,

147
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,759
some friends that have left
will never come back.

148
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,679
Xiao Shangqi.

149
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,119
What would you do

150
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,039
if you saw

151
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,719
your best friend

152
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,559
might be in a relationship

153
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,479
that could be hurtful?

154
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,719
I will respect her choice.

155
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,479
If she's in danger,

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
I'll get her out.

157
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,879
As expected of you.

158
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,639
But that probably

159
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,079
will never happen

160
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,279
because my best friend

161
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,559
is now my girlfriend.

162
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:08,999
I will never

163
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,159
let her get hurt.

164
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,399
Move out soon, will you?

165
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,439
Okay.

166
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,559
Move out soon, will you?

167
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,398
He won't hear it.

168
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,639
Fire alarm!

169
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,839
What are you doing?

170
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:21,839
Come on, Sui.

171
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,199
It's so early in the morning,

172
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,599
yet you're being lovey-dovey here.

173
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,319
You don't even allow me, the poor man,

174
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,599
to put a special effect.

175
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,479
He Xiaoran.

176
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,279
I remember you moved out

177
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,199
because your housemate

178
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,559
brought her boyfriend back, right?

179
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,279
That's a different story.

180
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,399
Hui.

181
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:44,999
What's the matter?

182
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,559
Pajamas party?

183
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,719
Yes.

184
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:50,799
The three of us

185
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,759
have just had

186
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:52,879
a very memorable night.

187
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,239
It's only when you change housemates

188
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,279
that you realize how miserable

189
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:56,399
your life was before.

190
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,159
Isn't it, Xiao Shangqi?

191
00:09:58,439 --> 00:09:59,599
It's quite a misery with you around.

192
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,039
Hui.

193
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,479
I wonder

194
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,159
who was

195
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,639
expecting you back last night.

196
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:05,599
Exactly.

197
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,479
Have you eaten breakfast?

198
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,479
I'll get some takeout.

199
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,479
No need.

200
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,519
I'll leave

201
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,639
after I grab some clean clothes.

202
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:11,999
If someone

203
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,039
finds me annoying,

204
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:13,919
why should I be

205
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:14,759
a nuisance here?

206
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:15,919
Don't you agree?

207
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,199
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

208
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,159
Tang Yan may stay in Wusu

209
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,279
for a few more days.

210
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,319
I'd like to get him

211
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,599
a room in Jifeng.

212
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,799
Give me a discount.

213
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,879
No problem.

214
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,359
Thank you.

215
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,239
I'll leave you be.

216
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,359
Why is it not a problem?

217
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,519
Why did you give your consent?

218
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,519
Why are you so unprincipled?

219
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,679
If you hear

220
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,239
that fire alarm sound in the morning,

221
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,359
you'll become unprincipled, too.

222
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,559
Mr. Xiao, this way, please.

223
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,199
Which clip is this?

224
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,279
This way.

225
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,639
Two breakfasts sets

226
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,919
and two cups of espresso.

227
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,439
Okay, please wait.

228
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,719
Didn't sleep well last night, Mr. Xiao?

229
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,479
What are you doing?

230
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,599
It's almost
International Children's Day.

231
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,679
We're going to have an event

232
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,239
to bring out

233
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,759
the inner child in adults.

234
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,679
These are the decorations and props

235
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:33,879
to set the venue.

236
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,159
We played with these as kids.

237
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,159
You're right.

238
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,879
Can you get me some?

239
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,199
Sure.

240
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,079
Is that okay, Mr. Xiao?

241
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,479
Of course.

242
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,759
Didn't we agree to
discuss the theme together

243
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,199
when we return?

244
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,159
Yes.

245
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,199
Tomorrow is

246
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,279
International Children's Day.

247
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,959
We can refer to these

248
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,039
for inspiration.

249
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:13,999
Li Hui.

250
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,039
I remember you told me

251
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:17,599
that you and Sui played marbles
when you were kids.

252
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,559
You said you knocked

253
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,799
his front teeth out, didn't you?

254
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,959
I was giving in to her.

255
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,399
She was bullied

256
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,879
by the seniors in primary school.

257
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,319
They snatched her cards.

258
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,479
I fought three to one

259
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,559
to get them back for her.

260
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,119
He got beaten up so badly

261
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,839
that he didn't come to class
for a month due to fractures.

262
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:34,839
I had to copy

263
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,959
lesson notes for him every day.

264
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,279
You should be grateful.

265
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,159
She even copied notes for him?

266
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,079
So, which villain

267
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,359
do you remember the most?

268
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,079
- Brocken Gigant.
- Brocken Gigant.

269
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,279
Shouldn't it be Ray Stinger?

270
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,079
What do you think?

271
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,359
You've never watched this animation?

272
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,279
No.

273
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,719
Really?

274
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,119
Yes.

275
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,279
Mr. Xiao.

276
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,439
You have no childhood.

277
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,879
Here, let me tell you.

278
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,079
This is the popping candy.

279
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,039
We enjoyed it the most

280
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,119
when we were kids.

281
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:23,159
Take a lollipop

282
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,919
and dip it in the popping candy.

283
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,679
Then it will

284
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,239
pop in your mouth.

285
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,279
I know.

286
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
And this is called a yo-yo.

287
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,639
I know this.

288
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,719
Of course I know yo-yo.

289
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,399
Sui is great at this.

290
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,399
He's skillful.

291
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:34,759
Sui, show him.

292
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:35,999
Wait.

293
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,479
Well, I...

294
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,839
I need to go to the bar.

295
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,559
Tang Yan called me.

296
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,639
I'll leave you be.

297
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,559
Why did he call you at this hour?

298
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,879
Let me send you there.

299
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,439
No.

300
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,519
I'll go on my own.

301
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,599
The fastest way to go to him

302
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,159
is by a motorbike.

303
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,159
Let's go.

304
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:58,999
Be careful.

305
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,079
Okay.

306
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:03,639
Do you think

307
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,719
they have made up?

308
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,199
You've recalled

309
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,239
so many of their memories.

310
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,519
Who can stand that?

311
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,639
But how come someone

312
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,319
doesn't know anything?

313
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,119
What exactly did you do as a child?

314
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:21,759
Come with me.

315
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

316
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,799
Why did you bring me here?

317
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,799
Didn't you ask

318
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,839
why I didn't play those?

319
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,799
Because most of my childhood

320
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,759
has been filled with
hotel-related activities.

321
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,679
This is

322
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,119
where I used to go

323
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,279
as a child.

324
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,839
Alone?

325
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,439
Yes.

326
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,679
Back then,

327
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,519
there were very few
children in the hotel.

328
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:01,639
So I didn't play with

329
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,559
most of the things

330
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,919
that children played with.

331
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,279
We didn't have

332
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,119
anything in common at school.

333
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,479
I couldn't relate

334
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,999
to their interest either.

335
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,279
Instead, the washing machine here

336
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,479
seemed like magic to me.

337
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,399
(When I looked at them,)

338
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:20,759
(I felt the whole world)

339
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,559
(was turning.)

340
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,159
(It felt as if)

341
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,879
(time had stood still.)

342
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,439
(I enjoyed my time alone.)

343
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,439
I wish I'd met you

344
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,199
earlier.

345
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,919
A colorful recreational centre,

346
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:36,199
a back kitchen with bottles and jars

347
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,359
and an adventurous

348
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,039
laundry room.

349
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,999
Sounds like

350
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,759
a lot more fun than marbles

351
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:43,759

352
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,399
Xiao Shangqi.

353
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,319
I've taught you

354
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,439
so much fun.

355
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,439
Now, can you

356
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,279
teach me

357
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,199
how to play this?

358
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,199
Close your eyes.

359
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,279
Don't open them.

360
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,520
♪The night is dark and real♪

361
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,350
♪The intimate look♪

362
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:38,160
♪Looking at the familiar stranger

364
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,519
Not ready yet?

365
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,519
Open your eyes.

366
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,720
♪The gentle tone♪

367
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,959
How did you do this?

368
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,639
Secret.

369
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:00,679
I'll tell you next time.

370
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,039
Tomorrow will be a busy day.

371
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,079
So, we're celebrating it early.

372
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,599
This is our

373
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:08,759
first occasion together.

374
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,119
Children's Day?

375
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,759
We'll spend all the celebration

376
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:15,559
together from now on.

377
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,360
♪The process of love one after another♪

378

379
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,359
What is the relationship between

380
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,959
Wusu's Miss Hanging and Xiao Shangqi?

381
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,519
Miss Hanging's only

382
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:49,759
title sponsor on the radio

383
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:50,719
is Jifeng.

384
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:51,999
If Mr. Xiao

385
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,759
had let him come back earlier,

386
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,599
Yunlan would not be

387
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,919
in this situation now.

388
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,079
That he didn't come back

389
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,359
doesn't mean there's no movement.

390
00:17:58,999 --> 00:17:59,759
I heard

391
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,959
that Yunlan is planning to

392
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:02,519
develop their own brand in Wusu.

393
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,359
Really?

394
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,599
Yes.

395
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,359
Mr. Zhao, are you not feeling well?

396
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,679
Get me an appointment
with Xiao Xian now.

397
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,039
Okay, where would you like to meet?

398
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,519
Basketball court.

399
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,359
Next month.

400
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,559
Ask Qi to come back and help me

401
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,319
with the opening
of Yunduan Hotel in Deju.

402
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:29,559
I also

403
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,839
need him

404
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,919
to plan my wedding.

405
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,159
I don't trust anyone else but him.

406
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,399
By the way,

407
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,199
I heard

408
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,959
that Qi is going to develop

409
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,079
Yunlan brand in Wusu.

410
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,919
It is still in
the conceptual stage, I guess.

411
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,799
I'm not sure either.

412
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,439
Only my father knows.

413
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,759
I feel so bad for you.

414
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,519
You've worked so hard

415
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,279
to support Yunlan for so many years,

416
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,679
but in the end, you let Qi

417
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,479
steal the show.

418
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,039
Is your father going
to leave your family

419
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,119
in the hands of Qi?

420
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,559
I can't believe Uncle Xiao.

421
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,919
Just because your leg was injured

422
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,719
doesn't mean you can't do great things.

423
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,759
What are you trying to say?

424
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,519
Our two families are very close

425
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,319
and we have
a long-term partnership ahead.

426
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,959
I can play a couple of games with Qi,

427
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,919
but I'm totally on your side

428
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,079
when it comes to business, buddy.

429
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,279
I will

430
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,959
take care of it for you.

431
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,159
I'll be off now if there's nothing else.

432
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:39,479
Take care.

433
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,960
(Who wasn't a baby once?)

434
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,079
Who wasn't a baby once?

435
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,119
This must be

436
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,399
the idea of that childish guy,

437
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,399
Xiao Shangqi.

438
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,399
The response is overwhelming.

439
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,079
If you don't take part

440
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,279
in such a good event,

441
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,839
you'll be unable to keep up

442
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:29,719
with your friends.

443
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:30,479
It's a waste

444
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,999
of your title, Ruler of Wusu.

445
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:34,839
You've come up

446
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,359
with so many excuses

447
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,919
to get him free labour.

448
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,719
It's our duty to serve

449
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,039
our rich master.

450
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,439
Have you figured out what happened to

451
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,719
Li Hui and Tang Yan?

452
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,639
Yes.

453
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,879
In fact, the most important thing

454
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,359
is that Li Hui is happy

455
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,439
in this relationship.

456
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,479
And if she gets hurt in the end,

457
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,799
she has me as a friend

458
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:00,919
to support her.

459
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:04,359
That sounds heart-warming

460
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,519
and a little touching.

461
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,319
It's okay.

462
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,279
(Children's Day)
If you end up breaking up,

463
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,359
(Children's Day)
you can cry

464
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:10,879
(Children's Day)
on my shoulder.

465
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:11,639
Don't jinx it.

466
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,839
You don't have to worry about it.

467
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:29,759
There are no rats here,

468
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,519
but there are obvious signs

469
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,399
of rat bites

470
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,159
and a few droppings.

471
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,799
These two barrels of oil
have also expired.

472
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:37,759
Mr. Xiao.

473
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,999
We are now suspending

474
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,639
Jifeng Restaurant from the business.

475
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,239
Here, Mr. Xiao.

476
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,159
Sign this.

477
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:51,439
Let's go.

478
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,319
What's going on?

479
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:01,279
This is...

480
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,519
How could we possibly

481
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,759
use expired oil?

482
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,039
Have you seen this oil?

483
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:05,879
No.

484
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,599
I've never noticed

485
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,079
the flour sack in the corner.

486
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,239
Do we really have rats here?

487
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,599
Don't be ridiculous.

488
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:15,839
All right.

489
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,359
You may go back first.

490
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,399
Let's go.

491
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,479
I have never seen this oil.

492
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,799
I don't think

493
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,279
we should be talking

494
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,759
about advertising right now.

495
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,599
Because of

496
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,959
our close relationship with them,

497
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,119
it is now our duty

498
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:36,919
and responsibility

499
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,879
to make this clear to our listeners.

500
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:41,959
What do you mean?

501
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:43,599
Whether they are

502
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,559
our title sponsor or not,

503
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,839
if they really

504
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,599
have issues with food safety,

505
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,959
they should be exposed.

506
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,599
But before we do that,

507
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,999
we should get to the bottom

508
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,799
of the whole thing

509
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,399
by finding

510
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,919
the person who posted the video.

511
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,279
(Today, I will show you all)

512
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,559
(the warehouse of Jifeng Hotel.)

513
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,479
(Look at this.)

514
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:08,479
(How dirty this is.)

515
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,719
(Such a big rat)
(Look here.)

516
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,119
(I'm puking)
(There are also rats here.)

517
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,479
(Do you dare eat food)

518
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,759
(from such places?)

519
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:15,999
(Mr. Xiao.)

520
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,479
(Black Pine Needles)

521
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,039
(has removed us from the list.)

522
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:21,399
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Yes.

523
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,119
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Check us out now.

524
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:23,159
- Check us out.
- Check us out.

525
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,999
Sir, due to the system,

526
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:25,839
we can't

527
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,079
check out of your room.

528
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,119
What?

529
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,719
If your hotel is like this,

530
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,679
who would dare stay here?

531
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:31,839
There are rats in the restaurant.

532
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,359
So, there must be some
in the hotel, too.

533
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,359
Rats are

534
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,119
swarming together.

535
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,519
What rats?

536
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,279
The rats' issue

537
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,639
is still not clear to us.

538
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,679
Enough.

539
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:40,919
Grace.

540
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:41,919
Just do as he says.

541
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,639
That's for sure!

542
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:44,479
I haven't even asked you

543
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:45,399
to compensate me!

544
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,119
Sir, the money has been refunded

545
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,079
to your account.

546
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,239
Let's go.

547
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,079
Mr. Xiao.

548
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,879
(Jifeng Hotel)
This...

549
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,159
Keep it.

550
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,159
Just keep it.

551
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
(Jifeng Hotel won the Black Pine
Needle Suitable For Living)

552
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,759
Mr. Xiao's efforts

553
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,159
were completely in vain.

554
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,279
In the last few days,

555
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,839
all the orders on
the platform and system

556
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,879
have been cancelled.

557
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,359
The occupancy rate is now close to zero.

558
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,599
Look at Mr. Xiao.

559
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,279
He's not even affected by it.

560
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,399
He has seen much of life after all.

561
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,279
He's just acting tough.

562
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,519
All right.

563
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,199
Go back to your work.

564
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,359
It's been days.

565
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,919
How can you

566
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:49,679
not do anything?

567
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,599
Don't wait until

568
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,119
it gets out of hand

569
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,279
before you try to deal with it.

570
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,679
It will be too late.

571
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,879
Things haven't been clarified yet.

572
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:58,839
Exactly.

573
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,119
The crisis PR should take

574
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,239
the initiative to handle it.

575
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,239
Don't try to go cold turkey.

576
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,359
Do you think this

577
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,599
will be forgotten in time?

578
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,999
I repeat.

579
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:07,999
I am not going cold turkey.

580
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,679
I am investigating it.

581
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,519
Are you a policeman

582
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,199
trying to solve a crime?

583
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,559
I'm well aware of

584
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,559
the crisis PR won't solve

585
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,039
the substantive problem,

586
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,119
but this can change

587
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,959
the Internet's perception of the matter.

588
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:23,919
Anyway, I will

589
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,119
tell you one last time.

590
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,319
If you can't solve

591
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,359
this matter,

592
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,839
I'll have to leave it

593
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,719
to Yunlan headquarters.

594
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:40,799
We've contacted the person

595
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:41,759
who posted the video.

596
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:42,999
He is willing to call in.

597
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,959
Yes, I'll put you through.

598
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,559
Xiaoran, here we go.

599
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,359
Our first call today

600
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,519
is a little special.

601
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:03,839
I'm aware that

602
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,679
Jifeng restaurant
opposite the radio station

603
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:06,959
has recently been embroiled

604
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,719
in a hygiene and safety incident.

605
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,439
As we have featured

606
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,039
this restaurant in our program before,

607
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:12,959
I personally

608
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:14,439
follow it very closely.

609
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,119
We also managed to invite

610
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,719
the person who made this video.

611
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:18,919
We refer to him here

612
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,159
as Mr. A.

613
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,679
Hello, Mr. A.

614
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:22,959
(Hello.)

615
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,079
Did you take the video

616
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,159
of the rat infestation?

617
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,279
(Yes.)

618
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,719
Can you tell us more about

619
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:31,519
the circumstances

620
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,159
in which this video was shot?

621
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,519
(I went to Jifeng for a meal.)

622
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,839
(Private home cuisine and all.)

623
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,319
(What's so good about the food there?)

624
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,599
It's awful.

625
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,759
It's all a gimmick.

626
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,439
Don't go off topic.

627
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,399
Please tell us about the video.

628
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,319
Anyway, this hotel

629
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,359
is just a mess.

630
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,839
The kitchen was filthy,

631
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,839
(the spoons were greasy,)

632
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,479
(the desserts were covered with rags)

633
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,079
(and there were rats)

634
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,439
(and pests.)

635
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,519
Nonsense.

636
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,799
What is he talking about?

637
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,079
I lost my appetite.

638
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:08,799
Gosh.

639
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,519
Exactly.

640
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,199
His video commentary

641
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,559
was already shocking enough.

642
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,399
Now he even narrates it live

643
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,599
for all to hear.

644
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,239
Isn't Jifeng

645
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,879
the title sponsor of Dajiabang?

646
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,839
How did you get access

647
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,839
to the hotel's kitchen storage room?

648
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,879
(It was because of)

649
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,839
(the loose management.)

650
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,479
That's how I got in anyway.

651
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,159
I'm telling you all these.

652
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,119
Jifeng is

653
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,119
your advertiser, right?

654
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,679
(You're not covering for
each other, are you?)

655
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,679
You can rest assured.

656
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:39,799
We are the media.

657
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:40,759
We are always objective

658
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,319
and fair when it comes to the truth.

659
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,159
This hotel restaurant issue

660
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,479
is definitely not an exception.

661
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:47,479
(I just walked around)

662
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,879
(because it was loosely managed.)

663
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,839
(There were wet foams)

664
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:52,319
(in front of the laundry room,)

665
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,559
(but no one wiped it off.)

666
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,279
The hallway was wet.

667
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:58,079
So, did they put up

668
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,839
any caution signs around the area?

669
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,119
I...

670
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,839
I can't remember.

671
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,599
The carpets in this hotel

672
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,479
were dirty.

673
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:06,719
The wall was covered in mold.

674
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,239
Do you remember

675
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,599
the exact spot of the mold?

676
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:10,959
(It was)

677
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,159
(at the east end of
the second floor of the guest room.)

678
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,079
You listened to the program?

679
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,479
As your boyfriend,

680
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:40,799
can I ask you

681
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,519
not to continue the investigation?

682
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,199
As your girlfriend,

683
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,479
I believe in you

684
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,679
and I believe Jifeng

685
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,399
is innocent.

686
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,839
But as a member of the media,

687
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,159
I have to maintain my autonomy

688
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,159
and accuracy.

689
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,239
I have to give an account

690
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,319
to my audience.

691
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,359
So,

692
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,879
I will probably continue

693
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,879
to follow up on this.

694
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,399
That's my girlfriend.

695
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,519
Come on.

696
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,639
It's not the time for you to tease me.

697
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,799
I just don't want you to be so tense.

698
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,719
Don't worry.

699
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:29,999
I'll look into it.

700
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:31,199
I also believe

701
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,279
that you will

702
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,519
get to the bottom of this

703
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,999
so that all the rumors and slanders

704
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:35,959
will be dispelled.

705
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,359
I knew

706
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:42,799
you'd get me.

707
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,439
Still, I haven't found

708
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:48,839
any breakthrough from the interview

709
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,519
with that person.

710
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,639
I did find one.

711
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,359
This is the closest surveillance

712
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,439
to the laundry room,

713
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,639
but Mr. A did tell a lie.

714
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,759
One thing is true.

715
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:10,119
There's usually

716
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,479
no foam in the hallway,

717
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,319
except for that day.

718
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,199
He said it was near the laundry.

719
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,879
So, he must have snuck into

720
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:39,999
the hotel that day.

721
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:41,759
He must have been

722
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:42,479
among the people

723
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,199
who passed by near there.

724
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,519
Pause.

725
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,719
This person...

726
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:04,719
Mr. Xiao.

727
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,799
Xiaoran, coffee.

728
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,959
Put it there first.

729
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,239
Did you find the person?

730
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,519
Not sure. His face is not visible,

731
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,399
but this guy is suspicious.

732
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,599
At least now it's confirmed

733
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,959
that he was at the hotel at the time.

734
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,279
There are so many cameras in the hotel.

735
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,879
One of them is sure to capture him.

736
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,479
Besides, he said

737
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,879
he had eaten in the restaurant.

738
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,079
We can look at the restaurant,

739
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,839
the lobby and the lift.

740
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,000
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

741
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,119
Xiaoran.

742
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,599
Did you find anything?

743
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:40,999
I did find out something.

744
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,479
So, you waited so long

745
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:13,719
for me that day.

746
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,079
I'm asking if you've found

747
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,599
any useful clues.

748
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,839
The man was nowhere

749
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,319
to be found anywhere else.

750
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,319
Let's go.

751
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:40,919
Let's get some air

752
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,039
and have breakfast.

753
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,199
Mr. Xiao.

754
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,439
Miss He.

755
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,559
You've been checking all night.

756
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,239
Any new discoveries?

757
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:19,319
I don't get it.

758
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,759
I'm sure he passed
through the restaurant

759
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:21,799
and the lobby.

760
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,399
I also listened to your program.

761
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,399
He said there was mold

762
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:25,959
on the wall of the hotel.

763
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,399
It turns out there was.

764
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,558
However, it was fixed

765
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,719
when the hotel was refurbished.

766
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:30,558
It's her.

767
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,679
She's the one who spoke about our hotel
in the program.

768
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:33,558
That's her.

769
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:34,078
Get back to work.

770
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:34,959
Let's go.

771
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,399
Don't take it to heart.

772
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,239
Everyone is

773
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,359
distressed by this incident.

774
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:41,599
I just went to see Mr. Meng

775
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,679
about a complaint.

776
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,199
He even

777
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,199
threw a tantrum at me.

778
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,038
What complaint?

779
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,518
On Children's Day,

780
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,359
many people said

781
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,319
that the sweet and sour ribs
were too sour.

782
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,639
He is not convinced.

783
00:34:50,998 --> 00:34:52,518
Chef Meng's cooking

784
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,639
should be fine.

785
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:55,959
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
If there is

786
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,879
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
no progress today,

787
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:57,919
Yunlan headquarters

788
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,199
will hold a press conference.

789
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,759
But in today's online community,

790
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,079
refuting rumors with evidence

791
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:05,479
have no credibility.

792
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,199
Wait a minute.

793
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,119
Can I borrow this?

794
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,359
What is this?

795
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:28,039
I'll do a magic trick.

796
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,359
What does this mean?

797
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,319
You'll find out in a minute.

798
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:17,799
How about it?

799
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,079
I learned it from Taiyang.

800
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,719
He said that if you see a rainbow,

801
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:21,679
you will have good luck.

802
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,399
I don't know if that's true either.

803
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:27,599
Xiaoran.

804
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,999
With you by my side,

805
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,199
there will always be
warmth and good luck.

806
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,439
You are my lucky charm.

807
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,479
Then you'll have to carry me with you.

808
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,039
Look.

809
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:54,919
What complaint?

810
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,999
(On Children's Day,)

811
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:57,839
(many people said)

812
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,199
that the sweet and sour ribs
were too sour.

813
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,479
He is not convinced.

814
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,199
Chef Meng's cooking

815
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,399
should be fine.

816
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,359
(Could he have gotten
vinegar and soy sauce)

817
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,519
(mixed up?)

818
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,479
What's it? What are you thinking?

819
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,559
Your rainbow is working.

820
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,519
Let's go.

821
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,519
Don't you want to keep it?

822
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:34,919
This is not right.

823
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,279
There's vinegar here.

824
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,839
Which one of you
has mixed in the vinegar?

825
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:44,079
This is not the fermented sour one.

826
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:46,959
Maybe that Mr. A did it when

827
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,199
he came in to shoot the video.

828
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,639
Why?

829
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,599
He wanted to sabotage your cooking.

830
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,839
Is he my enemy?

831
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,799
I have a lot of enemies.

832
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,599
He should be someone who has a grudge

833
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,599
against our restaurant.

834
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,679
After all, sweet and sour pork ribs

835
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:03,959
are our signature dish.

836
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,199
Xiao Shangqi,

837
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:08,039
maybe we're looking
in the wrong direction.

838
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:08,799
From the beginning,

839
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,599
we were going along

840
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,959
with the idea that Mr. A was

841
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,999
a guest at the hotel,

842
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,879
but what if he wasn't?

843
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,479
Mr. Xiao.

844
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,759
I found out that the guy on the CCTV

845
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,399
seems to be the former head chef, Hu.

846
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,479
It seems to be him.

847
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:29,919
You don't have to come tomorrow.

848
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:30,919
Lin Zong.

849
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,199
Settle his salary.

850
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:34,279
Do you think I love this job?

851
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,239
I'd like to see

852
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,199
who wants to run

853
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,199
your lousy hotel restaurant!

854
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,879
That makes sense.

855
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:40,919
He didn't go through the front door.

856
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,239
He entered through here.

857
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,159
But ex-employees will have

858
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:45,079
their access revoked.

859
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,719
They can't come in here.

860
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,119
It was captured on this surveillance.

861
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:54,999
The system was being
upgraded that day.

862
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,479
It was turned off.

863
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,639
What about checking the access records?

864
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,239
See if he met up with someone.

865
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,279
I've checked.

866
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,919
Nothing unusual that night.

867
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:05,079
Is there

868
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,279
no other evidence?

869
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,079
Mo.

870
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,639
I need your favor.

871
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,399
An interview?

872
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:17,439
Sure.

873
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:19,599
How much is the rate?

874
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,759
And let me be clear.

875
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,359
I'm not showing up.

876
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:43,279
Mr. Xiao, are you looking for me?

877
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,119
There's a cute little thing

878
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,119
that I'd like to give to Taiyang.

879
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,839
What is it?

880
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,319
This cute little thing

881
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,759
is called a chipmunk.

882
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,959
You can take it back for
Taiyang to keep it.

883
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:04,359
What's wrong?

884
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,119
You don't like it?

885
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,279
It's like a mouse.

886
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,239
You found out already?

887
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,279
Only you could choose the date

888
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:19,359
the camera was serviced

889
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,319
to let people in

890
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,639
and delete the access control record,

891
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:24,879
right?

892
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,599
Did you already suspect me earlier on?

893
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:31,519
Yes.

894
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,119
After all, these days

895
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,479
you have to report

896
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:38,999
my every move in Wusu

897
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,199
to Mr. Zhao in Hupu.

898
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,119
If you know

899
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:46,719
I've been working for Zhao Mingxuan,

900
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,759
why didn't you fire me?

901
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:50,799
There's something

902
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,199
I want him to know.

903
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:55,799
I've looked into you before.

904
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,519
Five years ago,

905
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,639
you worked under Zhao Mingxuan.

906
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:01,919
Mr. Zhao did help me a lot

907
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,559
during my most difficult time.

908
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,879
I brought Taiyang to Wusu.

909
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,319
It's not easy

910
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,439
for a single father

911
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:09,679
to get a foothold.

912
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:15,639
I will have to return
his favor sooner or later.

913
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:18,719
He said

914
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,119
Taiyang has grown up.

915
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,759
He suggested we move to another city

916
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,199
to give Taiyang a better education.

917
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,639
You're quite realistic.

918
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,239
He told me to put Hu Dong,

919
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,759
which is

920
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,079
the head chef you fired,

921
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,439
in the back kitchen to learn the ropes

922
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:38,959
and then transfer him

923
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,359
to work at the hotel in Hupu.

924
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:42,879
Hu said he could imitate

925
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:43,559
the flavor to 70-80%

926
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:44,279
by looking at the seasoning

927
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:45,599
in the back kitchen.

928
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,359
I didn't expect him

929
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:50,319
to come in and shoot a video

930
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,599
to frame Jifeng.

931
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,079
So,

932
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,119
you used the guest's complaint

933
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:11,519
and the original mold

934
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:12,679
on the hotel wall

935
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,719
to draw everyone's attention

936
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:15,839
to the person who had

937
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,319
a grudge against Jifeng.

938
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,239
I confronted him about it afterward.

939
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,319
He said it was all
at the behest of Mr. Zhao,

940
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,079
and that he would not

941
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,159
betray me in any way,

942
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,679
so I should stay out of it.

943
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,559
It's true he didn't mention you.

944
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:42,639
Then...

945
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:44,879
Then you...

946
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:48,039
You feel guilty because
you've done something wrong.

947
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:50,439
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

948
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,159
panicked over a little mouse.

949
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:07,839
I'll leave my resignation letter

950
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:08,599
on your desk tomorrow.
