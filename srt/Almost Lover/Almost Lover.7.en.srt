17
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,448
Li Hui said Sui's having a stomachache.

18
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,608
She has sent him to the hospital.

19
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:46,168
She'll come back and pick us up later.

20
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,328
The sun is about to go down.

21
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,168
When they're back,

22
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,488
I'm afraid it's a bit too late.

23
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:54,488
Yes,

24
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:55,768
it's late.

25
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,768
I remember there's a homestay

26
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:58,688
nearby,

27
00:01:58,928 --> 00:01:59,888
why not...

28
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:05,528
We'll just stay here.

29
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,048
Let's go to the homestay.

30
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:28,208
What are you thinking?

31
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,088
Nothing.

32
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,048
Nothing? You were staring blankly.

33
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:36,328
I just felt the chill.

34
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:37,888
Is it chilling?

35
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:52,008
Are you still feeling the chill?

36
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,008
Xiaoran said she's not coming.

37
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:09,808
Let's go. Get him along.

38
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:16,648
Let's go.

39
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,568
Xiaoran said she's not coming.

40
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:23,848
They're staying in the homestay.

41
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,248
We should go, too.

42
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:29,408
I'll keep the stuff.

43
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:31,808
Go now.

44
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:43,728
I told you to stop.

45
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:45,008
Look.

46
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,008
You're feeling sad, right?

47
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:50,808
No.

48
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,328
Enough, stop throwing.

49
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:57,408
You've been throwing all day.

50
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,528
It's not helping.

51
00:03:58,608 --> 00:03:59,448
You should stop.

52
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:04,288
Throw this.

53
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:10,528
Throw this and it becomes rubbish.

54
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,768
Throw this into the lake
and it becomes rubbish.

55
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:15,568
Throw this into your stomach

56
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,128
and it becomes a painkiller.

57
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,328
Let's go and take medicine.

58
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,008
I can't drink much. I...

59
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,528
I won't let you drink much.

60
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:27,328
Let's go.

61
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:29,608
If Xiao Shangqi asks you about this,

62
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,208
just say you're having a stomachache.

63
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:32,888
What do you mean?

64
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:33,768
Let's go.

65
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:34,608
I'm having a stomachache?

66
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,800
(Happy Homestay)

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,830
(Be friends with the nature,
experience the nature)

68
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,248
All the rooms are booked.

69
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:49,928
The weather is warm these two days.

70
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:50,848
Why not you just

71
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:51,808
put up a night here?

72
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,448
There are sleeping bags in my tent.

73
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:54,928
The scenery here

74
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,088
is beautiful.

75
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:57,648
You can view the stars at night

76
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,168
next to the pool.

77
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:00,368
You can view the sunrise
by the lake in the morning.

78
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:01,488
It's nice.

79
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,208
Okay, thank you.

80
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:10,608
Are you feeling not well?

81
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:12,728
No.

82
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,368
Why is your heart beating so fast?

83
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,208
Why not you

84
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,808
go in and take a seat in the tent?

85
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,048
Xiaoran,

86
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,368
you're so near to me.

87
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,448
Of course my heart is beating fast.

88
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,448
No worries.

89
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,088
The swimming pool is shallow.

90
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,208
As long as the water is not too wide,

91
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,408
it's fine.

92
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:53,248
Look.

93
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,368
Isn't that Orion?

94
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,128
Orion

95
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,368
is 1,500 light-years

96
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,528
away from the earth.

97
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,008
You participated in
the astronomy association

98
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,968
in high school.

99
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:05,288
I didn't expect you to be

100
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:06,608
so knowledgeable about the stars.

101
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:08,968
I'm saying,

102
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,488
we're using our naked eyes

103
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,168
to look at its brightness.

104
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,128
That's the time it has long been

105
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:15,888
in the darkness.

106
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:17,648
Do you think

107
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:19,208
this is the so-called

108
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:20,688
time flies?

109
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:24,648
Luckily I didn't

110
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:26,208
use such a long time

111
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,488
to find the light in your eyes.

112
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,208
It's sunrise.

113
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:34,768
It's sunrise.

114
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,288
Why did I fall asleep?

115
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,168
You said you wanted to
chat with me until morning,

116
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:41,088
but you

117
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,568
slept early.

118
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,728
Luckily we didn't miss it.

119
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:48,728
Another thing has been completed.

120
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:50,488
What has been completed?

121
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:53,208
Nothing.

122
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:57,808
Xiaoran,

123
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:01,168
why do I feel like

124
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,648
you live like

125
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:05,368
there's no tomorrow?

126
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,648
I'm worried that you might regret it.

127
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:15,768
Regret?

128
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,048
Xiaoran,

129
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,448
let me tell you something.

130
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,328
Actually,

131
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:32,008
I went overseas with her
after graduation...

132
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:34,208
Look.

133
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:36,688
It's so beautiful.

134
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:38,728
They said

135
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:39,968
if it's winter,

136
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,288
the lake will be frozen.

137
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,048
The scenery will be different.

138
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,128
Are you worried

139
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:52,808
because

140
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:54,648
I owed you

141
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:55,768
a serious confession?

142
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:00,728
Xiaoran,

143
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,048
on the year we graduated,

144
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,688
I left without telling you.

145
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:08,048
We've wasted three years.

146
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:10,968
Now,

147
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,288
I don't want to lose you anymore.

148
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,408
Can we start all over again

149
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:16,328
in Wusu?

150
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:18,928
From now on,

151
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:21,088
don't leave me

152
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,528
without telling me,

153
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:24,848
okay?

154
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:30,808
Do you really love me?

155
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:34,728
It's okay.

156
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:36,768
We have time.

157
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,088
I'll prove it to you slowly.

158
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:42,408
I mean,

159
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,168
I think you really love me.

160
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,688
That's why I said yes to you.

161
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:51,648
Do you know that

162
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,608
I've actually written a wishlist

163
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,088
in the time capsule?

164
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,808
I've written a lot of things

165
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:58,488
that I wish to do with you,

166
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,928
(but now I realized,)

167
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,688
(Do many things with Xiao Shangqi.)
(actually, no matter it's the starry night)

168
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:04,928
(Do many things with Xiao Shangqi.)

169
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,128
(Do many things with Xiao Shangqi.)
(or the sunrise,)

170
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:06,608
(Do many things with Xiao Shangqi.)

171
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,128
(Do many things with Xiao Shangqi.)
(it's all bonus.)

172
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,140
(Do many things with Xiao Shangqi.)

173
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,328
The one that makes me happy

174
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:11,528
is you.

175
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,780
♪Being with you♪

176
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,000
♪Not letting go of each other♪

177
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,808
Freshly cooked edamame and peanuts.

178
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:37,728
I planted them.

179
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,648
Try it.

180
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:39,408
Thank you.

181
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,048
Enjoy.

182
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:40,648
Thank you.

183
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:42,488
Dear,

184
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:43,208
let me help you keep the things.

185
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:44,528
You're done over there?

186
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:45,008
Yes.

187
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:46,488
The weather is fine these two days.

188
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,168
So, we have a lot of guests.

189
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,088
Thank you.

190
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:49,888
No problem.

191
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,048
Seeing the boss and the lady boss

192
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,288
reminds me of my parents.

193
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:58,248
They always

194
00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,968
cook in the kitchen, too.

195
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:21,088
Xiaoran,

196
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:23,888
let's look for a house.

197
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:25,728
We can cook every morning, too.

198
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,248
You've been staying in the hotel

199
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,848
and have never stayed with others.

200
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,208
Can you get used to it?

201
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:41,808
For so many years,

202
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,048
I've been moving around.

203
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,208
Staying in hotel is actually convenient

204
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,248
for my daily life.

205
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:47,688
I don't like

206
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:49,008
to stay with others,

207
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:51,768
but if it's you,

208
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,368
I'm willing to try.

209
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
(Wusu Radio & TV Group)

210
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:08,528
Xiaoran.

211
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:09,928
Miss Zhou.

212
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:11,928
I've been meaning to tell you.

213
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,328
The previous Weibo livestream

214
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,088
was not bad.

215
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:15,368
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

216
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,368
Actually, I want to do an episode

217
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,248
on the family with
two or three children.

218
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,488
Are you interested in

219
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:21,368
this topic?

220
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,088
Actually, I've always thought that

221
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,128
our program is on the passive side,

222
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,048
waiting for the audiences
to call in to our hotline,

223
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,288
but maybe some people

224
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,128
don't have the courage

225
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,648
to seek help actively.

226
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,328
Lele's incident

227
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:33,688
has really inspired me.

228
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:34,648
I'm thinking

229
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:36,008
maybe we can focus on

230
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,208
one sort of issue,

231
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:38,488
using our radio wave

232
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,248
to heal people's life.

233
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:42,608
Not bad.

234
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:44,248
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

235
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,248
Sui Mingwei,

236
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:48,688
why are you piling up

237
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,008
the planks over there?

238
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:52,528
Xiaoran's room

239
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,968
has no place to keep her books.

240
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:55,248
I'm making a simple book rack

241
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,488
on her wall.

242
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:58,408
It's for me?

243
00:12:59,128 --> 00:12:59,888
No need.

244
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,648
No problem. Let him nail it.

245
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:02,968
All your books are on the floor.

246
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:04,408
It's not easy to find.

247
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:06,368
Get one for me later.

248
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:07,488
Sure.

249
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:09,928
No need.

250
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,368
The nails on the wall will
leave some marks behind.

251
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:13,888
It's hard for you to rent it

252
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,048
to the next tenant.

253
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,288
What do you mean?

254
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,288
I'm planning to move out.

255
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,408
Tomorrow in the afternoon,

256
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,288
Xiao Shangqi and I will check out
some houses.

257
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:28,728
You're staying together?

258
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:29,768
No.

259
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,768
We're just sharing a house.
Each of us will have a room.

260
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:34,488
Sharing a house?

261
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,088
The intention is obvious.

262
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:40,568
As long as you've decided.

263
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:43,568
Actually, for him to say that,

264
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:44,968
I'm touched.

265
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,568
For so many years,

266
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,648
he has actually been wanting

267
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,488
to avoid going home.

268
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,728
So, I don't want to let him down.

269
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,008
I feel bad for you two.

270
00:13:58,408 --> 00:13:59,368
I've just moved in,

271
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:00,888
and staying here with you both

272
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:02,408
is comfortable and happy.

273
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:03,928
Then, don't move out.

274
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:07,488
But, I understand.

275
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,088
I just have one request.

276
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:10,328
Can you move out

277
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,728
after my birthday?

278
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,408
Of course.

279
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:15,288
When it's your birthday,

280
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,208
Tang Yan is coming back.

281
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:17,808
Celebrate it well. I remember.

282
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:19,448
Okay.

283
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:22,768
Xiaoran,

284
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:24,128
the firefighters are coming for a check.

285
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:25,568
I might not be going.

286
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,648
No worries. Go ahead.

287
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:30,648
After all, I'm experienced
in looking for a house.

288
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,088
He has something on
and can't make it.

289
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:34,848
Let's go in.

290
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:35,368
Okay.

291
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,088
This way, please.

292
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,728
It's double-storey.

293
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,048
The yard is huge.

294
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,968
There are two bedrooms.

295
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:43,928
A year ago,

296
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:46,208
I just got someone to renovate it.

297
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,008
The lighting is not bad.

298
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:50,128
The house is not bad.

299
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:51,808
The price is fine.

300
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:54,008
My boyfriend should like it.

301
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:55,888
Wait.

302
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:57,688
You're a couple
planning to rent a house?

303
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,328
How long have you been dating?

304
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:01,808
One week.

305
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,128
You're staying together
after dating for seven days?

306
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:07,568
No way.

307
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:08,568
Thank you. Please leave.

308
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,128
Madam, why won't you rent it to us?

309
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:11,208
You're the last type of people

310
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:13,768
I want to rent my house to.

311
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,368
Sharing a house is like

312
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:16,488
trouble.

313
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,368
You'll throw your underwear everywhere.

314
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:19,648
Will he be able to take it?

315
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:20,968
He'll use the toilet.

316
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:22,928
Will you not complain after brushing it?

317
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:27,768
Look.

318
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:36,888
Don't use it if you won't brush it!

319
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:37,928
The previous tenants

320
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,128
were a couple, too.

321
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:40,368
The girl

322
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:41,928
snores whenever she sleeps.

323
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:43,568
They checked out after a month.

324
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:55,568
We're living separately
in our own room

325
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,128
and I don't snore.

326
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:58,448
You're living in separate rooms forever?

327
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,048
I don't believe that.

328
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:01,088
Right?

329
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,488
Before you stay with anyone else,

330
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:04,568
you won't know

331
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,448
if you'd snore.

332
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,288
Where's your boyfriend?

333
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,248
He's busy today.

334
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:16,408
Busy?

335
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:17,928
Miss,

336
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:19,888
you're too young.

337
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:21,688
Renting a house is important.

338
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:22,808
How can he not come?

339
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,568
He must be withdrawing last minute.

340
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,128
How's the house?

341
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:35,888
Don't mention that.

342
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:38,688
Hui,

343
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:39,968
happy birthday.

344
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:41,408
Here.

345
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,088
I wish you get prettier and prettier.

346
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:47,168
Drink slowly.

347
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:48,488
I'll go back first.

348
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:51,608
How was it?

349
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,048
To rent that house,

350
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,888
we need to pay two months of deposit
and three months of rent,

351
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,528
and we need to prove to
the owner lady that

352
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,168
it's true love between us.

353
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,008
Do you like that house so much?

354
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,288
I like the yard.

355
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:08,728
I mean,

356
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,728
we can plant some flowers and plants

357
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:11,008
in the yard.

358
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,807
We can put a rocking chair there.

359
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:13,928
Then,

360
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,047
we can drink tea and
enjoy the wind outside

361
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,287
in the summer.

362
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:20,208
With such a warm shelter,

363
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:21,567
I think

364
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:22,888
no matter what

365
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,128
we face out there,

366
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,287
once we reach home,

367
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,287
we'll feel peaceful.

368
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,968
You just want to provide Xiao Shangqi

369
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,648
a peaceful place to stay.

370
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:37,008
But I'd rather agree with

371
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:38,488
what the owner lady said.

372
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,528
Staying with him and staying with us

373
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:41,488
is different.

374
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,048
We're friends.

375
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,448
As long as we don't cross

376
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:45,368
each other's boundaries,

377
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:46,288
it's fine.

378
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:47,488
As for couples,

379
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:48,968
you need time to know about each other.

380
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,648
Fine, I should give up by now.

381
00:17:58,288 --> 00:17:59,368
The house has been rented by someone.

382
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:01,528
Forget it.

383
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:02,528
Just take it as a period of time

384
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,088
for you to think.

385
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:05,408
Think carefully if

386
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:06,808
you want to use each other's flaws

387
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:08,328
to challenge each other's temper.

388
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:10,528
You're right.

389
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:12,288
To be in love,

390
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,488
eight hours are fine.

391
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:14,448
If it's 24 hours,

392
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:15,888
everything will be exposed.

393
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,688
Now, I started to understand

394
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:21,808
why you don't want to stay

395
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:22,648
with Tang Yan.

396
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:27,088
I want to stay with him.

397
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:28,848
He has to be around.

398
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,328
He's not around in Wusu all year long.

399
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:34,528
He came back this time

400
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:35,888
for a job

401
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:37,608
to record an album for
a tier-three singer,

402
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:38,488
and that's why he came back

403
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:39,688
to spend time with me for my birthday.

404
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,488
Why is he not here yet?

405
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,248
(Tang Yan)
(The recording is not done yet.)

406
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:43,288
(I'll be late.)

407
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:45,008
He said the recording is not done yet.

408
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,168
He asked us to drink first.

409
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:49,608
Let's start the fun.

410
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:07,208
There's a saying

411
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,648
in the rock and roll circle.

412
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:10,688
The age of 18 to 25

413
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,408
is the best age to play rock and roll.

414
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,408
After 25 years old,

415
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,848
rock and roll will become your belief.

416
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,688
I'm 25 years old today.

417
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:19,648
I announce that

418
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:20,928
rock and roll will be my

419
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,368
lifetime belief!

420
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:04,768
- Come on!
- Happy birthday!

421
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,488
Happy birthday!

422
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:06,168
Thank you for coming.

423
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:06,968
Thank you.

424
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:07,728
Happy birthday!

425
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:08,928
Drink with Mr. He.

426
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:10,488
Happy birthday, Hui.

427
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,008
It's a grant event today.

428
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:14,008
Why are

429
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,168
your boyfriends both late?

430
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:15,888
Yes.

431
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,648
You're changing quite fast.

432
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,568
Li Hui,

433
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:19,768
I wish your

434
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,928
music dream comes true.

435
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:23,528
Okay? Here!

436
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,128
I wish you get younger and younger!

437
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:28,488
He's here.

438
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:29,328
You're late.

439
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:30,088
You need to drink.

440
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:31,808
Li Hui,

441
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:33,448
happy birthday.

442
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:35,168
Xiaoran said you love

443
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:35,768
this band.

444
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,048
So, I asked someone

445
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:37,688
to choose this overseas.

446
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,008
Hope you like it.

447
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:40,448
This is

448
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:41,888
really the best gift I've ever received.

449
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:45,968
Could this be the compensation for

450
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:47,248
taking away my roommate?

451
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:50,528
Well,

452
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:51,648
the guests are all here.

453
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:52,008
Thank you.

454
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:52,768
Let's take a group photo.

455
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:53,648
Let's take a photo.

456
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:54,288
Let's take a photo.

457
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,128
Use Sui's phone to take a photo.

458
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:56,208
His phone is the latest model.

459
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,128
Okay, come on.

460
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:58,488
Pose.

461
00:20:58,528 --> 00:20:59,928
Pose.

462
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:00,808
Come on.

463
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:03,568
Look at the camera.

464
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:04,128
Come on.

465
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:04,688
Come on.

466
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:05,368
Three,

467
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,248
two,

468
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:07,048
one.

469
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:09,128
Two more!

470
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,768
Let me see.

471
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:17,528
Mr. He.

472
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:18,448
What?

473
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,768
Why did you close your eyes
in every photo?

474
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,128
Look.

475
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:23,288
Let me take a look.

476
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,408
No way.

477
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:25,928
See for yourself.

478
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:26,808
Look.

479
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,208
Well, it's the flashlight.

480
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:30,608
It's too bright.

481
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,448
I can't even open my eyes.

482
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,270
(I want to confess to someone.)

483
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,250
(I love you, He Xiaoran.)
Drone.

484
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,088
Sui likes Xiaoran?

485
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:46,648
Rascal,

486
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:47,488
what are you talking about?

487
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:49,208
That was in the past.

488
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,088
Well...

489
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,928
You all are waiting for me
to deliver a speech.

490
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:13,968
Okay.

491
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:15,568
I need to ride today.

492
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,088
I'll drink water instead of wine.

493
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:23,488
Just one line.

494
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:25,488
Xiao Shangqi,

495
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:27,128
be nice to her.

496
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,808
Make sure my heart is broken
for a worthy reason.

497
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:39,368
Feng.

498
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,048
Yes.

499
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,608
It's Hui's birthday today.

500
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,128
I'll be singing for everyone on stage

501
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:46,208
to light up the atmosphere, okay?

502
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:46,968
A round of applause!

503
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:47,608
A round of applause, everyone!

504
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:48,488
A round of applause!

505
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:49,368
Okay.

506
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:50,688
Okay.

507
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:56,808
Hui,

508
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:58,048
is Mr. Tang

509
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,408
coming or not?

510
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,768
He has something on. He's not coming.

511
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:02,888
I want to celebrate my birthday

512
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,048
with him at 12 a.m.

513
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:05,768
I'm leaving now.

514
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,968
Just pass the message to the rest.

515
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:15,768
Let's go.

516
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:36,248
No,

517
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:38,448
don't make it like we're facing
great enemies,

518
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:39,088
okay?

519
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:40,968
I've let it go.

520
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,408
When it comes to dating,

521
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:44,968
I emphasize on fate.

522
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:46,848
I don't wait and I don't force anything.

523
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:52,968
What?

524
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:54,528
Can't you tell me

525
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:55,248
at once?

526
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:56,408
I can just reject you.

527
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:00,368
You're so mean.

528
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:02,048
Ever since we came back

529
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:02,728
from the forest park,

530
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:03,728
I've told you.

531
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:06,168
You didn't take it seriously.

532
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:10,688
Sui Mingwei,

533
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:12,648
you're a good friend

534
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:13,568
that I care a lot about.

535
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:15,488
So, I don't wish to

536
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:16,928
see your effort being

537
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:17,928
ignored.

538
00:24:18,728 --> 00:24:19,728
I used to

539
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,648
do that.

540
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:26,688
You've been taken away

541
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,528
before I could do anything.

542
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,768
If you think it's a shame,

543
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:34,448
it's okay.

544
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:36,648
Just take me as the half-court break.

545
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:38,168
When you two break up,

546
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:39,288
I'll play in the field again.

547
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:41,968
We're leaving now.

548
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:44,608
Take care.

549
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:06,848
Li Hui, you're here.

550
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:09,448
Tang Yan hasn't done his job?

551
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,208
A tier-three singer.

552
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:13,528
She has a nice body.

553
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:15,088
Her voice

554
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,488
is terrible.

555
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:19,008
It can be edited later.

556
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:21,048
The singer doesn't agree to that.

557
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:22,328
She wants to be better.

558
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,648
I think

559
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,768
she likes Tang Yan

560
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:28,488
and that's the real intention.

561
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:29,488
Don't be ridiculous.

562
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:31,248
Monitor closely.

563
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:32,568
Play the music.

564
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,128
What song is she singing?

565
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:56,088
Are you jealous?

566
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,728
She rejected two of my songs.

567
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:00,808
She chose this song instead.

568
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:03,088
So, you gave it to her?

569
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:06,128
I wrote this song for you.

570
00:26:06,328 --> 00:26:07,568
How can she sing it?

571
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:10,368
I'll write another song for you.

572
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:12,248
Mr. Tang,

573
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:13,888
let's do this quickly.

574
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,168
I have many questions

575
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,248
to ask you

576
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,768
about this song.

577
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:21,528
It's a simple song.

578
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:23,128
Why do you have some many questions?

579
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:26,648
I'm sorry.

580
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:28,968
We're talking about music

581
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:30,128
and arts.

582
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:31,528
Unrelated personnel

583
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:33,728
should leave us alone.

584
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:36,928
Let me teach you.

585
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:38,168
Listen carefully.

586
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,270
♪The beginning of parting is running
to other places♪

587
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,680
♪The parting in the beginning
is to let go♪

588
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,620
♪Carrying the bag slowly♪

589
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,330
♪Departing without looking back♪

590
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,300
♪Growing armor passing by
the happening world♪

591
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,390
♪The gentle scar is about to heal♪

592
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,020
♪Do you have the courage
to open it up again?♪

593
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,570
♪I'll be alone in the world of love♪

594
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,930
♪I'll understand in the wound♪

595
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:17,968
Li Hui's voice

596
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:19,688
is a gift from god.

597
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:20,448
Susan,

598
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,048
you should learn from her.

599
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:33,368
So nice to hear.

600
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:34,888
Is it?

601
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:36,808
I feel like

602
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:37,968
it's not so nice anymore.

603
00:28:39,128 --> 00:28:39,768
Tang Yan,

604
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:41,328
I don't want this song anymore.

605
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:45,608
Won't you chase after her?

606
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,688
I like her craziness.

607
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:03,168
Why are you here?

608
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,128
No one is eating anyway.

609
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:06,448
We can't waste it.

610
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:07,768
So, I brought it here for you.

611
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:15,408
Where's Tang Yan?

612
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:20,208
It's about 12 a.m.

613
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:22,808
I want to blow the candle.

614
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:25,848
Okay.

615
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:34,848
Here.

616
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,528
Happy birthday, Hui.

617
00:29:58,248 --> 00:29:59,048
Have you counted

618
00:29:59,248 --> 00:29:59,888
how many candles

619
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:01,408
you've blown with me since young?

620
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:04,808
So many candles.

621
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:06,688
Ever since you started

622
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,928
celebrating birthday,

623
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:08,728
I've been there

624
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:09,768
to blow the candles with you.

625
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:19,928
Didn't he say he came back

626
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:21,048
to celebrate your birthday with you?

627
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:25,728
I'll look for him.

628
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,048
Let's go home.

629
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,328
Li Hui.

630
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:34,928
Break up with him.

631
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:39,848
I know you're not happy today.

632
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:41,528
You're drunk.

633
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:43,608
Li Hui.

634
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:44,888
Li Hui.

635
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:47,608
I wanted to tell you sooner.

636
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:48,808
When you first got together with him,

637
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,568
I knew he's not the one for you.

638
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:52,008
Tang Yan is not living

639
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:53,368
in Wusu.

640
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,768
You bought him food and
let him stay in your place for free.

641
00:30:54,968 --> 00:30:55,928
He just walked away like that.

642
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,488
Do you think he has a place for you

643
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:58,728
in his future?

644
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:04,088
You've dated many people.

645
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:05,328
I've never

646
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,688
criticized you.

647
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:08,968
This is the basic respect

648
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,248
as a friend.

649
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,528
Let's not talk about respect.

650
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:16,168
I just feel it's not worthy for you.

651
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:18,168
Besides rock and roll, Tang Yan

652
00:31:18,328 --> 00:31:19,208
has never cared about anyone.

653
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:20,128
You two

654
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:21,328
are totally different.

655
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:27,648
So, He Xiaoran didn't choose you

656
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:28,888
just because

657
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:30,208
you two are different?

658
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:33,128
Why did you

659
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:34,968
keep pestering her?

660
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,648
They love each other

661
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:37,488
and have finally got together,

662
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,168
and now you're here to break us up!

663
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:48,568
So, that's who I am to you,

664
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:49,408
am I not?

665
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:53,528
Okay.

666
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:57,928
Just stay faithful

667
00:31:58,608 --> 00:31:59,328
and let Tang Yan

668
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,728
order you around.

669
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:02,608
When you break up with him,

670
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,488
don't look for me and cry!

671
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:34,048
Why didn't you ask me

672
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:35,128
the reason I was late?

673
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,368
Didn't the firefighters come?

674
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:39,408
They won't come for a whole day.

675
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:41,768
Busy?

676
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:42,888
Miss,

677
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,968
you're too young.

678
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,888
Renting a house is important.

679
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,368
How can he not come?

680
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,608
He must be withdrawing last minute.

681
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:56,448
Shouldn't we give a little space
to each other

682
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,688
in the relationship?

683
00:32:58,048 --> 00:32:59,688
You didn't ask me about Sui.

684
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:02,528
I didn't ask because

685
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:03,648
I knew that

686
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:06,448
you only love me.

687
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:13,968
Xiao Shangqi,

688
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,008
there's something

689
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,368
I need to tell you in advance.

690
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:22,608
My hair falls off easily.

691
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,408
You might find my hair

692
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,608
on the pillows, sofa, shirts,

693
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:28,808
and computer.

694
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:32,288
It's also highly possibly

695
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:34,488
that I'd snore and grind my teeth

696
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:35,488
when I sleep.

697
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:41,808
What are you trying to say?

698
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,288
I'm trying to say that

699
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:55,288
actually moving in together is not easy.

700
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:56,968
You can actually

701
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,128
think twice and we can discuss again

702
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,488
so that we won't make the decision

703
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:02,328
so easily.

704
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:03,448
Did we?

705
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:05,488
Love could be gone in a few days

706
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,528
after we spend time

707
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:09,608
together too often.

708
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,408
We wanted to be sweet,

709
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,448
but ended up being troubled
by the trivial matters.

710
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:15,368
It's not worth it.

711
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,408
Where did you hear that nonsense from?

712
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,048
I mean,

713
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:27,528
I know why you withdrew last minute.

714
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,328
I don't understand.

715
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,167
And I didn't withdraw.

716
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,328
I've rented the place.

717
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:39,488
That's why

718
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:40,687
I was late.

719
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:45,288
You were so excited

720
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:46,568
and sent me a lot of photos.

721
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,808
We talked about it
and you didn't respond.

722
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:51,248
After that, I spoke to the agent.

723
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:52,328
He said you're happy

724
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:53,328
with that house,

725
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,928
so I signed the contract

726
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:57,408
and asked someone to keep the place.

727
00:34:57,768 --> 00:34:59,328
You can just move in any time.

728
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:03,968
How did you get past

729
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,288
Madam Tian?

730
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:06,728
Madam Tian?

731
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:10,888
You mean, the landlord?

732
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,288
Madam,

733
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,648
didn't you say you don't
rent it to couples?

734
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,008
Look at him.

735
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:22,168
He's so cute.

736
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:23,608
He can't be a dirty person

737
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:24,968
in life.

738
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,768
He'll surely maintain my house

739
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:27,968
really well.

740
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:28,848
Besides that,

741
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:29,808
he has signed

742
00:35:30,048 --> 00:35:31,368
a three-year contract.

743
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:32,968
That's proven that he's sincere.

744
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,328
Thank you for your trust.

745
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:37,128
What?

746
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:39,168
No demand or anything?

747
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:43,208
She has no principles at all.

748
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,688
What did she tell me before?

749
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:46,248
We can't judge someone by his looks.

750
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:48,168
A guy who looks smart

751
00:35:48,368 --> 00:35:49,208
could be throwing his socks everywhere

752
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:50,248
back home.

753
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:51,568
I promise

754
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:52,808
that I'll change my socks every day,

755
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:53,888
and I'll wash them myself.

756
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:55,448
That's not what I mean.

757
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:57,008
Xiaoran,

758
00:35:57,608 --> 00:35:59,208
we know each other.

759
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:01,008
It won't happen.

760
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:03,728
Why not

761
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:05,088
we set some rules?

762
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,528
I'll do the chores every day.

763
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,008
I'll be back before 12 a.m. every day.

764
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:11,568
If I can't do that,

765
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:12,968
I'll kneel on the durian.

766
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:14,248
Every night from now on,

767
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:15,408
I'll watch a movie with you.

768
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:16,608
Or...

769
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:17,568
Okay.

770
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:20,728
I'll think about

771
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:23,128
how to decorate our house.

772
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:24,848
I'll plant a lot of flowers

773
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:26,608
and plants in the yard.

774
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:27,608
I want to buy

775
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:29,408
a nice carpet.

776
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:31,288
I want to buy

777
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,208
many nice cups to decorate the wall.

778
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:35,248
What else do I need to buy?

779
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:36,048
Okay.

780
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,528
No problem.

781
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:40,888
But I'm thinking

782
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:42,768
we should quickly move in.

783
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:45,568
Okay.

784
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:00,888
I'll stay outside for these two days.

785
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,528
Where are you going?

786
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,048
Where are you staying?

787
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:14,088
What's going on with you both?

788
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:19,688
Just leave.

789
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:21,248
Then I'll have peace.

790
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:23,808
Sui.

791
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:51,848
Mr. Xiao.

792
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,448
This is

793
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,248
what Jifeng's gardeners

794
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,408
picked based on your request.

795
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:56,688
It's nice, easy to take care,

796
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:57,768
and it comes with auspicious meaning.

797
00:37:58,008 --> 00:37:59,328
I guarantee Miss He will like it.

798
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:01,128
Mr. Xiao.

799
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:02,048
Miss He's room

800
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:03,208
has been decorated.

801
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,208
According to what you said,

802
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,288
I've taken note of

803
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:06,168
her preferences and habits.

804
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,488
Will she like the style?

805
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:08,608
I'm sure she likes it.

806
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:10,048
When is she coming in?

807
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:11,528
Do you need our help?

808
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:12,648
No.

809
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:13,568
I'll take care of the rest.

810
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:14,528
Go back first.

811
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:15,128
Okay.

812
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:15,848
Okay.

813
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:16,488
Bye.

814
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:17,568
- I'm leaving.
-Thank you.

815
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:36,808
(He Xiaoran)
(I might not be able to move for now.)

816
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:58,568
What happened to them?

817
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,208
They haven't been speaking
to one another.

818
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,488
Sui Mingwei, are you crazy?

819
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,408
You didn't want to talk to me, did you?

820
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:13,128
Why did you reject

821
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:13,928
my parcel?

822
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,888
I rejected the parcel with

823
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:19,488
Tang Yan as the receiver.

824
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:20,608
Who is he?

825
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:22,528
Why should I receive the parcel
since I don't know him?

826
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:23,728
Tang Yan's parcel

827
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:25,488
has always been sent to the loft.

828
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:26,688
You knew that.

829
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:28,048
Don't say you didn't know.

830
00:39:28,288 --> 00:39:29,488
I really didn't know.

831
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:30,728
If you want to sign and receive it,

832
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:31,808
go ahead.

833
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:33,368
I'll just reject it every time I see it.

834
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,648
What do you mean?

835
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:37,768
Are you crazy?

836
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:39,608
Enough.

837
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:40,368
Calm down.

838
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:41,248
Don't be upset with him.

839
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:42,848
He's doing this on purpose.

840
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:44,968
I'll receive it for you, okay?

841
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:47,008
He's doing this on purpose

842
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,208
so that you'll go home.

843
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:50,608
Where do you stay at night?

844
00:39:51,168 --> 00:39:52,008
In the recording studio.

845
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:54,208
Can you even sleep in that place?

846
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:55,328
I can't sleep well.

847
00:39:58,928 --> 00:39:59,768
I remember that

848
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:00,608
Tang Yan gave the song

849
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:01,728
you wrote for him

850
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:03,168
to the tier-three singer

851
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,368
and you didn't say anything about that.

852
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:06,368
Sui is

853
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:07,848
speaking without thinking,

854
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:08,528
but in his heart,

855
00:40:08,768 --> 00:40:10,088
he feels that it's unfair to you.

856
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:11,528
You two

857
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:12,448
have been friends for years.

858
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:13,688
You can't keep fighting with him.

859
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:14,768
Just because

860
00:40:14,968 --> 00:40:16,088
we've been friends for years,

861
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,568
there's something he can't say.

862
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:21,168
Even if 10,000 people

863
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:22,168
think Tang Yan is not the one for me,

864
00:40:22,408 --> 00:40:23,528
I'm fine.

865
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:25,448
Sui Mingwei can't say that.

866
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:26,928
Why?

867
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:31,608
It's because what a good friend says

868
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:32,928
will become like a seed

869
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:34,288
planting in your heart

870
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:35,848
and shaking your faith.

871
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:38,368
I care about that a lot.

872
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:42,288
If it was you,

873
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:44,848
between the one you love
and your best friend,

874
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,288
and you need to choose one,

875
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:47,088
who will you choose?

876
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,208
I'm here. Go back now.

877
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:09,128
How's the new place?

878
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,968
I haven't moved in. I'm still in Jifeng.

879
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:14,928
When are you moving over?

880
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:19,088
Give me some time.

881
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:20,808
Now, Li Hui and Sui

882
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:22,488
are on an argument.

883
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,328
I can't leave them alone.

884
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:25,328
Li Hui has left home

885
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:26,688
for a few days.

886
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:27,568
She's sleeping with Tang Yan

887
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
in the recording studio.

888
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,248
So, these few days,

889
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:34,008
only you and Sui Mingwei
are staying here?

890
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,288
It's not what you think it is.

891
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:39,728
Sui comes back very late

892
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:40,768
at night.

893
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:42,448
He only wakes up at noon
on the next day.

894
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:43,808
If not for work in the station,

895
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:45,608
we basically don't meet each other.

896
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,568
Still you two are staying together
in the same house.

897
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:53,768
Why are you laughing?

898
00:41:58,728 --> 00:41:59,768
I don't meet him

899
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:01,368
as frequently as I meet you.

900
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:12,288
The scene where you two
are not willing to leave

901
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:13,528
reminds me of the days

902
00:42:13,888 --> 00:42:14,368
at the girls dorm entrance

903
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:15,808
in our university.

904
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:17,488
Grab hold of your time, Mr. Xiao.

905
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:18,688
The door is about to close.

906
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:21,608
Don't you come home after midnight?

907
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:23,768
Just occasionally.

908
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:25,968
Okay.

909
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,328
Okay, go home now.

910
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:30,088
Okay.

911
00:42:36,048 --> 00:42:37,048
Open the door.

912
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:44,448
Xiao Shangqi has really matured.

913
00:42:44,848 --> 00:42:46,248
I thought he'd come in.

914
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:52,008
It violates
the house-sharing rules.

915
00:42:52,888 --> 00:42:53,848
Who made the rules?

916
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:55,528
Don't you think

917
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:57,288
our home is

918
00:42:57,328 --> 00:42:58,408
a lot more comfortable

919
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:00,368
without someone with the OCD

920
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:01,728
and tidiness?

921
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:03,608
Sui, look.

922
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,448
Li Hui is back.
