17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,240
Mr. Sun,

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,640
didn't you

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,000
go to Mr. Xiao's place today?

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,000
Why are you back so soon?

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,400
You remember this well.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
I went to Mr. Xiao's place

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,080
last week.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,640
Let's go. Be careful.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Wasn't it today?

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,200
No way.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Look at how confused I am.

28
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,920
The journey is just

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
the short escape and half-time break

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
for pursuing the meaning of life.

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,960
After meeting you,

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,360
the heart that doesn't want to stay

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
has finally settled down.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,280
Jifeng is waiting for you like home.

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,120
Can we change this?

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,160
It's not smooth.

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,800
Also, who wants to hear this

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
on the radio?

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Me.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,280
From the top.

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
From the top.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,760
The journey is just

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,600
the short escape and half-time break

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,160
for pursuing the meaning of life.

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,240
Xiaoran,

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
your emotion is not there.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,080
Give it more.

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,840
The journey is just

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200
the short escape and half-time break

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,160
for pursuing the meaning of life.

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,960
Jifeng is...

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
Hold on.

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,640
This is not natural.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,160
Xiaoran, from the top.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
The journey is just

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,360
the short escape and half-time break...

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,680
From the top, Xiaoran.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Give it more.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
From the top.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,400
Xiaoran,

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,520
maybe you need to find

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,240
the feeling when you were a hostess,

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,720
okay?

64
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,360
Let's do it again.

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,840
Mr. Xiao,

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,280
can we have a minute to talk?

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm going out for a while.

68
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,400
Xiao Shangqi, do you think
this is meaningful?

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,120
Lin Zong suddenly

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,200
asked me to come.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
I didn't know you'll come

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,760
and record for the program.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,720
But, I told

74
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Mr. Ma that

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
Dajiabang For Everyone

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,200
means something to me.

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,640
Do you think I'd believe you?

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,039
Xiaoran.

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,200
Why are you

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,040
avoiding me lately?

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
You didn't reply my text.

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,120
Not disturbing me

83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
is the biggest respect for
your ex-girlfriend.

84
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,800
Don't you know that?

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,560
I know.

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,680
But, can we talk

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,080
and communicate nicely?

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Have you thought of why

89
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,480
every time when Chen Fei'er shows up,

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,280
the way you treat me would change?

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,920
I've been thinking these few days.

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,440
The problem is not Chen Fei'er,

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
but when she's around,

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
it reminds me of why

95
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,480
we

96
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,560
broke up.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,120
Xiaoran.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,720
I admit that

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,960
maybe some of my actions

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
and concern

101
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,160
have caused you to misunderstand.

102
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,680
I apologise to you.

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
But, Fei'er

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,080
reminds me that

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,600
we can't forget about the direction

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,240
for

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
the temporary emotion.

108
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,320
We're no longer

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
walking on the same path.

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,000
But what if someone

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,960
just made a mistake?

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
Carry on then.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
I got it.

114
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
Go back first.

115
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll be there in a while.

116
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,060
(Radio Program Department)

117
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,080
Miss Liu,

118
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm sorry for just now.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,120
Let's do it again.

120
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,040
No worries.

121
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,760
Mr. Xiao has left,

122
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,000
but he said something.

123
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
He said if you're not willing

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,200
to record this,

125
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
he's okay with someone else.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,040
What did you tell him just now?

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
I felt like he was not happy.

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,680
Did you offend him?

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,320
No, I didn't say anything.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Let me tell you.

131
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,880
This was arranged by Mr. Ma,

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
and he asked me

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,960
to let you record a few more times

134
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,440
even though Mr. Xiao
didn't say anything.

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,560
We need to do it thoroughly

136
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
to show that we're doing our part.

137
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,600
Wasn't he being picky

138
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
just now?

139
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,680
No, I was acting.

140
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
However,

141
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,880
to be honest,

142
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,960
my dear,

143
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
have you not been recording

144
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
for a long time

145
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,800
that your voice

146
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,840
is not that nice?

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,960
So, it's not

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Jifeng that

149
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,200
requested me to record this?

150
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
It's arranged by Mr. Ma,

151
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,560
but I guess he

152
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,560
has flattered the wrong person
this time.

153
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
I was thinking too much.

154
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,240
When did you start to

155
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
like planting

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
flowers and plants?

157
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,840
He Xiaoran likes these.

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,920
All these decorations

159
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,200
are fake.

160
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,680
It can't cover how ugly

161
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,760
and how fake the reality is.

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Miss Chen.

163
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,280
You've found your way here.

164
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Did you do this on purpose?

165
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
Why are you everywhere?

166
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,880
You're being ridiculous.

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
I came here first before you.

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,080
I suspect that

169
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,320
you were following me.

170
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,560
Also, Xiao Shangqi is not at home.

171
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,320
I guess

172
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,560
he's being with He Xiaoran now.

173
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,920
He'll not come back so soon.

174
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
You don't have to say that to upset me.

175
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,080
After all, I know where he stays now.

176
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,080
I'll just wait for him slowly.

177
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,400
Miss Chen.

178
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,400
Actually, taking a step back

179
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
at the right time is
stopping loss in time.

180
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,080
So, leaving Zhao Mingxuan

181
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:39,920
was a right choice.

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
But, have you thought about why

183
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,239
Xiao Shangqi doesn't want to see you?

184
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Two more check-ups left.

185
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,840
It's at the front there.

186
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Why am I here?

187
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
I need to go home quickly.

188
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,880
My son is waiting for me to eat.

189
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Madam Wang,

190
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,560
we're here for a check-up.

191
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,280
We'll go back after this.

192
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,800
You're...

193
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,360
Mr. Sun.

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,360
Mr. Sun, I remember now.

195
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,080
We're here for a check-up.

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,120
Let's go.

197
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Miss He,

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,960
will they take Madam Wang in

199
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,720
looking at her disease?

200
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,280
Will they change their mind

201
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,400
after looking at her report?

202
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't worry.

203
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,400
I've talked to them.

204
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,760
Madam Wang has no

205
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,560
children

206
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,560
and guardian.

207
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
But, I've given them

208
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,920
my mobile phone number.

209
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
They'll call me if there's anything.

210
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,520
The nursing home needs you

211
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,880
to have a full body check

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
to evaluate

213
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,480
your body

214
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,360
so that they can

215
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
take care of you better.

216
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,040
Okay.

217
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,680
That's great.

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
We finally

219
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
have a place to stay.

220
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,840
But, Zhao

221
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,800
has taken all the advantages.

222
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,160
He's done so many wicked things.

223
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
How can we do nothing

224
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,560
to him?

225
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
Yes.

226
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
The terrible guy who chased us away.

227
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,280
Is the TV station not
investigating him anymore?

228
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
There are so many of us.

229
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
Do we get bullied for nothing?

230
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
Don't worry.

231
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
People like him

232
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
will be arrested one day.

233
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,520
People like him will get it one day.

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Let's go for the check-up.

235
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,560
It's here.

236
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,640
- Here.
- It's here.

237
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,400
Okay.

238
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,720
Let's go.

239
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
You...

240
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm here for the medicine.

241
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,040
Are you

242
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,920
okay now?

243
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,560
Are you asking me out of concern?

244
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
You arranged a check-up for Mr. Sun
and Madam Wang.

245
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,760
Actually, you could've told me earlier.

246
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,640
I can send them here.

247
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,880
Well,

248
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
the recording...

249
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,640
was indeed arranged by Mr. Ma.

250
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
I've misunderstood you.

251
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,440
How did you know Zhao Mingxuan

253
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,280
will be arrested soon?

254
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,640
Didn't Fei'er get

255
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,920
the evidence to charge Zhao Mingxuan?

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,000
You should be taking your move soon.

257
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Did you walk away from me

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
because of this?

259
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,280
You're thinking too much.

260
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,400
I didn't want her evidence.

261
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,560
I swore in front of my father's grave.

262
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll get back the things

263
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,840
that he protected one by one.

264
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,400
I know that he wanted to protect

265
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,960
my life and Xian's life the most.

266
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,880
I'll use my own way

267
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,600
to investigate this matter.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,840
I don't want

269
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,040
and I can't make this matter

270
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,480
a business deal.

271
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,600
Otherwise, I'm just the same

272
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,800
as Zhao Mingxuan.

273
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Being kids is fun.

274
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,680
A petty toy

275
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,680
can make him so happy.

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,720
Kid,

277
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,800
are you okay?

278
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm sorry, Madam Pretty.

279
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
You're so brave.

280
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
You're not crying even though
your hand is injured.

281
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
My father told me

282
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
all the wounds will heal.

283
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,600
I don't have to be scared.

284
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,520
What's going on?

285
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
I just said you're brave

286
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,240
and now you're not anymore?

287
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,120
There's no more bubble water.

288
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,560
Just buy some.

289
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,360
My father is too busy working.

290
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,640
He has no time to buy it for me.

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,920
Where's your mother?

292
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,360
My mother stays very far away.

293
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,280
What's your name?

294
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm Taiyang.

295
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,120
Taiyang,

296
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
let me bring you to find bubble water,

297
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,360
okay?

298
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Okay.

299
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,840
Let's go.

300
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,680
Madam Fei'er,

301
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm squeezing the detergent.

302
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,680
Okay, we'll mix water,

303
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
detergent and sugar

304
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,920
together.

305
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
Stir it.

306
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,720
Here, give it a try.

307
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,360
Madam Fei'er, you're great.

308
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,120
There's this fragrant smell.

309
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,960
This is nothing.

310
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,080
I didn't even have a bubble maker

311
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
when I was young.

312
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,480
I can play even with a hair tie.

313
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,080
Isn't it great?

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,280
Well, Taiyang,

315
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,560
why are you so familiar

316
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,600
with this hotel?

317
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,160
Everyone knows you.

318
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,120
You can even get something
from the kitchen.

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,160
This is my home.

320
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,640
My father and I have been staying

321
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,680
in the hotel.

322
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,280
Your home?

323
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,360
The staff's son.

324
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,720
Another little Xiao Shangqi.

325
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,080
Madam Fei'er,

326
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,080
do you know Mr. Xiao Shangqi?

327
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,720
Taiyang.

328
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
When does Mr. Xiao Shangqi

329
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,120
work normally?

330
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,360
I helped you to make

331
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,400
the bubble water.

332
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
Mr. Shangqi and I are friends.

333
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,640
Shouldn't you help me

334
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,640
find him?

335
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,280
Okay.

336
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,080
I know where

337
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,520
Mr. Xiao Shangqi's office is.

338
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,840
I've been there.

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,880
Hold on.

340
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,120
This is bad.

341
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,520
My father doesn't allow me to come here.

342
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,200
No worries, let me handle

343
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
this bad guy.

344
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
I won't let your father know.

345
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,040
Miss Chen.

346
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
This is the office area.

347
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Guests are not allowed.

348
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Mr. Lin,

349
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,520
I'm bringing my friend's son

350
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,800
to look for his father.

351
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,680
Don't frighten the kid.

352
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,240
Otherwise, I'll complain about you.

353
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Are you sure that you're his friend?

354
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,320
Madam Fei'er,

355
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,120
he's my father.

356
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,600
Miss Chen.

357
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
Are you here for Mr. Xiao?

358
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,680
You're even using a kid.

359
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,520
Isn't that too much?

360
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Madam Fei'er

361
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,120
helped me fix the bubble maker.

362
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,640
Did you hear that?

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,560
I did your son a favour.

364
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,680
Can you stop making it hard for me?

365
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,920
Mr. Xiao is not around.

366
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,520
Lin Zong,

367
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,440
who are you to make any decision

368
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,400
for Xiao Shangqi?

369
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,880
Why do you think

370
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,160
he doesn't care about me?

371
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,600
How much do you know

372
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,560
about our past?

373
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Or you know

374
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,920
what I possess?

375
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,960
I didn't eat well and sleep well

376
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,240
living in your terrible hotel

377
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,680
in order to find him.

378
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,480
Are you planning to stop him forever

379
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
or you're planning to stop me forever?

380
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,880
Well, give me 10 minutes.

381
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,159
We'll meet at Jifeng's

382
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,120
entrance.

383
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Come on, Taiyang.

384
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Did you have fun today?

385
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll bring you to eat tasty food

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,560
tonight.

387
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,560
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

388
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,920
You're here. Get in the car.

389
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,120
Buckle up.

390
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
Where are you taking me?

391
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,800
This is the biggest market

392
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,040
in Wusu.

393
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,000
There's

394
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,920
a delicatessen owner there

395
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,840
who always gives me a lot of

396
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,640
fried meat balls.

397
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,760
He even taught me how to boil soup

398
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,800
and stew pig's trotter.

399
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm really curious

400
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,520
if a young lady like you

401
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,680
can differentiate

402
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,120
asparagus bean and common bean or not.

403
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,520
Celtuce, napa cabbage,
celery and spinach.

404
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,080
Do you want me to go back there

405
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,880
and explain to you about

406
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,640
silver carp, common carp,
carassius auratus and grass carp?

407
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,400
I didn't know

408
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,560
you've bought these before.

409
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,120
Do you know

410
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,560
the people here like to come here

411
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,640
to buy vegetables

412
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,000
than going to the supermarket?

413
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,880
Are you kidding?

414
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,280
Would Xiao Shangqi come to this place?

415
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,360
Yes.

416
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,600
It's crowded and smelly.

417
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,880
After you've lived here

418
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,760
for some time,

419
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,400
you'll come and buy
vegetables here, too.

420
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,480
It's wasting my time.

421
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,760
You were not happy

422
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,080
when I said you're waste of money!

423
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,680
I'll beat you to death!

424
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,880
You rascal!

425
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,040
(What have you given me)

426
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,080
(since I was young?)

427
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,520
(You're here to destroy)

428
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,720
(what I got through my effort.)

429
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,760
I have no money.

430
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
If you push me to the corner,

431
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,640
we'll just die together.

432
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,320
(Didn't you marry me)

433
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,680
(to cut off the bad past?)

434
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,160
Do you want to eat tanghulu?

435
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
No, it's so dirty.

436
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,960
It's sticky.

437
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,160
Hello.

438
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,600
How much is this?

439
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,160
RMB 10 for one.

440
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,600
It's done.

441
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,720
Here.

442
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,040
I told you I don't want.

443
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,200
Try it. I have wet tissue.

444
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,600
You can wipe your hands.

445
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,600
(Sweet Hour)

446
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,600
Actually, you didn't come to

447
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,360
help Xiao Shangqi, right?

448
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,120
Don't simply say that.

449
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
Didn't Xiao Shangqi tell you that

450
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,920
it's me who told him

451
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
that Zhao Mingxuan caused
his father's death?

452
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,080
I'm always on his side.

453
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
I know about this,

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,960
but you take his side

455
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,560
for a purpose, right?

456
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,680
You told Xiao Shangqi

457
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,560
so that he will owe you a favour.

458
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,760
You came here

459
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,760
saying that

460
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,080
you have the evidence
to charge Zhao Mingxuan,

461
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,320
but I've asked you a few times

462
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,680
yet you're not showing me.

463
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,160
You want Xiao Shangqi

464
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,280
to beg you, right?

465
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,000
You hope that he'll beg you

466
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,520
so that he won't leave you.

467
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,080
Since he owes you,

468
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,360
he'll keep you by his side.

469
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,240
Then you'll have a chance

470
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,080
to start all over again with him, right?

471
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
So, you did all these

472
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,480
for the evidence I have.

473
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,280
Do you think everyone

474
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,560
is scheming like you

475
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,880
every day

476
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
to live on?

477
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,120
I did all these

478
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,160
to show you the human touch

479
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,240
in this city

480
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,200
to tell you

481
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,480
He Xiaoran and Xiao Shangqi

482
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,920
didn't keep their relationship

483
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,920
by business deals.

484
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,600
They eat here

485
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
here,

486
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,280
walk here

487
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,560
and live here every day

488
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,400
without talking about any deals

489
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
and thinking about the consequences.

490
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,560
What are you trying to say?

491
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,120
That day, you said

492
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
the flowers and plants

493
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,560
are fake and used to cover things up.

494
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,440
Do you know that

495
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,760
it's the reality that Xiao Shangqi

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
cares the most?

497
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,360
It's still the same question.

498
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,280
Do you know why Xiao Shangqi

499
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,800
doesn't want to see you?

500
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,800
Because he will never

501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,320
make a deal using relationships.

502
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
I heard from Taiyang that

503
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,480
his mother

504
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,360
has left him

505
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,760
since he was little.

506
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,120
A single father who was dumped

507
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,880
shouldn't point fingers around here.

508
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm tired. I'll go back first.

509
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,320
Li Hui.

510
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,040
Zheng Jie.

511
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,600
I'm the producer

512
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,560
of this music recording studio.

513
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,760
(Zheng Jie, Music Producer)
I've heard about you before.

514
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,320
I've listened to you singing

515
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,320
"Yes" online.

516
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
I admire your talents.

517
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,360
I want to sign you.

518
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,200
Just because of "Yes"?

519
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,000
That's a very old song.

520
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Didn't you perform here

521
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,200
last week?

522
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,360
But my performance was cancelled.

523
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,360
Li Hui,

524
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
I can tell you this boldly.

525
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,520
You're the singer that I'm looking for.

526
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
Luckily, I came back to take my things.

527
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,400
Otherwise, I would've missed out

528
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,760
on a rising star like you.

529
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,200
Your music

530
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
is great and it can become hit songs.

531
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Once it's published,

532
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,640
you'll become popular.

533
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Of course.

534
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,720
We've just met today.

535
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,040
You can think about it.

536
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,040
Okay?

537
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,680
I'll think about it.

538
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,160
Okay.

539
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,160
Xiao Shangqi

540
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
is proving to you that

541
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,240
he's no longer

542
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,040
going to be

543
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,360
Chen Fei'er's saviour

544
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,080
anymore.

545
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,640
Do you think he's trying to

546
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,880
get back together with you?

547
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
He just wants to guard

548
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,200
his promise to his father,

549
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,520
not using himself

550
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,040
to exchange with anything.

551
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
It seems like he's picked himself up.

552
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,880
I'm happy for him.

553
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,800
Do you think Chen Fei'er

554
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,080
is bluffing?

555
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,560
Can you two be serious?

556
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Let's go to the

557
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,280
tabletop game shop tomorrow.

558
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,880
Playing game like this is not fun.

559
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,080
I'm not going tomorrow.
I have something on.

560
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,600
What's it?

561
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,240
I didn't tell you about this.

562
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,320
When we were

563
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,320
at Hao's place the other day,

564
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,800
a music producer

565
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,560
heard me singing

566
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,080
and he wants to sign a contract with me

567
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,000
and produce music together.

568
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,840
Really?

569
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,240
That's great.

570
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,840
Sign a contract?

571
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,760
What does it mean?

572
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
Will you be free

573
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,240
to hang out with me then?

574
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Are you a baby?

575
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,440
Can't you eat,

576
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,600
cross the road and live

577
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,560
alone?

578
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Even if I don't sign a contract,

579
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,280
I can hardly take it anymore.

580
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,400
Leave me alone.

581
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,680
I just want you to think clearly
about it.

582
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,320
Don't sell yourself in a hurry.

583
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I'm very clear about it.

584
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,440
Thank you.

585
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
Come on. Let's continue.

586
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,640
It's your turn.

587
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,120
Really?

588
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,520
Three.

589
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,560
I'll go home.

590
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,560
Hui.

591
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,640
Why are you here?

592
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,320
Today,

593
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,400
I'll bring you to a nice place.

594
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,440
There's a new

595
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,280
kart racing track.

596
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,640
I'm not going.

597
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm going to meet Jie.

598
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,840
No.

599
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,320
Is he in such a hurry?

600
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,480
He looks for you every day.

601
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,680
Jie values my talent.

602
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,880
Is there a problem?

603
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,080
Hui, I think

604
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,680
this is not a trivial matter.

605
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
We should plan carefully.

606
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,840
Also,

607
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,880
today's weather's nice.

608
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
It's good for kart racing.

609
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,760
Let's go.

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,920
Sui.

611
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
I know you're still

612
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,880
in a bad mood,

613
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,640
but you can't

614
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,000
stay this way forever.

615
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
You're afraid that after
I signed the contract,

616
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I'll not be free to

617
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,640
hang out with you anymore, right?

618
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,480
But I have something

619
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
that I want to do.

620
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
Music has been my dream.

621
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
You know that.

622
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
I'll surely take this step.

623
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,240
Stop discouraging me

624
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
if you're my friend.

625
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm leaving.

626
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,200
I don't mean that.

627
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,760
Miss Chen.

628
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,640
You...

629
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,400
What? I'm sick of Jifeng's food.

630
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,720
Can't I get some other food?

631
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,160
No.

632
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,200
I just wanted to tell you that

633
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,920
if you want to eat some buns,

634
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,080
Jifeng's kitchen will have

635
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,120
staff benefits

636
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,040
on every Friday night.

637
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,120
I'll be making it. It's nicer than this.

638
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
Do you like
the beef and scallion filling?

639
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,680
Who wants to eat your bun?

640
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,240
I've kept my stuff

641
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
and checked out.

642
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,600
Are you going back to Hupu?

643
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,120
You don't have to know where I'm going.

644
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,280
Father. Madam Fei'er.

645
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,560
Slow down.

646
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,680
Why are you back so early?

647
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,880
The kindergarten teacher

648
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,600
called you,

649
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,720
but you're not in the hotel.

650
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
A few kids in the class

651
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,840
were vomiting.

652
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
They're worried that it's virus

653
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,920
so they asked the kids to go home.

654
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,080
Come with me and stay in the hotel

655
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,080
in the afternoon.

656
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,920
Let's go. Come to my office.

657
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,120
Madam Xue is not free today.

658
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,640
She's on leave.

659
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,400
No worries, why not

660
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,400
I get a colleague who is
on an off day to take care of him?

661
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,760
Taiyang,

662
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,680
hang out with me, okay?

663
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,920
Okay, I want to hang out
with Madam Fei'er.

664
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,280
Didn't you check out?

665
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,920
Since you've taken care of me
these few days,

666
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,280
I'll return you the favour.

667
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,440
Let's go, Taiyang.

668
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,240
Let's go.

669
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,440
Let's go.

670
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,160
Madam Fei'er, let me teach you.

671
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,760
Sketch the letter, R.

672
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,240
Link it together.

673
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Then the face.

674
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,040
Nose.

675
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,200
Mouth.

676
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,320
Eyes.

677
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,160
Hair.

678
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,480
Is it nice?

679
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,080
It's nice.

680
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,880
Taiyang.

681
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,480
What's this?

682
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,960
This is the photobook that

683
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,040
my father made for me.

684
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,640
My father said kids have no memory,

685
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
so he records it for me.

686
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,400
Well, Madam Fei'er,

687
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,200
do you remember

688
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
about your childhood?

689
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,640
How I wish I could

690
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,160
forget it all.

691
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,400
It's not good to remember what happened.

692
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,360
Madam Fei'er,

693
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,160
I don't know these words.

694
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,760
Can you read it for me?

695
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,200
(Hello, baby)
It's too busy in the hotel tonight.

696
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,480
After bathing and feeding Taiyang,

697
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,040
I didn't bring him to bed

698
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,960
according to the schedule

699
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,120
and I left him alone

700
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,880
in the children centre.

701
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,360
He was happy for the first hour

702
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,400
but he was then tired and hungry.

703
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
He cried for more than 10 minutes.

704
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,440
That's his first time crying like that.

705
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,120
I felt bad and guilty.

706
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
Today, I started to feed Taiyang

707
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,280
his first fruit, apple.

708
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,520
I'm afraid it's not easy to digest

709
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,600
so I steamed it for five minutes.

710
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,920
As it's fruit,

711
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
I didn't blend it into the rice noodle.

712
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
It can't be frozen.

713
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,000
I kept a box for the afternoon.

714
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,760
Taiyang's facial expression told me that

715
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,920
it's sour.

716
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,640
(Taiyang likes this board book)

717
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,320
(called Spot Goes to the Farm.)

718
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,280
(He knows all the animals)

719
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,200
(on every page.)

720
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,720
(Whenever he cries,)

721
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,600
(he'd stop crying)

722
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,920
(once I said we're looking for Spot.)

723
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,800
(I brought Taiyang to eat dumpling.)

724
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,680
(He licked the spicy fried clams.)

725
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,200
(It's too spicy for him,)

726
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,280
(and he asked me
if he can wipe his tongue)

727
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,640
(with tissue.)

728
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,560
(Taiyang's first ambition is)

729
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,480
(to become a train driver.)

730
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,480
(I have to record this for him.)

731
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
(Taiyang is going to
the kindergarten today.)

732
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,200
(My son is growing up.)

733
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,840
(Choosing his clothes)

734
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,120
(every morning)

735
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,880
(is harder than any work.)

736
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,600
(Today, it's the first time Taiyang)

737
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,960
(asked about his mother.)

738
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,600
(I told him that)

739
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,760
(all the happy things in life)

740
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,800
(are given by his mother with love.)

741
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,760
(My son, actually, sensing happiness)

742
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
(is a great ability.)

743
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
(It's not luck,)

744
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,200
(neither is it fate.)

745
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
(One day,)

746
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,360
(you'll be able to create it.)

747
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,680
Stay fresh at night.

748
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,760
Mr. Lin, look.

749
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,160
The young master of Deju is dating
a mysterious girl

750
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
overseas.

751
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
He seems to have recovered
from his failed marriage.

752
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,880
Miss Chen

753
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,400
had two men

754
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,120
fighting for her on the wedding,

755
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,400
but look,

756
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,280
everything was in vain.

757
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,200
Well, extend her stay here.

758
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,080
I'll pay for her room.

759
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,840
When you give her

760
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,440
the room card,

761
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,480
tell her that our hotel
has this promotion

762
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,800
that she gets to stay three more days
for free after staying for five days.

763
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
But, isn't she going back to Hupu?

764
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,360
If she's going back to Hupu,

765
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,440
why would she agree to

766
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,080
keep Taiyang company?

767
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
I think she has nowhere to go.

768
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,560
Well, she has stopped

769
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,840
ordering food in the restaurant.

770
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,560
I guess she doesn't

771
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,680
have much money left.

772
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,040
Okay, do as I said.

773
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,280
Okay.

774
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,640
Rascal.

775
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,360
You damaged your shoes like me.

776
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,160
I need to buy you new shoes.

777
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,760
You came early.

778
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
I've just started.

779
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,520
You have to wait for a while

780
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
before the buns are ready.

781
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,480
Let me tell you.

782
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,320
Don't underestimate my skill.

783
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,480
This is the staff benefit in Jifeng

784
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,600
that can keep the most people.

785
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,920
Do you know how?

786
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,960
You seem skillful.

787
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,560
This is women's

788
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,520
job.

789
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,000
What do you mean?

790
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,080
Are you sexist?

791
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,160
In the current world,

792
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,160
there's nothing

793
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,799
men can't do.

794
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,120
There's nothing

795
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,920
women can't do either.

796
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,719
Take me as example.

797
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,319
When I was taking care of Taiyang,

798
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:42,239
he was only one year old.

799
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,520
I didn't know anything

800
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:46,440
about diapers,

801
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:47,719
infant formula,

802
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,719
and baby stuff.

803
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,239
Now, I realised that

804
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,840
Internet and technology

805
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,480
are two weapons in the society.

806
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,280
A man can become a mother as well.

807
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,280
That's right, Mother Lin.

808
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,880
I have yet to thank you.

809
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,400
You helped Taiyang to match his clothes.

810
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,840
Well,

811
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,680
what do you plan to do in the future?

812
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,880
What?

813
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,800
You've now become my mother?

814
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,720
Or you want to find a stylist

815
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,560
for your son?

816
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,040
No.

817
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,560
I'm just asking.

818
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,280
Few days ago,

819
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,760
I suddenly saw Zhao Mingxuan's news.

820
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,120
That's not weird.

821
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,480
After all, besides her,

822
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,040
there will be

823
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,480
third and fourth Chen Fei'er.

824
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,000
But honestly,

825
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,320
am I more beautiful
or she's more beautiful?

826
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,000
It's not just your beauty

827
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,520
that's better than her.

828
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,600
The buns that I steamed

829
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,040
are almost done. I'll take a look.

830
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,680
It's just done. Here.

831
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,040
Come and taste it.

832
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,080
It's hot and good for the stomach.
Hurry.

833
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,840
Be careful.

834
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,000
How is it?

835
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,200
I liked to eat my mother's

836
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,560
beef and scallion buns

837
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,840
when I was little.

838
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,640
But, she will only make it

839
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,800
when my brother wanted to eat it.

840
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,040
Also, I can only eat one.

841
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,320
No one wants me if I eat too much
and become fat.

842
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,000
You can eat all the buns

843
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,160
you want here.

844
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,600
Hello.

845
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,240
It's so late now,

846
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,240
and you're still in the cement plant?

847
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,720
I'll ask Mo to pick you up.

848
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,800
Okay.

849
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,240
It's Xiao Shangqi?

850
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,840
He has been investigating

851
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,480
Zhao Mingxuan's projects day and night.

852
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,760
He has also been to all the

853
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,880
concrete batching plants

854
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,840
in Wusu.

855
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
He doesn't want to rest

856
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,040
just because he's young.

857
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,800
Let me meet him once.

858
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,740
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

859
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,160
I heard from his secretary that

860
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,640
this is the primary data

861
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,760
of the two projects.

862
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,320
Those in the company are fake.

863
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,240
Zhao Mingxuan locked these documents

864
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
in the safe.

865
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,920
I left in a hurry

866
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,040
so I only took a few pictures.

867
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,680
It's not comprehensive.

868
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,240
It's okay.

869
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,760
As long as we have a target,

870
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,240
we don't have to go
without any direction.

871
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,520
Why?

872
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,360
I really like Wusu.

873
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,560
I want to start all over again here.

874
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,920
Don't worry.

875
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,960
I want to start all over again here

876
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
by myself.

877
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,360
Xiao Shangqi,

878
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,840
you know me.

879
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,720
I planned each and every step

880
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,160
I took.

881
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,520
But after I came to Wusu,

882
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,960
I realised that planning everything
in advance

883
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,720
will lose the fun of surprises.

884
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,840
Now, I know

885
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
being happy is a capability.

886
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,640
I don't depend on fate, luck

887
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
or business deal.

888
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,640
So, I want to try

889
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
moving forward with unknown

890
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,400
and see if I can get what I want.

891
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,520
Thank you.

892
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,880
I'm leaving now.

893
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,320
I'll get two reliable men

894
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,440
to investigate in Hupu.

895
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,880
No need.

896
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,760
I know who is more suitable to

897
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,640
do this.

898
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,760
Xian.

899
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,280
Qi,

900
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,480
I know

901
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,760
you feel like killing him now,

902
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
but we need to stay calm.

903
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,440
This can't even be counted as evidence.

904
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,240
We need to discuss about

905
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,160
what to do next.

906
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,640
Let me think about it.

907
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,840
This brooch

908
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,280
was given to us by father

909
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
during the 10th anniversary of Yunlan

910
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,040
when we were wearing suit

911
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,760
for the first time.

912
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,040
Father asked us about it

913
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,520
and you said it was lost.

914
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,440
I didn't know it's still here.

915
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,080
In my heart,

916
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,800
it was once lost,

917
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,960
but now,

918
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,760
I've found it.

919
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,000
Xian,

920
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,280
we need to protect Yunlan.

921
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,640
Okay.

922
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,360
Okay.

923
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,960
Mingxuan,

924
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,400
I need to talk to you.

925
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,160
Now, I have the most shares in Yunlan.

926
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,640
My word carries weight.

927
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,240
Can you let me go,

928
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,040
please?

929
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,360
Okay.

930
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,920
See you in a while.

931
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,200
Zhao Mingxuan,

932
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,440
I'll never let this slide!

933
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,440
Mr. Zhao.

934
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,600
Don't get this wrong.

935
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,040
He doesn't come

936
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,720
to interrogate me.

937
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,240
He's here to ask for a job.

938
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,360
Xiao Xian!

939
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,960
Just wait.

940
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,080
I'll never let you two

941
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
ruin my father's work!

942
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,040
Okay.

943
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,520
From now on,

944
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,880
we'll go on separate ways.

945
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,400
We'll use our own ways

946
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,720
to protect father's wishes,

947
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,160
okay?

948
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,320
You brothers are

949
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,800
very good at acting.

950
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The set that we've planned

951
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,920
is finally going to be useful.

952
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,760
It's going to be a tough battle.

953
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,920
Don't worry.

954
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,040
As long as you and Xian are together,

955
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,640
you'll be able to turn the tables.
