17
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,536
You suddenly ran over here.

18
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,376
Watch first before you jump.

19
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:06,216
She was saved

20
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,096
and she's sitting there.

21
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,136
You didn't even look carefully.

22
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,856
I saw your jacket on the lake.

23
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:11,215
So many people were
surrounding the lake.

24
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,096
The wind was so strong just now.

25
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,936
My colleague borrowed my jacket.

26
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,496
The people you saw

27
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:21,896
were looking for the equipment.

28
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,136
How would I know?

29
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,536
I thought you fell into the lake.

30
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:28,456
At least you know

31
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,656
I can swim.

32
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:31,336
It has nothing to do with

33
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:32,336
if you can swim or not.

34
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:33,896
I was afraid that you...

35
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:42,656
Are you okay?

36
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:51,936
Do you remember that you said

37
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:54,456
most of the farewells

38
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,056
are sudden?

39
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,496
It's rare to have the chance

40
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:02,496
to prepare to lose.

41
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,456
I've experienced it

42
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,016
too many times.

43
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:08,416
I don't want to experience it anymore.

44
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:13,856
Breaking up with you is

45
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:15,256
the silliest decision that I've made.

46
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:18,536
So, I'm willing to wait for you
for a lifetime.

47
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:22,656
But, I was really afraid

48
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:23,616
to lose you, that I can't wait for you,

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,976
and I can never see you anymore.

50
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:33,536
Xiaoran.

51
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:36,736
I don't want to lose you anymore.

52
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:00,056
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:03,656
I've troubled you and your colleagues.

54
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,695
I didn't know the water was so deep.

55
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:20,496
Do you know what?

56
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:21,776
Your face was pale

57
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:22,656
and terrifying.

58
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,296
You look better now.

59
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:31,496
I'm fine.

60
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,056
Don't be stressed.

61
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:39,456
Don't neglect your work

62
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:40,696
and stay here with me.

63
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:43,456
I won't let you marry me

64
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:45,216
to return the favor.

65
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:52,576
Have you forgotten that
we've agreed to meet today?

66
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:53,576
I was supposed to look for you
in the homestay

67
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:54,656
after the interview.

68
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:55,536
Don't you remember?

69
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:03,772
Luckily, I put it in my bag.

70
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,092
I found it under the pillow

71
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,412
when I was putting Taiyang to bed.

72
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:17,332
(Xiaoran.)

73
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:19,692
(He Xiaoran.)

74
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,172
I think I pressed it accidentally

75
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:24,092
on the night that

76
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:26,532
I was admitted.

77
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:27,612
(Xiaoran.)

78
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:29,812
(He Xiaoran.)

79
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:31,092
I was feeling dizzy.

80
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,092
I can't remember.

81
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:36,492
(Xiaoran.)

82
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,652
You recorded for four hours.

83
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,332
I've listened to it the whole night.

84
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:43,492
I heard how you were calling my name

85
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:44,532
when you were sick.

86
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,212
I can hear the weak side of yours

87
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:50,332
that you'll never

88
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:51,892
show me when you're well.

89
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,332
Whenever you call my name,

90
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,132
I'd feel sad

91
00:05:58,372 --> 00:05:59,212
and my heart aches.

92
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:02,452
It's worse than

93
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,332
the time when we broke up.

94
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:11,332
So, Xiao Shangqi,

95
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:14,772
I'm looking for you today

96
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,572
to tell you that

97
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,332
I don't want to lose you either.

98
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:24,812
I don't want you

99
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,812
to be sad alone.

100
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:33,172
I'll be with you from now on.

101
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:37,812
Furthermore,

102
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,172
I've saved you just now.

103
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:41,932
You should marry me

104
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,092
to return the favor.

105
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:48,892
Xiaoran,

106
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:52,452
I should've told you earlier

107
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:54,892
that I can't live without you.

108
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,092
I need you.

109
00:06:59,092 --> 00:06:59,612
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,132
I'm sorry, too.

111
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,012
I know what you're afraid of

112
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,012
the most.

113
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,012
I know you regret the most

114
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,372
for not being able to make up

115
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:17,172
your relationship with your father.

116
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:20,812
You're right.

117
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,812
If something happened to you today,

118
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:26,892
or something happened to me,

119
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:28,452
we can no longer

120
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,492
be together anymore.

121
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:34,532
I'll never let that

122
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:35,212
happen.

123
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:38,652
We'll never let that happen.

124
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:00,972
It's my mother.

125
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:03,932
Hello, mother.

126
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,372
What?

127
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,092
Why are you seeing him again?

128
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,652
This rascal has hurt you

129
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:16,172
many times.

130
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,012
He's forced you to leave Hupu twice.

131
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,212
Don't you think it's too much?

132
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:19,652
Father.

133
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:20,572
Mr. He, Mrs. He,

134
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:21,852
I've indeed done

135
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:22,892
something bad before.

136
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,012
I've opened a room

137
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:24,732
in Jifeng for you.

138
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:25,732
Take a rest there.

139
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:26,692
There's no need for that.

140
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:29,852
We've booked a hotel.

141
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:35,252
Jifeng is just

142
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:36,452
across the radio station.

143
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,292
Didn't you come to visit me?

144
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:39,051
Father,

145
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,571
you can see where I'm working

146
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,412
from the room in the hotel. It's nice.

147
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,212
We'll pay for it.

148
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,652
What are you waiting for? Lead us there.

149
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:07,972
Meng.

150
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,052
Mr. Xiao, you're here.

151
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:12,412
It's too early for supper.

152
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:13,252
It's not ready.

153
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:15,052
There's peanut here.

154
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:15,692
Eat this.

155
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:16,692
Thank you.

156
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:23,812
What's going on?

157
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:27,452
Meng.

158
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:29,812
If your daughter's boyfriend

159
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:30,772
has made you angry,

160
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,412
what do you think he can do

161
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,052
to make it up?

162
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:36,252
I'm so annoyed by him!

163
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,612
How dare he even come?

164
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:40,732
What's wrong?

165
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:42,852
No father-in-law in the world

166
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:44,332
likes to see his son-in-law.

167
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,212
It's so annoying.

168
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,012
You'll know

169
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,292
when you have a daughter.

170
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:56,172
What's wrong?

171
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:57,932
Nothing.

172
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,372
You don't say. This is knowledge.

173
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:08,332
Let me see

174
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:10,812
how I can make my father-in-law happy.

175
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,372
Learn slowly, silly boy.

176
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:20,092
Meng, carry on.

177
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:20,932
I'm leaving now.

178
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:22,772
I've just fried the dish.

179
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:23,892
Put it in the fridge.

180
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:32,972
What are you thinking?

181
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:47,172
Xiaoran.

182
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:49,772
I'd like to bring Mr. He and Mrs. He out

183
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:50,452
for a meal tomorrow.

184
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,052
Why not we slow things down?

185
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,132
My father is short-tempered.

186
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,372
It's not easy this time.

187
00:10:57,932 --> 00:10:58,852
Also, they're going to

188
00:10:59,012 --> 00:10:59,892
the loft tomorrow.

189
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,092
Then I should just join you.

190
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:03,492
No.

191
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:05,572
I guess my father

192
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:06,692
will not treat you nicely.

193
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,372
I've just

194
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:09,852
got you back.

195
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,212
Even if I'll be slapped,

196
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:11,892
I'll go.

197
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:12,972
Really?

198
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:19,332
Xiaoran.

199
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:24,652
It's good to have you by my side.

200
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:28,812
Do you think

201
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,012
I'll wake up tomorrow

202
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:31,372
and realize this is just a dream?

203
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:37,052
Does it hurt?

204
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:39,772
It doesn't.

205
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:44,292
Is this a dream?

206
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:46,892
It's not real enough.

207
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,372
Are you still dreaming?

208
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:54,092
I don't think so.

209
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:00,172
I think it's real.

210
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,052
I don't want you to go home.

211
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:09,572
Better sleep early.

212
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,132
The battle with my parents

213
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:13,732
is not easy.

214
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:19,892
Okay.

215
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:32,163
(Yunlan Jifeng)

216
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:34,892
Have you eaten?

217
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:36,732
I need to go back

218
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:37,852
and research on this red bean soup.

219
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:38,972
It's tasty.

220
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:41,852
The snacks are all tasty.

221
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:42,532
Good morning!

222
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:43,412
Father.

223
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:44,012
Mother.

224
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:45,452
Good morning, Xiaoran.

225
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,332
Did you sleep well?

226
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,252
Not bad.

227
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,372
Hello, Mr. He, Mrs. He.

228
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:06,412
Come in.

229
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:09,692
I wanted to come earlier

230
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:10,492
to look at how

231
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:11,412
your house looks like.

232
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,012
So, it looks like this.

233
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:15,532
I was wondering why

234
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,652
you're dwelling in this place

235
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:18,732
and not going home.

236
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:20,492
Come on, mother.

237
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:21,812
Sit on the sofa.

238
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:23,652
Look at the style.

239
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:25,972
Li Hui is not at home now.

240
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:26,812
I'm staying here alone.

241
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:29,572
You're staying here alone.

242
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:30,892
It's not safe.

243
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,772
How is it not safe?

244
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,852
The combination lock

245
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,012
was fixed for us by

246
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:38,332
Xiao Shangqi's staff from Jifeng.

247
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:47,012
Did your housemate, Wei,

248
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,772
go home as well?

249
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,052
Coming.

250
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,212
You're at home.

251
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:00,452
Why are you here?

252
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,412
I'm here to give you this.

253
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,092
Our new fragrance.

254
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:05,612
Wei.

255
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:06,652
Mr. He, Mrs. He, you're here.

256
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:07,372
Wei.

257
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:07,932
Hello.

258
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,132
When did you come?

259
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:11,772
We were talking about you.

260
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:12,772
Take a seat, Mrs. He.

261
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:16,092
We were too rushing in Hupu.

262
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:17,732
We didn't get to talk to you.

263
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:19,572
We have time now.

264
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:20,732
Mr. He, Mrs. He,

265
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:21,932
stay in Wusu for a few days.

266
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:22,492
I'll make the arrangement.

267
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:23,452
I'm familiar with Wusu.

268
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,012
We were thinking about

269
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,172
where to eat lunch.

270
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:28,292
I'll buy you lunch.

271
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:30,012
There's a new restaurant nearby.

272
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,492
It's owned by my friend.
The food is tasty.

273
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:32,692
Well...

274
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:34,932
Mr. Sui,

275
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,532
you're so busy.

276
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,972
You don't have to worry about this.

277
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,092
I'll arrange for the lunch.

278
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:41,492
Look at you.

279
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:42,572
You don't get it.

280
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:43,812
There's nothing more important than

281
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,172
accompanying Mr. He and Mrs. He.

282
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:46,812
You're busy with your work.

283
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,092
Get back to work quickly.

284
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:51,092
We're not eating out

285
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,092
for lunch.

286
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,412
He and I

287
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,372
will cook

288
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:55,812
a Hupu's home-cooked meal.

289
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:57,372
Stay and eat with us.

290
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:58,012
Okay.

291
00:14:58,172 --> 00:14:59,652
Yes, it's happening with more people.

292
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:00,372
Yes.

293
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,292
Let us cook.

294
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:22,612
Let me do it.

295
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,492
Mr. He, you like watching football?

296
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,052
Of course.

297
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,652
He'd stay up the whole night to

298
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:29,492
watch the UEFA
European Football Championship.

299
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:31,812
Mr. He,

300
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,492
which team do you support?

301
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:35,252
It's...

302
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,292
Which team do you support?

303
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:49,332
Which team?

304
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,012
- Argentina.
- Brazil.

305
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:55,932
Argentina.

306
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:59,052
It is my least favorite team.

307
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:03,892
Mr. He.

308
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:04,932
Mr. He.

309
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,532
Neymar is

310
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:07,732
the greatest player of all time.

311
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:10,132
I like Neymar, too.

312
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:10,572
Really?

313
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:12,852
After Neymar was injured,

314
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:14,692
they only have Fred,

315
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:16,092
Walker and Oscar

316
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:16,892
left in the roster.

317
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:18,732
Look at the forwards.

318
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:21,532
I've finally won.

319
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:23,932
Right? He...

320
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:26,212
Wei.

321
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:27,892
When you come to Hupu,

322
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:28,932
drop by.

323
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,412
I'll show you Neymar's

324
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,132
photo with his autograph.

325
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:32,172
Really, Mr. He?

326
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:33,412
When did you get that?

327
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:35,852
I won't simply show it.

328
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:37,532
Seriously?

329
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:38,652
I need to have a look.

330
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:39,172
- Yes.
- Mr. He.

331
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:40,492
I'd like to take a look, too.

332
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:43,132
Forget about it.

333
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:45,732
Who knows if

334
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,492
you've broken up by then or not?

335
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:50,012
Father.

336
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:52,092
Mr. He.

337
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,052
I'll never hurt Xiaoran anymore.

338
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:57,012
I'll never let her go anymore.

339
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:58,252
You've done that before.

340
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,212
How do you prove that?

341
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:03,532
We'll get married.

342
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:06,732
I'll prove it with a lifetime.

343
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:14,452
How can you simply say that?

344
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:20,732
I know it's too reckless

345
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:21,492
to talk about this.

346
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:23,371
However, Mr. He, Mrs. He,

347
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:24,492
please give me some time.

348
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:26,892
I'll prove it with actions.

349
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:45,572
Mr. He, let me see you out.

350
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,212
(Blue Friend Creative Community)
No need.

351
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:49,612
No need.

352
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:50,932
Call you later.

353
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:52,212
Okay.

354
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:55,252
Be careful.

355
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:03,772
Dude,

356
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:05,892
you're brave.

357
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:07,772
You even talked about

358
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:08,772
getting married.

359
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:12,132
This is the first time I salute you
for what you did.

360
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:16,052
My mother passed away

361
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:17,412
when I was young.

362
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:19,812
I have no concept

363
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,612
about marriage.

364
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:22,572
What I can imagine

365
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,052
is the feeling of Xiaoran's parents.

366
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:29,452
The decision today

367
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:30,492
was quite sudden,

368
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:32,892
but I feel good

369
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,492
after saying that.

370
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,172
I want to form a family.

371
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:40,572
Xiaoran is already my family

372
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:42,292
that I can't live

373
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:42,932
without.

374
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:52,372
Marriage is for a lifetime.

375
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,892
I live

376
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:57,732
for today.

377
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,052
I've never thought of
spending the rest of my life

378
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,172
with someone

379
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,492
besides

380
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:04,732
Li Hui.

381
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:10,292
Are you free later?

382
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:12,572
Why?

383
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,052
Qi

384
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,492
wanted to give us

385
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:27,652
an assurance,

386
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,612
but your father

387
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:30,892
got a surprise instead.

388
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:32,812
He spoke about marriage

389
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,852
instead of just dating.

390
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:37,612
Ran,

391
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:39,772
what do you think?

392
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:46,212
I think marriage is too early

393
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:47,492
for me now.

394
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,132
But if it's

395
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,572
Xiao Shangqi...

396
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:57,852
Drink some milk.

397
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:02,532
No rush.

398
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,012
Here.

399
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:06,732
Come here.

400
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:14,172
Stop.

401
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:16,012
Look at this.

402
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:17,212
This.

403
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,452
Be nice.

404
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,332
Be nice.

405
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:25,172
Get up.

406
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:27,932
Look at this.

407
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,692
Look at this.

408
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,052
I think it's not bad.

409
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,292
Ran,

410
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,732
I'll sleep with you tonight.

411
00:20:58,652 --> 00:20:59,172
What about me?

412
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,132
Go back to the hotel.

413
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:02,812
Ran is getting married.

414
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:03,852
It's a big deal.

415
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:05,452
I need to discuss with her.

416
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:08,012
Yes, you need to discuss about it.

417
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:23,772
Let's go up.

418
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:26,012
Let's go.

419
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:28,732
Actually, I realized that

420
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,332
the young people now

421
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:33,092
know nothing about marriage.

422
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:35,612
Or I'd say that

423
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:37,252
you have no desire to get married.

424
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,932
But, I've thought about it.

425
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:41,292
I'll never force you to get married.

426
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:43,532
I'll give you
the courage to stay single.

427
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:45,852
Actually, before today,

428
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:47,332
I've never thought of this.

429
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:51,172
Ran,

430
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,452
not getting married

431
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:55,532
doesn't mean you'll not be happy.

432
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:56,892
It doesn't mean you'll be happy

433
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,692
after getting married either.

434
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,852
Actually, when two people get married,

435
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:04,092
you'll face many

436
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,212
trivial matters in life
that you can hardly imagine.

437
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,212
So, before you make any decision,

438
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,652
you must figure out

439
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:12,652
why you want to get married.

440
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:20,012
I...

441
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:25,132
I want to give him a home.

442
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:30,292
Mother.

443
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:33,932
Xiao Shangqi

444
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:35,812
has lost both his parents.

445
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,892
When he was young,

446
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,172
his mother has passed away.

447
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:41,212
His father didn't know

448
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,572
how to express himself.

449
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:45,452
Actually, all these years,

450
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:46,812
his relationship with

451
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,972
his father and his brother

452
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:51,572
was hidden and twisted.

453
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,772
We don't have a chance

454
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,052
to choose

455
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,892
which family

456
00:22:58,092 --> 00:22:59,052
we want to be born into,

457
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:01,012
but we can choose

458
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,772
what family we want to build.

459
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:05,252
So, I want to make it up to him

460
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:06,732
the love he was lacking of.

461
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:17,532
My daughter has grown up.

462
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:22,612
Don't worry.

463
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,092
I'll talk to your father.

464
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,292
Actually,

465
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:34,812
I don't trust Qi much,

466
00:23:36,052 --> 00:23:37,532
but I trust my daughter.

467
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:40,372
I'm sure he's worthy to be loved

468
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,172
since you love him so much.

469
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,572
(I'm waiting for you downstairs.)

470
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:55,732
Are you looking for Qi?

471
00:24:59,292 --> 00:24:59,732
Go ahead.

472
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:06,761
(Blue Friend Creative Community)

473
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:12,092
Here.

474
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:15,692
What's this?

475
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:17,812
Get in the car first.

476
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:49,612
You must be tired.

477
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,052
What goes around comes around.

478
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,332
I didn't expect that

479
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:54,132
I stayed up the whole night

480
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,292
to prepare for

481
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:56,532
He Xiaoran's proposal.

482
00:25:57,612 --> 00:25:59,332
Here, Espresso.

483
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:00,612
You can surely stay awake until the end

484
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:01,492
with widen eyes.

485
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,692
You're working hard on this.

486
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:06,572
What kind of a proposal

487
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,692
would you like to have?

488
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:14,652
They're coming.

489
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:20,572
Have you convinced her?

490
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:26,092
I was asking her why

491
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:28,332
she wants to get married.

492
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,732
I thought

493
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:32,612
she wants to settle down

494
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,172
and live

495
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:35,932
a simple life with him

496
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:38,052
to experience a different life.

497
00:26:39,412 --> 00:26:41,372
Guess what she said.

498
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:44,812
She said she wants to give Qi a home.

499
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,012
I can't keep her anymore.

500
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:05,332
He.

501
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,052
Actually, I think

502
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:11,972
Ran's lucky to have

503
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,372
this kind of relationship.

504
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:15,732
You should

505
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:17,812
change your mind.

506
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:19,932
Just treat Qi

507
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:23,012
as your son.

508
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:25,372
Think about it.

509
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:27,972
His father has passed away.

510
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:31,412
Your fatherly love

511
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:34,212
is overflowing.

512
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:36,052
Just give him some.

513
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:38,652
Then

514
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:40,252
we're not giving away our daughter,

515
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,652
but we're bringing a son

516
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:43,412
back home.

517
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:46,092
Isn't that great?

518
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:54,972
Where's Xiaoran?

519
00:27:58,772 --> 00:27:59,492
Ran

520
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:02,812
must be experiencing

521
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,972
the most beautiful moment

522
00:28:05,132 --> 00:28:07,132
in her life now.

523
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:17,652

00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:50,812
that I booked can be cancelled

692
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:51,692
within 24 hours.

693
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:55,012
Think about it.

694
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:56,692
Even though we're taking a flight

695
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:58,012
back here,

696
00:39:58,452 --> 00:39:59,852
you would've used up more than

697
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:01,532
half of your leave.

698
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:05,732
When we're back,

699
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:06,732
you'll realize that

700
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,972
actually the most beautiful moment

701
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,772
is not the destination,

702
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:12,412
but the journey.

703
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:15,972
Okay.

704
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,972
I'll rent a recreational vehicle.

705
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:19,652
Okay.

706
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:20,732
We'll split and take action.

707
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,812
We're running out of time.

708
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:23,212
Hurry up.

709
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:23,732
Okay.

710
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:25,652
I want to just depart now.

711
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:26,772
I want to just go now.

712
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:28,572
We need to first rent

713
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:29,292
the car.

714
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:31,492
We'll walk there.

715
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,012
Let me see. Yes.

716
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:36,572
Actually, we can take a rest here.

717
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:37,532
Okay.

718
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,492
First day and second day.

719
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:43,652
Let me do this.

720
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,252
We need two more chairs. Go get them.

721
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:50,892
You're here.

722
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:53,372
We need two more chairs.

723
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:55,492
Have you thought about

724
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,052
why He Xiaoran wants

725
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,612
to hold the banquet at home?

726
00:40:58,812 --> 00:40:59,532
She doesn't want you

727
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:00,972
to make it grand.

728
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:02,652
This is not grand.

729
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:05,772
Here.

730
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:06,972
I've picked this for you.

731
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:08,252
The car is outside.

732
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:10,492
Just call me if you need anything.

733
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:11,372
Thank you.

734
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:17,092
You'll be married tomorrow.

735
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:17,932
How do you feel now?

736
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:21,732
I feel stable.

737
00:41:22,252 --> 00:41:23,092
I feel like being caught

738
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,132
tight.

739
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,732
Don't be jealous.
You'll have it as well.

740
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:30,492
Why are you so proud of yourself?

741
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:37,532
Didn't you invite Hui?

742
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:39,012
We did, but she's not coming.

743
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,372
If you want to see her,

744
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:42,932
go find her.

745
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:54,252
Have the cross-cupped wine!

746
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:56,732
- Have the cross-cupped wine!
- Have the cross-cupped wine!

747
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,652
- Cross-cupped wine!

748
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:02,252
- Have the cross-cupped wine!
- Have the cross-cupped wine!

749
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:04,372
- Cross-cupped wine!
- Cross-cupped wine!

750
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,452
Great!

751
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:10,772
My fish is done.

752
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:11,692
Eat first.

753
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:13,012
- I'll go get the fish.
- I'll help you.

754
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:14,572
Eat first.

755
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:15,532
Come on.

756
00:42:15,812 --> 00:42:16,532
Here.

757
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,972
Is she your girlfriend?

758
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:20,852
Let's eat.

759
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:23,372
She looks familiar.

760
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:31,932
No.

761
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:34,692
I'm Xiaoran's high school classmate.

762
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:36,212
Now, I'm an employee in Jifeng.

763
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:39,612
So, Mr. Lin

764
00:42:39,692 --> 00:42:40,652
is your superior.

765
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:42,812
No wonder you're taking care of his son.

766
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:46,572
Yes.

767
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:47,852
Li Hui is making a video call.

768
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:51,452
Hui.

769
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:52,932
Congratulations.

770
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,052
I have a performance tomorrow.

771
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,212
So, I can't be there.

772
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:57,372
I'll drink here with you.

773
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,492
- Come on.
- Come on.

774
00:42:58,732 --> 00:42:59,332
Thank you. Cheers.

775
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:03,452
The home banquet is not bad.

776
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:06,092
Yes, Sui is here as well.

777
00:43:06,412 --> 00:43:06,812
Here.

778
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:08,372
