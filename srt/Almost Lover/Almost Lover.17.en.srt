Your daughter

18

is not a quilted jacket,

19
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,641
but a money printing machine.

20
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:46,881
I'm blessed.

21
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,521
They've been dating for so long

22
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:49,761
yet we've never seen him here.

23
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:50,441
Yes.

24
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,201
Nine characters.

25
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:53,361
My son-in-law is earning money

26
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,081
every minute.

27
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:54,761
Why should he come here?

28
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,721
Playing mahjong with us?

29
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,481
They should invite me to their house

30
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,841
if they want to see me.

31
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,201
Five dots.

32
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,121
Really?

33
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:03,801
Mrs. Chen,

34
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,081
did he buy a house for Fei'er?

35
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,801
Of course. Nine bamboos.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,121
Bring us there

37
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,281
to check out the new house

38
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,441
and widen our horizon.

39
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,161
That's right.

40
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,121
They're busy with the wedding.

41
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:18,081
They won't have time for us.

42
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,961
Four bamboos. Mrs. Chen.

43
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,361
Which mother doesn't help

44
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,481
in the wedding planning?

45
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,881
Does he not want you there?

46
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,401
Five bamboos.

47
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:28,481
I think I'm right.

48
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,321
- How can that be?
- One character.

49
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:32,881
Six characters.

50
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,081
I think you guys don't believe me.

51
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,761
- Of course.
- Of course.

52
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,881
Here.

53
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,041
What is this?

54
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:43,681
What is this?

55
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:46,441
My daughter's new house keycard.

56
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,921
Thank you, Mingxuan,

57
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,881
for giving my beloved daughter

58
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:51,841
the warm companion and

59
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,881
for giving her the support

60
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,801
she needs to

61
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,241
weather through all storms.

62
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,121
Fei'er,

63
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,121
no matter where you are,

64
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,361
father and mother will always be

65
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,201
there for you.

66
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,081
Come home often.

67
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,161
All right. You guys go back first.

68
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,121
I think the first couple is better.

69
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,921
They're good at acting and passionate.

70
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,481
Did Zhao Mingxuan force you to do this?

71
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,561
I wanted it.

72
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,801
How did they treat me

73
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:43,841
since young?

74
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,121
You've seen it all.

75
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,721
This is the life that I got
through my effort.

76
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,841
I don't need them to take part.

77
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,761
Yes, they are not worthy.

78
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,321
But if you do this,

79
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,321
your whole life

80
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,801
will become a movie.

81
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,641
I know you and Xiao Shangqi

82
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,961
despise me for doing that,

83
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:06,521
but I'm willing to do that

84
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,481
because I believe that

85
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,881
the character they are referring to

86
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:10,801
is me.

87
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,921
Talented yet humble.

88
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,121
I have parents who love me dearly.

89
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:19,441
He Xiaoran,

90
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,361
not everyone's reality

91
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,561
can be shown to the world.

92
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,041
What are you thinking?

93
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,081
I may not have the right

94
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,001
to dictate your way of life,

95
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,121
but I wanted to say,

96
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,241
since this is the case,

97
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:39,361
why don't we find an actress

98
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,401
to be the bridesmaid?

99
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,721
This is the peak of my life.

100
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:47,641
If no one that I knew in the past

101
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,521
is here,

102
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,521
who is going to see my highlight?

103
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:02,881
Miss Chen,

104
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,761
you should come back urgently.

105
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,481
Your family is here.

106
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:19,761
Why was my budget rejected?

107
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:21,201
You want to auction that

108
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,561
limited edition piano as
a performance piano.

109
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,361
Zhao Mingxuan will not

110
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,241
reimburse you for it.

111
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:24,961
Shen Meng is the most important guest

112
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:25,881
at the wedding.

113
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:26,921
He just got off the plane

114
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,041
and his itinerary has been exposed.

115
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:29,281
He is furious.

116
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,601
So, we must satisfy

117
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:31,681
all of his demands.

118
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:32,401
Qi.

119
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:35,521
You have no idea

120
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,681
how expensive things are.

121
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,321
Deju did it.

122
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,601
Exposing Shen Meng's plan

123
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:43,561
is the largest blow to

124
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,881
Yunduan Hotel and the wedding.

125
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,321
On the surface,

126
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,321
the hotel has suddenly become famous,

127
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,201
but people within the industry

128
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,401
would surely talk about

129
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,681
our failure to protect confidentiality

130
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:51,961
and poor emergency response.

131
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,041
Will the owner or the management company

132
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,401
take the blame for this?

133
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:01,721
Hello, father.

134
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:03,721
Xiao Xian.

135
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,281
Madam Zhang made dove soup for you.

136
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,641
Drink it, go home and rest early.

137
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,561
All right. Thank you, father.

138
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,521
Is Qi there with you?

139
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,121
Do you want to speak to him?

140
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:17,041
No need.

141
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:17,881
Tell him

142
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,961
to keep his schedule clear.

143
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,201
Ask him to accompany me to

144
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,521
play golf with Mr. Gao.

145
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,281
Fine, I got it.

146
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:30,441
Father is meeting Mr. Gao for golf.

147
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,921
He wants you to go with him.

(General manager: Xiao Xian)

149
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,321
Father.

150
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,081
I didn't know I could

151
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:17,921
buy this here.

152
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,681
It still tastes the same.

153
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:27,721
I loved this drink

(Dafu Grocery Store)

156
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,001
You must be tired.

157
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,401
We've been socialising all day.

158
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,601
It's boring.

159
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,241
Well, Qi,

160
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:51,481
when your mother

161
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,561
and I were young,

162
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,721
we stayed in this alley.

163
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:56,961
You weren't born yet.

164
00:07:57,641 --> 00:08:00,761
(Dafu Grocery Store)
Your brother was around three years old.

165
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,760
(Dafu Grocery Store)

166
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:03,601
(Dafu Grocery Store)
He was this tall.

167
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,561
He would squat by the door,

168
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:07,801
waiting for your mother and I

169
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,721
to bring him drinks and snacks.

170
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:11,641
After we had you,

171
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,641
we moved to the large villa.

172
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,961
Growing up here would be fine, too.

173
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:24,121
Qi,

174
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,401
do you still remember your mother?

175
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,401
We were still young then.

176
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,361
Your mother

177
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,601
wanted to do everything by herself.

178
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:39,680
(Dafu Grocery Store)
Our life slowly

179
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:40,680
(Dafu Grocery Store)
got better,

180
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,281
but your mother suddenly left us.

181
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:47,481
I handed you to the nanny.

182
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,881
I didn't pay attention to you.

183
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,881
I didn't take care of you a lot.

184
00:08:58,241 --> 00:08:59,121
After that, your brother

185
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,001
crippled his leg in that incident.

186
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,281
He was a good child,

187
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,761
but after that,

188
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,281
he's always having low self-esteem.

189
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,001
I feel so sorry

190
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,161
toward your mother.

191
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,121
If I was with you both that day,

192
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,241
that may not have happened.

193
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,561
Humans

194
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:24,881
will always find

195
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:25,961
a proper excuse

196
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,121
to escape responsibility.

197
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,121
So, I pushed it all

198
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,801
unto you.

199
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,441
Would I have

200
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,201
- felt less guilty that way?
- Father.

201
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,201
I didn't blame you.

202
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,241
Nonsense.

203
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,681
You were only eight years old.

204
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:43,881
How could you not?

205
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,281
If you didn't, why did you avoid me?

206
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,961
That's really strained

207
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,281
our relationship.

208
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,201
It felt like we were strangers.

209
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,121
All these years, as I see your brother,

210
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,681
I feel like I owe him a lot.

211
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,121
I want to make it up to him.

212
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,201
Xiaoran is right.

213
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,041
I didn't ask you

214
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:16,041
and I used you to

215
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,401
lessen my guilt toward your brother.

216
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,961
You had to go through a lot

217
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,321
but received so little love.

218
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,641
I nearly forgot

219
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,481
you're my son as well.

220
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,681
Did Xiaoran tell you that?

221
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:40,361
Sometimes, Xiaoran

222
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,481
texts me via WeChat

223
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:43,921
to talk about you.

224
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,281
Qi,

225
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:48,500
I feel that Xiaoran's personality

226
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,520
(Dafu Grocery Store)
I feel that Xiaoran's personality

227
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,681
(Dafu Grocery Store)

228
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,761
(Dafu Grocery Store)
is rather blunt.

229
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:52,041
(Dafu Grocery Store)

230
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,561
(Dafu Grocery Store)
This part is similar to your mother.

231
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,321
Well, I heard she's willing to stay here

232
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,321
and get a job in Hupu TV station
because of you.

233
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,361
How's it going?
Do you need me to help her?

234
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:01,921
No need.

235
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,401
She'll be able to do it herself

236
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,561
as long as that's what she wants.

237
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,281
Qi,

238
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:11,721
I have a feeling.

239
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,041
If you stay,

240
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,401
something good will happen to Yunlan.

241
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,561
What makes me happier is,

242
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,401
you and I

243
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,041
will have more time

244
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,041
to get to know

245
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,601
each other properly.

246
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,260
(Dafu Grocery Store)

247
00:11:59,001 --> 00:11:59,841
Xiaoran.

248
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,321
Did you wait long?

249
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,001
Mr. Xiao.

250
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,401
Do you know

251
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:06,521
what day is it today?

252
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:08,201
The weekend you've been waiting for.

253
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,401
My parents have arrived
at the spa hotel.

254
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,241
My apologies, I forgot.

255
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:21,001
I've been so busy these days

256
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,561
hosting Shen Meng and
with the wedding.

257
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:24,721
Hurry up.

258
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,401
What do you want to eat?
I'll make a reservation.

259
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,121
I came here to pick my boyfriend up.

260
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:30,321
Do I need your help?

261
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,841
Let's go. I have my own plans.

262
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,961
Where are we going?

263
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,561
I'm satisfied.

264
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,521
These were our childhood snacks.

265
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,641
I found these after

266
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,801
visiting so many shops.

267
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,321
Sadly,

268
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,481
the steamed buns from
Miss Yang's shop are no longer around.

269
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,721
I didn't think these
stalls are still open.

270
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,081
My girlfriend,

271
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:00,961
you're amazing.

272
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:02,721
Compared to you,

273
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:04,961
I'm so unimaginative and thoughtless.

274
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:07,481
Right. Take this meal as making up

275
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:09,401
for you not being prepared.

276
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,001
Also,

277
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:13,401
we'll surely run into people you know

278
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:14,321
at the high-class restaurants

279
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:16,281
you made reservations at

280
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,281
and you'll talk business again.

281
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:20,041
This place is much better. How nice.

282
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:25,561
Don't worry.

283
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,921
When their wedding is over,

284
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,801
the situation will get better.

285
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,761
Forget it.

286
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,401
I was mentally prepared

287
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,121
for tight situations like this

288
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,841
when I stayed on.

289
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,201
So, I brought in

290
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,641
these for brownie points.

291
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:46,961
I forgot that drink

292
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:47,961
we used to buy.

293
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,361
I'll go get it.

294
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:50,601
I just drank it with my father

295
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:51,441
two days ago.

296
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:52,881
You

297
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,001
and your father?

298
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:55,961
Together?

299
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,881
Nice.

300
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,281
That's thanks to someone

301
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,441
being the double agent

302
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,601
between us.

303
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:04,761
What double agent?

304
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,481
I'm the renowned hostess

305
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:08,401
of Dajiabang For Everyone.

306
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:10,561
You must know that our program

307
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:11,841
is very popular.

308
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,521
Most of my audiences are
above middle-aged.

309
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:14,961
So, I get along very well

310
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:15,801
with the elders.

311
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:17,721
Right. You're the famous hostess.

312
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,241
In just a few months,

313
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,201
I feel like

314
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,121
working in Dajiabang

315
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,641
was a very long time ago.

316
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:30,321
Actually, you can listen

317
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:31,961
to them through the Internet.

318
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,961
Let's go buy drinks.

319
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,561
Take it.

320
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:45,761
Sorry.

321
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:49,441
It's Fei'er.

322
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:54,441
Hello?

323
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,921
All right. Got it.

324
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,161
Hold on.

325
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:06,841
Fei'er's piano is spoiled.

326
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,201
I have to go take a look.

327
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,281
Go on then.

328
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,401
We came all the way here for food

329
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:15,681
yet work still finds its way to you.

330
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,201
Not bad.

331
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,161
I'll make it quick.

332
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,161
That's fine.

333
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:33,201
Help me pack up.

334
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:34,241
I'll go look for Li Hui.

335
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:35,881
All right.

336
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,041
Come.

337
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:44,321
Another one.

338
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:45,481
Go away.

339
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:46,401
All right.

340
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:50,921
He has to be there

341
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,441
personally just to tune it?

342
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,681
Lately, when we're dating,

343
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:58,801
all sorts of people

344
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,641
keep calling him. How annoying.

345
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,241
What kind of people?

346
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:05,801
It sounds like it's just

347
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:06,761
Chen Fei'er.

348
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,481
Is she done or not?

349
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,041
She isn't doing it on purpose this time.

350
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,281
Officially, her wedding

351
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,201
is an important event
for Yunduan Hotel.

352
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,561
There must not be any mistakes.

353
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:18,841
On a personal level...

354
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:20,561
Did you know

355
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:21,641
when we were in school,

356
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:23,521
Xiao Shangqi and I

357
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,161
had to take on a lot
of their family matters.

358
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,201
I can't count the number of times

359
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:29,521
we saved her

360
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,441
from her father's wrath.

361
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,361
Sometimes, I wish

362
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,241
she acted up more.

363
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:37,801
At least I would have a proper reason.

364
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:40,721
Tell me.

365
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,681
We've been friends

366
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,521
for so many years.

367
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,881
How can I just stand by and watch?

368
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:46,641
I can't.

369
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:50,641
Now,

370
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,401
do you still trust Xiao Shangqi?

371
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,121
Of course.

372
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,841
I know he has been

373
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:56,561
reassuring me.

374
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,241
That's fine then.

375
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,561
Stop sulking.

376
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:05,481
What is this?

377
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,441
This is pork ribs with rice cake.

378
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:09,401
It's delicious.

379
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,080
The sauce is really good. Try it.

380
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,041
It's nice.

381
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,801
Right?

382
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,120
This is sold by the

383
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:18,840
neighbour downstairs.

384
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:19,281
It's really good, too.

385
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:20,161
I got these chicken feet

386
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:21,041
from a

387
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,120
small stall nearby.

388
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,481
We loved these when we were young.

389
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,881
Mr. Xiao, the piano is tuned.

390
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:39,081
Don't worry. It's fine now.

391
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,201
All right. Thank you.

392
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:40,881
I'm leaving now.

393
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,121
Sorry.

394
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:44,961
I wanted to try it out first.

395
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:46,481
I didn't think that once it was moved,

396
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:47,561
it wouldn't work.

397
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,561
I'm too frantic about
working with Shen Meng.

398
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,921
It seems you need more practice.

399
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,161
I really hate this song.

400
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,841
A Midsummer's Night Dream.

401
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:20,561
I don't have good dreams.

402
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,961
It should be a Summer's Nightmare.

403
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:25,881
Fei'er.

404
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:32,401
Do you feel like this piano

405
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:33,721
looks like

406
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:35,401
a monster with its mouth wide open?

407
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:36,881
What kind of a married life

408
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,281
do you think it would

409
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,481
swallow me into?

410
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:06,481
Do you remember this

411
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:07,641
Bird in the Dream?

412
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,561
It was my favorite song in high school.

413
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,201
You listened to it

414
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,401
with me back then.

415
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:07,121
Got it.

416
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,241
I told you. I didn't lie to you guys.

417
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:11,961
My sister is marrying to

418
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:13,161
a rich man in Hupu.

419
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:14,921
I will pay back my debts.

420
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:16,801
There's still RMB 200,000 left.

421
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:18,001
When will you pay up?

422
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,721
As soon as possible.

423
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,521
I'll go look for my sister again.

424
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:23,481
Hurry up.

425
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:39,121
Little brat,

426
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:40,081
did you steal

427
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,081
your sister's card?

428
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,401
That money was to buy a car.

429
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:43,481
Got it.

430
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,081
We'll buy the car tomorrow!

431
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:52,841
Get out!

432
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:54,041
Don't push me.

433
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:55,041
I'm here to look for someone.

434
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,121
What do you do?

435
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,081
I'm looking for someone.

436
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:57,761
This is my sister's home.

437
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:58,881
Who are you looking for?

438
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,041
Without the owner's permission,

439
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,801
you cannot enter.

440
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,641
This is my sister's home.

441
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:02,961
Why can't I enter?

442
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:04,801
Who is your sister? Get out!

443
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:06,201
Let me tell you.

444
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:07,961
I am Chen Fei'er's brother.

445
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:09,001
Her biological brother.

446
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:09,841
When Miss Chen left,

447
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:10,881
she specifically said that

448
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:11,881
any guests visiting

449
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:12,681
as family

450
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,001
will be forbidden from entering.

451
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,081
Fine. You just wait.

452
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:22,481
Sorry.

453
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,521
The number you have dialled

454
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:24,841
cannot be reached.

455
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,401
Please try again later.

456
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,001
Sorry.

457
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:52,121
Fei'er,

458
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:53,321
shall we practise one more time?

459
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:54,601
There's one day left.

460
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,121
Do you think it'll help?

461
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:00,521
Hello?

462
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:02,801
Got it.

463
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:04,441
Shen Meng agreed

464
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:05,561
to change the song.

465
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:06,961
Did he?

466
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:09,241
Yes. He wants the Bird in the Dream.

467
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,801
Isn't that your specialty?

468
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:11,601
He said in the

469
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,521
rehearsal later,

470
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,081
he would go along with you.

471
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:15,801
Mr. Zhao takes care of you so much.

472
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,241
He must have requested Shen Meng

473
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,121
to change it.

474
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:20,321
Fei'er.

475
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,321
(I just want to win.)

476
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,841
(Why can't I just secure)

477
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:32,721
(one victory in my life?)

478
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:37,881
(Fei'er.)

479
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:39,961
(I'll protect you next time.)

480
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:43,921
(Xiao Shangqi.)

481
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,001
(This is my favorite song.)

482
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,441
(The Bird in the Dream.)

483
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:49,321
(Fei'er.)

484
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:50,681
(I'll find the best)

485
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:51,921
(plastic surgeon to cure you.)

486
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:53,561
(Don't worry.)

487
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:55,681
Even if your wound cannot be cured,

488
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:58,321
I will marry you.

489
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,641
Please change

490
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,601
all the flowers here.

491
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,441
The theme is purple.

492
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:19,561
Hello, Miss Chen.

493
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,241
You asked Shen Meng to change the song?

494
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,081
I know it must be you.

495
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:32,721
Zhao Mingxuan wouldn't

496
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,841
do that for me.

497
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:36,761
That's all I can do for you.

498
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,001
All these years,
I've been planning carefully

499
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,081
and walking on thin ice.

500
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:46,361
No one actually cares about me

501
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:47,481
and concerns about me.

502
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:49,481
There's only you in the end.

503
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,361
You support me

504
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,921
every time I'm in trouble.

505
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:57,561
Shangqi,

506
00:23:58,201 --> 00:23:58,921
I regret it.

507
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:00,961
I don't want to get married.

508
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:05,601
Just once.

509
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:07,961
I just want to be happy once.

510
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:09,801
Can you pull me like how you did

511
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:12,201
in the relay race?

512
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,041
What are you doing?

513
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:18,961
Don't say that here.

514
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,201
Let's go in and talk.

515
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:29,241
I changed the song.

516
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,641
I wanted to make sure

517
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,121
there are no mistakes in the wedding.

518
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,201
Including your performance
with Shen Meng.

519
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:37,441
Don't lie to me.

520
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:39,681
Xiaoran and I saw

521
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:41,441
the time capsule.

522
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,921
You said you would protect me

523
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:45,801
no matter when it is.

524
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,161
Shangqi,

525
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:51,841
I'm tired of acting

526
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,081
and wearing a mask

527
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,681
all the time.

528
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:57,521
I'm panicking.

529
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,561
I don't know if I've

530
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,401
made the right choice.

531
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:01,881
You know me.

532
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,081
Growing up in that family,

533
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,121
you can only tell

534
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,041
who is the one loving me

535
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:08,761
with time...

536
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:09,801
Your family

537
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,761
shouldn't be the reason you do things.

538
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:13,601
If you're tired,

539
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,121
then take down that mask

540
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:17,561
and be the real you.

541
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,201
If you don't want to get married,

542
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:23,601
just tell me.

543
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:26,121
So, Yunlan can do

544
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:27,081
the necessary.

545
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:50,441
Chen Fei'er,

546
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:53,281
what are you doing?

547
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:55,881
You're one step away.

548
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,801
No regrets.

549
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:31,601
You played it better

550
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:32,641
than I imagined.

551
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:34,801
This is my favorite song

552
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:36,001
in high school.

553
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,761
Every time I hear it,

554
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,041
I am reminded of a good friend

555
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:41,801
as if

556
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,161
I went through the best time

557
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:46,081
in my life with him.

558
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:47,801
Your good friend

559
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:48,961
must be Mr. Xiao,

560
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:50,721
who convinced me to change the song.

561
00:26:59,201 --> 00:26:59,681
Are you tired?

562
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,641
Xiaoran.

563
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:05,961
Ever since we met at Hupu

564
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,921
and through the wedding preparations,

565
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,601
a lot has happened.

566
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:11,681
I'm really tired.

567
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:13,801
My thoughts are in a mess.

568
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:15,921
I have lost composure.

569
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:17,641
I've made you feel

570
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:19,201
uncomfortable, too.

571
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:22,241
But everything will be
fine after tomorrow.

572
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:25,641
I'm getting married tomorrow.

573
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,521
Fei'er.

574
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,401
I wish you all the happiness.

575
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,881
Of course, I worked so hard.

576
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,201
On this world,

577
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,961
only you and Xiao Shangqi

578
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:48,081
are the ones who truly want me
to be happy.

579
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,001
I finally get it.

580
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:52,801
Only if you both stay at Hupu

581
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,401
and Triangle remains,

582
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,401
that is the best ending,

583
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:57,521
right?

584
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:03,161
Pick up.

585
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:09,761
What's wrong?

586
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:12,361
The people attending the party

587
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:13,441
are all the big shots.

588
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:14,361
The employees here

589
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,681
wouldn't dare offend them.

590
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,321
This waiter is new.

591
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:19,601
He's clumsy

592
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,361
and flipped Mr. Zhao's wine glasses.

593
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,201
He hurt his hand, too.

594
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,201
Let's have a look first.

595
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:27,961
Let's go.

596
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,401
I think let's call it a day.

597
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,401
I'll get someone to clean up.

598
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,921
Please have some rest.

599
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:41,721
Don't be late for tomorrow.

600
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:42,561
All right?

601
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:43,521
Clean up?

602
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:46,961
Is the environment here

603
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:48,281
too lowly for you,

604
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:49,081
Xian?

605
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,721
Where is Xiao Shangqi?

606
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:54,801
Why did we get someone who

607
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:55,561
doesn't drink and smoke?

608
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:56,761
To put us off?

609
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:05,841
How did you get in here?

610
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,161
I'm the bride's brother.

611
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:08,001
Could you kindly

612
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:08,921
show us your invitation card?

613
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:10,881
I don't need any invitation card.
Get lost.

614
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,161
Tell Chen Fei'er this.

615
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,921
If she doesn't want to see me today,

616
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,241
she'll regret it tomorrow.

617
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:41,041
It's been a while.

618
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,081
It's been a while.

619
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,321
Where are you going for your honeymoon?

620
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:58,121
We haven't thought about it.

621
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,601
It depends on Mingxuan's schedule.

622
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:00,761
Maybe Paris.

623
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,001
- Paris?
- Paris?

624
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,521
What's that nice smell?

625
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:06,841
Is that Furma?

626
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:08,081
I don't know

627
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,001
the brand either.

628
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,961
I think Mingxuan asked someone

629
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:11,681
to custom-make it.

630
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,041
Mingxuan truly loves you.

631
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:14,601
Fei'er, you're so lucky.

632
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,641
Today is your son's

633
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:17,321
special day.

634
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,601
Congratulations.

635
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:18,961
Zhenyun.

636
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:20,361
Excuse me.

637
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,201
It's been a while.

638
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:22,721
It's been a while.

639
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:23,641
Thank you, Yunlan,

640
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,881
for putting together

641
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,561
Mingxuan's wedding.

642
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,761
We're on the same side.
Don't worry about it.

643
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,161
I'm envious

644
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:31,241
of you both as a couple.

645
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:32,401
You've retired overseas

646
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:34,561
and you're living a carefree life.

647
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:37,241
We're all just

648
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:38,041
outdated old folks.

649
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:39,601
What can we do if we can't let go?

650
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,961
Xian and Qi are well trained by you.

651
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,321
You should take a break.

652
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,321
Mr. Zhao.

653
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:46,721
I'll go greet them.

654
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:50,721
Father.

655
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:52,441
It seems Mr. Zhao

656
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:53,521
doesn't know how tricky

657
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:55,361
our relationship is with Deju.

658
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:56,681
He doesn't know?

659
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,201
He knows very well that

660
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:01,041
his son is trying to get rid of us.

661
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,281
He just acts dumb.

662
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:03,761
Sir,

663
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,481
we've looked into that matter.

664
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:08,081
Let's go over there.

665
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,961
The bouquet looks a little wilted.

666
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:18,281
It was exposed under the sun

667
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:19,161
during the outdoor shoot.

668
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:20,281
Spraying some water on it will do.

669
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:21,921
No. Do up another one.

670
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:22,681
All right.

671
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:24,481
The outfits that we've matched

672
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:25,721
should be taken to the ballroom.

673
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:26,681
All right.

674
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:28,481
These shoes are uncomfortable.

675
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:29,641
Please think of a way.

676
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,041
Got it. We'll sort it out right away.

677
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:36,761
Xiaoran.

678
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:41,721
Why aren't you mingling with the guests?

679
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,801
That would help Xiao Shangqi's

680
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,521
career.

681
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:47,881
What can I do to help him?

682
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,881
These people either come from
a rich family or

683
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:50,961
married to rich husbands.

684
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:52,641
You should get to know them

685
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:54,081
and get acquainted with them.

686
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,041
Social circles are
business opportunities.

687
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:57,961
I don't know them.

688
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:00,881
Do you know why

689
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,481
they're cold towards you?

690
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:03,401
Because you're just

691
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:04,441
Xiao Shangqi's female partner.

692
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:06,361
Female partner?

693
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:09,921
Girlfriend, lover or fiancee.

694
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,641
To them, you're just his female partner.

695
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:13,161
Who cares about you?

696
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:18,241
I know that you think

697
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:20,481
me entertaining them

698
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:21,401
is laughable,

699
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,761
but did you think that

700
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:23,561
you could stay out of this

701
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:25,321
by marrying Xiao Shangqi?

702
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:28,721
Sooner or later,

703
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,201
you'll become like me.

704
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,601
Independent woman?

705
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:32,801
News ideal?

706
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:36,401
In the future, Yunduan's high tea

707
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:37,721
will be your battlefield.

708
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:41,561
That cannot be.

709
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:45,481
I'm doing this for your own good.

710
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,361
Since we'll be fellow

711
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,841
comrades in Hupu,

712
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:50,921
right?

713
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:52,881
Fei'er.

714
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,001
If everything is fine here,

715
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:54,921
I'll head out first.

716
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:58,761
All right. You can head to the

717
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,201
ballroom's waiting room directly.

718
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,001
I want to be alone for a bit.

719
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,081
Are you nervous?

720
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:07,601
When someone is

721
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:08,921
getting closer to success,

722
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,640
one would feel anxious

723
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:14,761
and panic.

724
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:29,441
Have a drink.

725
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:30,041
Cheers.

726
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:34,761
Xiaoran.

727
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:36,241
Excuse me.

728
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:36,881
It's fine.

729
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,161
Don't move.

730
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,321
You're perfect now.

731
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:02,321
When did you prepare this?

732
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:04,081
I thought about it when
you were trying

733
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:04,961
out your bridesmaid dress.

734
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:05,961
Do you like it?

735
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:10,161
Shangqi.

736
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:16,001
When the wedding ends today,

737
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:18,081
can we return to the lives

738
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,281
we had when we were at Wusu?

739
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:22,881
When are you referring to?

740
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:26,321
I mean,

741
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:30,241
no matter

742
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,841
how Fei'er's

743
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:32,601
marriage life unfolds,

744
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,001
it has nothing to do with us?

745
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:38,481
Of course.

746
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:41,161
Xiaoran, I promise you.

747
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,081
After this wedding,

748
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:44,921
Yunlan will not

749
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:45,841
depend on Deju anymore.

750
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,041
We don't have to

751
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,401
put up all this act anymore.

752
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:51,481
We can prepare to

753
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:52,481
live our simple lives.

754
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:55,001
Mr. Xiao.

755
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,441
We meet again.

756
00:36:58,721 --> 00:36:59,161
Nice to see you.

757
00:36:59,441 --> 00:36:59,761
Nice to see you.

758
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,721
You're young and successful.

759
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:02,561
Your father and I

760
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,841
have known each other for many years.

761
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,001
The board is very interested

762
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,961
in your idea.

763
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:08,321
Do you think we can

764
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,921
talk about it after the wedding?

765
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:12,521
Let me introduce you.

766
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,721
This is my girlfriend, He Xiaoran.

767
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:16,761
Miss He, what business

768
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:17,561
does your family do?

769
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,281
My family isn't running any business.

770
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:21,961
My mother is an art teacher.

771
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:24,401
Mr. Xiao,

772
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:26,561
why not we talk somewhere else?

773
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:29,441
Apologies, today I...

774
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:30,041
Go on.

775
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:31,641
Li Hui and Sui have just arrived.

776
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:32,481
I'll go look for them.

777
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:35,801
All right.

778
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:36,961
I'll come find you

779
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:37,601
when I'm done.

780
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,041
No need. You go ahead.

781
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:39,641
Go on.

782
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:41,241
Go on.

783
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:41,961
All right.

784
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:43,481
Sure. This way, please.

785
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:44,001
All right.

786
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:51,641
(Girlfriend, lover or fiancee.)

787
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,281
(To them, you're just his female partner.)

788
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,841
(Who cares about you?)

789
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:08,361
It works.

790
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:09,201
Great.

791
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:09,481
Hello.

792
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,441
This is our most popular

793
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:10,921
model.

794
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:12,241
You can get in and try.

795
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:12,961
Dear.

796
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:13,441
Take a look.

797
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,241
Get in.

798
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:19,161
It's spacious.

799
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,961
This car has a trendy outer look.

800
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:23,121
Its interior is classy, too.

801
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:25,361
It is classy.

802
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:26,321
It is beautiful.

803
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:27,561
It is so nice.

804
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:29,321
This car only costs
a few hundred thousand.

805
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,201
Look at Zhao Mingxuan's.

806
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,441
That's nice.

807
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,361
Let's look at other cars.

808
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,441
Don't compare with your brother-in-law.

809
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:36,921
Don't be ungrateful.

810
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,201
Your father and I

811
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,481
put down our pride

812
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,241
and fought with your sister for this.

813
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:42,041
That's right.

814
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,081
Buying a car

815
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,121
isn't a small matter.

816
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,201
Let's have a look somewhere else.

817
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:49,641
My son,

818
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:53,561
you don't like anything.

819
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:55,401
Your sister is getting married today.

820
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:56,881
We can't show off

821
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:57,601
about the wedding.

822
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,161
We should at least drive a car back.

823
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:00,401
Mother, let's look elsewhere.

824
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:01,481
Miss, we're paying by card.

825
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:02,281
All right.

826
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,281
Look at this color.

827
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:04,961
I like it so much.

828
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:05,521
This will do. Not bad.

829
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:06,481
Very good.

830
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:12,321
Excuse me.

831
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:13,921
This card has insufficient fund.

832
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:15,241
Do you have another card?

833
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:19,601
Call her now.

834
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:24,561
How can this happen?

835
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:27,281
It's getting through.

836
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:31,081
Fei'er, pick up.

837
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:36,601
Fei'er isn't picking up.

838
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:37,401
This...

839
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,761
How can this be?

840
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:42,441
Preposterous.

841
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:43,881
Miss,

842
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,201
could there be something

843
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,321
wrong with your machine?

844
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:47,801
Let me tell you.

845
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:49,201
My son-in-law is

846
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:50,361
a rich man at Hupu.

847
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,121
It's impossible this card
cannot be used.

848
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:53,761
Right. Please try again.

849
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,481
Yes. Try again.

850
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,201
But I've tried it

851
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:55,921
a couple of times earlier.

852
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:56,521
This POS machine

853
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:57,761
works fine.

854
00:39:58,361 --> 00:39:59,081
No worries. Don't panic.

855
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,281
Ask them properly first.

856
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:07,961
Don't embarrass us.

857
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:08,801
I think

858
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,401
she hasn't even become Mrs. Zhao,

859
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:11,441
and she's already

860
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:12,281
playing tricks.

861
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,161
She definitely gave us

862
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:14,081
a card with no money

863
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:14,921
to toy with us.

864
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:16,721
How daring.

865
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:17,921
That cannot be.

866
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:19,281
Why not?

867
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:20,881
Father, mother,

868
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,641
why don't you go home first?

869
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:23,841
I'll go look for her in a bit.

870
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:24,841
I'll get her to cough it up.

871
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:26,681
Can you get in?

872
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,921
I have a way.

873
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,241
We'll come with you.

874
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,921
On this important day,

875
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:32,001
how dare she mess with us.

876
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:32,881
- Yes.
- No!

877
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,281
Go home first.

878
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:35,801
My son,

879
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:36,681
I think your father

880
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:37,401
makes sense.

881
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:37,801
Yes.

882
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:38,641
If you go alone,

883
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,721
what if you get chased out?

884
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:40,041
Right.

885
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:41,201
It's better to go together.

886
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:41,681
Let's go.

887
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:42,201
Let's go.

888
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:43,561
Let's go.

889
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:44,481
Go home first.

890
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:44,961
Let's go.

891
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,081
Don't be scared.

892
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,041
We are here.

893
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,161
I can do it myself.

894
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,161
No worries.

895
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,001
We're here, too.

896
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:50,441
Right?

897
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:51,521
How dare she take the money.

898
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:52,321
That won't do.

899
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:53,201
We'll call her out.

900
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:59,481
Go on.

901
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:00,681
Xixi invested

902
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:01,401
so much in you

903
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,681
so you can find more partners

904
00:41:02,841 --> 00:41:03,841
for the fragrance factory.

905
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:06,281
I have nothing to say to them.

906
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,721
The pastry in this expensive hotel

907
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:14,921
tastes pretty normal.

908
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:16,361
Dinner starts at 7 p.m.

909
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:17,521
Who are they starving?

910
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:18,801
I think it's pretty tasty.

911
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:33,361
Is this tasty?

912
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,961
I think skewers taste better.

913
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,521
Shall we go eat

914
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:42,321
supper tonight?

915
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:44,561
We're going back tomorrow.

916
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:45,681
So soon?

917
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,241
I haven't even bought you

918
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:49,361
the famous local snacks

919
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,641
and gifts for

920
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:51,601
Mr. He and Feng.

921
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:52,761
No need.

922
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:53,561
In this age,

923
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,921
what can't you buy
from the Internet?

924
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:56,321
True.

925
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,481
There isn't anything

926
00:41:58,601 --> 00:41:59,401
special here either.

927
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,761
Wusu has more things that

928
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:02,681
we cannot buy with money.

929
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:06,361
What's wrong with you?

930
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,561
Are you feeling low?

931
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:11,361
I just feel that

932
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:12,641
we're from different worlds.

933
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:13,201
Mr. Wang.

934
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:14,801
It's been a while.

935
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:16,001
Hello, you are...

936
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:17,641
We met on the yacht party before.

937
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:19,561
The yacht party?

938
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:20,681
I wasn't there.

939
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:22,441
Apologies.

940
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:26,241
Why do I feel like these people

941
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:26,921
are so fake?

942
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:28,801
Will you be accompanying

943
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:29,881
him to do such things?

944
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,681
Why are you so clumsy?

945
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,441
Be careful.

946
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:34,961
Sorry.

947
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:35,721
It's fine.

948
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:37,881
Let's go.
