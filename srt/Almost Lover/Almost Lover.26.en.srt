Okay.

slept in the exam,

32
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,527
idled at work

33
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,207
and treated women poorly

34
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:47,047
in the past 20 years.

35
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:51,527
I didn't know that it all
came back to me today.

What comes around goes around.

37
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:55,367
Tell me.

38
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:58,367
Do you think

39
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,607
I'm not being serious enough this time?

40
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:03,927
Do you believe that

41
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:04,887
I can even die for her?

42
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:06,447
Yes.

43
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,687
I went there with her that day.

44
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,247
Why did I agree

45
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,967
to split up with her?

46
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,207
I'm always one step
later than Xiao Shangqi.

47
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:25,967
One step later,

48
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,247
and every step later.

49
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,367
I can never catch up with her.

50
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:38,047
I just want to keep her company,
wait for her,

51
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:39,847
and be nice to her.

52
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:43,247
End of the day,

53
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:46,247
I've only moved myself.

54
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:50,527
Just

55
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,127
withdraw as early as possible.

56
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:54,767
I'm not interested

57
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,327

it's time.

60
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,767
You need to treat her well

61
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:09,567
if you like her.

62
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:13,687
It's not about moving yourself.

63
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:15,807
Li Hui,

64
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:17,087
let me ask you

65
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:18,087
one last question.

66
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,127
One last question.

67
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:20,046
Hurry up.

68
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,367
If it was you

69
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,767
who grew up with Xiao Shangqi,

70
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,087
will you fall in love with him?

71
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:49,287
No way.

72
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,007
Am I that bad?

73
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,287
Even you won't choose me.

74
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,087
You're crazy.

75
00:04:58,207 --> 00:04:58,887
Sui,

76
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:01,207
you've been keeping

77
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:04,807
Xiaoran company all this time

78
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:05,967
with a sincere heart.

79
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,607
I know you're serious.

80
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:12,847
I also know you've been hurt badly.

81
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:15,967
You've changed

82
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,127
so much for her.

83
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,087
You've even gone back to work
in the fragrance factory.

84
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,087
But, no matter how you change,

85
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:24,687
you can't become

86
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,887
another person.

87
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:27,927
You can't become the person

88
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:29,407
in her heart.

89
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,127
But, I think

90
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:35,967
it's great.

91
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,567
It's not a bad experience.

92
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,127
Look at the previous you.

93
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,207
You were not being serious.

94
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:44,727
Now, you've finally understood

95
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,367
how it's like...

96
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:49,207
How it's like

97
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,647
to really love someone.

98
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,247
I think I'm quite good.

99
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,047
Don't be surprised.

100
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:22,287
It's not going to happen

101
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,687
like having sex after drinking
in the drama.

102
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,567
We're adults.

103
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,727
We can't really do that.

104
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:31,687
You're quite frank.

105
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,327
I didn't mean that.

106
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,327
I was just

107
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:36,407
shocked.

108
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,127
The last time we were on the same bed

109
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:40,927
was during our primary school days.

110
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:44,207
Right?

111
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:51,087
You should

112
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,367
get me changed.

113
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:53,927
Don't try to make your way through.

114
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:57,167
Well.

115
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:00,767
Whenever I got my heart broken,

116
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,167
you'd just throw me in the living room.

117
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,367
What happened this time?

118
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:06,327
You've taken care of me the whole night

119
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,287
with clothes on.

120
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,327
Do you think I wanted
to take care of you?

121
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,287
You were drunk and
you went crazy last night.

122
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,127
I said I'll wait for you,

123
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,127
and then I...

124
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:15,847
I fell asleep.

125
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,247
To be honest, Hui,

126
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:23,887
you're the only woman

127
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,207
that will not be misunderstood

128
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,847
for sleeping with me on my bed.

129
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:29,887
Let's go. I'll buy you breakfast.

130
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,047
No, you should buy me breakfast.

131
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:31,887
I'm not going.

132
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:32,967
I have something on.

133
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:35,367
I wasn't drunk.

134
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,367
I don't care.

135
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:37,526
I remember what

136
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:38,646
you said at Hao's place.

137
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:39,727
You said you'll take care of me.

138
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,207
Let's go.

139
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,447
Look after the house, okay?

140
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:29,087

(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)

142
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:43,447
Mr. Xiao,

143
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,567
it's quite cold lately.

144
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,367
The hospital is not
as good as your hotel.

145
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,047
You may catch a cold or a fever easily.

146
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,687
If it leads to coughing and pneumonia,

147
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:50,727
you'll suffer.

148
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:51,927
What's going on?

149
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:53,007
The other patients

150
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,527
just wipe their bodies.

151
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:55,647
He insisted on washing his hair.

152
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,487
He'll catch a cold.

153
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,767
He has to wash his hair every day.

154
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:00,887
No problem, I've brought a hairdryer.

155
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:01,847
Thank you.

156
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:10,967
Blow it dry.

157
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:14,207
Thank you.

158
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:23,607
Let me do it.

159
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,367
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,567
I asked Mo

161
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:35,927
to get the things for
my hospitalisation,

162
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:37,007
but he didn't get everything.

163
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,607
Even the socks are not in pairs.

164
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:40,687
You had to go one more time.

165
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:42,407
Maybe he's not familiar with

166
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:43,367
where you keep your things.

167
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:05,687
Mr. Xiao, you must be starving.

168
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,207
I...

169
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:15,487
I was worried
no one is taking care of you.

170
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,607
I picked up Taiyang

171
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,847
and came here immediately.

172
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,487
I wouldn't have rushed if I knew.

173
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,127
Yesterday, he said he needs something

174
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:24,207
for his hospitalisation.

175
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:25,407
So, I took them

176
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:26,247
for him today.

177
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:27,287
I'm about to leave.

178
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,287
Help him out.

179
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:29,527
No, Xiaoran.

180
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:30,527
Well,

181
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:31,647
Mr. Xiao's hospitalised lately.

182
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,407
Jifeng's workload

183
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:33,407
is all on me now.

184
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,767
I also need to take care of Taiyang.

185
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:35,847
Well,

186
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:36,927
I'm not that young anymore.

187
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:39,007
I can hardly catch up

188
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:39,927
with my age.

189
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:41,007
Look at

190
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,887
my huge eye bags.

191
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,207
Who forced you to come?

192
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:45,847
You know Mr. Xiao well.

193
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:46,607
He's picky

194
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:47,367
and short-tempered.

195
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:48,607
He's offended

196
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,927
all the medical staff here.

197
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:52,687
If you're free lately,

198
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:53,647
and since I can't come here often,

199
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:54,567
can you come over

200
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:55,647
and take care of him?

201
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:00,007
His family is not here.

202
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:03,767
He got injured because of me.

203
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:04,807
I should take care of him.

204
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:06,487
That's what I wanted to hear.

205
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:07,767
I'll pass your contact to the doctor.

206
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:08,967
Mr. Xiao, if you need anything,

207
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:09,847
look for Xiaoran.

208
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:10,807
Well, the meal...

209
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,247
I'll put the meal here.

210
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,607
Hurry up.

211
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,047
Blow his hair dry.

212
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:17,247
I'm leaving now.

213
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:18,447
You might catch a cold

214
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,207
if your hair is not dry.

215
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,207
The ribs will hurt.

216
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,967
Blow his hair dry.

217
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:31,407
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:34,807
Blow your hair dry quickly.

219
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:42,807
Xiaoran.

220
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:45,447
Thank you.

221
00:13:58,847 --> 00:13:59,567
It's all fixed.

222
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,727
The water pipe is old.

223
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:01,847
The connector was broken.

224
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:03,407
Thank you.

225
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,607
Luckily, you found out about it in time.

226
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,367
I've also

227
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,167
tidied up your washroom.

228
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,847
Are you still having bulimia?

229
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,847
Sit here and eat.

230
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:21,567
No need.

231
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:26,647
Xiaoran said she's not

232
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:27,487
coming back tonight.

233
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:29,567
She'll go to the TV station for overtime

234
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:30,527
straight from the hospital.

235
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:37,727
She goes to the hospital every day.

236
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:38,767
Can she take it?

237
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:40,967
You haven't let it go yet

238
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:41,767
or this is the concern

239
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,087
for a friend?

240
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:47,207
I'll never regret

241
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,007
the decision I made

242
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:50,647
ever since I was young.

243
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,407
So, I understand it

244
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:55,367
as you're planning to

245
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,487
befriend Xiaoran

246
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,407
and you don't plan to
stay away from her.

247
00:14:58,807 --> 00:14:59,447
Then I don't have to

248
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,767
just communicate with
either of you alone,

249
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:01,367
right?

250
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:04,767
I'm not that unforgiving.

251
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,327
I just don't want her to feel bad.

252
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:08,127
Do you think Xiaoran

253
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,327
is that unforgiving?

254
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,127
I'll be performing with others
at Hao's place

255
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,167
this weekend.

256
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:19,527
Come over.

257
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:20,807
Grab the chance

258
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,127
and talk things out.

259
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:22,927
Romance is all about feelings

260
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,927
and it can't be forced.

261
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,407
Friends stay together forever though.

262
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:46,527
Do you want some extra flavour?

263
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:48,287
Chilli.

264
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:57,847
I don't want.

265
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,007
Why not?

266
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:35,127
What's going on?

267
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,087
Do you want to drink water?

268
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:38,487
No.

269
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,367
Hello, Lili.

270
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,367
Xiaoran,

271
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,647
there's a multiple vehicle collision
on the highway.

272
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,727
Some of the injured victims are sent to

273
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:00,727
the hospital where you are.

274
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,167
Go and have a look.

275
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,287
Do a report on that if you can.

276
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:04,967
Okay, I'll get down there now.

277
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,967
A multiple vehicle collision.
I'll go and have a look.

278
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:11,806
Xiaoran.

279
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:22,767
Move.

280
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:25,487
Sir,

281
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:26,647
can you tell me

282
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,847
how the accident happened?

283
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,007
I'm the journalist from Wusu TV Station.

284
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:30,527
It was horrible.

285
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,047
The cars knocked into each car's trunk.

286
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,487
Two of them were big trucks

287
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:34,407
carrying rebar.

288
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,687
The rebar pierced through

289
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,447
the rear window glass.

290
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,367
It was horrible.

291
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,327
How many people were injured?

292
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,927
Come on, move.

293
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,407
Stop taking the photo. You're disturbing us.

294
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:50,527
Are you okay?

295
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:56,807
Don't mind their attitude.

296
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:58,647
It's okay.

297
00:17:58,847 --> 00:17:59,367
Didn't I get

298
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:00,447
paint poured all over my body?

299
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:01,727
This is my job.

300
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,687
Record all the news,

301
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,127
be it good or bad,

302
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,087
keep it real, effective and fast.

303
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:09,807
Xiaoran,

304
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,167
I feel like I can see

305
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:13,927
how you'll become a war correspondent.

306
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,647
Your faith and persistence

307
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:17,767
make your dream

308
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:18,927
closer and closer to you.

309
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:21,167
I'll continue to pursue it.

310
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,287
Lin Zong just informed me that

311
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:26,367
the mobile phone is fixed.

312
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,127
I've looked for a colleague
in the construction industry

313
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:28,967
to contact

314
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:29,807
someone he knows well

315
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,007
in quality control

316
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,887
and see if they can find anything.

317
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:34,247
Okay.

318
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,887
No matter what you find,

319
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:37,447
tell me about it.

320
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,007
He, what did it go?

321
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:54,767
Look at the photo you took.

322
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:55,927
The wall is falling off

323
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:57,167
little by little.

324
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:58,887
Based on my experience,

325
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,767
the concrete's not that solid anymore.

326
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,447
What do you mean?

327
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:03,807
It means the wall

328
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:04,647
is not hard.

329
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,487
Just like when you hang some heavy rack

330
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,487
on the wall,

331
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:09,927
it will just slide down.

332
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:10,767
You can't hang anything on it.

333
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:11,927
Also,

334
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:13,007
the leaking here

335
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:13,967
is really serious.

336
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,007
The rebar will rust after a long time.

337
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,687
The building will
go out of shape easily.

338
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:18,967
For example,

339
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,367
the window will damage easily

340
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:21,967
and can't be closed. It's possible.

341
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:23,687
In conclusion,

342
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:25,847
the building is not in a good shape.

343
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,127
It has to be demolished.

344
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,447
So, is this a tofu-dreg project?

345
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,327
I dare not say so.

346
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:34,527
I suggest you

347
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:35,527
look for our colleague
in doing a quality check

348
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:36,447
to take a look.

349
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:37,407
The building is not

350
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,527
fully demolished.

351
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:39,327
Get a wall

352
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:40,247
that's intact.

353
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,767
Test it with a rebound hammer

354
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:43,087
and we'll know.

355
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:44,687
Also,

356
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,247
this rebar

357
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:47,687
seems to be too small.

358
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,447
This kind of building

359
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,007
should use size 22.

360
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,607
This doesn't look like it.

361
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,127
I'm about to go back to Hupu.

362
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,527
I came to see you before I leave.

363
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:19,047
Those people really

364
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:21,247
gave you a hard time.

365
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,287
I've paid

366
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:24,967
for your medical bill.

367
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,207
Mr. Zhao, you came here

368
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,047
just to tell me this?

369
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,327
Guess why I'm here

370
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:35,367
today.

371
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,327
Are you trying to repeat what you did?

372
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:40,167
Mr. Zhao,

373
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:43,807
I don't have a heart disease.

374
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,167
Don't you want to know

375
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,167
what I said to your father

376
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:56,647
in the patient ward?

377
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,247
Do you still remember?

378
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:12,327
Your family and mine once

379
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:13,287
went to the sea together.

380
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,807
Qi was lying on the deck.

381
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,327
There was a wave

382
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,927
and he fell into the sea
as the boat was shaking.

383
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:22,007
What happened then?

384
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,367
Xiao Xian became crippled.

385
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:26,967
You were in the hospital

386
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,127
scolding Qi.

387
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:30,967
He told him that his brother's life

388
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:32,127
was ruined by him.

389
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,327
You said you'll never forgive him

390
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,607
for what he did.

391
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,887
If I'm not mistaken,

392
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,287
this is

393
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:44,727
the hospital you were in.

394
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,327
What are you trying to say?

395
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,767
I pushed him off into the sea.

396
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:54,727
What did you say?

397
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:56,727
I pushed

398
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,527
Xiao Shangqi off into the sea.

399
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:08,567
Shangqi

400
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:10,007
was lying on the deck

401
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:11,767
to check on the fish.

402
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:13,807
When the wave came

403
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,327
and the boat was shaking,

404
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:18,247
I pushed him down.

405
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:23,967
Qi!

406
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:24,687
Qi!

407
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:26,967
Xian, help me!

408
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,207
He didn't feel it.

409
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:33,367
He thought

410
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:34,887
he fell off on his own.

411
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,447
Zhao Mingxuan.

412
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,047
Actually,

413
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,927
I hated Xiao Shangqi the most

414
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,407
since I was young.

415
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,487
He's so full of himself.

416
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:05,847
I remember

417
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:09,327
my father always beat my mother

418
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,327
when he came home.

419
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:15,607
Why are you so stupid?

420
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,527
Xiao Shangqi is a few years
younger than him,

421
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:18,487
but he's so much better.

422
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,247
Hire him a teacher tomorrow

423
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:21,327
to teach him public speaking.

424
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:23,407
You're not allowed to eat and sleep
if you can't talk well.

425
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,687
The reason was

426
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:26,647
that I wasn't educated

427
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:27,927
as excellent as the kids

428
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,047
in Xiao family.

429
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,167
Isn't that ridiculous?

430
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,287
It's ridiculous.

431
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:33,967
A great chance like this

432
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,087
was hard to come by.

433
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,407
Do you think

434
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,207
I'll just let it go?

435
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,127
What I didn't expect is that

436
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,607
Xiao Xian went in and saved him.

437
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,567
He also made it.

438
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:49,927
Qi.

439
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:50,727
Qi.

440
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:52,087
Qi.

441
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,887
Xiao Xian has become crippled.

442
00:23:58,207 --> 00:23:59,567
He can never fight against me anymore.

443
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,847
As for Xiao Shangqi,

444
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:17,687
I have to thank you.

445
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:21,407
You're my accomplice.

446
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:23,727
You've hurt him so bad.

447
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:25,087
You don't know, right?

448
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,207
Xiao Shangqi had been crying to me

449
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,687
when he was young.

450
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:33,607
And for a long period of time,

451
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:34,607
he treated me

452
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,607
better than you and Xiao Xian.

453
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:39,647
He thought that

454
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,167
I'm the closest person to him.

455
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,527
Don't you think

456
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,327
it's more interesting than

457
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,127
having him dead?

458
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:56,127
You're a madman.

459
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:57,007
Yes,

460
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,127
I'm a madman.

461
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:01,247
So, you better don't

462
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,367
take a madman's word lightly.

463
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:10,687
Zhao Mingxuan,

464
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:13,447
you're shameless.

465
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:15,367
Get lost.

466
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:16,487
Get lost.

467
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:21,647
There's really no remorse pill

468
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,287
in the world.

469
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:26,247
So, I advise you

470
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,567
to come to your sense

471
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,767
and stop doing something
that can make you regret it.

472
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:35,167
Are you serious, Mr. Xiao?

473
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,087
You can't even stand
this bit of stimulation?

474
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,127
I think you should retire.

475
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:51,927
Zhao Mingxuan.

476
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,247
Do you think

477
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,727
you can have a great time
with your father?

478
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:17,087
No more.

479
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,007
Never ever again.

480
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:21,047
You're someone

481
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,527
not worthy to be loved

482
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:24,247
and win.

483
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:27,967
Also,

484
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,087
stop pestering me.

485
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:31,487
Otherwise, I'll also take He Xiaoran

486
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:32,647
away from you.

487
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:34,527
Don't learn from your father

488
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:35,327
and repeat the same mistake.

489
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,247
There is something

490
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:39,087
that once you lost,

491
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:42,207
you can never get it back anymore.

492
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,447
You have too many flaws.

493
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:53,407
All that you've told me now

494
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,047
will only motivate me

495
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:56,887
to defeat you.

496
00:26:58,687 --> 00:26:59,847
I'll find the evidence.

497
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:01,767
You're too naive, Qi.

498
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,167
You won't be able to find anything.

499
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,807
You have weakness, but I don't.

500
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,007
So, you can never defeat me.

501
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,807
You can only be manipulated by me.

502
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:17,167
Go back.

503
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:19,567
How can you fight against me

504
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,327
as you're so weak?

505
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:27,607
Take care.

506
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:45,367
Xiao Shangqi.

507
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:47,687
I think

508
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:48,727
Qingshan Nursing Home

509
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,007
is a tofu-dreg project.

510
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:51,647
Maybe from the beginning itself,

511
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:52,687
I've got the direction wrong.

512
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:54,327
I said

513
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,567
we should go to
the construction site now.

514
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:56,607
Look at him.

515
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:57,447
I've advised him for half a day.

516
00:27:57,607 --> 00:27:58,687
We'll go with some people. You...

517
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:00,367
I've met Zhao Mingxuan in the afternoon.

518
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,447
Let's go to the construction site.

519
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:10,687
(Employee channel)
That's fast.

520
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:11,887
(Employee channel)
When we came last time,

521
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,167
half of the site was not demolished.

522
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:14,887
Mr. Xiao.

523
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:17,207
Mr. Xiao.

524
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:19,407
I've asked around.

525
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,127
They have been working in
the construction site day and night.

526
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:22,327
They got complained a lot

527
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:23,367
due to this reason.

528
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:25,167
But, luckily we

529
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:26,327
have some photos as the evidence.

530
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,207
The photos are not comprehensive.

531
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,687
It can't prove that it's taken here.

532
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:32,127
Now, the entire Qingshan Nursing Home

533
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,007
is gone.

534
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,447
It's harder to find any evidence.

535
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,727
(You're too naive, Qi.)

536
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,207
(You can't find anything.)

537
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:40,647
I should've thought of it.

538
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:44,567
He came and looked for me.

539
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,247
It means everything has been
taken care of.

540
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:54,767
Mr. Xiao.

541
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:57,687
Mr. Xiao.

542
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,207
High fever.

543
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:36,447
39.2 degree Celsius.

544
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:38,727
He needs to be monitored closely.

545
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:40,367
He'd better not get any pneumonia.

546
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:41,847
One of you should stay back tonight.

547
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:42,607
Okay.

548
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:43,527
Thank you.

549
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:45,487
Lin Zong,

550
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:46,807
go home and take care of Taiyang.

551
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:47,727
I'll stay back.

552
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:49,927
Okay.

553
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:51,247
Call me

554
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:52,087
if you need anything.

555
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:53,407
Don't worry.

556
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,007
(Zhao Mingxuan)

557
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:11,727
Monitor what's going on in the hospital.

558
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:14,927
Okay, let's talk tomorrow.

559
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:28,647
Where have you been?

560
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:29,967
You didn't call me back

561
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:30,847
for days.

562
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:32,207
I keep you here

563
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:33,247
not for you

564
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:34,327
to ask me questions.

565
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,287
I've brewed tea for you to
dispel the effects of alcohol.

566
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:39,647
It's turned cold.

567
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:40,927
I'll heat it up.

568
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:47,967
You really look like

569
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:48,887
Xiao Xian.

570
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:50,767
You know your place.

571
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:53,327
How close you were

572
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:54,447
with Xiao Shangqi?

573
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:56,887
Why didn't you learn how to be tough

574
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:58,207
from him?

575
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:00,767
You knew that the news

576
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:01,767
was fake.

577
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:03,847
It doesn't matter.

578
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:06,247
Now, everyone will

579
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,207
think of the scandal

580
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:09,207
when they see you.

581
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:11,967
You're like a joke.

582
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:15,967
I'll get the tea.

583
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,887
If you can't even

584
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:55,407
do this,

585
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,727
you're not qualified to stay here.

586
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:19,527
(You're not worthy to be loved.)

587
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,967
(You're not worthy to be happy.)

588
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:23,367
(You'll lose)

589
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:24,407
(everything you love.)

590
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:25,847
(Once you've)

591
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:27,287
(lost something,)

592
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,567
(you'll never be able to regain it.)

593
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,440
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

594
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:18,767
Lin Zong.

595
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:20,247
I'm here to get the meal.

596
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,887
Let me deliver it today.

597
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:24,847
Don't you need to keep Taiyang company?

598
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:25,967
Also,

599
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:27,367
Xiao Shangqi sent me a text,

600
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,367
asking me not to go.

601
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:29,807
How's his recovery?

602
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:38,447
You're here in time.

603
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:39,606
Talk to him.

604
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,007
He's not even taking his medicine.

605
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,527
Yesterday's medicine
is still on the table.

606
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:43,847
He also wants to be discharged.

607
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:44,646
Look at his status.

608
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,407
The doctor won't allow him to discharge.

609
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:47,727
I'll bear

610
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:48,927
the consequences myself.

611
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:53,367
Why are you here?

612
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:55,686
You called her here?

613
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:56,927
I...

614
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:58,327
Let me talk to him.

615
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:16,767
What are you doing?

616
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:18,927
You've been acting weird

617
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:19,887
after your fever was gone that morning.

618
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,087
Lin Zong said

619
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,047
you didn't eat or sleep
in the past two days.

620
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,367
You were only looking
outside the window.

621
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,007
How can you recover then?

622
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:29,767
You must be tired from
taking care of me.

623
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:31,647
Leave me alone.

624
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:35,927
Are you trying to take a break again?

625
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,567
Who are you to decide my life?

626
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:40,847
You order me around as you please.

627
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:41,967
Does that make you happy?

628
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:43,287
What did Zhao Mingxuan say to you?

629
00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:48,367
I know.

630
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,367
You never trusted me

631
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,407
even when

632
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:52,527
we were together.

633
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:54,327
You think I don't deserve

634
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:55,047
to share the ups and downs

635
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:56,367
in your life.

636
00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,647
What more now.

637
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:05,407
Fine, I'm leaving now.

638
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,247
Do as you please.

639
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,167
Maybe he's right.

640
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:16,687
I'll always be the loser.

641
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:19,927
He caused Xian to become crippled.

642
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:22,887
He pushed me off

643
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,607
into the sea on purpose.

644
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:27,367
My awful life

645
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,287
in the past 20 years

646
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,607
was caused by him!

647
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,887
I don't want to fight
against him anymore.

648
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:41,487
I don't want those whom I love

649
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:44,727
to be hurt by him anymore.

650
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:47,767
Xiaoran.

651
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:52,687
I'm scared.

652
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,567
Since you're not eating
or drinking here,

653
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:11,087
it's a waste of resources staying here.

654
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:12,847
Get changed and come with me.

655
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:21,767
How did it go?

656
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:26,007
Where are you

657
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,007
going, Xiaoran?

658
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:28,087
Don't worry.

659
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:29,967
I'll bring him back in one piece.

660
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:31,207
What he needs now

661
00:37:31,487 --> 00:37:32,687
is not physical treatment.

662
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:12,207
Hello, Mr. Xiao and Mrs. Xiao.

663
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,007
Mr. Xiao, it's been a while.

664
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:28,887
I'm sorry

665
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,247
that I only came to see you now.

666
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:32,687
Although I can sense that

667
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,727
you looked strict,

668
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:38,367
you're the same as every father

669
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:39,567
in the world.

670
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,407
It turns out bad
when you show concern.

671
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,087
Sometimes,

672
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,527
you didn't know how to communicate.

673
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:46,767
You didn't know how to

674
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:47,847
express your fatherly love,

675
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,080
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

676
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:50,527
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)
so you acted like a strict father.

677
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,220
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

678
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,407
However, you loved him
from the bottom of your heart, right?

679
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,040
(Xiao Zhenyun)

680
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,247
You haven't planted any flowers

681
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:00,447
with Xiao Shangqi, have you?

682
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:03,607
In my memory,

683
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:07,207
you've never celebrated

684
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,287
his birthday with him.

685
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:12,287
The Xiao Shangqi I know

686
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:14,127
has distanced

687
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:15,287
himself from others

688
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:18,367
and always pulled a long face

689
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:20,447
for a long period of time.

690
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,447
It's like he was wearing a mask.

691
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:26,567
But as his best friend,

692
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:28,247
I know

693
00:39:29,407 --> 00:39:30,767
he thirsts for love

694
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:31,967
and concern.

695
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:35,487
Now, we know the truth.

696
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:40,287
It's just that something

697
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,687
can't be made up anymore.

698
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:47,927
You're buried here.

699
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,087
What about him?

700
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:53,207
Your son.

701
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,407
He's not doing well.

702
00:39:58,247 --> 00:39:59,567
He's not eating, drinking

703
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:00,607
or sleeping.

704
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:01,647
If this goes on,

705
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:03,047
his body can't take it.

706
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:05,527
He wants to live

707
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,487
a haphazard life.

708
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:09,727
He thinks he doesn't need to be loved

709
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:11,287
or to be concerned.

710
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:14,847
Mr. Xiao,

711
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:17,687
is this what you want to see?

712
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,287
You were managing Yunlan diligently

713
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,487
to take care of the family of three.

714
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:25,487
Now, you're gone.

715
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,087
Is this home

716
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:28,007
going to dismiss?

717
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:29,647
Are you not expecting anything

718
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,367
from Xiao Shangqi anymore?

719
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:33,087
Have you severed ties with him?

720
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:34,967
Does everything not matter anymore?

721
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:38,247
Did you have no regrets

722
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,927
when you passed away?

723
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,007
Xiao Shangqi.

724
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,527
You have the answers

725
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,487
to all my questions, right?

726
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,327
If you don't,

727
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,367
stand here today,

728
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:01,047
look at Mr. Xiao and think about it.

729
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:32,047
I have a feeling that

730
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,327
if you're willing to stay here,

731
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:36,767
Yunlan will take off.

732
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,007
Another thing that makes me happier

733
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,007
is that you and I

734
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,327
will have more time

735
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:42,527
to get to know

736
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:43,847
each other more.

737
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,487
You can tell

738
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:47,887
how happy he is

739
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:49,527
after you came home.

740
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:51,687
He also said how sorry

741
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:53,447
he was that

742
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:55,887
he has sent you overseas
in the past few years.

743
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:57,567
(It's stopped you from shining.)

744
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:00,087
(In conclusion, he really)

745
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:01,727
(expects a lot from you.)

746
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,007
I'll get back the things

747
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:54,567
that you protected one by one.

748
00:42:58,487 --> 00:42:59,287
I'm sorry.
