Fei'er,

18
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:43,646
I didn't think you were

19
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:44,886
this head-over-heels for me.

20
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,606
Do you really miss me?

21
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:56,406
But Fei'er,

22
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:58,526
you're right.

23
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:01,086
Your coming back to me

24
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:03,486
makes me feel like

25
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:09,445
beating him just gets more interesting.

26
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:13,086
Come.

27
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:16,086
Tell me

28
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,446
what you saw

29
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:20,126
at the funeral.

30
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:21,846
Okay.

31
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,726
Will you expect him to come

32
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:39,926
and sign this contract
when he's even absent

33
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:41,006
from the funeral?

34
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,246
Let's stop

35
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:43,406
deceiving ourselves.

36
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:45,486
Is this your so-called

37
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:46,606
70% of assurance?

38
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,486
You boasted about it.

39
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:50,806
In fact, you're using everyone's

40
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:51,846
lives and properties

41
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,526
to pay for your action.

42
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:56,206
Where's your brother?

43
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,126
Why is the new CEO

44
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,966
even afraid of showing his face?

45
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:01,246
Where's he?

46
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:08,206
(This)

47
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,526
(should be very important to you, right?)

48
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,286
(Just don't forget)

49
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,966
(this favour from me.)

50
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:36,726
Mr. Xiao,

51
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:37,286
you can't go in.

52
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:38,246
We've got rules here...

53
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,046
Move away!

54
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:44,406
Zhao Mingxuan,

55
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,526
you killed my father.

56
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:53,726
You're willing to show up at last.

57
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,366
Why have you led yourself

58
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:58,006
into this situation after a few days?

59
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,206
What did you say to my father?

60
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,446
I thought I lost it.

61
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,126
What did you say to my father?

62
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:16,606
Qi.

63
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:18,925
If you think I killed your father,

64
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,925
you should just call the police.

65
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:25,486
Do you think I wouldn't?

66
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:26,766
It's not that you wouldn't.

67
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,206
You learn it well by heart

68
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:30,406
that this

69
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:33,046
doesn't count as any evidence.

70
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:36,966
But since you're here,

71
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,646
let me tell you the details.

72
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,406
After all, I was the only person

73
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,606
who witnessed your father's death.

74
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,486
But, how did

75
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:50,326
Xiao Zhenyun die?

76
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:53,646
I need to think properly about it.

77
00:04:58,246 --> 00:04:59,006
Mr. Xiao,

78
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,086
are you so surprised

79
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:03,486
by what I said?

80
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:10,646
You're despicable.

81
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:16,246
Get out.

82
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,246
There's really no remorse pill

83
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:23,966
in the world.

84
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,046
So, I advise you

85
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,526
to come to your sense

86
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,686
and stop doing something
that can make yourself regret.

87
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,486
Are you serious, Mr. Xiao?

88
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,166
You can't even stand

89
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:37,966
this bit of stimulation?

90
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,846
I think you should retire.

91
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:53,366
Do you want to call the doctor?
Let me help.

92
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:35,766
He couldn't be saved.

93
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,286
It's his ill luck.

94
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:39,966
That's a dying man's

95
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,806
desire to live.

96
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,366
(I didn't expect)

97
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,766
(to see fear)

98
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:47,926
(and panic)

99
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,526
on your father's face.

100
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,366
He had no dignity at all.

101
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,246
A hardcore person like him

102
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,446
was also afraid of death.

103
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:01,326
Also,

104
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,486
your father had a heart attack.

105
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:05,606
There's no way

106
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:06,686
you can blame me.

107
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:08,686
Zhao Mingxuan,

108
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,366
I won't let you go.

109
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:21,046
Do you think

110
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,606
we're still at the wedding?

111
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,006
Listen.

112
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,086
Your father's score sticks to himself.

113
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:28,486
As for you,

114
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:31,366
I'll even the score with you slowly.

115
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,366
Mr. Zhao, Xiao Xian has arrived.

116
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:35,726
Let him come in.

117
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:37,486
Mr. Zhao.

118
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,006
Well...

119
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:44,886
Why are you doing here?

120
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:47,446
Don't get him wrong.

121
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:48,806
He doesn't come

122
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,246
to question me.

123
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,766
He comes to beg me for a job.

124
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:08,966
Are you crazy?

125
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:11,166
We just attended father's funeral

126
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:12,046
in the morning.

127
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,406
And now, you're kneeling down

128
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,566
and accepting his help?

129
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:16,566
Do you know

130
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,526
father was killed by him?

131
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:19,606
Father

132
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:20,406
won't rest in peace if you do this!

133
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:21,766
I repeat myself.

134
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:24,006
Yunlan is father's lifetime effort.

135
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:24,686
If Yunlan is gone,

136
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:26,246
father won't rest in peace!

137
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,046
Mr. Gao came today.

138
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:33,005
It means there's still hope for a fight.

139
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:34,806
I can secure Yunlan!

140
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:35,966
You?

141
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:37,726
Tell me.

142
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,046
Ever since you came back to Hupu,

143
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:42,286
didn't you promise father

144
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,846
that you can help Yunlan
out of difficulty

145
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:46,806
and get dissociated from Deju?

146
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,246
We didn't doubt it.

147
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:50,886
We believed it.

148
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,566
You're meeting all kind of people.

149
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,326
You let the whole hotel industry

150
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:56,366
know

151
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,366
who you are.

152
00:08:58,566 --> 00:08:59,846
You're in the limelight.

153
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,246
But what did you get in the end?

154
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,966
Father's death?

155
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,526
A few people

156
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,086
who attended his funeral,

157
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:08,806
right?

158
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,246
Or hundreds of Yunlan employees

159
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:11,686
losing their jobs?

160
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:18,446
Yes, you can bear it and hang in there.

161
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:19,766
What about the others?

162
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:21,446
Also,

163
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:23,326
you mentioned Mr. Gao.

164
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,646
I really want to thank him.

165
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:26,686
It's him

166
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:27,806
who enlightened me.

167
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,886
You've caused all these.

168
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,406
That's how you are.

169
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,846
You think the whole world
owes you everything.

170
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:34,926
You must

171
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,526
do something shocking

172
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:37,886
to draw attention from those

173
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,246
who don't care about you, right?

174
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:40,886
Let me tell you.

175
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,606
Even if we owed you something,

176
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,766
we've paid you all!

177
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,006
Mr. Zhao,

178
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,966
I'll wait for you in the room next door.

179
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:56,486
Xiao Xian.

180
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,086
I won't sit idly by.

181
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:02,286
I won't let the two of you

182
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,406
ruin my father's empire!

183
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,246
Sure.

184
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,166
From now on,

185
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:08,766
we're steered clear.

186
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,406
We'll secure father's legacy

187
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:13,326
in our own way, okay?

188
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,286
Qi.

189
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,646
Have you realised?

190
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,286
You can't beat me

191
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,446
since you were young.

192
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,006
Chen Fei'er,

193
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,406
your father,

194
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,526
and the competition between

195
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,206
Yunlan and Deju as well.

196
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,206
Is that a photo wall?

197
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:25,406
Yes.

198
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,006
You said the wall is particularly empty,

199
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:27,846
didn't you?

200
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:28,766
So, I said

201
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:29,846
I wanted to give you a present.

202
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,006
I've printed out all the photos

203
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:32,406
in my phone.

204
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:37,166
Should we

205
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:38,646
remove the photos?

206
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:40,246
It's disturbing to watch.

207
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:41,726
Shall we remove it?

208
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:43,926
Throw it away.

209
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:45,846
It's better to burn it
than keeping it for that rascal.

210
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:53,566
Was this taken in the forest

211
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:54,726
on Linglong Mountain?

212
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:55,886
(Yes.)

213
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:57,806
(It's beautiful.)

214
00:11:58,726 --> 00:11:59,326
(It's beautiful)

215
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:00,566
(only because you're pretty.)

216
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:01,606
(This is from the homestay.)

217
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,366
(Yes, homestay.)

218
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:04,366
(Someone)

219
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,086
(fell asleep early.)

220
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,086
I'm glad I didn't miss it.

221
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,926
(We've completed another one.)

222
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,246
(What a nice wall.)

223
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:16,766
(Take a few shots.)

224
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,846
(I want to complete the word puzzle.)

225
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:21,366
(You need to promise me.)

226
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:22,966
You mustn't silently disappear

227
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:24,486
from my side anymore.

228
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,686
Xiaoran, where are you going?

229
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,086
Xiaoran.

230
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:35,566
Xiaoran.

231
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,006
Xiaoran.

232
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:38,926
What are you doing?

233
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:40,206
I'm going to Hupu.

234
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:41,486
Lend me your car.

235
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,326
You can reach there

236
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:43,366
only in the middle of the night.

237
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:44,166
Yes.

238
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,086
It doesn't matter.

239
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:46,486
It matters.

240
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:47,286
He Xiaoran.

241
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,126
He's been

242
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:49,526
fooling you in the past few days.

243
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,686
You still want

244
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:52,006
to drive a few hours to find him.

245
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,366
Do you have no pride?

246
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:54,486
Xiaoran,

247
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,486
you can't be a pushover.

248
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:57,566
You've given him

249
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:58,446
so many chances.

250
00:12:58,606 --> 00:12:59,166
Don't you understand

251
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:00,526
he won't come back anymore?

252
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,446
I can't pretend anymore.

253
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:05,726
No matter how I pretend

254
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:06,526
that I don't care,

255
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,566
I still care a lot.

256
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,046
I need to go look for him now

257
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,166
and talk it out.

258
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,526
Even a bad ending

259
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,406
is an ending.

260
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:19,406
Let her go.

261
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:33,246
She'll be fine.

262
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,006
Let's go.

263
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:39,886
Yueyue.

264
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:42,966
What day is today?

265
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,446
Let's watch a movie tonight.

266
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,686
Sure.

267
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:55,726
(Xiaoran.)

268
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,246
(Can you give me some time?)

269
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,046
(How long?)

270
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:01,566
(Seven days.)

271
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:12,086
Hello, Xiao Shangqi.

272
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:13,846
I'm driving

273
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:14,766
to Hupu.

274
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,206
Where are you? I'll look for you.

275
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:18,606
Where are you?

276
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,046
I've just got on the highway.

277
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:20,926
Okay.

278
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:22,126
Let's meet at

279
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,286
31 Cafe.

280
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,006
Okay.

281
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,000
(CROWNHOMES ART TOWN)

282
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,366
You said you needed seven days.

283
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:50,486
You're late.

284
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,486
It's been overdue for
more than ten hours.

285
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,566
I'm very busy these days.

286
00:14:58,766 --> 00:14:59,646
I need to deal with

287
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,326
many family and office matters.

288
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:03,766
I plan to form

289
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:05,766
a new strategy group in Yunlan

290
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:07,966
to take on new projects.

291
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,206
A new department?

292
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:11,366
Will you need to travel back and forth?

293
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,246
The situation in Hupu
is changing rapidly.

294
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,246
Wusu only has one Jifeng

295
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,166
somehow.

296
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:23,046
It doesn't require
much effort on my part.

297
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:26,886
You don't want to go back?

298
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,686
I planned to go back.

299
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,766
I'd go back to see you.

300
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:36,126
There's something

301
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:38,846
which I think it's better

302
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,526
to say it in person.

303
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:46,366
Xiaoran,

304
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:51,806
let's break up.

305
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:07,646
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:12,206
I recently realised

307
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,086
that relationship doesn't matter

308
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,086
that much to me.

309
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:20,806
When I had no goals,

310
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,486
dating was fun.

311
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:26,606
But now,

312
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:27,646
I have so many things to do.

313
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:31,646
I know.

314
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:33,806
You've given a lot

315
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:35,086
in this relationship.

316
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:37,326
To me...

317
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:38,406
Stop.

318
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:44,526
It's just right.

319
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,806
I also came here

320
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,646
to break up with you.

321
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:50,486
You're right.

322
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:52,326
It's better

323
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:53,806
to make it clear

324
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:54,526
for a breakup.

325
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:00,206
I've loved you for many years,

326
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,606
but if I knew this is a relationship

327
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:03,886
better than nothing,

328
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,406
I wouldn't have started it at all.

(your three years abroad?)

339
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,366
Why do you suddenly care about me?

340
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:33,446
(I love you.)

341

(to keep pickles.)

348
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:42,406
Who are you to decide my life?

349
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,526
(Because my best friend)

350
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,766
(has become my girlfriend.)

351
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:02,126
(I'll never)

352
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:03,126
(let her get hurt.)

353
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:05,086
I knew

354
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:06,566
you'd understand me.

355
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:40,686
How's it?

356
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:44,526
I heard of the infighting

357
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:45,766
in Yunlan.

358
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,246
Most of them support Xiao Xian.

359
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,806
They said the food handed out
in contempt

360
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:53,166
is anyhow better than
starvation to death.

361
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,286
Some of them prefer to explore

362
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,726
new business with Xiao Shangqi.

363
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,886
Xiao Xian let me tell you.

364
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:01,766
He said no more than three months,

365
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,246
and he'll make Xiao Shangqi

366
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,246
leave Hupu.

367
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,326
Do you think he can be trusted?

368
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,966
He's just a spineless man.

369
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:17,126
He sounds justly.

370
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,686
He claims it's meant for Yunlan.

371
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,806
But in fact, he's nothing

372
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:22,526
after Xiao Zhenyun died.

373
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:24,326
Do you know

374
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,726
what's the best use that

375
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:26,686
I can make of him?

376
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:29,726
No.

377
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:32,046
I need him to

378
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:33,566
irritate his brother.

379
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:41,246
Fei'er,

380
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,046
what do you think?

381
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,446
Xiao Shangqi wouldn't expect

382
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,606
his brother to fall out so soon.

383
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:51,606
I heard

384
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,566
he's also dumped by He Xiaoran.

385
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:55,886
He should now be considered as

386
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,286
having nothing and
he's been betrayed by everyone.

387
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:02,846
Is it? Is it that bad?

388
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,846
It's the price of him

389
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,486
giving me a punch at the wedding.

390
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:17,206
Do you think he bears more grudges

391
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:19,446
against you or me?

392
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,286
What does it have to do with me?

393
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:27,406
I can't be held responsible for this

394
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:29,486
in any way.

395
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,006
I've figured it out.

396
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,966
The password is 022...

397
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,206
02237.

398
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:22,886
How can you figure out

399
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:25,086
such a difficult question?

400
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,126
I hold my hand against it

401
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,406
while turning the dial.

402
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,526
When I turn it to the right number,

403
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,726
I'd hear a different sound.

404
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:36,326
Between the two of you,

405
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,926
one is steady and hardworking,

406
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,286
and the other one is smart and

407
00:23:40,726 --> 00:23:42,806
always thinks out of the box.
You're both right.

408
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:44,886
In the future,

409
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:46,086
I'll leave Yunlan

410
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:47,286
to the two of you.

Xian takes the helm
while Qi sets the sail.

412
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,766
I don't strive for nothing.

413
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:55,206
I can travel around the world.

414
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,326
Is this boat Yunlan?

415
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,086
Yes.

416
00:23:58,846 --> 00:23:59,966
Do you know why our company

417
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,446
is named as Yunlan?

418
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:04,886
"Lan" means big wave.

419
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,286
Ride and tide over the wave.

420
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:09,326
Yes.

421
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,446
A sincere person won't
make sorrowful sound.

422
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:12,966
The sea won't make self-panicking wave.

423
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:13,726
Hopefully,

424
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:14,806
after you grow up,

425
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:17,846
regardless of good times or bad times,

426
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:19,486
you'd remain enthusiastic,

427
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,126
steady and calm.

428
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,166

Do you want a two-day off?

475

No,

476
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,046
but I want to get off work
on time today.

477

What's next?

479
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,086
Go on.

480
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,726
Then I acted like a thug.

481
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,566
I seized his collar at once

482
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:46,806
and asked for protection fee.

483

She always picks

501
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,686
the most difficult and offensive jobs.

502
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:21,766
Someone has to do it eventually.

503
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:25,006

Don't talk about work.

"Last Goodbye".

513
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:41,606
Yes, "Last Goodbye".

go and talk to them.

517
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:53,686
Talk to them.

518
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:55,086
Yes, change the music.

519
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:57,206
Isn't it pleasant? I...

520
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:58,726
Hao, change the music.

521
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:02,846
Enough. It's not a big deal.

522
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,086
It's over.

523
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,006
Now, my life

524
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,166
is all about work.

525
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:14,766
This is more like it.

526
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:15,726
Yes.

527
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:16,926
They should play rock music

528
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:18,686
at where Hui is.

529
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:20,486
Atmospheric.

530
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:22,006
Lift your glasses.

531
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,206
Cheers.

532
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:32,606
Mr. Xiao,

533
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:33,846
it's the due date.

534
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,486
The new strategy group
makes no progress.

535
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:36,806
We have to dismiss your department

536
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:37,606
as promised

537
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,246
and ask you to leave Yunlan.

538
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,046
My belongings are still in the office.

539
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:45,766
Let him in.

540
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:02,486
From now on,

541
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,086
Yunlan has got nothing
to do with you anymore.

542
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,286
Either you're used to it

543
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,606
or not,

544
00:31:07,886 --> 00:31:08,606
I'll keep Yunlan alive

545
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,006
with my own way.

546
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,046
Do you have any plan in the future?

547
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,646
Since I can't fit in Hupu,

548
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:19,846
I'll fit in somewhere else.

549
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:24,886
I'm sorry.

550
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:26,446
The laptop belongs to the company.

551
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:27,886
It also stores Yunlan's information.

552
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:29,126
You may not take it.

553
00:31:58,286 --> 00:31:59,686
Xiaoran has mastered

554
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,166
a new skill lately.

555
00:32:01,646 --> 00:32:03,246
She sleeps whenever she's full.

556
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:04,446
It's impressive.

557
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:07,446
She'll fall asleep

558
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:08,646
only at the noisiest place

559
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:09,406
these days.

560
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:10,366
It's the same at home, too.

561
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:12,326
She wears headphone when she sleeps

562
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:12,926
to listen to rock music.

563
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:15,966
She's so busy with work.

564
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:18,326
How long can her body hold up?

565
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:36,326
Xiaoran.

566
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,046
It's a new product.

567
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:38,686
Try it.

568
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:40,726
Thank you.

569
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:42,686
Sui.

570
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:45,086
You don't stay here,

571
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:46,606
but you're paying the rent.

572
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:47,326
Do you think we both

573
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:48,086
are bullying you?

574
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:51,126
Don't try to chase me away.

575
00:32:52,246 --> 00:32:53,686
I'm paying the rent

576
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:55,766
because that's my choice.

577
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:56,886
I'll stay wherever I want.

578
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:58,966
This is also what I wanted to say.

579
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:00,246
You may go wherever you want,

580
00:33:00,406 --> 00:33:01,446
but pay on time every month.

581
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:04,486
I'm going up.

582
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:11,646
Mingwei,

583
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,886
you gave up on the motorcycle
and stopped living here.

584
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:17,406
You even started all over
again in the company.

585
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:19,326
You're well-intentioned.

586
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:20,646
Stop.

587
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,206
Stop mocking me.

588
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,446
I'm not.

589
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,286
I'm impressed by you.

590
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,326
At least, you chose the harder one

591
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:29,006
between taking advantage

592
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:29,846
in the name of sharing a house

593
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:31,366
and making a step back

594
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,446
to reshape yourself.

595
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:35,646
But, I want to tell you

596
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:36,766
that it isn't easy

597
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:37,806
to imitate Mr. Xiao.

598
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:41,566
Leave.

599
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:44,926
Tell me when you reach home.

600
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:04,486
Why are you still up?

601
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:06,566
I can't sleep so I work a bit.

602
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:12,526
Is this given by Sui

603
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:13,486
today?

604
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:14,685
Useless stuff.

605
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,806
There's nothing useful.

606
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:18,125
Didn't he say this?

607
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:20,645
Insomnia rate among the young people

608
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,006
is now as high as 15%.

609
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:23,165
He'll be financially free

610
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:23,886
if he really gets to develop

611
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:25,605
something effective.

612
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:28,486
You're the only one who is willing
to be a lab rat.

613
00:34:32,526 --> 00:34:33,446
Is your sleep affected

614
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,645
by this?

615
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:37,446
It's not to that extent.

616
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:39,205
I won't accuse him for this.

617
00:34:40,006 --> 00:34:40,645
It's just that my brain

618
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:43,326
is confused when I lie down on bed.

619
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:44,046
I can't sleep.

620
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:47,486
All right.

621
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,645
Time is the cure for everything.

622
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:51,966
Say what you have to say.

623
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:53,165
I'll take it with you.

624
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:58,166
Go to bed. I'm fine.

625
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:05,006
"Private Qingshan Nursing Home
changes its owner".

626
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:07,286
"The elderly people are asked to leave
in a week".

627
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:10,086
Here it comes again.

628
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:12,206
Your private phone number

629
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:13,766
is turning into
a whistle-blowing hotline.

630
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,046
It's better to have some work
than nothing at all.

631
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:21,046
I'm taking this away.

632
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:22,086
You're affected by it.

633
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:26,326
- Go to bed.
- Sleep early.

634
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,846
She took it away even though
she mocked him.

635
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,420
(Qingshan Nursing Home)

636
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,726
Sir, it isn't easy to get a taxi here.

637
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,326
Could you wait for me by price?

638
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:46,206
Approximately an hour.

639
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:46,766
Okay.

640
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:47,526
Thank you.

641
00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:53,646
Let's not leave.

642
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:55,686
Let's not leave even if they serve us

643
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:56,566
poor food.

644
00:35:56,846 --> 00:35:57,366
We must ask

645
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:58,686
for a clarification.

646
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,246
We can't let him do anything he likes.

647
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:04,806
You're Miss He, right?

648
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:05,766
Miss He is here.

649
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:07,166
Nice to see you.

650
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:09,286
Isn't it the right choice
to contact her?

651
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:10,286
- Yes.
- Yes.

652
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:12,406
Mei, you're here.

653
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:13,686
Why do you always

654
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:14,686
take pretty girls

655
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,566
as your son's girlfriend?

656
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:17,846
My goodness.

657
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,006
I'm at a nursing home.

658
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,086
She has

659
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:25,206
something called dementia.

660
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:26,686
Don't take it to your heart.

661
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:27,326
I'm fine.

662
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,246
Come on.

663
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:29,646
I'm sorry.

664
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:31,766
You should sit, too.

665
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:33,206
No, take a seat.

666
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:35,686
Do you mind if I record this?

667
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:36,886
We don't mind.

668
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:37,926
Go ahead.

669
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:39,486
All right.

670
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:43,246
Could you tell me

671
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:44,286
the actual situation?

672
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:44,806
Okay.

673
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:45,806
Here's the thing.

674
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:46,686
Ever since

675
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:47,886
the son of the former director, Mr. Wang,

676
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:48,966
took over

677
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:49,726
the nursing home,

678
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:50,766
the food quality

679
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:51,646
is getting worse.

680
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:52,966
Yes, it's simply inedible.

681
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:54,086
Fortunately, we're glad

682
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,046
that we stay together.

683
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:56,366
We don't complain much

684
00:36:56,686 --> 00:36:57,726
about the food.

685
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:58,406
Yes.

686
00:36:58,886 --> 00:36:59,806
In the end, the young director

687
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:00,806
suddenly announced that

688
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,206
he'll sell the home.

689
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:03,166
He wants to chase us away.

690
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,286
He wants to chase us away.

691
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:05,726
I took out the contract to have a look.

692
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:06,726
There's this phrase.

693
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:09,366
They reserve the right
of the final interpretation.

694
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:09,766
It's unreasonable.

695
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:10,646
- It's unreasonable.
- They care about nothing else...

696
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:11,726
after giving us

697
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:12,886
a month of financial compensation.

698
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:14,366
Where should we go?

699
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,846
Who will move into a nursing home

700
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:18,246
if one has a home?

701
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,326
- Yes.
- Exactly.

702
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,286
Miss He,

703
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:22,526
could you go

704
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:23,966
talk to Mr. Wang

705
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:24,766
and threaten him?

706
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:25,286
Yes.

707
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:25,846
That's right.

708
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:26,726
Threaten him.

709
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:28,006
Everyone,

710
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:29,206
take it easy.

711
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:30,766
I can't threaten him.

712
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:32,246
What about this?

713
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,006
I'll go and learn about

714
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:33,766
the actual situation first,

715
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:34,246
okay?

716
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:34,726
Sure.

717
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:35,366
Yes.

718
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:36,246
It's over there.

719
00:37:36,246 --> 00:37:36,806
Yes.

720
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:37,526
The office is over there.

721
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:38,086
Sure.

722
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:38,646
Thank you.

723
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:39,166
We're looking forward
to hearing from you.

724
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,046
Sure, thank you.

725
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,686
You must solve it for us.

726
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:42,766
Sure.

727
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:43,646
This is good.

728
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:44,326
There's a hope.

729
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:45,286
Yes.

730
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:46,246
Miss He.

731
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:47,526
Hello.

732
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:48,886
Hello.

733
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:50,246
May I know where is

734
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:51,086
Mr. Wang's office?

735
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:52,326
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:53,326
We're closed.

737
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:54,366
We don't accept new resident anymore.

738
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:55,326
No.

739
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:56,286
I just want to

740
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:57,406
interview him.

741
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:00,646
Mr. Wang isn't around.

742
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:02,606
When will he come back?

743
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:05,726
Mr. Wang.

744
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:10,486
Don't stir up any trouble.

745
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:11,406
Leave now.

746
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:15,686
Where's she?

747
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:17,366
She's seen here on the CCTV.

748
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:18,446
We'll get into trouble

749
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:19,126
if Mr. Wang knows we let

750
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:19,926
a stranger in.

751
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:20,806
Come on.

752
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:51,166
Why are you here?

753
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:52,966
Work matter.

754
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:54,886
What about you?

755
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:58,326
It has nothing to do with you.

756
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:07,286
Is it her?

757
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:08,006
She's really here.

758
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:08,926
What do you want?

759
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,126
I'm here to see Mr. Wang.

760
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,046
Well...

761
00:40:15,686 --> 00:40:16,286
I've taken over

762
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:17,006
this nursing home.

763
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:18,446
What do you want to ask?

764
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:20,806
I'm about to look for Mr. Wang, too.

765
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,326
Mr. Xiao is a businessman.

766
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:35,806
Why does he acquire

767
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:36,686
Qingshan Nursing Home?

768
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:38,086
Do you know each other?

769
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:38,566
Not really.

770
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:39,446
Business consideration.

771
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:40,446
From what I know,

772
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:41,686
Qingshan Nursing Home used to be

773
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:42,726
a hotel.

774
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:43,846
Do you chase the elderly people away

775
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:45,126
to convert the home back to a hotel?

776
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:45,806
Yes.

777
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,286
How do you negotiate

778
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,886
over the timing of discharge?

779
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:49,926
How do you communicate

780
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:50,846
with the elderly people?

781
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:52,606
Do you have alternative options

782
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:53,726
for some of them in difficulty?

783
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:55,046
If you don't mind,

784
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:56,566
I'm going to record

785
00:40:56,846 --> 00:40:57,686
our interview from now on.

786
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:03,326
Why do you want to record this?

787
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:05,926
Miss He,

788
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:07,446
let me put it this way.

789
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,686
My father founded this nursing home

790
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:11,326
purely out of a kind of sentiment.

791
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:12,846
The key is it's not a good business

792
00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:13,726
right now.

793
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:15,326
If I don't dispose

794
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:16,486
this loss-making business,

795
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:17,606
it'll go out of business
sooner or later.

796
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:18,686
The elderly people still have to leave

797
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:19,406
when that happens.

798
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:20,766
I also have to leave.

799
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,246
We discharged them

800
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,446
totally based on

801
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:25,006
the contract.

802
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,286
You can't pick any error.

803
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:28,166
I can't comment on the rest.

804
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:31,886
Please leave.

805
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:36,246
No comment.

806
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:39,846
Is this your explanation

807
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:41,126
over the matter?

808
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:42,326
Miss He.

809
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:43,726
It won't be pleasant

810
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:44,886
dwelling on the matter.

811
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:46,566
You should make an appointment

812
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:47,686
if you really want an interview.

813
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:51,326
I have things to discuss with Mr. Xiao.

814
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:52,166
See yourself out.

815
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:55,126
I'll come back.

816
00:41:57,286 --> 00:41:58,526
Since you don't cooperate
with me for the interview,

817
00:41:58,886 --> 00:41:59,606
I'll make an objective report

818
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:00,686
based on

819
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:01,926
my gathered information.

820
00:42:11,606 --> 00:42:12,566
What a fuss.

821
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:14,086
Mr. Xiao.

822
00:42:15,126 --> 00:42:16,446
You've found the information

823
00:42:16,606 --> 00:42:17,086
you were looking for, haven't you?

824
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:18,366
Let's carry on the procedure.

825
00:42:18,846 --> 00:42:19,606
The agreement of transfer

826
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:21,526
is already in progress.

827
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:23,246
Why did you inform the discharge

828
00:42:23,406 --> 00:42:24,326
only a few days ago?

829
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:28,166
It's because I haven't received

830
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:29,206
your deposit.

831
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:31,246
If you act like your father

832
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:32,526
who lost contact

833
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:33,446
halfway through the business deal,

834
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:34,606
I'll lose

835
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,726
both the residents

836
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,726
and the buyer.

837
00:42:38,646 --> 00:42:39,166
Don't worry.

838
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:41,766
I'll transfer the deposit
in the next few days.

839
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:43,206
No problem.

840
00:42:46,446 --> 00:42:46,846
Mr. Xiao,

841
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:48,526
the day of discharge

842
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:50,526
was decided by my father.

843
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:51,326
Now, it seems

844
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,806
somewhat hasty,

845
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:54,886
and it's been targeted by a journalist.

846
00:42:55,046 --> 00:42:56,286
Shall we postpone

847
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:57,286
the day of discharge?

848
00:42:58,086 --> 00:42:58,606
Mr. Wang,

849
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:00,966
I'll do whatever it takes

850
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:02,446
to enforce

851
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,566
every clause in the contract

852
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:06,846
