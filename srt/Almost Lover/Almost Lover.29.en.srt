17

Xiao Xian!

18
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:46,218
Just wait.

19
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:47,417
I'll never let you two

20
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:48,578
ruin my father's work!

21
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:49,377
Okay.

22
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:50,858
From now on,

23
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:52,218
we'll go on separate ways.

24
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:53,657
We'll use our own ways

25
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:54,977
to protect father's wishes,

26
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:56,377
okay?

27
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,218
You brothers are

28
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,138
very good at acting.

29
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,417
The set that we've planned

30
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,337
is finally going to be useful.

31
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:09,937
It's going to be a tough battle.

32
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:11,137
Don't worry.

33
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,297
As long as you and Xian are together,

34
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,058
you'll be able to turn the tables.

35
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:19,418
I'll go get some fresh air.

36
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:28,258
Xiaoran,

37
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:29,618
let's have a cup of coffee.

38
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:31,818
Okay.

39
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,818
Are you here to visit the elderly?

40
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:39,857
I've given

41
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,497
the evidence to Xiao Shangqi.

42
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:46,577
He Xiaoran,

43
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,418
I've really let go this time.

44
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:54,418
Well,

45
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:57,217
do you remember that we went hiking

46
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,538
and waited for the sunrise

47
00:02:58,577 --> 00:02:59,777
on the mountain in high school?

48
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:02,937
You wanted to be the first one

49
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:04,217
so you ran so fast.

50
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,978
I couldn't catch up.

51
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:07,497
I fell down

52
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:08,737
and hurt my knee

53
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:10,058
before you could stop.

54
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:11,818
You stopped and helped me.

55
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:13,258
We even formed

56
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,497
a casualty's camp.

57
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,017
We reached the last.

58
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,137
What are you trying to say?

59
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:22,818
Actually, only the two of you

60
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,458
are moving forward

61
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:25,857
at the same pace

62
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,178
while I've stayed at the same place

63
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,777
and I couldn't catch up with you.

64
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,258
So, I've decided

65
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,458
to start walking on my own path.

66
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:43,497
You don't believe me?

67
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:46,297
No.

68
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:47,618
I'm happy for you

69
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:48,937
for thinking like that.

70
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:50,618
Come on.

71
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:52,058
You're happy

72
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,497
because I've stepped out

73
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:55,577
so you and Xiao Shangqi

74
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,418
can get back together.

75
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:02,737
The problem between he and I

76
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,818
is not you.

77
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:10,297
After all, you've loved him for so long.

78
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,217
I don't believe that

79
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,377
you can let it go easily.

80
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:20,298
Yes.

81
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:26,258
I came here from Hupu

82
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,217
because of you two.

83
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,897
I was

84
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,377
frustrated back then.

85
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:34,377
I wanted to have a good ending.

86
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:37,858
I've loved him for so long.

87
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:40,018
When we broke up...

88
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:46,497
But, after we met again,

89
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:48,698
we've encountered so many things.

90
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:50,337
I'm also thinking

91
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:52,657
maybe in love,

92
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,457
two people

93
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:56,377
getting together

94
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:57,617
might not be the perfect ending.

95
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,258
What other ending could there be?

96
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:03,937
I don't want this relationship anymore.

97
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:05,738
I don't want to repeat the mistake.

98
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,497
This is my ending.

99
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:10,777
Thanks for the coffee.

100
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,018
I'll go back to the station now.

101
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,818
After you two met again,

102
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,858
we always talked about what you think.

103
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,138
This is the first time

104
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:45,098
you've clearly stated that

105
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,777
you're refusing it.

106
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:48,657
Are you that determined?

107
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:50,258
You think I can't let it go?

108
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,138
Chen Fei'er also said the same.

109
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,177
I just realised once she said that.

110
00:05:58,217 --> 00:05:59,538
After all these years,

111
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:00,978
I've never let go of

112
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:01,978
one thing

113
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,258
which is that I love Xiao Shangqi.

114
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,497
But to Xiao Shangqi,

115
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:07,538
I'm just someone

116
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:08,777
he has dated

117
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:09,777
for a few months.

118
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,337
Once he's facing something,

119
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:12,937
he can just let go of my hands.

120
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:15,177
Also, our relationship

121
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,057
didn't start

122
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:17,098
from the same place.

123
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:19,978
So, even if we reconcile this time,

124
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,457
when we face the same issue again,

125
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,018
he'll still push me away.

126
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,818
I don't want to repeat that.

127
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:28,578
Come in.

128
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:37,978
Thank you.

129
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,777
Chen Fei'er gave the evidence to you.

130
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,858
Do you want to tell He Xiaoran?

131
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:45,457
She probably has been informed.

132
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,337
No worries.

133
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:48,617
When we've defeated Zhao Mingxuan,

134
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,858
everything will come to an end.

135
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,098
Then you can pursue her

136
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,377
once again.

137
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,578
Things might

138
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:56,897
come to an end soon,

139
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,818
but we might be unable
to get back together.

140
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:01,057
Back then,

141
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,177
with the environment

142
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:03,258
and all the other factors,

143
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,298
you only had one choice.

144
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,177
If I'm given a chance,

145
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,298
no matter how high the price is,

146
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:17,018
I'll never let go anymore.

147
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:19,217
Fei'er has given

148
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:20,698
him the important evidence,

149
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:22,138
I believe

150
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,538
everything will come to light soon.

151
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:27,177
We'll be back to our own lives

152
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:29,098
and shall not disturb one another.

153
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:32,057
Maybe when we meet again,

154
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,177
we'll greet each other.

155
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,657
Or when we're in trouble,

156
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:37,858
we'll help each other.

157
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:39,457
But in terms of relationship,

158
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:41,738
we're not getting back together.

159
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,698
My goodness. It sounds pathetic to me.

160
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:49,098
It's a clean cut.

161
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:50,777
I'm moving on

162
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:51,897
and moving forward.

163
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:54,418
That's great.

164

(Artist signing contract)
What about you? Have you signed the contract?

165
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,578
Yes.

166
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:03,897
Have you told Sui?

167
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,298
No need.

168
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:06,337
No need to bother him.

Looking at the company's scale,

170
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:26,160
(Museum of Pastel Art)

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,377
(Museum of Pastel Art)
it should be reliable.

172
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,298
Hui seems

173
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:30,937
happy today.

174
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:32,457
I feel like the weather has
become better, too.

175
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,418
Stop recording. Why are you recording?

176
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,178
I'll take a vlog.

177
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,657
When you're famous,

178
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:39,577
today will be the day one of

179
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:40,858
you becoming a star.

180
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:42,178
Please don't

181
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:43,618
expect that from me.

182
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:45,217
This time, I only

183
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:46,457
want to produce music steadily.

184
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,618
I'm not thinking about other things.

185
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:55,298
Don't send this

186
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:56,577
to someone.

187
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,298
Sui Mingwei's just worried about you.

188
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:02,817
There are many swindlers

189
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,217
in the industry now.

190
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:05,337
The more he knows,

191
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:06,378
the less worried he will be.

192
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:08,538
Let's take dinner together tonight.

193
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:09,498
Tell us

194
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:10,498
the details today

195
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:11,538
to widen our horizon.

196
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:15,697
The two of you

197
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:16,777
are great.

198
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:19,137
It feels like we're back
to our childhood.

199
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:21,378
The starting is not bad. Let's go.

200
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:28,938
Our company is not bad, right?

201
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:32,738
Although our current scale is not big,

202
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,257
I believe

203
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:35,337
when we have you,

204
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:36,178
the future star,

205
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,217
we'll be on the right track.

206
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:39,858
Here. Take a look.

207
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,378
This is our lounge,

208
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:43,137
bar,

209
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:43,697
and our

210
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:44,498
rehearsal room.

211
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,418
Hui.

212
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,298
Let me introduce.

213
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:49,777
This is our company's

214
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:50,697
best composer.

215
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,017
Once he heard that I'm signing you,

216
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,017
he immediately asked to

217
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:53,978
collaborate with you.

218
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:54,897
Li Hui.

219
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:55,858
Hello.

220
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:57,378
Nice to meet you.

221
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,058
I've listened to your song, "Yes".

222
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:00,657
I was already your fan then.

223
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:01,577
Thank you.

224
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:03,137
Well, Hui,

225
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:04,777
do you have any new songs?

226
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,257
Let's choose a few

227
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:07,457
and compose a few songs, okay?

228
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,058
Is that okay?

229
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:10,137
I fully support you.

230
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:11,257
I fully support you.

231
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:11,897
That's great.

232
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,098
Thank you, everyone.

233
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:14,777
Hui seems

234
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:16,337
happy today.

235
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:17,817
I feel like the weather has
become better, too.

236
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:20,498
Stop recording.

237
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:21,498
Why are you recording?

238
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:22,858
I'll take a vlog.

239
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:27,938
Hello, Ji. Play a song.

240
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:29,178
Coming.

241
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:30,217

What are you doing here?

246
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,058
I'm thinking

00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,418
where to have fun later.

248
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,697

I can't find someone

And the thing that

you were researching on.

The projects in

275
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:53,817
the photos

276
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:55,257
are indeed handled by Zhao Mingxuan,

277
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:57,298
but they're all fragments,

278
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:58,817
and the information is not complete.

279
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,978
Even the amounts are not clear.

280
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:02,897
It's hard to get some

281
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:03,858
useful information.

282
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:04,618
But?

283
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:05,178
Well,

284
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:06,098
but I've found someone

285
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,337
to check on the amounts

286
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:08,938
and we found

287
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:10,178
the critical information.

288
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:12,457
Something is surely wrong with

289
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:14,337
the Lihe project in the photo.

290
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,378

Xian,

292
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:18,978
think of a way

293
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,538
to investigate within Deju.

294
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:21,817
Cutting corners

295
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:22,938
are just on the surface.

296
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:24,858
The most critical problem is

297
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:26,697
where the money went.

298
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:29,538
Why is it you?

299
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:32,298
What's Yunlan's people doing here?

300
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:33,817
Where's Mr. Wei?

301
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:37,577
Mr. Tian,

302
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:39,017
it's not easy to meet you.

303
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:40,498
Let me be frank.

304
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:42,137
Zhao Mingxuan has caused Deju

305
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:43,217
to be a mess.

306
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:44,418
If this continues,

307
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,098
Deju can't go far.

308
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,178
So, everyone can instruct

309
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,817
Deju to do anything now?

310
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:51,777
After Zhao Mingxuan was promoted,

311
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,178
your life has been tough, right?

312
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,538
(Whether it's tough or not)

313
00:12:58,858 --> 00:12:59,457
(has nothing to do with you,)

314
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,378
(an outsider.)

315
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,657
(Zhao Mingxuan is trying hard)

316
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,217
(to get rid of the elders in Deju)

317
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:04,498
(in every aspect.)

318
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,498
(Actually, he has been looking
for an opportunity)

319
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:07,657
(to kick you out from Deju.)

320
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:09,098
(But, it's not as easy as)

321
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,298
(getting you all to step down.)

322
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:19,777
(I'm sure)

323
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,017
(Mr. Wei's very clear about this.)

324
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,257
(Aren't you aware?)

325
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,457
Mr. Wei is on your side?

326
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:31,298
Mr. Wei told me that

327
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,618
you've handled Lihe's project before.

328
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:37,938
My father's death is not
as simple as it seems.

329
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,098
He's got the evidence of Zhao Mingxuan

330
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:42,178
cutting corners in Qingshan project.

331
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:43,738
Qingshan has been demolished

332
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:44,618
by Zhao Mingxuan,

333
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:46,618
but the information that we have

334
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:46,897
in hand

335
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:49,098
is all against Lihe.

336
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,058
Lihe?

337
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:51,178
No way.

338
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,058
Lihe was handled by me.

339
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:56,378
No way.

340
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:58,457
Could he

341
00:13:58,817 --> 00:13:59,938
have tricked me somewhere?

342
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:00,978
Lihe and Qingshan

343
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:01,978
are quite similar.

344
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:03,777
The investment is huge,

345
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,137
but there was no profit.

346
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:06,657
Have you thought of

347
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:07,418
he might have done something

348
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:08,418
without your acknowledgment?

349
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:10,217
Mr. Tian,

350
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:11,897
investigate this with us.

351
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:13,897
Otherwise, once Zhao Mingxuan's matter

352
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:14,657
is exposed,

353
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,217
I'm afraid you'll be involved.

354
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:18,017
Then...

355
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:19,938
Then what do you want me to do?

356
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:20,978
Verify again

357
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,178
all the information of Lihe.

358
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:23,098
But,

359
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,577
I can only check

360
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,897
a part of the information.

361
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,017
Yes, I know.

362
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,098
The data is not comprehensive.

363
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,137
We're getting others to get involved.

364
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:32,817
But through the process,

365
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:33,938
I realised that within Deju,

366
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:35,657
many people are not happy with him.

367
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:37,697
This is good news to us.

368
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,457
But from what I know,

369
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:40,897
Lihe didn't have any

370
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:42,697
encrypted content.

371
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:44,378
Then check everything once again.

372
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:46,577
We'll surely find something.

373
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:49,137
Mr. Tian said

374
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,298
he remembers the price stated

375
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,058
in the contract.

376
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,017
He's agreed to get the information

377
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,178
from the system for us.

378
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:57,538
You can look for the suppliers

379
00:14:58,058 --> 00:14:58,618
to find out

380
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,137
the average price at that time.

381
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:03,697
Qi,

382
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:04,657
I think

383
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:05,938
we're not far from the truth.

384
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:12,498
Come in.

385
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:14,777
How was it? Was it okay?

386
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,017
Mr. Sun and Madam Wang

387
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:19,897
have checked out.

388
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:20,817
He Xiaoran is bringing them

389
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:21,938
to the new nursing home.

390
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:23,457
Let's go and take a look.

391
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:35,178
Okay.

392
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:36,697
Let's go.

393
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:38,538
Mr. Xiao.

394
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,577
Thank you for taking care of us.

395
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:42,938
Let's go.

396
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:45,938
No need.

397
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:46,738
Get back to work.

398
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:47,817
I can bring them there.

399
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:51,257
It's okay.

400
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:52,657
I was busy earlier on.

401
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:53,897
I'm not familiar with

402
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:54,897
the new nursing home.

403
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:55,938
I can go and check it out.

404
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:56,817
When did you start to show concern

405
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:57,657
about this?

406
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:00,418
I've made a mistake before,

407
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,538
but I should be given a chance
to amend it.

408
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,498
I was just saying,

409
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:06,418
but I didn't know

410
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:08,098
Miss He was able to convince them

411
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:09,418
to take both of us in.

412
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:09,938
I was

413
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:11,098
just telling them

414
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:12,137
the entire matter.

415
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:12,978
Okay.

416
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:13,858
Let's go.

417
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:14,418
Okay.

418
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:15,384
Let's go.

419
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:16,178
Let's go.

420
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,490
(Lizhen Nursing Home)

421
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:21,538
(Lizhen Nursing Home)
This is provided by

422
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:21,817
(Lizhen Nursing Home)

423
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,058
(Lizhen Nursing Home)
the nursing home for the elderly.

424
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,378
It smells good for laundry.

425
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,137
You can then sleep better.

426
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:28,858
It smells good.

427
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,137
It smells familiar.

428
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:32,738
I used this

429
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,538
at home before, too.

430
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:35,337
Really?

431
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,418
Then you'll feel like you're at home.

432
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:38,498
Miss,

433
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:39,938
can I add you on WeChat?

434
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:41,577
If Madam Wang needs anything,

435
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:42,337
you can look for me.

436
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:43,217
Let me scan yours.

437
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:44,298
Okay.

438
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:52,938
You must be her daughter.

439
00:16:58,657 --> 00:16:59,858
You're not her family?

440
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,137
Give it to me.

441
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,138
I've been looking for it.

442
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:06,098
So, it's here.

443
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:08,297
I've basically settled down.

444
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,177
The place that Miss He found for us

445
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:11,177
is not bad.

446
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:12,738
Carry on.

447
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:13,817
I'm leaving now.

448
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:14,457
Thank you.

449
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:15,138
- Wang.
- Bye.

450
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:16,498
There's a garden down there.

451
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,297
Let's go there later.

452
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:18,978
Wen.

453
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:21,177
Didn't Xiaomei come?

454
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,337
Me?

455
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:25,738
You're confused again.

456
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:27,697
He's not your son.

457
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,697
He's the CEO, Mr. Xiao.

458
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:30,658
What?

459
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,537
My son is capable,

460
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,498
but he's not a CEO.

461
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:35,817
Wen,

462
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,057
are you busy lately

463
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:38,417
and you didn't eat well?

464
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:39,498
You've lost weight.

465
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:40,337
Let's go.

466
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:41,778
I'll bring you to eat some snack.

467
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,498
I...

468
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:43,778
- Let's go.
- I...

469
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,258
She'll get confused whenever
she sees the photo.

470
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,258
Her son was working in Hupu.

471
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:50,018
I think

472
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,498
he was working in a hotel, too.

473
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:53,098
He became rich for a while.

474
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:54,297
But when

475
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:55,658
he was doing so well,

476
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:56,697
he died.

477
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:57,898
Look.

478
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,297
His mother has to attend his funeral.

479
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:01,978
Who can handle it?

480
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,457
- Eat this.
- Thank you.

481
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:04,018
Dig in.

482
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:06,417
There's more here.

483
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:07,738
Dig in.

484
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:08,697
One is enough.

485
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:09,618
- Dig in.
- One is enough.

486
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:11,098
Eat more. You're too skinny.

487
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,537
She's confused.

488
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:14,337
Xiaomei,

489
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:15,618
you're back?

490
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:18,858
Why is she getting everyone involved?

491
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:19,817
She treats you

492
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:21,337
as his son's girlfriend again.

493
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,697
His girlfriend

494
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,217
didn't contact her anymore

495
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:26,177
after he died.

496
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:28,138
Xiaomei.

497
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,098
Madam Wang.

498
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,138
Xiaomei.

499
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,018
Wen.

500
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,098
When are you getting married?

501
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:36,297
Madam Wang, we're not...

502
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:36,817
Very soon.

503
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,378
That's great.

504
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:41,138
Hurry up.

505
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,457
Did I move again?

506
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:48,738
Where are you staying?

507
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:49,978
They're staying at home.

508
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,057
I'm staying here with you.

509
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:53,937
Yes.

510
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:55,858
This is the nursing home.

511
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,978
Wen is too busy.

512
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:00,618
He's dating Xiaomei

513
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:01,697
only when he's old

514
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:02,898
and she's such a nice lady.

515
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:04,778
Get back to work.

516
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,498
Come and visit me often.

517
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:07,297
Go ahead.

518
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:07,937
We're leaving now.

519
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:09,057
Madam Wang, see you.

520
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,898
Take a good rest.

521
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:13,138
Wang,

522
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:14,498
I'll go to the garden

523
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,098
with you in a while.

524
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,297
I know you were trying to
make her happy,

525
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:24,937
but I think

526
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,177
it was not necessary.

527
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:29,177
You know that

528
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,697
but why are you so upset?

529
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:32,618
You're the righteous journalist

530
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,177
who became the guardian

531
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:35,098
of Madam Wang

532
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,417
who has no kids

533
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:37,378
so that she can stay here.

534
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,937
Is that even same?

535
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:43,258
Well,

536
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:44,697
how's the investigation

537
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:45,937
with Fei'er's evidence?

538
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:47,577
We've got

539
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,297
the internal information of the project.

540
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,417
No matter how hard Zhao Mingxuan
is trying to hide it,

541
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,018
as long as we investigate thoroughly,

542
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,378
we'll find the loophole.

543
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,577
It's about to end soon.

544
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:02,658
Yes.

545
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:04,457
It's about to end soon.

546
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:09,337
Then I can do another thing

547
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:10,498
wholeheartedly.

548
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:12,618
What's it?

549
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:15,457
Do you want to take dinner together?

550
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:16,658
No.

551
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:17,697
I'm meeting someone.

552
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:19,978
Who is it?

553
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,417
Why is he here?

554
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:32,817
He insisted on coming.

555
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,898
I've never seen anyone

556
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:38,778
eating for free so naturally.

557
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:43,778
Did you...

558
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:44,457
No.

559
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:45,577
Nothing.

560
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,697
Not going to happen.

561
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,858
Who knows what will happen
in the future?

562
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,177
Everything

563
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:53,057
will end well.

564
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:54,417
If it doesn't,

565
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,177
it means it's not the end.

566
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,098
Xiaoran,

567
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:00,378
I don't think our relationship

568
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:01,337
has come to an end.

569
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,417
It's too early to make the conclusion.

570
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,018
Maybe in love,

571
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,658
two people

572
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:10,537
getting together

573
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:11,658
might not be the perfect ending.

574
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:13,978
What other ending could there be?

575
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:17,744
I don't want this relationship anymore.

576
00:21:18,297 --> 00:21:19,658
I don't want to repeat the mistake.

577
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:21,417
This is my ending.

578
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,258
Enough.

579
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:27,417
Talk about this

580
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:28,537
in private.

581
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:29,697
Take a look

582
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:31,217
at what you want to eat. Just order.

583
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,138
It's on my today.

584
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:32,898
Okay.

585
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,337
You've become rich
after signing the contract.

586
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:35,697
Of course.

587
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:36,898
You've signed the contract?

588
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:39,417
It's not reliable at all.

589
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:40,658
It's a small company.

590
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,537
They have yet to pay her.

591
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:44,697
I know someone doesn't like it.

592
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:45,778
Can we not talk about this?

593
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:49,217
No one wants to bother you about that.

594
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:50,618
From tomorrow onwards,

595
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:51,978
I'll be very busy.

596
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,658
I want to market my fragrance
aiding for sleep

597
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:54,978
in the shopping mall.

598
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:56,937
It's going on shelf?

599
00:21:58,057 --> 00:21:58,937
Awesome.

600
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:01,577
I wish you get to sell a lot of them.

601
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:03,858
Congratulations, Mr. Sui.

602
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:05,457
Mr. Sui.

603
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:43,297
Mr. Zhao,

604
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:44,817
all the core data of Lihe

605
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:46,378
has been exported in the interview.

606
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:47,778
This is the list of the staff ID

607
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:48,577
logging in to the interview.

608
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,350
(Interview staff list)

609
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:15,898
Taiyang.

610
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:17,457
Madam Fei'er.

611
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:18,978
What are you doing?

612
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,978
He said it's on fire.

613
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:23,297
This firefighter is here.

614
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,337
Where is it?

615
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:26,098
Here!

616
00:23:26,258 --> 00:23:27,978
I'm a firefighter. Who are you?

617
00:23:28,337 --> 00:23:30,057
I'm a chef.

618
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,697
My restaurant is on fire.

619
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,018
Please help me.

620
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:36,018
Madam Fei'er,

621
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,378
what do you do?

622
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:38,457
I'm a chef.

623
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,378
My father is a manager.

624
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:46,697
Mr. Xiao Shangqi is a CEO.

625
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:48,778
Madam Xiaoran is a journalist.

626
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,018
Then what do you do?

627
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:52,138
You stay with me in the hotel every day.

628
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,258
I want my father to be like you.

629
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:02,098
Who is this little guy?

630
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:02,457
Father.

631
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:04,337
You're going everywhere on weekend.

632
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:05,498
Go look for Mr. Meng for a meal.

633
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:11,498
Thank you.

634
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,738
May I ask

635
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:19,457
if you know how to write a resume?

636
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:21,177
You're asking the right person.

637
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,098
Take a seat.

638
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:25,898
Come here.

639
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:27,098
Take a seat.

640
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:28,898
I'll show you a few websites.

641
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:30,057
Look.

642
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,618
This website has all the templates.

643
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,858
You can choose it

644
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,297
based on the position you're applying.

645
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:36,217
For example,

646
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:37,738
there are management posts,

647
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:39,177
finance industry,

648
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:40,658
and education.

649
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,498
I think this is nice.

650
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:43,258
The blue one.

651
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,658
The template is rather neat

652
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,978
and clean.

653
00:24:58,258 --> 00:24:58,778
Miss Chen.

654
00:24:59,138 --> 00:24:59,697
You woke up early.

655
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:00,697
Are you going to take breakfast?

656
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:01,858
An interview.

657
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:03,098
You just sent it yesterday

658
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:04,337
and you have an interview today?

659
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:05,457
You're

660
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:07,498
going like this?

661
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:10,337
Why?

662
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:19,498
Bring a few more resumes.

663
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,098
You need to give however many copies
to all the interviewers.

664
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:23,057
You need to keep one yourself.

665
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:24,337
So, you know what to answer

666
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,098
when they're asking questions.

667
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:26,817
Normally, they'll ask you

668
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:27,738
to introduce yourself first.

669
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:28,498
Try to say something

670
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:29,618
that's not written in the resume.

671
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:31,417
Just relax.

672
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:33,817
You're long-winded.

673
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:35,978
If I didn't stop you,

674
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:37,217
maybe you would've

675
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:38,378
failed the interview.

676
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,697
Well, bring a pen.

677
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,457
In case there's a test.

678
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:46,697
What?

679
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:48,417
You're moved?

680
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:50,457
You're

681
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:52,658
like a mother

682
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:54,138
sending her kid to
the high school examination.

683
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:55,498
Really?

684
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:56,577
That's all?

685
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:57,618
I haven't thought of

686
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:58,817
what to do when Taiyang is taking

687
00:25:59,018 --> 00:25:59,738
the high school examination.

688
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:01,858
I'm leaving.

689
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:03,978
Relax.

690
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:57,697
(Mr. Xiao, I've checked it out.)

691
00:26:58,098 --> 00:26:59,177
(The purchase fund you mentioned)

692
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:00,697
(looks good in the system.)

693
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:01,817
(The amount is totally different)

694
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:02,817
(from the amount in the photo)

695
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:03,898
(that you've given to me.)

696
00:27:06,577 --> 00:27:07,297
Come in.

697
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,577
Mr. Xiao, Mr. Zhao's asking to meet you.

698
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:12,057
Now?

699
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,018
Yes.

700
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:42,618
You all have

701
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:43,937
been asked here for a meeting as well?

702
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:50,297
Mr. Tian.

703
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:56,817
They're all our people.

704
00:27:58,498 --> 00:27:59,138
Mr. Tian,

705
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:00,378
you asked me here for the meeting?

706
00:28:00,937 --> 00:28:01,658
I didn't.

707
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:03,978
It's me.

708
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:11,258
Mr. Zhao.

709
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:13,937
You've asked for so many people

710
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,057
here for the meeting.

711
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,150
(Wu Haoyu, Lu Haoxuan,
Specialists of Business Segment)

712
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:41,417
The meeting is over now.

713
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,738
You can leave first.

714
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:54,457
What's going on?

715
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:55,937
Let's talk when we go back. Come on.

716
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,978
Why are you investigating

717
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:10,217
Lihe suddenly?

718
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:12,778
Did you receive a document?

719
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,057
The data in there

720
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:15,498
is fake.

721
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:17,658
Even Chen Fei'er

722
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,537
who brought the document to you

723
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,217
was something set up by me.

724
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:24,417
Let me tell you another thing.

725
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:25,937
Lihe

726
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:29,417
is the cleanest project I've ever done.

727
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:31,898
It's useless for you

728
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,378
to go to the bottom of the matter.

729
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:39,018
Xiao Xian.

730
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,258
As a dog,

731
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,498
you don't obey your master.

732
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,898
You bite him instead.

733
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:55,057
Zhao Mingxuan.

734
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:58,138
You've caused my father's death.

735
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:00,217
Do you think

736
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,537
I'll just let it slide?

737
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:03,697
One day,

738
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,057
I'll surely send you

739
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:06,337
to the place you should be at!

740
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:08,057
You've frightened me.

741
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:10,417
You're so ambitious.

742
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:12,177
You have to live longer then.

743
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:14,697
All the things that you're doing now

744
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:16,018
can't send me away.

745
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,778
Do you know why

746
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:19,697
I asked them

747
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,898
to leave first?

748
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,658
It's rare that you exposed

749
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:25,738
yourself.

750
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:27,018
I'm going to take it slow

751
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:29,378
in this game.

752
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:30,457
I want to give

753
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:32,138
all those who were here just now

754
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:34,217
to find a way out.

755
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:36,217
I want them to be afraid
even when they're sleeping

756
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:37,778
before they know the result.

757
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:40,738
But to Yunlan,

758
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:44,217
I'm not that patient anymore.

759
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,138
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
There's something urgent in Hupu.

760
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:02,498
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

761
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:03,138
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
I need to be there for a few days.

762
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,700
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

763
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:27,858
(I remember now.)

764
00:31:28,297 --> 00:31:29,258
(She's the fake bride)

765
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:30,817
(covered in the previous news.)

766
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:32,297
(I'm sorry.)

767
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:33,018
(Miss Chen Fei'er,)

768
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:34,217
(our company)

769
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,258
(emphasises on
personality and credibility.)

770
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:42,498
Mr. Lin.

771
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:47,337
You're back.

772
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,018
You're holding...

773
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:51,057
That company is terrible.

774
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:52,057
The lighting is bad.

775
00:31:52,297 --> 00:31:53,177
The seat is small.

776
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:54,417
They've wasted my resume.

777
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:55,498
You're

778
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:56,457
really terrible.

779
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:57,898
Mr. Xiao treats you so well.

780
00:31:58,098 --> 00:31:58,537
Mr. Lin paid for your room

781
00:31:58,738 --> 00:31:59,577
for you to stay here.

782
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:01,138
Is this how you treat them?

783
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:03,138
You bite the hand that feeds you.

784
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,337
What do you mean?

785
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:09,978
The project that you showed us

786
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:11,258
was fine,

787
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:12,817
but those

788
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:13,498
who investigated the project

789
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:14,297
have been found out by Zhao Mingxuan

790
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:15,138
and they've become his target.

791
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:16,297
Deju has now stopped

792
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:17,817
all the business deals with Yunlan.

793
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:18,898
There's news in the industry that

794
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,337
Xiao Xian is a betrayer.

795
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:23,537
Miss Chen, let me be straightforward.

796
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:25,217
Did you put the bait

797
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,177
among us?

798
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,018
Did you come here

799
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:30,457
as a part of his plan?

800
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:37,138
Even you're suspecting me?

801
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:37,978
What are you talking about?

802
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:39,138
It's you who set us up.

803
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:25,817
You don't like him?

804
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:32,978
Don't be scared.

805
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:37,978
Of course.

806
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,018
A terrible place like this

807
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:42,858
doesn't even have good wine.

808
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:45,337
How did you...

809
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:52,658
I came here today

810
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:54,858
to thank you.

811
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:57,297
Thanks to you

812
00:33:58,177 --> 00:33:59,417
that I can destroy

813
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:00,177
everyone who is

814
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:01,417
going against me

815
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,098
behind my back.

816
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:08,138
Calm down.

817
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:09,898
Don't be agitated.

818
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:12,057
Sit down first.

819
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:16,218
Do you think you

820
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:20,297
can set me up by yourself?

821
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:24,098
Let me tell you.

822
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:27,057
I'm monitoring

823
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:29,098
what you all have been doing.

824
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:31,938
This is taken by Madam Wang.

825
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:34,098
She said Chen Fei'er is searching
everywhere at home.

826
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:36,297
Since she's keen to find

827
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,418
some evidence,

828
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:39,817
give her the chance.

829
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:50,658
This is the primary data
for the project.

830
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:52,658
Shall we destroy it?

831
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,458
Keeping it here

832
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:55,458
will not make it a flaw to us.

833
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:56,577
No need to destroy it.

834
00:34:57,977 --> 00:34:58,737
At least

835
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:00,698
we can use it to control others.

836
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:12,017
I'm here to deliver the tea.

837
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:29,737
Mingxuan, drink tea.

838
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:30,898
I'm not drinking.

839
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:32,577
My shoulders are tight.

840
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:33,977
Come and massage me.

841
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:40,577
Keep your own things.

842
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,297
The house is too messy.

843
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:43,977
I hope when I come home,

844
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:46,618
it's all cleaned up.

845
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:51,977
Thank you.

846
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,257
Mr. Zhao.

847
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:00,977
She's searching now.

848
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:09,057
Who do you think

849
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:10,898
she will give this to?

850
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,537
I don't mind,

851
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:15,458
but I really hope that

852
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:18,458
she will give it to him.

853
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:23,938
However,

854
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:26,297
you've helped me

855
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:27,458
gather a lot of information.

856
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:31,218
Xiao Shangqi didn't really
fall out with Xiao Xian.

857
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:33,817
It seems like

858
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,297
I was right for not

859
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:37,178
trusting him.

860
00:36:40,138 --> 00:36:41,017
But I didn't lose anything.

861
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:45,218
After all, Xiao Xian has served me

862
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:47,378
like a dog for so long,

863
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,017
right?

864
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:49,977
Zhao Mingxuan,

865
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:51,858
you're despicable.

866
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,537
I'm despicable?

867
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,418
You said I'm despicable?

868
00:36:58,858 --> 00:36:59,698
What about you then?

869
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:02,257
Stop being humble.

870
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:03,817
You've contributed half

871
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:06,497
to this matter.

872
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:13,017
Also,

873
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:16,577
Jifeng has been mortgaged now.

874
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:19,138
But the money they have

875
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:21,178
can't

876
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:22,658
help Yunlan.

877
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:26,938
As for Xian and Qi's future,

878
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,297
I can only

879
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,178
describe them with seven words.

880
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:34,178
Guess what it is.

881
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:44,458
Let me tell you.

882
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:46,497
They can only

883
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:47,898
beg me

884
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,178
for

885
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:50,577
mercy.

886
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,337
They need to

887
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:56,737
listen to me

888
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,577
if they want to survive.

889
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:02,777
As for you,

890
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:06,977
you have

891
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:08,017
no value at all now.

892
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:11,698
Last but not least,

893
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:12,658
let me remind you.

894
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:15,098
Be careful

895
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:16,098
no matter where you go.

896
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:17,297
The world is in a mess.

897
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:18,938
It's hard to tell

898
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:21,497
if you'll have an accident.

899
00:38:56,138 --> 00:38:56,777
We'll have to

900
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:58,178
pay for the compensation.

901
00:38:58,537 --> 00:38:59,458
We only have this much of cash.

902
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:01,138
James,

903
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:01,977
can you check if there's any money

904
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:03,337
we can collect?

905
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:23,537
Here.

906
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:28,098
You drove a few hours here.

907
00:39:28,337 --> 00:39:29,057
You must be tired.

908
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:32,138
Well,

909
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:34,418
I've asked Madam Zhang

910
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:35,537
to tidy up your room.

911
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:43,497
I didn't expect

912
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:45,057
that we failed here.

913
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:48,057
It's my bad.

914
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:49,977
It's okay.

915
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,178
Things have come to this.

916
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:55,017
We shouldn't blame each other.

917
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,458
Let's take a step at a time.

918
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,297
How's the company doing?

919
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:05,337
Stop getting deals from Deju

920
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:07,858
was within my plan,

921
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:10,017
but going bankrupt

922
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:12,057
was not.

923
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:14,777
The compensation amount is huge.

924
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,378
Even if we go for the lawsuit,

925
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:18,898
it may only buy us some time.

926
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:21,138
We can't win for sure.

927
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:23,618
So pathetic.

928
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:26,537
Jifeng still has some money.

929
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:28,378
I know,

930
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:30,698
but I don't want to use it.

931
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:36,218
If Yunlan goes bankrupt,

932
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:37,858
I hope you will still

933
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:38,977
own Jifeng.

934
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:41,618
This might be our

935
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:43,977
only chance to come back.

936
00:40:47,257 --> 00:40:48,898
We're in this now.

937
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:50,458
We might not be able to solve it

938
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,017
even though we give it our all.

939
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,977
So, why do we worry about the future?

940
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:04,977
Mainly because I can't

941
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:06,458
see where our future is.

942
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:08,898
Qi,

943
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:11,178
do you know what?

944
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:13,178
Actually, sometimes,

945
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:14,537
I'm really frustrated.

946
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,257
He caused father's death,

947
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:19,698
ruined our family,

948
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:22,777
and he kept us father and sons,
brothers,

949
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:24,577
in agony for the more than 20 years.

950
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:27,618
Even father's last...

951
00:41:30,537 --> 00:41:31,178
Xian,

952
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:33,458
stay strong.

953
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:35,898
It hasn't come to an end.

954
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:43,098
From tomorrow onwards,

955
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:45,418
simplify Yunlan's

956
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,698
basic structure.

957
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:47,777
Just keep the core team.

958
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:50,497
Reduce all the possible expenses.

959
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:52,537
Tell me when you've counted

960
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,257
the figure for compensation.

961
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:55,737
I'll go back to Jifeng

962
00:41:55,977 --> 00:41:56,577
and get the figure.

963
00:41:57,178 --> 00:41:58,138
I'll also borrow some.

964
00:41:59,017 --> 00:41:59,698
Yes.

965
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:01,057
Let's not talk about this.

966
00:42:01,658 --> 00:42:02,458
Right?

967
00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:04,497
Solve the problem

968
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:07,537
and move on.

969
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:30,817
Thank you.

970
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,938
Do you mean the clue was fake?

971
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,577
Zhao Mingxuan knew

972
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:38,977
that I was looking for his weakness,

973
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,658
so he left it there for me.

974
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,178
Then Xiao Shangqi...

975
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:45,938
Yunlan...

976
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,337
Yunlan is done.

977
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,497
They need to compensate
a huge amount of money.

978
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:51,218
Everyone was exposed.

979
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:52,817
Xiaoran,

980
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:54,017
I was really

981
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:55,337
used by Zhao Mingxuan.

982
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:57,098
I didn't know about this.

983
00:42:57,938 --> 00:42:58,698
But no one is willing

984
00:42:58,817 --> 00:42:59,977
to trust me no matter what I say.

985
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:01,257
No one trusts you

986
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:02,858
so you came to Xiaoran.

987
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,537
I have nowhere to go now.

988
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:08,618
Zhao Mingxuan has found me.

989
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:09,618
I don't know what

990
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:11,458
this madman will do to me.
