Let's say

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,040
you can live until 100 years old,

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,040
half of half your life

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,960
is just until here.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,440
You're now here.

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,200
After turning a short corner,

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,480
you still have a long

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,480
way to go.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,960
You can live however you want.

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,640
You've just lived

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
a little longer than me.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,880
You sound like you're very old.

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,640
I'm leaving now.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,680
Taiyang, good night.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,680
Good night.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,160
Okay,

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
you're tired from playing.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Go to bed now.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,120
Let's go.

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,680
Why did I come here?

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,400
Since I'm here,
I should just take a look.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,720
It's closed?

39
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,410
(Closed)

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,680
Even this place has ended.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,040
What's ended?

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,920
Why are you here?

43
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
I want to open a homestay

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,520
for elderly in Wusu.

45
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,960
It happens that
this homestay is being sold.

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Be careful, it's hot.

47
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,200
Thank you.

48
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,039
Everyone would think

49
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,320
you should

50
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,720
develop your career in Hupu.

51
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,640
The most important thing

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,920
to me is not Yunlan,

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,480
but to find back the person I lost.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
There are many of

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,960
our good memories here.

56
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,840
If we can start

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,760
all over again here,

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,480
it'd be meaningful.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,800
Xiaoran,

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,240
can you give me one more chance?

61
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
It was my fault.

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,680
I shouldn't have let go

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
no matter what happened.

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,000
From now on,

65
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,640
I'll never

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,720
make this kind of mistake anymore.

67
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,680
It's getting late.

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,800
I'm leaving now.

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,000
Xiaoran.

70
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,360
Did you drive here?

71
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,280
Lili's car.

72
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,480
I wanted to send you home.

73
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,040
It's okay. Thank you.

74
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,280
The road is blocked.

75
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,760
You can't drive there.

76
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,000
Hello.

77
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
What's going on there?

78
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,240
A big truck is overheight.

79
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,400
It's stuck in the tunnel.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
It can't move out quick.

81
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
Take another road.

82
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,160
I can only take this road

83
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,320
to enter the city.

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Which other road I can take?

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
Why not you

86
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,360
stay here?

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,880
I think it will take a few more hours.

88
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,280
Thank you.

89
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,160
It's okay.

90
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,740
(Happy Homestay)

91
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
There's everything we need here.

92
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,680
We can put up for a night here.

93
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,520
It's okay.

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,160
I can just sit here for

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,760
a few hours.

96
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,240
Do you have a charger cable in your car?

97
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,320
No.

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,240
Won't you save some battery

99
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,240
for the navigation tomorrow?

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,560
Get me a room then.

101
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
I'll go lie down for a while.

102
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,320
Okay.

103
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,560
I forgot.

104
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,520
It's stopped operating for a while

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
after I bought it.

106
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,160
I'll go get the bed sheet and pillows.

107
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,200
It's okay.

108
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm wearing my clothes.

109
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
I just can lie down.

110
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,160
No need.

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,880
Or

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,320
you want to sleep in the tent?

113
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Men and women shouldn't stay together.

114
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,360
Let's keep a distance.

115
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't worry.

116
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm prepared

117
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,280
for a prolonged battle.

118
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,000
One year.

119
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,960
Ten years.

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,320
A lifetime.

121
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll wait for the day that

122
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,400
you forgive me

123
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,320
and look at me

124
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
again.

125
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,240
Although it's rare to be able
to spend time with you alone,

126
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm not planning

127
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
for you to change your mind today.

128
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,320
You...

129
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
Did anyone say to you that

130
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,120
you've become...

131
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,920
No.

132
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,880
You're the first one

133
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,080
because I only do this to you.

134
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't worry too much.

135
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,840
Just take it as a homestay

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
owned by a friend

137
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,400
and he invited you to stay here
for a night before it starts operating.

138
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,520
Thank you.

139
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,400

The netizens

161

have stopped listening
to Tang Yan's new songs.

I'm not planning to sue them.

I asked them to remove

the songs

167
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
and terminate the contract
without any compensation.

They don't want to cause more trouble

172
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
so they agreed to it.

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,000
I can get back

176
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,120
the copyright of the songs?

177
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,480
Should I sing them

178
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
and release them once again?

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,080
I didn't know it's

180
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,320
a trench.

181
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,720
Now, I know

182
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Tang Yan and Zheng Jie

183
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,200
are wicked.

184
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,880
Why should I go back there?

185
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,280
I don't want to have

186
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,200
anything to do with them anymore

187
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,680
or bring this to the court.

188
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,680
Why not I just

189
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,840
calm down for a while?

190
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,440
It's good.

191
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
Thanks to you and Sui.

192
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,920
If it's not for you two,

193
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
maybe I would've lost all my songs
and money.

194
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,200
What are you talking about?

195
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,000
Hurry.

196
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,360
Handle this for me.

197
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,120
I asked you not to be impulsive
and fight.

198
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,240
Did you fight again?

199
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
Hui can forget about this,

200
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
but

201
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,640
not me.

202
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,040
I need to make them

203
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,080
hurt physically.

204
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Sui Mingwei,

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,080
I realised that you

206
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
are interesting.

207
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,520
You've never improved.

208
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,560
The way you handle things

209
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,920
is always the same.

210
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,360
No,

211
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,720
that's all I got.

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,200
Well,

213
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,600
Xiao Shangqi came back again.

214
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,240
You knew about this?

215
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960
Not only he's everywhere,

216
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,240
he even made a big deal out of it.

217
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,800
This time, he took over

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
a homestay in Linglong Mountain.

219
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,680
The road was blocked last night.

220
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,960
You two...

221
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,160
- Could it be...
- You...

222
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,160
Stop your imagination.

223
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Nothing happened.

224
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,120
Nothing.

225
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm going to work.

226
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,360
Does she mean it?

227
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,480
I think so.

228
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Stop fighting.

229
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,280
Okay.

230
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:53,640
(Yunlan Jifeng)

231
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,020
(Jifeng Homestay preparatory team
temporary office)

232
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,680
Go now.

233
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,640
Mr. Xiao, look at this.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,560
I think this proposal

235
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,400
is not bad.

236
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
The blue colour here

237
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,840
and the orange colour here

238
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,560
have to be adjusted

239
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,440
and changed to white colour.

240
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Change this.

241
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Mr. Xiao, look.

242
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
I've amended the document.

243
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,640
Take a look.

244
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,640
Okay, no problem. Do it.

245
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,440
Okay.

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,480
This side, too.

247
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,320
Change it.

248
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Okay. There's also this proposal.

249
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,320
Isn't this too much of blue?

250
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,400
It has to be blue,

251
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,720
right?

252
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,280
Hello.

253
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,840
It's your call.

254
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,600
Hello.

255
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Okay.

256
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,880
Okay, no problem.

257
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,120
Do it.

258
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay.

259
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,440
Change this

260
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,560
blue colour.

261
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
The in-depth cooperation with
the radio station

262
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,560
has been confirmed.

263
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,200
We can start executing it today.

264
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,120
Thank you.

265
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,200
No problem.

266
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,680
Mr. Xiao,

267
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,000
don't we lack manpower

268
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,800
and start hiring?

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,160
Just now we found out that

270
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,560
the interviewee

271
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,480
was Chen Fei'er.

272
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,640
What's wrong with me?

273
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,160
You can't come here.

274
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,920
I sent in my resume

275
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
through the proper channel.

276
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,040
I passed the first interview
and the written test.

277
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
I can accept it even if I failed.

278
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,840
Why are you making this a fuss?

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
What did the interviewer say?

280
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,000
Once they saw it's Miss Chen,

281
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,360
they didn't proceed.

282
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Since she has come for the interview,

283
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,520
there should be an outcome.

284
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,520
Lin Zong,

285
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,760
you'll make the decision.

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Can you tell me

287
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:43,880
what's

288
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
this about?

289
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,280
I've sent resume to 10 companies,

290
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,240
besides Jifeng,

291
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,160
I've been to another two companies

292
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
for the final interview,

293
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,640
but I prefer this place

294
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
because I want to stand back up

295
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,320
at where Zhao Mingxuan tripped.

296
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,720
Can you let go of Zhao Mingxuan

297
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,720
and give yourself

298
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,080
more opportunities?

299
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,360
I'm using

300
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,640
my past with Zhao Mingxuan

301
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,520
to open up more
opportunities for myself.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,840
You know me.

303
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,080
I've never worked before

304
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,600
so I'm not that competitive.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,960
But, I've been in the hotel industry

306
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,640
for many years now

307
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,120
so I know a lot about hotels.

308
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm also a fast learner.

309
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,520
I'll not be doing worse than others.

310
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,919
That makes sense.

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,240
After the brand department update it,

350
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
they'll also upload it here.

351
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,520
Do you get it now?

352
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,280
I think so.

353
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,800
Well,

354
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,880
I'll get a screen recording application

355
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,280
and record it step by step.

356
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,240
You can look at it and learn

357
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,320
when you're back home.

358
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,120
If you don't know anything
in the first six months

359
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,160
after starting a new job,

360
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,840
it's not embarrassing, just annoying.

361
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,040
But if you still don't know
after half a year,

362
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
it's embarrassing.

363
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,280
Thank you.

364
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

365
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm leaving now.

366
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,720
You should rest early, too.

367
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,760
The invincible Mr. Lin

368
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,800
has this kind of cute

369
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,160
yet embarrassing moment, too.

370
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
This is not embarrassing.

371
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
This is the love badge.

372
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,680
Here, I'll give it to you.

373
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,160
Well,

374
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,400
no need to keep the room

375
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
for me next week.

376
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
I've rented a house.

377
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,640
I'll move out.

378
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,080
Your changes

379
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
are so quick that I can't cope with it.

380
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,480
You're getting older

381
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,640
so you're getting worse at adapting.

382
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,000
You don't say.

383
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,360
Looking at how

384
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,240
you're getting better and better

385
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,520
every day,

386
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,600
I do feel like

387
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,240
I'm an old father.

388
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,840
Don't take advantage of me.

389
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,640
What?

390
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
You said I'm old.

391
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,800
Can't I make fun out of it?

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,960
Where are you moving to?

393
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,040
I'll help you check

394
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,240
the surrounding.

395
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,320
Okay.

396
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,880
Get off work early.

397
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,800
Are you going to work?

398
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,200
I'm going to Jifeng.
It's just along the way.

399
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,120
Let's go together.

400
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
And you got all the way here?

401
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
It pleases me.

402
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you,

403
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,480
but I've been having car sickness.

404
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,360
I'm having car sickness, too.

405
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,080
Let's go together.

406
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
What are you doing?

407
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,640
You know what I'm doing.

408
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The graffiti wall is still here.

409
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,480
Do you remember that

410
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,360
the night you drank...

411
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,120
I don't remember.

412
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
What time are you
getting off work tonight?

413
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,520
I have an interview tonight.

414
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,480
Mr. Xiao,

415
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,480
you came back this time

416
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,200
for your career, right?

417
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,520
Stop looking for me.

418
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,640
I think you're more important
than my career.

419
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,000
Xiaoran.

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,320
It's been cold lately.

421
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,280
There will be rain and snow mixed.

422
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,720
So, the dispatching centre

423
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,840
is monitoring

424
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,560
the electrical grid 24 hours a day

425
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,760
to ensure that

426
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,120
all the works are done safely

427
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,280
in the bad weather.

428
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
Now,

429
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,680
the damaged grid

430
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
is getting back to normal.

431
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,240
Our maintenance staff

432
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
are patrolling around

433
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,320
to make sure no hidden danger

434
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
under all the electrical grid.

435
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay. Thank you for
accepting the interview.

436
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,600
It's okay. Most welcome.

437
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,720
Hello, everyone.

438
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,160
Thank you.

439
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,800
Here, drink some coffee.

440
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,280
Thank you.

441
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,400
Why are you here?

442
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm here to see you.

443
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,640
Miss He,

444
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,920
is he your boyfriend?

445
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,280
It's an honour to us.

446
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,600
I don't have a boyfriend.

447
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,960
Thank you, everyone.

448
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,080
Thank you.

449
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,520
Soon.

450
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,280
Thank you.

451
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,680
Can you stop doing this?

452
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,560
Xiaoran.

453
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,200
Bring the snacks home.

454
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
I don't want.

455
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,040
You don't look at

456
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
the dashboard before you drive?

457
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,760
It doesn't matter.

458
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,120
The light will turn red

459
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
if there's anything.

460
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,920
You can get angry with me,

461
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
but don't treat your safety as a joke!

462
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,200
Stay in my car.

463
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,600
No need.

464
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,280
Must you stay freezing with me?

465
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,560
When you catch a cold,

466
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,960
I'll surely go take care of you.

467
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,000
That's how eager

468
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
you want to be with me?

469
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
Take a seat.

470
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,000
It's fixed.

471
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,600
The tyre got punctured by a nail.

472
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
I've changed the spare tyre.

473
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,920
Thank you.

474
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,000
You're welcome.

475
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Don't you think

476
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,840
it's good to be followed by me?

477
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,400
It's freezing. Go home now.

478
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Let me do it.

479
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
Get in the car.

480
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,520
Be careful.

481
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,800
Tell me when you reach home.

482
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,440
Be careful.

483
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,200
Hello, Mr. Lin.

484
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,560
Xiaoran.

485
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Did Mr. Xiao contact you?

486
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,360
I keep calling him

487
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,360
but I can't reach him.

488
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,760
What's happened to him?

489
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,040
He's sick.

490
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,640
He's having a fever and resting at home.

491
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,680
He's sick?

492
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes. Are you free now?

493
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I want to get Meng to cook something

494
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,920
and send over to him

495
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,360
but I have something on

496
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,640
and I can't go now.

497
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,400
Can you help me

498
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,480
to check on him?

499
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,000
Just get the food delivered to him.

500
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,640
No.

501
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,240
He's besides himself

502
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,400
whenever he's sick.

503
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,280
He's nagging that

504
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,480
he doesn't want to eat the takeout.

505
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,560
It means he's not hungry enough.

506
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,000
When I was visiting him this morning,

507
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,800
he was having a fever
of 39 degree Celsius.

508
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,480
He's really sick.

509
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,560
I asked him to go to the hospital

510
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,440
but he refused.

511
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,880
I'm worried.

512
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,440
You...

513
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,080
(He Xiaoran has agreed)

514
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,040
(to visit you later.)

515
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,000
(Wrong example,
please don't do this at home)

516
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:04,940
(Heating pad)

517
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,440
Coming.

518
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,120
Why is it you?

519
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,760
Why are you so sick?

520
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Enough.

521
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
Do you have fruit juice at home?

522
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm thirsty.

523
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,960
Man,

524
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,240
just go home

525
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,000
if there's nothing else.

526
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,080
Don't worry about me.

527
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,560
Come on.

528
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,680
I've brought the dishes here.

529
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,240
I have to watch you eat it.

530
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,400
What's your body temperature?

531
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,120
Let me see.

532
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
No!

533
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm feeling cold.

534
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,120
This heating pad helps.

535
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,720
My throat is sore.

536
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
I know this well.

537
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
You're feeling cold?

538
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
What's this?

539
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,120
You're pretending to be sick.

540
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,640
Mr. Xiao, I'd never have thought

541
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,000
you'd do this.

542
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,800
Sui.

543
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,400
Help me.

544
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,160
You need my help?

545
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,640
Beg me.

546
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,520
Beg me.

547
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,480
Please.

548
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Please.

549
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,040
Please.

550
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,280
Okay.

551
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,640
You're quite resilient.

552
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,320
You're willing to help me?

553
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
(It seems like
Xiao Shangqi is really sick.)

554
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,320
(His fever has reached
42 degree Celsius.)

555
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,360
(It's very high.)

556
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,720
My big brother.

557
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,080
Why is it so hot?

558
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,160
Get the fruits.

559
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,200
Fruits.

560
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,800
Here, my big brother.

561
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,240
Fruits.

562
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
Cut it smaller.

563
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,680
How can my mouth

564
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,360
stuff in the apple this size?

565
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,960
- Yes. Smaller.
- Go.

566
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,480
I'll cut it smaller.

567
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,640
Cut it smaller.

568
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,000
Here, it's smaller.

569
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
Let me feed you.

570
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,280
No need.

571
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,720
Xiaoran,

572
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
I have something on
in the fragrance factory.

573
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,160
I need to leave.

574
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,560
Why not you come and visit him?

575
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,400
Eat one more piece.

576
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,760
Get me the slippers.

577
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,440
Slippers.

578
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,640
Here.

579
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,720
Here you go.

580
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,320
(Xiaoran,)

581
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,040
(I have something on
in the fragrance factory.)

582
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,920
(I need to leave.)

583
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,160
(Why not you come and visit him?)

584
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,480
The passcode has not changed.

585
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,000
I just came in.

586
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,600
Did you catch the cold
by fixing the car for me?

587
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,800
If I say yes,

588
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,040
will you stay and keep me company?

589
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,080
I came here today

590
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
to tell you this.

591
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,240
I think we should

592
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,640
make it clear.

593
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,920
Do you think

594
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,279
I've loved you for eight years,

595
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:12,719
so it's hard for me

596
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,000
to let go of our relationship

597
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,200
and you just do whatever
you feel like doing

598
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,840
when we were dating?

599
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,360
You started it

600
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
and ended it as you please.

601
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,400
And I'm the one

602
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,000
waiting for you to make the decision.

603
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,799
That's not what I mean.

604
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,000
Indeed we broke up due to
some misunderstanding

605
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,239
and we can't help it.

606
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,080
To be honest,

607
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,759
when I saw you again in Qingshan

608
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
and found out about the truth,

609
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,400
I thought of

610
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,680
getting back together with you,

611
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,480
but I've thought it through.

612
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,160
I can't be with you anymore.

613
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,120
Between us,

614
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,200
be it your father

615
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,320
or Fei'er,

616
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,680
it's no longer the biggest problem.

617
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,040
The biggest problem is that

618
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,280
I don't trust you anymore.

619
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,080
To you,

620
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,560
I'm just someone

621
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,640
who you can give up

622
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,840
when something happened.

623
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,800
I don't want

624
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,360
to be in a relationship
where I'm on the passive side.

625
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,000
Actually, I was reluctant.

626
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,800
I regretted it, too.

627
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,840
But, it's all in the past now.

628
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,160
Now, everyone has

629
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,040
come back to the right track.

630
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
Everything is just fine.

631
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,760
So, I don't want to

632
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,640
go back anymore.

633
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,560
I don't want to go back either.

634
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,360
I want us to move on.

635
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,800
if you continue doing this,

636
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,520
I won't be staying in Wusu.

637
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,240
I'll need to go to other places.

638
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,400
If you're willing,

639
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,440
we can still be friends.

640
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,760
But, we can only be friends.

641
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,760
Don't cross the boundary anymore.

642
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,880
You haven't eaten, right?

643
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,320
I've ordered fried chicken for you.

644
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,640
Forget it.

645
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,960
I'm having a sore throat.

646
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,360
Stop pretending.

647
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,160
Sui has told me everything.

648
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,680
Two buns and one tea egg.

649
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,600
Two sets.

650
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,960
Is the breakfast here so tasty?

651
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm enjoying

652
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,720
your staff discount.

653
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,080
Well,

654
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,320
the detergent that you're using

655
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,600
is finished.

656
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
It smells really good.

657
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,680
It's heavy. I'll bring it home for you.

658
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,360
You should be able to get off work now.

659
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,600
Not bad. You're not late today.

660
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,160
You're here every day to monitor me.

661
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,480
Would I dare be late?

662
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,440
Okay.

663
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,360
It's done.

664
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,320
Okay.

665
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,600
Your fragrance factory is so busy.

666
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,040
You come out here
at this time every day.

667
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,280
You only get home
when I go to work at night.

668
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,680
Are you getting off work?

669
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I'll bring you to a place.

670
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,120
Let me get changed.

671
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,400
Dude,

672
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,600
keep it here for me.

673
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,720
Okay.

674
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
They should be opening soon.

675
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,800
Where are you bringing me to?

676
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,520
Let's go.

677
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
Welcome.

678
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,840
Welcome.

679
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,960
This one.

680
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,120
Get me three sets.

681
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,040
This is our new fragrance.

682
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
It helps you sleep better.

683
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,040
Not bad, Sui.

684
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,120
The box can be used like this?

685
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,040
I didn't know that.

686
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,000
It's interesting.

687
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,520
I'll buy one later.

688
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,560
Here.

689
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,120
Three of us will have one each.

690
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,960
Here.

691
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,910
♪Remember the breath,
foreign yet familiar♪

692
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,880
Hold on.

693
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Doesn't the copyright of the song

694
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,440
belong to Zheng Jie?

695
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,840
Isn't this copyright infringement?

696
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,520
What copyright infringement?

697
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,520
I've bought the copyright back.

But, I only bought one song.

700
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,360
I can't afford the rest.

701
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,360
And I think you're right.

702
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,240
The songs that Tang Yan has sung
are disgusting.

703
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,240
We don't want those songs.

704
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,920
But this song is different.

705
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,440
This song is your first EP.

706
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,480
It's under your name.

707
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,120
It's meaningful.

708
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
So, I think the opportunity

709
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,280
must be held by you.

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,480

Zheng Jie

712
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,920
and paid him.

713
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,000
I beat him up though.

714
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,560
He got it all from me.

715
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,040
Why did you do that?

716
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,240
This song is the trap that
they set for me.

717
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,320
It's inauspicious.

718
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,160
It's still your first EP.

719
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,000
I think it's nice and I like it.

720

722
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,320

love listening to it

732

come to this extend?

733
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,960
Ridiculous.

734
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,560
He bullied you, Hui.

735

But, I need to scold you.

738
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,960
You gave up on music because of him
last time.

739
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,680
Now, you're doing it again for him.

740
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,160
You haven't played the guitar
for a few days, right?

741
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,880
I couldn't play last time.
