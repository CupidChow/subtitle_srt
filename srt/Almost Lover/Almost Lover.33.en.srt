17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,973
But you're sharing the house
with others.

18
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,573
Are you okay to stay alone?

19
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,533
The price is okay.

20
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:45,973
Also,

21
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:47,413
the place that I grew up in

22
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:48,893
is 100 times worse than this.

23
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:52,293
What place is that?

24
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:56,253
A dark and greasy place.

25
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:59,293
It's like the air and the soles
are all sticky.

26
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,733
You can't wash it away

27
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,413
and you can't move out.

28
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:06,893
You've moved out

29
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:07,853
now.

30
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,933
The legs are yours.

31
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:20,973
Since you've moved out,

32
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,373
just go wherever you want to go.

33
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:24,373
Tell the landlord that

34
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:25,493
I'll get someone to change
to a better lock

35
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,653
for your room tomorrow.

36
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:32,653
Let's go.

37
00:02:58,813 --> 00:02:59,853
Aren't we going to eat?

38
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,293
Let's warm up first.

39
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,333
Check out the new amplifier

40
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:06,213
that I bought.

41
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,613
I've brought the guitar here for you.

42
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,493
You're getting me to busking

43
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:13,373
from singing in the bar.

44
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,173
Street performance helps you
to get inspired.

45
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,773
Your songs were ruined.

46
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,373
We have to get them back for you.

47
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:20,453
Continue writing.

48
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:21,893
It will be better than the old songs.

49
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,093
Look at what I've brought here.

50
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,173
I heard that the place
we're going tonight

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,253
is lively.

52
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:33,013
They even have New Year's countdown.

53
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:35,933
My performance is costly.

54
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,493
I have enough money.

55
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:41,253
Let's go.

56
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:43,413
Let's go.

57
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,253
Hello, Mr. Sun.

58
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:58,453
Madam Wang should've

59
00:03:58,653 --> 00:03:59,613
come back from Hupu, right?

60
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:00,693
I've bought some food.

61
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,093
I'll visit you in
the nursing home later.

62
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:03,093
About an hour...

63
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:03,893
Miss He,

64
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:05,613
I was just about to call you.

65
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,853
Why didn't we see you

66
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:07,773
in the gathering?

67
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:08,813
What gathering?

68
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:10,933
Mr. Xiao sent us to Jifeng

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,040
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
to celebrate New Year's Day.

70
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:15,773
Look, it becomes noodles.

71
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:17,772
I can't even teach him.

72
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,092
My son is bad at this.

73
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,293
I'm making Mandarin rolls.

74
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:21,733
You're making Mandarin rolls?

75
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:22,253
Look.

76
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:23,613
Here.

77
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:25,213
Xiaoran.

78
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,133
Miss He.

79
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:27,333
Mr. Sun.

80
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:28,013
Miss He, you're here.

81
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:28,773
Madam Wang.

82
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,293
We're making dough figurine.

83
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,133
Isn't it nice?

84
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:32,293
Yes.

85
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:33,333
Join us.

86
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,933
It's okay.

87
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,093
Xiaoran.

88
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:37,293
Here. Come on.

89
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:38,453
Put your things down.

90
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,853
Yes, there.

91
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,213
This is the highlight of

92
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,013
our gathering,

93
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,333
which is to knead a bun with the face

94
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,413
of the person next to you.

95
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,053
Yes.

96
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:50,933
Yes.

97
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:51,613
Just use his face as reference.

98
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:53,733
Turn around.

99
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,293
Hold on.

100
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:01,653
Don't move. Let me see.

101
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:03,413
What are you kneading?

102
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:04,893
What's this?

103
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:06,053
Bun.

104
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:06,493
Bun?

105
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:07,813
Why does your bun have a tip?

106
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:11,093
Because it looks like the steamed bun.

107
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:30,493
Show me yours.

108
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,053
Mine is not done.

109
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,853
I haven't got the face kneaded.

110
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:34,853
Show me.

111
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:38,813
Do you have to keep looking at me

112
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,013
for kneading that?

113
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:41,813
Isn't that good?

114
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:43,893
Show me yours.

115
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,373
How could you laugh at me?

116
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,173
You're just about the same as me.

117
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:51,653
No wonder you don't look at me.

118
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:55,973
Give it back to me.

119
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:57,773
Two eyes.

120
00:05:58,253 --> 00:05:58,893
The eyebrows are not done.

121
00:05:58,893 --> 00:05:59,573
You only have one eyebrow.

122
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,573
Here are the eyebrows.

123
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:03,013
The buns are here.

124
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,173
It looks great.

125
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,253
Happy New Year to everyone.

126
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,653
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

127
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:10,893
Happy New Year.

128
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:12,053
Bless you.

129
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:12,893
Let me do it first.

130
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:13,613
The child is one year older.

131
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,413
Come on. Hurry.

132
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,053
Who eats first? Baby first.

133
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:18,573
It's tasty.

134
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,213
It's tasty, right?

135
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,293
This looks like you.

136
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:21,093
It's tasty, right?

137
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,093
It's tasty. I made this.

138
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:23,213
We made these ourselves.

139
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:25,413
We're leaving. Thank you.

140
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:26,013
See you.

141
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:26,653
Bye.

142
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,133
Be careful.

143
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:27,613
See you.

144
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:28,453
Bye.

145
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:32,200
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)
Taiyang has to grow taller next year.

146
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,413
Sir, drive carefully.

147
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:33,773
Okay.

148
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:34,333
Bye.

149
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,080
Drive slowly.

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,840
I wanted to go visit them.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
I didn't expect to have come here.

152
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,080
Once Jifeng Homestay is built,

153
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,880
we'll have similar events

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
with the local nursing homes.

155
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,080
That's great.

156
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm going home now.

157
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,720
Don't go.

158
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,760
There'll be New Year's countdown

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,720
later over there.

160
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
We're going.

161
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,600
Join us.

162
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,440
Counting down with your friends

163
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,800
is not too much, right?

164
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,520
Okay.

165
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,120
Father, they're selling toys there.

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
I want to buy one.

167
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,360
What's it?

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
I didn't know that

169
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
they're still selling this.

170

(Time Capsule)

171
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,120
Let's have a deal.

172
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,080
Seven years later

173
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,880
when we're 25 years old,

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,520
we'll come here to
collect the time capsule.

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,080
We must come no matter what happens.

176
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

177
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Triangle stays forever!

178
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,840
- Triangle stays forever!
- Triangle stays forever!

179
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's take a photo together.

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,320
Be careful, Taiyang.

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,880
Let's do it together.

182
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,079
Let's buy one.

183
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,079
This is it.

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,440
Mr. Xiao,

185
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,920
make a wish.

186
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,000
No, thanks.

187
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,080
Take one.

188
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
From my experience,

189
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,040
the wishes you make

190
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
will always come true.

191
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
At least half of them.

192
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
Write yours.

193
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,440
Mr. Xiao, make a wish then.

194
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,280
No need.

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
My wish

196
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,160
is now next to me.

197
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
We...

198
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,920
Bye.

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,560
Happy New Year.

200
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,200
Happy New Year.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Mr. Mo,

202
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
I want this little ball, too.

203
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,040
This is buried for making wishes.

204
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
What wishes do you have

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
as a kid?

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
I will give one to you,

207
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:30,920
okay?

208
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
Is that okay?

209
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,120
Here.

210
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,240
Here's the pen.

211
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,640
Madam Fei'er,

212
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,680
how do I write "have"?

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
What do you want to write?

214
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,360
Let me help you, okay?

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,920
I want father to have happiness.

216
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,760
A raise?

217
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,440
Work harder for a raise.

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,480
Sure.

219
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,280
Since your father has you,

220
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,520
he's had happiness.

221
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,400
It's different.

222
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,840
It's the kind of happiness

223
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
that my classmates' parents
have when being together.

224
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,400
Madam Fei'er,

225
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,600
I think you and my father

226
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
look like that when you're together.

227
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,320
What are you talking about?

228
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,560
Do you write it horizontally
or vertically?

229
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,160
All my friends who are here

230
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,800
for the countdown,

231
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,120
a brand new year

232
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,080
will be here

233
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
in another minute.

234
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Let's seal the good, the bad,

235
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,400
the gratitude and

236
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,000
the regret of the past year.

237
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,280
Let's count down together

238
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,800
and open a new chapter.

239

The lighting makes

257
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,840
the stage look huge, right?

258
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,320
It depends on how creative you are.

259
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,880
Let me tell you.

260
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,840
Those who stop by and listen to

you singing on the street

262
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,480
are definitely

263
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
impressed by your talents.

264
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,360
I know you.

You are

very emotional.

267
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,600
If your relationship and career

268
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
are stained,

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
you'll be depressed for a while.

270
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,040
It's okay.

271
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,840
Just space out.

272
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Even though

273
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,800
I can't get you

274
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,440
a big stage,

275
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,240
I can be with you

276
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,960
and have fun

277
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,920
on the streets.

278
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,640
Take it as looking for

279
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,600
the first intention of getting on stage

280
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
and producing music.

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Sui, thank you.

282
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,400
No worries.

283
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,560
What's the next song?

284
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
I think I have

285
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,400
the talent for percussion.

286
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,760
I'll stop singing. Let's go home.

287
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,840

Am I handsome?

295
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,560
Yes.

296
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,040
You look high-spirited like

297
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
how your father was.

298
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,280
When you join your classmates

299
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240

300
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,680
you must be

the most handsome boy.

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,240
Okay.

306
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,560
Sure.

307
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
She said you can open it

308
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,240

I love Madam Fei'er.

00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,440
Do you like it that much?

315
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,320
Then I'll need to

316
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
learn from Madam Fei'er

317
00:14:59,640 --> 00:14:59,960
on how to

318
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,120
make beautiful sweets.

319
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,360
I'll make them for you.

320
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,160
Only girls will make

321
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
beautiful things.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,640
Will you learn?

Xiaoyu's mother

324
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200

Mengmeng's mother

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,840
made animal buns.

If I can't make it beautiful,

328
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll learn a few more times.

329
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
This is for Xiaoyu.

330

The tree that you're painting

335

the old tree in Qingshan.

337

Your mother is an art teacher.

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Who says that when one's mother
is an art teacher,

339
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
the daughter has to be a good painter?

we'll be their

348

first batch of customers.

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,520
We can also hold events here.

352
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,880
It's a good deal.

353
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,520
I should help out.

354
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,720
You just called him Qi.

355
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,680
What's wrong with that?

356
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,280
It's strange to call him

357
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,640
Mr. Xiao.

358
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,200
I see

359
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
him as my own

360
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,600
child.

361
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,560
I think he hasn't stayed

362
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,160
with so many elderly people

363
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,040
since he's young.

364
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,360
He's got the feeling of it now.

365
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,680
The color is wrong, miss.

366
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,000
Look.

367
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:50,880
It's okay.

368
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,960
The tree leave is red now.

369
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,360
I'll paint it round

370
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,320
as an apple tree.

371
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,240
What...

372
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,240
Xiaoran,

373
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,760
do you treat this place
as a kindergarten?

374
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,520
But your painting skill

375
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,320
is still as terrible

376
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,159
as before.

377
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,160
So, all my paintings

378
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
were amended by you?

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,080
What do you think?

380
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,640
Why did you ask

381
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320
Mr. Sun to get me here?

382
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,240
Are you trying to embarrass me?

383
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,360
Of course not.

384
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,560
Without your draft,

385
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm not able to paint it.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
That's right.

387
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,640
One of you paints it

388
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,960
and the other amends it.

389
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,720
That's how life is.

390
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,640
Helping each other
and clearing each other's mess.

391
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,160
Life will definitely

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
become better.

393
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,200
Hello.

394
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm now at Mountain Linglong.

395
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,840
Really?

396
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay, let me ask.

397
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,080
I'll get back to you later.

398
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
Li Hui has signed with
a new record label.

399
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,000
She asked me to be there.

400
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Go ahead.

401
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,040
Leave the rest to me.

402
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,520
Okay.

403
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
Is my painting

404
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,560
that horrible?

405
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
Of course not.

406
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,160
Don't worry.

407
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
I won't let this place

408
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,480
become a kindergarten.

409
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,600
Mr. Sun, I'm leaving now.

410
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:05,840
Okay.

411
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,280
Bye.

412
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,920
She has left.

413
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,000
You're quite generous.

414
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,240
I've had enough of the paint smell

415
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,160
for the whole morning

416
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,280
to create the chance for you.

417
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Actually, I understand.

418
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
She wants to be careful

419
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,840
and not experience another failure.

420
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,480
It was all my fault.

421
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,520
I didn't make her feel safe enough.

422
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll wait patiently this time.

423
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,240
You're young.

424
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
This is nothing.

425
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,760
You can still stand up

426
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,200
after failing 10 times.

427
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,880
Also, will you fail her?

428
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,720
Of course not.

429
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
That's it.

430
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,480
Paint now.

431
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,240
I need to go back at night.

432
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Here's your drink.

433
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
I was waiting for you to come back.

434
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
I didn't expect this.

435
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
I don't think I can hire you anymore.

436
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,920
Don't worry, Hao.

437
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,080
This is my home.

438
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,400
I'll come often.

439
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,760
You don't know.

440
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,280
You can't help it one day.

441
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,120
The liquor is here.

442
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,040
- Here.
- Congratulations

443
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,200
on your signing with a new company.

444
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,480
Thank you.

445
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,120
Someone seems

446
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
calm this time.

447
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
Star Entertainment is a famous

448
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,960
record label.

449
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,240
Of course I know.

450
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Also, someone can't be

451
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,640
cheated once again, right?

452
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,080
No way.

453
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,680
Speaking of which,

454
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,280
although it's a big company,

455
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,520
this contract

456
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
is a bit close to the previous

457
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,520
scam.

458
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,400
Are you not worried?

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,440
I'm not going to back down

460
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
just because I was cheated once.

461
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,320
Am I that kind of person?

462
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,560
So what if I got cheated?

463
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,360
I'm not afraid.

464
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,560
Someone seems to

465
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,480
have no progress

466
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,000
after coming back

467
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,800
from the homestay.

468
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,240
We're here to celebrate you
signing with a new company.

469
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,880
Why are you talking about me?

470
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,800
Yes, the gathering today
is about our career.

471
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm showing concern.

472
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Here.

473
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,560
Let's celebrate that Hui

474
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,840
has become a professional singer

475
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
and she'll become famous.

476
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,680
No way.

477
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,520
I just want to

478
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,320
make my music.

479
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,120
No, we're waiting for Hui

480
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,040
to make us proud.

481
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
I like this saying.

482
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,880
We all will be glorified together.

483
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,120
Enough.

484
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,720
Don't talk
if you're not good at talking.

485
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,400
He can't say

486
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,280
anything good.

487
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
Just be famous yourself.

488
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,440
Don't drag me along.

489
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,520
I'm just being kind.

490
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:57,267
(Jifeng Elderly Homestay)

491
00:22:58,934 --> 00:22:59,294
Welcome to

492
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:00,174
Jifeng Elderly Homestay.

493
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:01,214
This way, please.

494
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:04,334
Don't worry.

495
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:06,174
This is definitely the safest.

496
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,494
Even the elderly and
the kids can use this.

497
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:09,294
Also, it helps you sleep well.

498
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:10,694
When are you going to bed at night,

499
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:12,014
squeeze it out like this and

500
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:13,694
drop five drops on it.

501
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:15,414
Five drops. Great.

502
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:18,054
Come and try, madam.

503
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:20,254
Different colors come with
different flavors.

504
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,254
I'll be going there.

505
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:29,014
Okay.

506
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:30,814
After my father passed away,

507
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,294
I was moved.

508
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:34,934
Now, there are a lot of

509
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:37,294
homestays and hotels for family.

510
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:39,014
But basically, there's no

511
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,254
holiday resort servicing

512
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:41,254
the elderly.

513
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:43,494
I think companion

514
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,414
is important to them,

515
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:48,534
so I founded this

516
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:49,574
elderly homestay.

517
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:50,934
I also hope that we all can

518
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:52,454
spend more time

519
00:23:52,694 --> 00:23:53,814
to be with our parents,

520
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,614
show them concern,

521
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:56,014
and let them have someone to rely on.

522
00:23:57,974 --> 00:23:58,454
Okay, Mr. Xiao.

523
00:23:58,974 --> 00:23:59,694
That's all for today.

524
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:00,534
We have enough materials now.

525
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:01,534
Thank you.

526
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,134
Elderly homestay.

527
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:04,934
This creativity is not bad.

528
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:05,894
I'll bring my parents

529
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:06,534
here for a holiday.

530
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:08,414
Okay, come at anytime.

531
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,214
Here.

532
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:11,294
Let's go together?

533
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:12,334
Go first.

534
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:14,934
Mr. Xiao, I'm leaving now.

535
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:15,694
Carry on. See you.

536
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:16,254
Take care.

537
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:20,054
How was it, Miss He?

538
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,654
Are you satisfied with
today's interview?

539
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:25,934
You're collaborating with

540
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:26,894
Xixi Fragrance's KOL

541
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:28,694
and you got Li Hui here as the guest.

542
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,294
It shows that
you're doing it attentively.

543
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,414
As the first

544
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:33,694
elderly homestay in Wusu,

545
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:35,534
I really hope that the elderly

546
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:36,574
can feel like

547
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:37,934
coming home.

548
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:38,734
Of course.

549
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:41,094
You can come anytime

550
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:42,654
to interview and monitor us.

551
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:55,094
These two birds...

552
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:56,974
This is the painting
you painted before,

553
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,014
European robin.

554
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:00,534
You know that?

555
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,254
It's scientifically proven

556
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:04,854
that in the animal world,

557
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:07,134
European robin is one of the few birds

558
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:08,014
that's faithful

559
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:08,934
to its only partner.

560
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,254
They represent hope and love.

561
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,214
It's my fault.

562
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,134
I wish I got to know this earlier.

563
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:16,094
But when we were in school...

564
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:16,814
Do you know this?

565
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,094
When the European robin

566
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:20,374
tells you it's spring,

567
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:21,774
spring has already passed.

568
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:25,774
Let's take a look at

569
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:26,414
what they're doing there.

570
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:30,094
Who said it's passed?

571
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:39,894
A little lesser.

572
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:43,054
Father.

573
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:44,974
The fish here is beautiful.

574
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,374
Let me tell you.

575
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,094
This is called koi.

576
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,094
It will bring you good luck.

577
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:51,494
When you see it next time,

578
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:52,294
you can make a wish.

579
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:54,894
Don't give him the wrong information.

580
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:56,254
You're so unreliable.

581
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,974
How can you put your hope

582
00:25:58,174 --> 00:25:59,054
on the fish?

583
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:00,854
How can you say that?

584
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:02,614
Look at the auspicious pictures.

585
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:05,094
Abundance Year After Year,
Babies Carrying Koi,

586
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:05,734
and Five Koi Fishes in the Lotus Pond.

587
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:06,934
Those are all with koi.

588
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:08,214
This is our aspiration

589
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:09,254
towards a good life.

590
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:13,934
I'll set them free.

591
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,894
Go now.

592
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:26,254
Bye.

593
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:28,214
Father.

594
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:29,454
It's okay.

595
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:30,014
Are you okay?

596
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:30,814
Father.

597
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,494
It's okay.

598
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:34,294
Don't let others see this.

599
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:36,374
I almost became a koi.

600
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:39,734
Yes, this koi is quite big.

601
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:41,214
Taiyang, let's make a wish.

602
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:46,494
I wish father and Madam Fei'er

603
00:26:46,694 --> 00:26:48,374
will bring me to the amusement park.

604
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:53,534
Taiyang,

605
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,694
what wish is this?

606
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:56,494
Don't you have any wish

607
00:26:56,654 --> 00:26:57,414
that's harder to achieve?

608
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,654
This kid is practical.

609
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:01,494
He's like his father.

610
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,374
Will you

611
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:07,854
turn him down?

612
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:09,134
Of course not.

613
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,254
Taiyang, I promise that

614
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:13,174
I'll go with you.

615
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,294
Let me get you a towel.

616
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:20,694
Be careful.

617
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:24,574
Father,

618
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:26,054
you almost fell

619
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:27,534
into the river.

620
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,654
It's okay. It's an accident.

621
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:32,094
I've achieved what I wanted.

622
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:33,334
The process is not important.

623
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:46,574
Hui,

624
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,734
it's so happening inside.

625
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,054
Why are you leaving without
saying goodbye?

626
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,094
I'm about to get late for work tonight.

627
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:53,934
I have two livestreaming and

628
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:55,094
a magazine shoot.

629
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:57,934
What does it have to do with singing?

630
00:27:58,934 --> 00:27:59,894
Why do I think you have

631
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:00,934
less time to

632
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:01,574
work on music

633
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:02,734
after being a singer?

634
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:05,574
Don't you think it's not motivating?

635
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:10,814
Am I that pretentious?

636
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:15,654
I need to work. Talk to you another day.

637
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:16,374
Li Hui,

638
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,214
I think you're not happy.

639
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:27,494
I regret it.

640
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:43,374
Thank you.

641
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:44,094
Hui,

642
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:45,854
don't come to this kind

643
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:47,214
of event anymore.

644
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:49,254
Don't do it for free.

645
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:50,934
If they're sincere,

646
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:51,654
get them to

647
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,814
pay you.

648
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,214
You must know that

649
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:54,814
every second of yours

650
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:56,294
is valuable.

651
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,094
Jifeng is charitable.

652
00:28:58,254 --> 00:28:59,374
It's an elderly homestay.

653
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:00,894
Charitable?

654
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:03,254
Did you take photos?

655
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:04,374
Quickly post them on Weibo.

656
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,414
Just say that you're here for charity.

657
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,574
You asked us not to come with you.

658
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:10,214
Otherwise, I'll get them

659
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,534
to take more photos of you

660
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:12,734
to publicize

661
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:13,614
your good reputation.

662
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:15,694
They're my friends.

663
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:16,454
We're not trying to

664
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,054
use each other for benefits.

665
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:20,654
You're too naive.

666
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,374
But, the rest will post

667
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:24,414
some photos.

668
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:25,974
We'll then

669
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:26,974
use them.

670
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:28,254
It's going to be real.

671
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:32,414
Speaking of Weibo,

672
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,054
delete

673
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:36,614
your previous posts.

674
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,334
Now, we get haters easily

675
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:39,734
on the Internet.

676
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,294
From now on, your account

677
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:42,534
will be handled by the company.

678
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,374
You can't simply post anything.

679
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:53,654
Hello, Mr. Wang.

680
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,014
How are you?

681
00:29:56,134 --> 00:29:57,574
You want to collaborate with Li Hui?

682
00:29:57,934 --> 00:29:59,214
No problem.

683
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:01,694
Sure, tell me the details.

684
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:07,774
(You're just falling out of love.)

685
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:09,894
(Just cry and make a fuss.)

686
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:11,054
(This matter won't be over
if you hold it in.)

687
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:13,454
(Although you're not
playing the guitar anymore,)

688
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:15,694
(you can sing well.)

689
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:17,894
(But if one day,)

690
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:18,934
(you think of)

691
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,454
(picking up guitar)

692
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:21,094
(again,)

693
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:22,254
(and I'm not by your side,)

694
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:23,254
(look at this.)

695
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:24,534
(Maybe it'd help.)

696
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:32,974
Are you venting your anger on me?

697
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:34,174
Did I

698
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:34,894
show you too much favor?

699
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:36,454
Did I spoil you too much?

700
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:37,054
Hui,

701
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:38,814
you'll be famous for sure.

702
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:40,734
You're different from others

703
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:42,334
because you're glowing.

704
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,294
Why are you here?

705
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:58,414
(What does this have to do
with singing?)

706
00:30:59,214 --> 00:30:59,774
(Why do I think you have)

707
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:00,934
(less time to)

708
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:01,694
(work on music)

709
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:02,854
(after being a singer?)

710
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,720
(Jifeng Elderly Homestay)

711
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:26,315
You're not going back?

712
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:31,995
I'll be staying here for a few days.

713
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:33,715
We've just started the operation.

714
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,915
We can handle some issues immediately.

715
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,315
Why are you still here? Where's Taiyang?

716
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:40,715
I've asked Mo and Fei'er

717
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,075
to bring him home.

718
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:43,995
I'm worried about the operation here.

719
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:47,995
You'll need to handle

720
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:48,835
the hotel.

721
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:51,635
I'll shift my focus here.

722
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:53,715
Are you so confident in me?

723
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,515
You do look like

724
00:31:58,715 --> 00:31:59,995
you're back in the paddy field.

725
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:06,675
Don't you think

726
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:07,755
the serenity after the lively event

727
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:09,355
makes you

728
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:10,315
feel lonely?

729
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:15,315
I think someone

730
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,675
can't handle the loneliness.

731
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:21,395
Is that so obvious?

732
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,075
What do you plan to do?

733
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:33,315
She looks tough,

734
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,035
but she is lack of

735
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:36,755
something to be moved easily.

736
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:39,355
I think girls

737
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:40,395
used to have

738
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,315
the fantasy and wishes.

739
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:45,915
I want to find a romantic

740
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:46,795
and fantastic place

741
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:47,915
to fill up the sweet memory

742
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:50,115
that she's been lacking of

743
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,035
since young.

744
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:55,515
What do you think about
the amusement park?

745
00:32:57,715 --> 00:32:58,435
Good luck.

746
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:14,835
Hui.

747
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:16,075
Smile more

748
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:16,795
and it's perfect.

749
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:20,595
Not bad.

750
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:22,755
Okay, that's it for today.

751
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:32,835
Hui.

752
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:34,995
I think you're suitable

753
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:36,275
to be cute.

754
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:38,675
Your style was too neutral.

755
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:40,075
I still think it's too common.

756
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:41,155
This style

757
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,755
is rare in the market.

758
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,595
I need to get them to fix it.

759
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:48,435
Why not we use this

760
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,315
Rock and Roll Loli style
as the publicity photos

761
00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:51,275
to test the market?

762
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:54,675
Do you really think it looks nice?

763
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:56,955
I dressed up like a feather duster.

764
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,195
We're doing well now,

765
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:01,515
but the audiences
will get tired of this.

766
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:02,435
We need to keep giving them

767
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:03,875
new stimulation

768
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,355
in terms of audio and visual.

769
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:07,275
Hui,

770
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:08,515
think about it.

771
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,875
You're not alone now.

772
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,715
The whole company and the whole team

773
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:12,995
are moving forward

774
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:13,755
together with you.

775
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,195
Just cooperate with us,

776
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:16,915
okay?

777
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:24,475
Hello.

778
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:28,235
(Let's eat together.)

779
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:29,755
(It's not fun eating alone.)

780
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:30,835
Yes, pull over here.

781
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:31,995
Wait for me.

782
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:32,995
I'll come down and pick you up.

783
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:35,395
Hui,

784
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:36,875
let's eat supper together.

785
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,235
The song that you wrote

786
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:41,235
is not impressive.

787
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:43,074
I've called a composer friend.

788
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:44,035
He will be here soon.

789
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:46,715
I'll go down and pick him up. Hold on.

790
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,634
(I need to work. Maybe next time.)

791
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:55,154
(Okay.)

792
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,835
The new singer that you signed,

793
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:10,635
Li Hui,

794
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:12,275
is really famous lately,

795
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,075
but she has so many works

796
00:35:14,315 --> 00:35:15,555
to do.

797
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:16,875
What can we do?

798
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,195
The audiences

799
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:19,475
change very fast.

800
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:21,435
How long can an artist
like her stay famous?

801
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:22,595
So, we still

802
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:23,675
need your help.

803
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:26,035
Where did you find

804
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:26,995
the treasure?

805
00:35:28,235 --> 00:35:29,915
I'm lucky. She

806
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:31,755
came to me by herself.

807
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:35,035
What do you mean by

808
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:35,955
I came to you by myself?

809
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:38,675
Hui,

810
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:39,555
it's good that you're here.

811
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:40,555
Let me introduce.

812
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:41,715
This is the...

813
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:42,795
I was asking you.

814
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:43,715
What do you mean by

815
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:44,875
I came to you by myself?

816
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:48,595
You didn't know about this?

817
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,315
You have a friend called Sui Mingwei,

818
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:51,875
right?

819
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:53,675
What does this have to do with him?

820
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:56,875
Listen to this

821
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:57,315
demo.

822
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:58,835
My friend, Li Hui, wrote this.

823
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,475
(Aili Record Label)
She's talented. Listen to it.

824
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:01,715
Li Hui?

825
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:02,195
Yes.

826
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:03,515
I'll listen to it.

827
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,555
Thank you.

828
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:08,755
Drink more.

829
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:10,835
Bottoms up.

830
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:11,915
You must

831
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:12,555
give my friend a chance.

832
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,995
She can really sing well.

833
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:15,395
Okay.

834
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,155
Please help me

835
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:17,715
to pass this.

836
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:18,275
Okay.

837
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:19,035
Don't forget.

838
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:20,475
Thank you.

839
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:23,675
Don't throw it away.

840
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:50,955
So, he begged you

841
00:36:51,195 --> 00:36:53,075
to come listen to my live performance?

842
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:54,475
Yes.

843
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:56,275
He has looked for

844
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:57,435
all the famous record labels

845
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:58,195
in Wusu

846
00:36:58,435 --> 00:36:59,715
and showed them your demo.

847
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:01,715
But, I'm wise.

848
00:37:02,475 --> 00:37:03,075
You don't know

849
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:04,595
how many of them

850
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:05,995
regret it so much now.

851
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:09,955
Sir, are you alone?

852
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:11,035
The girl next to you is asking

853
00:37:11,115 --> 00:37:11,995
if she can join you.

854
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:13,995
No, I like eating alone.

855
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:16,235
Hello, welcome.

856
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:16,835
Are you alone?

857
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:19,235
I'll sit with him.

858
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:25,995
Why are you here?

859
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:27,555
Is there anything

860
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:28,195
more important than eating

861
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:29,195
with my old friend?

862
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:32,275
What?

863
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,475
Mr. Sui is buying a meal today?

864
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,395
That's for sure.

865
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,995
Order anything you want.

866
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:41,795
Where is He Xiaoran?

867
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:44,355
She's just as busy

868
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:45,875
as you.

869
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:48,235
Excuse me,

870
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:49,635
we need the menu.

871
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:51,435
What do you feel like eating?

872
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,075
Order anything you want.

873
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:54,155
The most expensive one.

874
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:56,995
Sure.

875
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,555
Eat this first. I haven't touched it.

876
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:01,875
Dog.

877
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:02,595
Be careful.

878
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:03,715
Where's the dog?

879
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:05,155
Be careful, Taiyang.

880
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:06,275
Slow down.

881
00:38:06,475 --> 00:38:07,155
Dog.

882
00:38:07,195 --> 00:38:08,355
Let me take a photo for you, okay?

883
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:09,635
Dog.

884
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:10,835
Do you want to take a photo with it?

885
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:11,715
Yes.

886
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:12,315
Slow down.

887
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:13,635
Dog, let's take a photo.

888
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:13,955
Okay.

889
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:14,555
Dog, let's take a photo.

890
00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:17,315
Look at the camera.

891
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,515
One, two, three.

892
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:21,595
So handsome.

893
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:22,435
So handsome.

894
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:23,675
Change your pose.

895
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:24,875
Be happy, Taiyang.

896
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:25,755
You're blocking your face.

897
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:27,315
Okay.

898
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:29,795
Carousel.

899
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,115
Taiyang.

900
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:57,595
Well, Fei'er, I...

901
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:58,515
So pathetic.

902
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:00,315
What's so pathetic?

903
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:02,555
Why would someone think

904
00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:04,155
amusement park and carousel

905
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:04,995
are romantic?

906
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:08,435
Is carousel not romantic?

907
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:11,355
Those sitting on it

908
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:13,075
are spinning on the same spot forever.

909
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:15,275
The circle is pathetic.

910
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:17,835
And the Ferris wheel.

911
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:19,715
Kissing at the top

912
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,115
and they'll be together forever?

913
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:23,595
It's just a few seconds up there

914
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,715
and their relationship will start
going down.

915
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,235
There's no forever to speak of.

916
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:35,995
And the characters.

917
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:37,875
It looks like they

918
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:39,235
are giving fun and happiness

919
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:40,235
to others,

920
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:43,115
but actually they are just working
in the costume

921
00:39:43,835 --> 00:39:44,795
and living in the darkness

922
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:46,075
inside.

923
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:47,075
So pathetic.

924
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:50,595
Why do all the nice things

925
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:51,555
in the amusement park

926
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:53,035
sound like

927
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:54,515
a dark fairy tale to you?

928
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:56,715
Don't girls have

929
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:57,955
a princess dream?

930
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:01,475
To be honest,

931
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:02,915
although I've become
the Princess of Yunduan

932
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:03,875
for a few years,

933
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,395
I hate the word "princess"

934
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:07,675
the most.

935
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:09,755
There's no fairy tale

936
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:12,075
in the world.

937
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:25,635
Taiyang.

938
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:30,955
Snow White and the seven dwarfs

939
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,315
will be there in the castle later.

940
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:33,315
Do you want to go?

941
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:34,355
Okay.

942
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,115
Madam Fei'er,

943
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:36,875
do you like Snow White?

944
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:38,195
Of course.

945
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,155
Snow White is beautiful.

946
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:40,995
Madam Fei'er,

947
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:42,115
you're as beautiful

948
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:43,275
as Snow White.

949
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:44,835
Thank you, Taiyang.

950
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:46,475
I love

951
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:47,195
Snow White the most.

952
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:47,675
Okay.

953
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:48,435
Madam Fei'er,

954
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:49,835
let's go together.

955
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:50,315
Let's go.

956
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:52,995
Well,

957
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:54,115
what were you trying to ask me?

958
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:56,315
Nothing.

959
00:40:57,395 --> 00:40:58,395
Let's go.

960
00:40:58,675 --> 00:40:59,635
We need a good spot.

961
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:00,195
Let's go.

962
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:00,595
Okay.

963
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:02,235
Let's go.

964
00:41:08,555 --> 00:41:08,915
Let's go.

965
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,035
It's been a while
since I last ate so much.

966
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:13,595
You don't have to keep fit

967
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:14,875
as requested by the company?

968
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:16,155
I'm not fat.

969
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:17,955
You must be Li Hui.

970
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:19,515
I really like you.

971
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:22,035
Can I have your autograph?

972
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:24,235
Just write "Rock and Roll Forever".

973
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:27,995
You like rock and roll, too?

974
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,035
Yes.

975
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:30,915
I like rock and roll because of you.

976
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:32,635
You're beautiful.

977
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:34,835
You look cool when you sing.

978
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:36,115
Thank you.

979
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:37,355
She's a star.

980
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,115
Yes, a singer.

981
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:41,395
Can we take a photo together?

982
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:47,915
Why is there firework?

983
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:03,915
No, I can't run anymore.

984
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:17,555
Sui.

985
00:42:19,315 --> 00:42:21,075
If I'm not famous anymore one day,

986
00:42:21,995 --> 00:42:23,515
will you be disappointed?

987
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:25,755
What do you mean?

988
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,195
I thought after signing the contract,

989
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:30,995
I can be more famous

990
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:31,835
and more people

991
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:33,075
will listen to my songs.

992
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:35,235
But in fact,

993
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:37,155
I have endless

994
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:38,955
social events and activities.

995
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:40,395
Writing songs is like

996
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:41,395
my KPI.

997
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:42,515
They're just using my

998
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:43,275
popularity

999
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:45,195
to create wealth for themselves.

1000
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:46,355
They have no time for me

1001
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:48,155
to write songs.

1002
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,115
How long have we

1003
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:51,315
not eaten together?

1004
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:53,795
I suddenly realized today that

1005
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:55,835
being casual

1006
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,035
is better than being an artist.

1007
00:42:57,715 --> 00:42:58,515
What do you mean?

1008
00:43:01,555 --> 00:43:03,475
Ever since you signed the contract,

1009
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:04,355
you'd pull a long face

1010
00:43:04,635 --> 00:43:05,515
every time we meet.

1011
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:07,355
You looked really depressed.

1012
00:43:08,155 --> 00:43:09,555
I think

1013
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:10,715
it's more important to me

1014
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,155
that you're happy

1015
00:43:12,395 --> 00:43:12,875
instead of

1016
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:13,955
being famous.
