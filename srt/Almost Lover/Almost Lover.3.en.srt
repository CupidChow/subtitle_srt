How generous.

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,740
Renovate the hotel

23
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,980
for an open tendering.

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,060
Executive suite?

25
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,140
We don't stay in a standard room?

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,460
It's been upgraded free for you.

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,420
Your treatment is kind of high profile.

28
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,100
We don't need an upgrade.

29
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,820
Then...

30
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,380
I may need to

31
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,500
ask for Mr. Xiao's advice.

32
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,020
Let me make a call.

33
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,220
What's it?

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,180
We don't need an upgrade.

35
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,460
Staying closer with colleagues

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,020
in the preparatory team

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,100
makes our work easier.

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,740
It's not far away.

39
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,740
(What do you want to do now?)

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,100
(Can we work in an official way?)

41
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,420
Sure.

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,900
Listen to the customer.

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,820
Okay.

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,940
Mr. Xiao said

45
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,780
you may change your room

46
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,060
if you change your mind.

47
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,620
What does it mean?

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,540
Here's the thing.

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,380
Our hotel

50
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,740
has a few inferior rooms.

51
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
They all are located at
the end of corridors.

52
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,300
It's near the equipment room.

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,260
The room is rather small.

54
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,380
Noise is particularly loud.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,260
You've booked all

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,180
the standard rooms.

57
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,260
Considering customers' experience,

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,060
Mr. Xiao upgraded

59
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,020
the few rooms

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,500
into suites.

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,420
So,

62
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,780
not only our room has been upgraded?

63
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,380
The rooms of five other
customers as well.

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,700
You should've said it earlier.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,460
Your TV

66
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,380
can be connected to
the Internet, right?

67
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,460
Yes.

68
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,540
Can I connect it

69
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,220
to a Bluetooth speaker?

70
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,260
No problem.

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,620
Such a big room.

72
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,940
It's so luxurious.

73
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,980
There's even a pool.

74
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,820
I can watch Tang Yan's livestreaming

75
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,260
at ease later.

76
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,620
These drinks

77
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,460
and these snacks

78
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,980
are what you'd usually buy

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,820
and eat.

80
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,100
Did he do this

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,140
to kiss the hand that smote it?

82
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,540
He takes pleasure in plotting
against others.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,020
Please.

84
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,780
Please get inside.

85
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,820
He Xiaoran.

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,700
Hurry and set up the chairs.

87
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:04,980
He Xiaoran.

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,860
Hurry up!

89
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,660
And this side.

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,620
So you're

91
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,060
Miss He of Dajiabang.

92
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
You're so sweet.

93
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,940
No.

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,820
We like your program.

95
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,540
- Yes.
- It's nice.

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,380
So idle

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,380
and so happy.

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,860
No customer goes to her.

99
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,660
Indeed.

100
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,420
I like you.

101
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,060
So lovable.

102
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,980
Yes.

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,420
You're back.

104
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,380
How was the conversation?

105
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,220
There're quite many

106
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,020
regular audiences of Dajiabang.

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,620
I'm a little inspired.

108
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,700
Do you play it so loud?

109
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,260
I don't feel it when the volume is low.

110
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,900
I'll bring you

111
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,900
to his live house by chance.

112
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,380
It's more exciting than this one.

113
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,100
He's carrying the guitar

114
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,060
that was given by you?

115
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,140
The one valued over 30,000 yuan?

116
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,340
Even my name is carved on it.

117
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,540
It's so cool!

118
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,300
Tang Yan! So cool!

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,540
I'll buy you another one!

120
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,860
Viva La Rock!

121
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,580
No way. I need to rest.

122
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,380
He's so crazy.

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,900
How could he break it?

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,740
Listen.

125
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,180
I knew Tang Yan
since I was 18 years old.

126
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,180
That's my first visit to a pub.

127
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,140
At the end of that day,

128
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,860
I confessed my love to him.

129
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,020
He

130
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,980
has countless weaknesses,

131
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,900
but you mustn't let him get on stage.

132
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,140
Don't let him touch a guitar.

133
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,500
As soon as his fingers

134
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,820
touch the string,

135
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,940
he'll give others

136
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,940
goose bumps.

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,300
What else should I request from him?

138
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,740
I just won't bother anything

139
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
and I'll leave everything alone

140
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,060
to follow him.

141
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,900
So you confessed your love to him

142
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,780
in your first meeting.

143
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
What's the focus of your concern?

144
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,860
I think

145
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,260
you live a more interesting life
than me.

146
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,700
You have stories.

147
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,260
(Jifeng Hotel)

148
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,580
Hello.

149
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,300
Hi.

150
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,820
Can you call a taxi for me?

151
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,340
Yes,

152
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,380
but you may need to
wait particularly long.

153
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,300
There's a banquet tonight.

154
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,180
There're many guests who want to go out.

155
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,100
Someone waited over half an hour

156
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,420
just now.

157
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,140
I see.

158
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,260
I'll see.

159
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,660
Miss He, where are you going?

160
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Let me give you a lift.

161
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:13,980
Never mind.

162
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,060
I'll just get a taxi for myself.

163
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,060
Could it be

164
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,580
somewhere unspeakable?

165
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,980
Where's your car?

166
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,620
Parking lot.

167
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,740
Nine Bamboo.

168
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,180
Self-pick.

169
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,060
Pay me now.

170
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,420
Seriously?

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,060
It's so aggressive.

172
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,140
Here.

173
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,060
Two Bamboo.

174
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,900
Washroom is over there.

175
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,580
Two Bamboo?

176
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,100
Yes.

177
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,940
Are you really angry?

178
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,140
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,860
Wait a minute.

180
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,380
I'll go get something.

181
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,020
It's yours.

182
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,540
Take it.

183
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,980
Come on.

184
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,420
Come on.

185
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,110

He Xiaoran.

189
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,420
You're keeping pickle using this?

190
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,340
It seals well.

191
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,160

(I just have to do it my way.)

197
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,260
Dear guests and leaders,

198
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,020
nice to meet you.

199
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,820
The open tendering
of Wusu Radio & TV Group

200
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,100
officially begins.

201
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,480
(News Focus)

202
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,000
Hello,

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,300
(Main News Data Providers)
I'm the host of News Focus.

204
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,340
Light goes out.

205
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,980
Heart turns bright.

206
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
It's the best moment to be accompanied

207
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
by sound.

208
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,140
In fact, there is a lot of

209
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,660
therapeutic sound

210
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,260
in the world.

211
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,820
For example,

212
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,380
sound of wood burning in fire.

213
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,820
Sound of ocean.

214
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,180
And sound of rain

215
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,700
often heard in Wusu.

216
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,060
Although we have not many audiences,

217
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,420
we continue to explore

218
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,180
changes in listening rates

219
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,420
in the faint sound of feedback.

220
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,980
Giving up while having hope.

221
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,060
I like migratory birds.

222
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,100
They're phototropic.

223
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,900
In cities,

224
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,700
overly bright neon

225
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,660
will make them lose their directions.

226
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,700
Maybe this happens to be the situation

227
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
of Dajiabang For Everyone.

228
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,260
I hope my voice

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,940
could become

230
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,060
a bird carrying a thought,

231
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,620
soaring freely

232
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,940
in the night sky,

233
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,900
guiding the correct direction for it.

234
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,220
Is she intended to stand out

235
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,980
by creating a buzz?

236
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,180
All of this?

237
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,140
Yes.

238
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,780
Mr. He,

239
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,860
I've fought such a rare chance

240
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,180
for you.

241
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,220
What's wrong with you?

242
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,380
Is it because you're trending now

243
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,700
so you think a bottom line
is unnecessary

244
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,660
as long as you get the attention?

245
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,540
Well...

246
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,260
It can't be.

247
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,740
There must be a problem
with the equipment.

248
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,460
A problem?

249
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,740
The problem is even when
this is what I think,

250
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
our boss and station manager

251
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,180
are not thinking like that.

252
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Doesn't Dajiabang

253
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,620
usually like to create

254
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,900
this kind of drama?

255
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,020
Mr. He,

256
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,780
it's a solemn open tendering.

257
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,140
Yes.

258
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,420
You've caused me big trouble.

259
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,060
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,020
I'm very sorry.

261
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,020
What should we do now?

262
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,140
The advertising is a total bust.

263
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,180
Our program was criticized

264
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,620
as vulgar.

265
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,100
Where's He Xiaoran?

266
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,300
She said she's heading home.

267
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,420
I guess she won't attend

268
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,300
the dinner.

269
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,660
You're incapable.

270
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,180
You only know how to hit me, don't you?

271
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,500
Believe it or not,
I'll hit you to death.

272
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,380
Xiaoran.

273
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,380
Liu Hang, what are you doing?

274
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,620
It's none of your business. Go away.

275
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,820
You should go away instead.

276
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,140
You've been idling the whole day.

277
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,380
Do you also hit her now?

278
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,100
Save some pride for yourself.

279
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,820
Get out.

280
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,740
He Xiaoran.

281
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,340
I've had it with you for a long time.

282
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,860
Do you believe

283
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,820
I'll hit you, too?

284
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,860
I suggest you don't mess with me today.

285
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,220
Crazy.

286
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,500
- Xiaoran!
- Go away!

287
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,300
Let her go!

288
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,540
You hit a woman, didn't you?

289
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,640
It hurts!

290
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,660
I want to sue her.

291
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,340
See this for yourself.

292
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,300
Don't talk yet.

293
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,860
Miss,

294
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,740
did he hit you?

295
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
Don't be scared.

296
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,860
He didn't hit me.

297
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,940
It's just a normal fight between us.

298
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,020
What about the bruise

299
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,020
at the corner of your mouth?

300
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,220
I accidentally hit myself.

301
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,780
Officer.

302
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,100
You have to do something for me.

303
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,140
She hit me for no reason.

304
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,220
Look here.

305
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,900
Officer.

306
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,060
There's a camera at my door.

307
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,300
It can prove who started it first.

308
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,020
See if

309
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,540
it's self-defence.

310
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,740
Is she serious?

311
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,260
He Xiaoran's friend is here.

312
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,500
Hello.

313
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,340
I'm He Xiaoran's friend.

314
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,420
The details of her case

315
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,940
can wait until the lawyer arrives.

316
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,900
It'll be settled in private.

317
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,980
Will it work?

318
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,780
My boyfriend and I

319
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
are fine.

320
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,660
We won't press a charge.

321
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,380
Lawyer is arriving.

322
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,740
Never mind.

323
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,620
This is it.

324
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,500
How do you know
I'm at the police station?

325
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,460
I went to your house.

326
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
The security told me.

327
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,260
Okay.

328
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,220
It caused a disturbance just now.

329
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,900
Regarding the compensated
medical expenses,

330
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,500
I'll pay you back after the landlord

331
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,260
returns my deposit.

332
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,420
You don't need it urgently, do you?

333
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,140
Go back and stay at Jifeng tonight.

334
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,580
If you don't want to stay there,

335
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,860
I'll find another hotel for you.

336
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,900
Never mind.

337
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,020
I'm going to work back in my office.

338
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,940
He Xiaoran.

339
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,340
Xiao Shangqi.

340
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,700
What do you want to do actually?

341
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,060
I look down on your job.

342
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,940
I can't stand you wasting your life

343
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,860
here.

344
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,580
So I'd rather ruin your job

345
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,540
completely.

346
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,940
Is this your purpose?

347
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,260
Yes.

348
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,060
It's my purpose.

349
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,700
I don't want you to be in this situation

350
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,900
because of me.

351
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,700
Look at your job.

352
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,180
Running errands, laughing with people
and distributing flyers.

353
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
And the place you're staying in.

354
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
Look at your housemates.

355
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,660
I don't know why

356
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,100
you want to live a life like now.

357
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,020
You even use the capsule

358
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,900
that was used to store your ideal

359
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,140
to keep pickle.

360
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,100
Fine.

361
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,700
Since you want to give up,

362
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,420
I'll help you till the end.

363
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,780
Who are you to decide my life?

364
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,420
Don't you think

365
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,460
you're too nosy?

366
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,060
Yes.

367
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,260
I didn't pass the second round of exam

368
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,220
of Hupu TV Station.

369
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,660
Do you really think

370
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,300
I failed

371
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,020
just because of the flowers

372
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,860
and the fact that
you didn't stand at the entrance?

373
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Why was it then?

374
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,020
Fine.

375
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,860
Let's get it straight

376
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,820
today.

377
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,940
Xiao Shangqi,

378
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,220
I loved you.

379
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,180
I've loved you for eight years.

380
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,180
I failed the exam of Hupu TV Station

381
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,500
because one day before the test,

382
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,940
at the graduation party,

383
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,780
they mistakenly

384
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,300
played the video of my love confession

385
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,580
in the public.

386
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,740
You left without saying goodbye
after that.

387
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,100
Now, I know

388
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,500
you didn't watch that video,

389
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,380
but I'd rather that

390
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,260
you'll never know about it.

391
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,340
You'll never know

392
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,660
how embarrassed I was

393
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,700
to come all the way to Wusu.

394
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,180
At first I thought of

395
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,500
just living out this reunion

396
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,220
with dignity.

397
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,180
You've ruined everything.

398
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,060
But it's fine.

399
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,820
I can move on

400
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
completely.

401
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,790
(Jifeng Hotel)

402
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,620
Why didn't you tell me

403
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,740
what happened back then?

404
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,340
I wanted to tell you back then.

405
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,140
Didn't you stop me
from mentioning it again?

406
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,180
Fei'er.

407
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,460
What happened to your face?

408
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,140
Don't mention it if you still

409
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,900
take me as a classmate.

410
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,100
How's it?

411
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,260
Do you feel better today?

412
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,580
You didn't rest well yesterday?

413
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,540
Well,

414
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,740
prepare a room facing south for me.

415
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,860
Buy some

416
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,380
daily household items.

417
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,100
Household items?

418
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,460
The ones normally used

419
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,340
by girls.

420
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,420
Sure, I'll go and prepare it.

421
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,860
Xiao Shangqi,

422
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,100
did you make the mist?

423
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,900
What's the matter?

424
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,940
I don't care where you come from.

425
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,260
He Xiaoran is mine now.

426
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,740
Bullying her

427
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,300
is messing with me, Sui Mingwei.

428
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,740
Don't think

429
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,420
you can stay in Wusu

430
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,420
after messing with me.

431
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,620
She's yours?

432
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,940
Is she aware?

433
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,300
You seem concerned.

434
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,620
Do you care so much about her?

435
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,500
Sir.

436
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,940
You're affecting our normal operation.

437
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,780
Please leave now,

438
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,020
or I'll call the security.

439
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,780
I warn you again.

440
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,300
It won't be as easy

441
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,420
as smashing a sign

442
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,740
if there's another time.

443
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,780
There's no program today.

444
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
What brings you here?

445
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,660
You...

446
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,260
Did you sleep here last night?

447
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,380
Well...

448
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,820
(Real shot No agency fee Fully furnished)

449
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,790
(He Xiaoran)
Hello, Miss He.

450
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,020
We're calling from
the marketing department

451
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,820
of Jifeng Hotel.

452
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,780
Congratulations, you've won a prize.

453
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,660
As a give-back activity

454
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,340
of the open tendering,

455
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,600
we specially selected

456
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,040
some lucky customers

457
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,160
for 90% off room voucher

458
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,220
for the next six months.

459
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,060
You may check in any time

460
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,980
with no limit of days.

461
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,180
Mr. Lin.

462
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,820
I'm not.

463
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,060
We're from the marketing department.

464
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,540
Hello.

465
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Have you found a place to stay?

466
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,380
Yes. Don't worry about me.

467
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,220
Did she find it so soon?

468
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
We missed it, Mr. Xiao.

469
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,060
Shall we

470
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,260
do something else

471
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,300
to make it up?

472
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,940
Why didn't you tell me

473
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,380
when you had nowhere to go?

474
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,500
A housemate of ours has
gone back to hometown.

475
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,220
There's a room empty.

476
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,740
I could've applied to come

477
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,100
and join you

478
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
if I knew there's an empty room.

479
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,980
Staying with you is better than

480
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,860
staying with others.

481
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,780
You come just in time.

482
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,460
We're bored every day.

483
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,780
We may plan

484
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,740
some entertainment

485
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,740
to liven things up.

486
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,940
What do you think? Isn't it good enough?

487
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,380
That's your room.

488
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,020
Let me take you to clean it up.

489
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,980
After attending your open tendering,

490
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,060
I'm rather interested in your

491
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,900
Dajiabang.

492
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,820
I want to hear about
their operating condition.

493
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,180
Not to mention others,

494
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,300
Miss He is really lucky.

495
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,540
Even after ruining the open tendering,

496
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,460
she's attracted

497
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
you.

498
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,540
The mist was an equipment accident.

499
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,460
If I invest in Dajiabang,

500
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,100
I don't want this rumor

501
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,940
to keep on spreading.

502
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,100
Of course.

503
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,420
Please go through

504
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,900
the introduction of their program.

505
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,200
Dajiabang

506
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,760
is a favorite program
of our radio station.

507
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,160
(Sui Mingwei, male, editor)

508
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,880
Audience loss

509
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,560
is rather severe in
the recent two years.

510
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,230
(Li Feng, male, intern)

511
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,500
The station actually planned

512
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,020
to call off the program.

513
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,860
Unexpectedly,

514
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,420
these few youngsters

515
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,740
actually brought the program

516
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,980
back to live.

517
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,580
Take a look.

518
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
He Xiaoran in particular.

519
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
She makes quite
an outstanding performance.

520
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,860
Unfortunately,

521
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,700
she ruined the open tendering.

522
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,540
Did that old classmate of yours

523
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,340
cause you

524
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,340
homeless?

525
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,180
He must have

526
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,580
done something behind
the open tendering.

527
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,500
What kind of grudge

528
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,180
do you hold against each other?

529
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,980
You and Sui are considered

530
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,940
good friends for over a decade,
aren't you?

531
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,220
We're in a bad relationship.

532
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,260
If

533
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,420
he suddenly says

534
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,140
he likes you one day,

535
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,100
what will you do?

536
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:10,900
My goodness!

537
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,380
I'll beg him

538
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,620
to let me go.

539
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,940
Do you mean...

540
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,860
It isn't him.

541
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,580
I had a crush on him for eight years.

542
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,220
It ended

543
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,420
in the most embarrassing way.

544
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,500
He knows it, too.

545
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,860
What do you plan to do next?

546
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,100
I plan to never see him again.

547
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,740
He's known it anyway.

548
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,860
With his character,

549
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,100
I think he'll treat me with respect.

550
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,700
I still want to eat that
tomorrow morning.

551
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,620
It's very delicious.

552
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,540
Is it? Not bad.

553
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,700
Order more next time.

554
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,700
It's too little.

555
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,140
Enough will do. Enough for me.

556
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,100
Mr. He.

557
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,140
Mr. Ma.

558
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,700
Aren't you my lovely

559
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,740
team members?

560
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,180
You...

561
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,260
What?

562
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,020
Call him Mr. Xiao.

563
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,220
Dajiabang's

564
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,180
latest titleholder.

565
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,460
Do we need him?

566
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,620
Wei, mind your words.

567
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,340
He extends

568
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,740
our lives

569
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
with real money.

570
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,340
Are you still unhappy about it?

571
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,780
What's suddenly

572
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,740
changed Mr. Xiao?

573
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,420
He actually wants

574
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,540
to sponsor a program
at the bottom of the pile.

575
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,300
Do you still have to ask?

576
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,340
It must be the potential

577
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,660
of Dajiabang.

578
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,260
All right, Mr. Xiao.

579
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,300
We'll draft a contract

580
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,660
in the afternoon

581
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,540
before contacting you
to sign and stamp on it.

582
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,540
No problem.

583
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,180
He Xiaoran.

584
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,340
Hurry and see him off.

585
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,660
See your old classmate off.

586
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,540
Go now.

587
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,180
Why does she need to see him off?

588
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,820
He has legs, right?

589
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,740
Can't he walk himself?

590
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,220
Stop making a fuss.

591
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,500
Xiao Shangqi.

592
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,900
I've heard so much about
your glorious exploits

593
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,420
in Jifeng.

594
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,260
Why?

595
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,380
You didn't have much fun

596
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,540
so you came to a radio station, did you?

597
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,580
Do you think I'm having fun?

598
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,860
Aren't you having fun?

599
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,380
Then it's about you

600
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,620
knowing that I had a crush
on you for eight years.

601
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,580
You feel a bit sorry.

602
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,540
You're under pressure.

603
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,980
So you want to make it up

604
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,460
in this way, don't you?

605
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,340
I advise you to save the trouble.

606
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,100
I've long forgotten about it.

607
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,900
We don't owe each other anymore.

608
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,860
We'll go our own way.

609
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,100
Don't think

610
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,860
you can tell me

611
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
what to do with my life

612
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,980
after becoming

613
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,860
the titleholder.

614
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,300
No way.

615
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,060
Don't get me wrong.

616
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,220
What's it then?

617
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,460
Jifeng wants to test the water
with a radio advertisement.

618
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,420
Dajiabang offers the lowest price.

619
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,300
I believe you?

620
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,660
Jifeng's reputation

621
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,860
has hit rock bottom.

622
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,300
Does it need an advertisement?

623
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Yes.

624
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,700
Jifeng wants to be rated

625
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,100
for the Black Pine Needle's
Desirable Hotel.

626
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,060
It's also

627
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,180
the purpose of my business trip.

628
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,860
If you really want nothing

629
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,700
to do with me,

630
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,220
I can give up the sponsorship.

631
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,540
Wait.

632
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,420
The Black Pine Needle is the recent

633
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,860
new list online.

634
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,980
Hotels in the list

635
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,100
aren't that luxurious.

636
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,740
It's mainly about comfort and specialty.

637
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,860
They're especially popular.

638
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,900
But Jifeng...

639
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,260
Will it work?

640
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,580
Make it work then.

641
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,620
He comes for a business trip.

642
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,020
As long as the hotel is listed on
Black Pine Needle,

643
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,460
he'll fulfill his business tip.

644
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,620
He can then go back to Hupu.

645
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,140
I see.

646
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Do you plan

647
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,980
to accept the sponsorship?

648
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,380
Of course.

649
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,140
Not only that,

650
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,020
we should work hard

651
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,100
to get the program right.

652
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,380
Let our listening rate

653
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,500
soar with the popularity

654
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,260
of Jifeng,

655
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,340
to see off

656
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,660
my old classmate.

657
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,380
What have you bought?

658
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,500
Is there anything for me?

659
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,780
Dream on.

660
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,300
It's for myself. Electric toothbrush.

661
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,660
All right.

662
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,940
Wait a second.

663
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,780
What's the matter?

664
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,140
You don't have anything else
in mind, do you?

665
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
What do you mean?

666
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,420
He Xiaoran has nowhere to go.

667
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,100
I'd bring her back in my case.

668
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,860
But I need to

669
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
confirm in advance.

670
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:19,940
You don't have

671
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
anything else in mind, do you?

672
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,460
What if I have something else in mind?

673
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,420
Don't lose a friend

674
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,860
out of impromptu.

675
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,700
Whose impromptu?

676
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,140
I wanted to experience

677
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,820
love over time last time.

678
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,100
It changes a little

679
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,900
due to some sudden

680
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,300
people and matters.

681
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,620
The loft is a place

682
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,980
for someone to settle down in peace.

683
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,980
I'll come to you

684
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,340
if you dare harass He Xiaoran

685
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,500
under my watch.

686
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,780
You should

687
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,540
care more about

688
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,980
your boyfriend who uses all your money.

689
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,340
Go away.

690
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,460
All right.

691
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
(Name, He Xiaoran)

692
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,460
(Sui Mingwei, male, editor)

693
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,160
(Li Hui, female, editor)

694
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,810
(Li Feng, male, intern)

695
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,460
(Delicious Crayfish)

696
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,740
(Their crayfish)

697
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,060
(has 13 spices. It's delicious.)

698
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,700
(Taste it.)

699
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,740
(Xiao Shangqi,)

700
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,900
(I loved you.)

701
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,180
(I've loved you for eight years.)

702
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,900
(I've long forgotten about it.)

703
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,780
(We don't owe each other in the future.)

704
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,580
(We'll go our own way.)

705
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,700
(Is there no program today?)

706
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,580
(Have you eaten?)

707
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,580
(Are you still at the radio station?)

708
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,740
(I want to talk about)

709
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,540
(the following collaboration with you.)

710
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,500
I'm really surprised

711
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,260
when you showed interest

712
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,060
in the program.

713
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,860
This is where

714
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,820
the program goes on air.

715
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,660
Do you just play at

716
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
your advertisers?

717
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Dear sponsor,

718
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,220
would you like me to introduce it?

719
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,980
Sure.

720
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,020
This is the director's room.

721
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
The program

722
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,100
is aired on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday.

723
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,900
It happens to be unavailable today.

724
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,060
Open tendering.

725
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,580
The content after
being disrupted by the mist.

726
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,060
Can you talk about it?

727
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,740
Sure.

728
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,900
It's meant to be listened

729
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,340
by the sponsor anyway.

730
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,980
Although Dajiabang

731
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,060
used to be at the bottom

732
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,180
of the listenership pile,

733
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,620
our existence

734
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,980
is to deliver a kind of

735
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,300
persevering faith.

736
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,380
Also, with such faith,

737
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,380
we got on the stage of open tendering.

738
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,420
We're like

739
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,100
a light in the dead night.

740
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,940
It's faint,

741
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,940
but it shines a light
on a group of people.

742
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
I just don't know

743
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,460
if the group of people

744
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,980
is your customer group,

745
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,220
Mr. Xiao.

746
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,980
It will be.

747
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,220
Because

748
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,540
I was one of them.

749
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,180
They all have left.

750
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,060
Let's play Lego.

751
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,140
Xiao Shangqi,

752
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,740
even when you don't spend money,

753
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,500
you can't always stay in the hotel.

754
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,980
You should go home.

755
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,300
This is

756
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,940
my home from now on.

757
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,020
I knew something was wrong.

758
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,220
You invite everyone to come

759
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,660
every day without a reason.

760
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,300
Did you fight with your father again?

761
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,780
He removed the basketball hoops at home

762
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,260
in case it displeased my brother.

763
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,220
It's been a while.

764
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,980
Didn't he tell you to go back?

765
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,140
He has Xiao Xian and that's enough.

766
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,940
But it's so empty here.

767
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,180
Will you sleep well?

768
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,740
Turn the volume of
sports channel to five.

769
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,060
Other than the slightly harsh light,

770
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,340
others are fine.

771
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,140
Use this.

772
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,740
You may sleep

773
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,820
while listening to
radio programs at night.

774
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,500
It's too childish.

775
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,740
Yes.

776
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,580
There's also a group of people

777
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,460
like you.

778
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,460
They need some sound to fall asleep.

779
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,660
Let's call it a day.

780
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,820
Come on. I want to go back.

781
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,180
Where are you going?

782
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,540
Have you found a place to stay

783
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,260
so soon?

784
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,260
I don't need to tell you,

785
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
do I?

786
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,380
Xiaoran.

787
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,180
I'm taking the stairs, too.

788
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,460
I'm sorry.

789
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,980
For what?

790
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,180
Many things.

791
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,420
No.

792
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,660
Everything.

793
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,740
It's my fault for not considering

794
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,500
your feelings.

795
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,580
In fact, I left

796
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
the graduation party

797
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,420
due to an emergency.

798
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,580
I didn't notice what was playing

799
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,740
on the screen either.

800
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,500
I know.

801
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,860
But does it make a difference?

802
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,180
Had you watched

803
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,460
that video back then,

804
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,700
we could've

805
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,540
become like this long ago.

806
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,460
We'd withdraw our hands even when

807
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,580
we accidentally touch each other's.

808
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Just now I...

809
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,580
You actually don't need to feel sorry

810
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,900
or apologize

811
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,340
for not falling for me

812
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,020
or sensing

813
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,140
my feelings.

814
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
It's me who wanted to hide it,

815
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,300
so you didn't realize.

816
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,820
And I had

817
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,020
a lot of fun liking you.

818
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,180
I didn't lose anything.

819
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,340
I'm sorry.

820
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,940
Enough.

821
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,260
I've said it.

822
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,780
It's over.

823
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,140
Good job with the open tendering.

824
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
The popularity goes up.

825
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,380
Many in the industry

826
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,580
came to ask for a quotation.

827
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,820
I'll make recommendation in a few days.

828
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,500
Sell it and come back to Hupu
as soon as possible.

829
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,620
Aren't you too jittery?

830
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,220
What are you referring to?

831
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,420
How much will you get for Jifeng now?

832
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,820
Give me more time.

833
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,940
We can make money

834
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,100
other than making up the loss

835
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,300
caused by Zhao Mingxuan.

836
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,340
This cup isn't nice either.

837
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,700
Shut it down.

838
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,940
This is our one and only

839
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,020
profitable business segment now.

840
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,860
Mr. Lin.

841
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,940
Do you think Jifeng

842
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,460
can be listed on Black Pine Needle?

843
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,940
What did you say?

844
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Black Pine Needle's Desirable Hotel?

845
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,740
Last year,

846
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,780
there's only one hotel in Wusu

847
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,380
listed on the ranking.

848
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,180
It's also a new

849
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,980
international five-star hotel chain.

850
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,900
Work hard

851
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,060
and make Jifeng the second one.

852
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,580
Go for it.

853
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,780
Second?

854
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,060
Is he crazy or am I crazy?

855
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,380
Who's the head chef?

856
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:03,980
Me.

857
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,700
Are you in charge of food procurement?

858
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,700
Yes.

859
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,740
What's the matter?

860
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,540
The porridge is overnight.
The noodle is soggy.

861
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,060
The buns have more
green onions than meat.

862
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,460
Jifeng is known to have
the worst breakfast.

863
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,300
Customers who take breakfast

864
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,180
are all our room guests.

865
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,380
It's not profitable.

866
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
You don't need to come tomorrow onwards.

867
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,740
Lin Zong.

868
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Settle his salary.

869
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,260
You're new so you may not know.

870
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,860
He's poached by us with high salary.

871
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,220
Use the salary

872
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,340
to hire this person.

873
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,220
His noodle is quite delicious.

874
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,180
I may not answer it even if you call.

875
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,140
He said

876
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,180
he may not answer it even if you call.

877
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,860
I want to see

878
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,740
who is willing to manage

879
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,580
the poor restaurant of your poor hotel!

880
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,420
Would you like to check in?

881
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,420
Where's the kitchen?

882
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,700
Ask Mr. Xiao to come here.

883
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,500
Take us there.

884
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,900
Welcome.

885
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,500
I'm sure you all know that

886
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,020
the food in Jifeng is awful.

887
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,860
We need

888
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,820
a new menu.

889
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,260
So I've specially hired

890
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,740
the elite chefs in Wusu.

891
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,700
Do you call these roadside chefs

892
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,700
as elites?

893
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,020
The head

894
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,180
opens a noodle house.

895
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,420
Noodle house?

896
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,660
It's to manage you.

897
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,420
No marketing. No operations.

898
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,740
No dining environment.

899
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,260
It's all about the taste.

900
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,060
Fight your way through the fierce

901
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,180
food and beverage industry.

902
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,340
That's elite.

903
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,460
I lack a head chef.

904
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,540
Let's compete fairly.

905
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,820
Show your best dishes.

906
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,060
The one with the most selected dishes

907
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,180
will be the head chef.

908
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,140
What do you say?

909
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,220
Sure.

910
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,220
Let's begin.

911
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,380
Meng,

912
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,980
aren't you running a noodle house?

913
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,740
Why do you know so many cuisines?

914
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,020
Before opening a noodle house,

915
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,820
he's worked for ten five-star hotels

916
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
and opened six restaurants.

917
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,860
Isn't that fascinating?

918
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,860
Mr. Lin.

919
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,340
Don't you think I'm lucky?

920
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,620
I only wanted a taste of noodle.

921
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,940
That's how I discovered a precious.

922
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,180
You're lucky.

923
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,660
It's the last one. Taste it.

924
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,820
It doesn't taste right.

925
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,860
I've been making this dish
for over a decade.

926
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,540
No one has ever said

927
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,220
it's not good.

928
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,540
Not bad.

929
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,460
What taste should it be?

930
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,620
Come and eat.

931
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,380
Come and sit.

932
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:04,860
Sit down.

933
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,940
Sit down.

934
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,980
Sit down.

935
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,980
This is my favorite dish.

936
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,620
My father's best dish,

937
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,140
sweet and sour spare ribs.

938
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,340
It's the best in the universe.

939
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,180
You're so arrogant.

940
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,380
Will it be better than

941
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,380
the hotel?

942
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,100
Ran told me that

943
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,340
your father is busy with work.

944
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,860
You've been staying in the hotel.

945
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,780
Come here

946
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,100
for dinner whenever you have time.

947
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,060
Yes.

948
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,100
Come and dine here.

949
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,220
Move it over there.

950
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,620
Outside food is delicious,

951
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,620
but it's not as nutritious
as home-cooked food.

952
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,460
Come on.

953
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,660
Taste my sweet and sour spare ribs.

954
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,780
You aren't used to it, are you?

955
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,100
No.

956
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,220
I never ate one at home.

957
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,660
It tastes quite different.

958
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,580
It's delicious.

959
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,500
It's delicious.

960
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,420
Have more then.

961
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,500
- Yes.
- Come on.

962
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,620
Come and taste my prawn.

963
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,060
You should eat it, too.

964
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,660
You've slimmed down lately.

965
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,380
Best in the universe.

966
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,020
Second in the universe.

967
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,700
There's more.

968
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,940
Mr. Xiao has been telling us that

969
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
your home-made sweet and sour spare ribs

970
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,260
are the best in the universe.

971
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,380
I know how to make it,

972
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,500
but it's kind of showing off.

973
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,380
Don't worry.

974
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,220
Just do what you normally do.

975
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,780
We'll record the amount of

976
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,420
garnish

977
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,060
and assist you.

978
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,860
Come on. Hurry up.

979
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,940
Thank you.

980
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,540
Salt.

981
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,340
It's almost there.

982
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,620
Turn off the fire.

983
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,300
Does anyone want to try?

984
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,100
Is there anyone...

985
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,420
Miss He,

986
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,740
your home-made sweet and sour spare ribs

987
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,700
are certainly different.

988
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,820
It's delicious.

989
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,260
It's certainly the best in the universe.

990
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,660
I always thought

991
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,580
there's secret recipe

992
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,620
in your homemade dishes.

993
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,420
It's actually

994
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,220
made with kitchen seasonings.

995
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,700
Dishes

996
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,580
are all about the atmosphere.

997
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,020
Half the taste, half the story.

998
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,860
It doesn't taste very good.

999
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,100
But it reminds you of the past.

1000
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,060
He Xiaoran,

1001
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,260
do you want to work
closely together with me?
