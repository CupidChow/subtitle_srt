I'll get back the things

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
that you protected one by one.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,800
Romance relationships might not be

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,760
so important to me.

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,960
When I had no goals in life,

23
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,000
dating was fun.

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,760
I've loved you for so many years,

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,080
but if I knew

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
this relationship means nothing to you,

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,920
I wouldn't have started it.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
I'll go buy coffee.

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
I've never

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,520
cried in front of my father

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,600
since young.

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,880
Live well when you're alive

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
and that's the right way to treat

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,160
those who have passed away.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,440
Xiaoran.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Thank you.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,080
No worries.

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
It's good that
you're not depressed anymore.

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,880
I didn't know that the daytime view here

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,640
is not bad.

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
It's not as dark

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,480
as that night.

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,480
If I was

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,960
more patient,

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120
perhaps we could have waited until dawn

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,000
and seen

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
a different view.

48
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,480
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,120
Xiaoran, you're good.

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,080
What you did

51
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,960
have solved his problem.

52
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,560
But you have to be here for the drip

53
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,440
for two days.

54
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
Get all the construction projects

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,680
Zhao Mingxuan's doing

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,760
to me quickly.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,880
Okay.

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,760
Mr. Xiao,

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,800
we're more familiar

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,880
with your current state.

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,320
You were not asking us

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,160
to do anything some time ago.

63
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
We didn't know what to do.

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm going back first.

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,200
Li Hui has a performance at night.

66
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,160
I'll go and cheer for her.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,080
Okay.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Is Sui Mingwei going, too?

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,720
I think so.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
I heard from the staff from
the fragrant factory

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,160
when they came to Jifeng

72
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,640
about how Mr. Sui

73
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
seems to be in a bad mood.

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,480
It seems that

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,800
he was dumped.

76
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,080
What I heard was that

77
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,520
he didn't get to pursue
the girl he likes.

78
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Well, I'm leaving now.

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,160
Bye.

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,360
Someone said he doesn't want to
get back together,

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,120
but when he heard Sui Mingwei

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,800
was out,

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,040
he was quite happy.

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,240
Get all the information here

85
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,800
by 8 p.m. tonight.

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,880
Go now.

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,200
You were nicer

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,520
when you were depressed.

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,960
Let's go.

90
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
Boss wants the information
by 8 p.m. tonight.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Okay.

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,480
Where's Li Hui?

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Hasn't she gone up to the stage?

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
You're quite lucky.

96
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
She's coming up next.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,600
- Xiaoran.
- Sui.

98
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,400
Go ahead.

99
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,680
Go ahead.

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,320
Actually, it's nothing.

101
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,480
I just want to tell you...

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,680
Okay.

103
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
Thank you for coming.

104
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,920
Today's performance has come to an end.

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,880
Thank you, everyone.

106
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,840
It has ended?

107
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,960
Sui.

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Sui, you...

109
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,400
Don't be impulsive.

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,040
Why did it end?

111
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Li Hui has yet to perform.

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,840
Li Hui?

113
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
There's no time.

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,200
The band was asked

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,040
to encore today,

116
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,320
so they sang a few more songs.

117
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,480
The following performances

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,240
didn't have enough time.

119
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,640
So, she can't sing anymore?

120
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,520
We're here to hear her sing.

121
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,560
How can you just cut her off?

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
You're terrible.

123
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
So what?

124
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,600
The band is famous and they sing well.

125
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Furthermore,

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,320
the later performers were just here
to fill up the numbers.

127
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
What are you talking about?

128
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
She can sing way better than others.

129
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,560
That's right.

130
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,680
No.

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
Can you stop giving me a hard time?

132
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,920
This is decided by the organiser.

133
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
I think

134
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
you should just follow

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
a famous band

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
or

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,080
you should ask the singer you like

138
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,040
to work

139
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,080
harder.

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,800
Work harder?

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,760
They're my friends.

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,560
They're my friends.

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm leaving.

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
It's okay.

147
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll ask Li Hui

148
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,920
to sing tomorrow.

149
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,520
Pay her extra.

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,120
No problem.

151
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,040
- Okay?
- No big deal.

152
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,720
No big deal.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Okay. Thank you, Hao.

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,520
Look at you two.

155
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,280
Was that a big deal?

156
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,400
He didn't let you perform.

157
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,880
It's not a big deal.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,560
Let's go.

159
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,080
Where are you sitting?

160
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Here.

161
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
Look at how angry you are.

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,000
In this industry,

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,840
popularity determines everything.

164
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,920
Actually, I came here this time

165
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,280
to join the rest to perform

166
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
to make myself

167
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
happy,

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
sing a song and have time.

169
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
But the few bands in front of me

170
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,640
were fighting for the duration

171
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,320
and the order.

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,520
Everything was messed up.

173
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,960
I didn't want to perform actually.

174
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
Popularity?

175
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,440
Capability is everything.

176
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,960
That's right.

177
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,360
Once you start singing,

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,960
they have to give ways to you.

179
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,520
Why not I record you singing

180
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
and post it online?

181
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,240
Great idea.

182
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,840
Right?

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Right here.

184
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Let's record a video

185
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,840
and post it online.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
Tag their performance official website

187
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,800
and give them a hard time.

188
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,680
Let me see.

189
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Miss He.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
Mr. Sui, I'm begging you.

191
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,960
Stop this, okay?

192
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,280
It doesn't matter.

193
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,080
The performance is not important.

194
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,360
What's important is that

195
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,040
I have you two

196
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
as my best friends.

197
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm happy.

198
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,200
What are you talking about?

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,440
What do you mean by
the performance is not important?

200
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,680
That's right.

201
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,200
We came here

202
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,400
to hear you sing.

203
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,000
It doesn't really matter.

204
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,160
Sing for us.

205
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,600
Sing a song.

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,800
Come on.

207
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
Okay.

208
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
I'll sing a song then.

209
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
This song is dedicated

210
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,360
to my best friends.

211
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
To our friendship!

Here.

225
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,080
Mr. Zhao.

226
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,800
Mr. Lan.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,520
Mr. Zhao.

228
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,280
You're here.

229
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,920
How can I miss your gathering?

230
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,880
Miss Fei'er

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,240
is indeed more beautiful
than the social influencers.

232
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
No wonder Mr. Zhao's so faithful.

233
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Fei'er.

234
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,880
Since Mr. Lan admires you a lot,

235
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,080
you should pour him wine

236
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
to thank him.

237
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,800
Here.

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,800
Mr. Lan.

239
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,520
Thank you.

240
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, Mr. Zhao,

241
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I need to apologise to you.

242
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
Xian came to me the other day.

243
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,200
Looking at how hardworking he is

244
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,200
running errands for you,

245
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,840
I can't help but to tease him.

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,080
I asked when he can

247
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,720
come and play golf with me,

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,960
and I'll sign the contract.

249
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,120
I didn't mean to make it hard

250
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,200
for Deju.

251
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
It's okay. We're brothers.

252
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,720
No need to worry about that.

253
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,280
Mr. Zhao.

254
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,840
Cheers.

255
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,560
Cheers.

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
- Cheers. Mr. Zhang.
- Cheers.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Carry on.

258
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,120
What's wrong?

259
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,040
Why are you hiding here?

260
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,120
Tired?

261
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,960
Mr. Lan kept touching me.

262
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,360
Didn't you see that?

263
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Fei'er,

264
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,720
why do you think

265
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
I brought you here?

266
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,640
Mr. Lan is my client.

267
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,400
It's good that he likes you.

268
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,520
You're no longer
the Princess of Yunduan.

269
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
What's wrong?

270
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,360
No worries.

271
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,400
She's just tired.

272
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,040
Come on.

273
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,360
Let's continue drinking.

274
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,680
Come on.

275
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Come on.

276
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,040
Mr. Lan.

277
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,080
Be careful.

278
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
You're beautiful.

279
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
You're drunk.

280
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,160
Sit down.

281
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,240
Come here.

282
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,480
Come here.

283
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,640
Come here.

284
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,800
Mr. Lan,

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,680
you're drunk.

286
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,680
I'm Mingxuan's woman.

287
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,760
Trying to scare me?

288
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,480
Trying to scare me with him?

289
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,160
Do you think I'm afraid of him?

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,080
Why is Zhao Mingxuan

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,120
trying to

292
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,040
please me?

293
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,520
Which dirty work that he did

294
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,160
wasn't

295
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,240
assisted by me?

296
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,360
He wants to

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,960
use you to please me.

298
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Mr. Lan, you're drunk.

299
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,440
This is the primary data
for the project,

300
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,280
Mr. Zhao.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,560
Shall we destroy it?

302
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
Keeping it here

303
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,280
will not make it a flaw to us.

304
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,200
No need to destroy it.

305
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,440
At least

306
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,400
we can use it to control others.

307
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,440
I'm here to deliver the tea.

308
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,160
Mingxuan, drink tea.

309
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm not drinking.

310
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
My shoulders are tight.

311
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,240
Come and massage me.

312
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
You're teasing me again.

313
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,640
Mr. Zhao.

314
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,280
You're keeping a woman at home.

315
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,319
You don't know her?

316
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,200
I do.

317
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
The former Princess of Yunduan.

318
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Everyone knows her.

319
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,400
I just didn't know that

320
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,160
the wedding messed up,

321
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,280
and you're still living together.

322
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,000
You're so soft-hearted.

323
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Mingxuan,

324
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,760
she's your friend?

325
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,680
Yes.

326
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,720
Prepare some fruits

327
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,360
and a bottle of red wine for us.

328
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
You know my taste.

329
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,760
Try my collection later.

330
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,640
Okay.

331
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,400
I won't drink it if it's not nice.

332
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Well,

333
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,400
I made my shoes dirty

334
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,600
on my way here.

335
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,280
Wipe it for me.

336
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,200
Fei'er,

337
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,400
sometimes,

338
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,040
I really admire how calm you are,

339
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,880
but I'm sick of

340
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,920
your face.

341
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
Stay in Yunduan tonight.

342
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,400
We have

343
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,920
something to talk about.

344
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,040
Okay.

345
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,080
What's this?

346
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Put my things down.

347
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,720
Why are you touching my clothes?

348
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,600
It's yours?

349
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,600
Which of the clothes here

350
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
are yours?

351
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,720
You're just

352
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,480
a collection item

353
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,760
at Mingxuan's house.

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
There's no difference
between you and the items here.

355
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,960
You're right.

356
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
Even if I'm an item,

357
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,400
at least I'm kept at home.

358
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,600
I'm much better than you,

359
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,320
an instant food.

360
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
Are you so naive thinking that

361
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,960
putting a night here

362
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,640
makes you the mistress here

363
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,920
and you have the right to move my stuff?

364
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Instant food?

365
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
I wasn't the one being chased

366
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,280
out of the house yesterday.

367
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
I'll throw away all your clothes

368
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,520
today.

369
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,440
I'll show you

370
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,200
if I can

371
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
handle all these rubbish!

372
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,240
What are you doing?

373
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Mingxuan.

374
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
Mingxuan.

375
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,320
You asked me to come here.

376
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
It's an eye sore for me
to see all these.

377
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,040
Will you be against this?

378
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,200
No.

379
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
Whatever you want to throw away,

380
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,280
just throw it away.

381
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,520
Does it include her?

382
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,400
I don't want to stay

383
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
under the same roof with her.

384
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,720
Mingxuan,

385
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,520
what do you mean?

386
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,400
Xiao Shangqi has been

387
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,640
defeated by me.

388
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
Do you think I still need to keep you

389
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,800
as my trophy?

390
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,520
You're chasing me away?

391
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,840
Keep your own things.

392
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,760
Zhao Mingxuan.

393
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm going out for breakfast.

394
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,000
The house is too messy.

395
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,640
I hope when I come home,

396
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,280
it's all cleaned up.

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
That girl

398
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
asked me to

399
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,160
monitor you as you keep your things.

400
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,280
No need to treat me like a thief.

401
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,440
When I'm done keeping,

402
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll let you check.

403
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,840
Miss Chen.

404
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,800
Do you need my help?

405
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:11,410
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

406
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,560
I wanted to call you

407
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,480
when I'm settled down.

408
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
I didn't know we'd meet up so quickly.

409
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Why are you here?

410
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,760
I've been curious about how

411
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,920
the small city

412
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,240
that keeps you

413
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,680
and Xiao Shangqi here

414
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,800
looks like.

415
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
I've finally seen it.

416
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,240
Not bad.

417
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,080
What are you doing here?

418
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,080
Xiaoran,

419
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
you actually hate me a lot, right?

420
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,760
After I tortured you and Xiao Shangqi,

421
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,120
I still returned to

422
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,600
Zhao Mingxuan.

423
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm not trying to

424
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,080
wake someone who is pretending
to be sleeping up.

425
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,320
I can't control many things.

426
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
When I had nothing,

427
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
Zhao Mingxuan was willing to keep me,

428
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,200
I had to agree.

429
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,920
Do you know who

430
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,920
Zhao Mingxuan is?

431
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,160
He caused Xiao Shangqi's father's death.

432
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,400
You know about this?

433
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,720
Not just that,

434
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,440
I even told him about this.

435
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,760
But,

436
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,800
he still couldn't do anything.

437
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,160
What are you and Zhao Mingxuan

438
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,480
trying to do?

439
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,960
Zhao Mingxuan didn't know that
I've come to Wusu.

440
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,040
If I say

441
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm here to

442
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,960
help Xiao Shangqi,

443
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
will you support me?

444
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,120
No.

445
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,760
I know you've broken up,

446
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,560
but I'm sure you still
talk to each other.

447
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,840
What happens between

448
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,600
you and him

449
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
has nothing to do with me.

450
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,400
Between you both,

451
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
one is trying to save the other,

452
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,840
and the other one
is depending on the other.

453
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm not interested in

454
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,680
this charity game.

455
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,640
Miss He.

456
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,560
This is Mr. Xiao's breakfast.

457
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,840
Give it to her.

458
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,000
She's going to the hospital

459
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,920
to visit Xiao Shangqi.

460
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,120
Hospital?

461
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,740
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)

462
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,880
Can I be discharged now?

463
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,120
Stay for one more night.
Discharge tomorrow.

464
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,240
He Xiaoran

465
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,480
is coming to send you food.

466
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,120
Why are you leaving so early?

467
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,960
Why won't you treasure

468
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
the good time in the hospital?

469
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
When you're recovered,

470
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,680
will she follow you

471
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,960
and take care of you at home?

472
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
Treasure the good time.

473
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,280
No need to trouble her.

474
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,600
You don't mean what you said.

475
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,400
She's not feeling troubled.

476
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
It's been a while.

477
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Why were you so careless

478
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,640
that you're hospitalised?

479
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,960
It must be tough for you.

480
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
Why are you here?

481
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,400
Is this place

482
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,560
a forbidden place

483
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,960
for Chen Fei'er?

484
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,760
Why is everyone

485
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,920
giving me this response?

486
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,920
No wonder Zhao Mingxuan

487
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,120
looked like he won something

488
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,120
after coming back to Hupu.

489
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,840
He caused you to get hurt,

490
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,760
didn't he?

491
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,240
I'm asking, why are you here?

492
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,360
He's getting more and more arrogant.

493
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,520
I didn't care about my title

494
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,560
and obeyed him in every way,

495
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,760
but he

496
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
tortured me more

497
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
and took me for granted.

498
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,600
I think it's because

499
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
he's bothered by

500
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,400
what happened between you and I before.

501
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm asking, why are you here?

502
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm here to help you.

503
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,880
Shangqi,

504
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,840
when I got back to Zhao Mingxuan's side,

505
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
I had no choice.

506
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,880
I was never feeling good

507
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,240
seeing how he treated you.

508
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,560
Similarly,

509
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,800
do you think

510
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,160
he will treat me well

511
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,800
as his trophy?

512
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,320
To him,

513
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,440
we're tied together

514
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,680
and we're his enemy.

515
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I've got something.

516
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm sure we can

517
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
defeat him if we work together.

518
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,080
Why are you helping me?

519
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,520
Because we're the same kind of people.

520
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,840
We used to help each other.

521
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Now, we're being pushed to the corner

522
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,880
by the same enemy.

523
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,000
Why should we fight alone?

524
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,240
What's the condition?

525
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Yes.

526
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,000
I have some conditions.

527
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,400
I want to stand beside you again

528
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,120
to give us

529
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,040
a new chance.

530
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,560
You like Wusu.

531
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,480
I'll slowly

532
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,680
learn about this city.

533
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,280
I want to live

534
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,320
a peaceful life here

535
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,920
with you around.

536
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,400
Is that okay?

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,760
Since that's the case,

538
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,200
no matter what you have with you,

539
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,520
I don't need it.

540
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't have what you want.

541
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,080
Also,

542
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,840
I like Wusu

543
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,360
because He Xiaoran is here.

544
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,000
But,

545
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,440
she doesn't seem to be interested

546
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,840
in you anymore.

547
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,880
You've met her?

548
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,120
Xiaoran.

549
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,320
I didn't know Chen Fei'er
would come here.

551
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,200
Did you come here

552
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,600
just to tell me this?

553
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:30,920
It's okay.

554
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,200
I just met

555
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,240
Fei'er in Jifeng.

556
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,640
She wanted to see you.

557
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,920
So, I asked her to

558
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,040
send the breakfast over to you.

559
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,200
She's here in Wusu...

560
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,880
Actually,

561
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm not interested  in her matter.

562
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,680
The reason she's here

563
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,720
and how you plan to help her

564
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,720
is none of my business.

565
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,920
I'm not planning to help her.

566
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,800
Xiao Shangqi,

567
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,600
since you were running here,

568
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,320
you must have almost

569
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,120
fully recovered.

570
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,080
Actually, the station

571
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,960
is quite busy recently.

572
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,960
Many things happened.

573
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm not going to the hospital anymore.

574
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,320
He Xiaoran.

575
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,800
Was the concern you showed me

576
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,920
in the hospital

577
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,880
limited?

578
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,960
What limited?

579
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,120
That's weird.

580
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,320
I visited you in the hospital

581
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
and went to the graveyard with you

582
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,960
to return your favour

583
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,280
for saving me.

584
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,920
I still need to write scripts.

585
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,920
I'm going up.

586
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
What favour?

587
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,080
You're back.

588
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,400
Why are you home today?

589
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,880
Didn't you go to the hospital?

590
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,280
What are you doing?

591
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,240
Let the blood flow to my thighs

592
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
to reduce the blood flow in my brain.

593
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,480
Then,

594
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,080
I'll be less troubled.

595
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,600
You're troubled?

596
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,040
Tell me and make me happy.

597
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,920
What's troubling you?

598
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
I met Chen Fei'er today.

599
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,360
Chen Fei'er?

600
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,880
Why is she here?

601
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,360
She's everywhere.

602
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,640
Did she come for Xiao Shangqi?

603
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,960
I think so.

604
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,160
I just realised that

605
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,640
there's no

606
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,880
so-called Xanadu

607
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,840
that can avoid you from

608
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,880
the people and matter
that you don't want to see or face.

609
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,720
I could finally

610
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,320
live a peaceful life

611
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,720
and Chen Fei'er is here.

612
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,160
Xiao Shangqi

613
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,440
started to explain to me again.

614
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,800
So, you didn't want

615
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,680
to hear his explanation?

616
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,480
No.

617
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,720
Chen Fei'er knew all along

618
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,720
it's Zhao Mingxuan

619
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,040
who caused Xiao Shangqi's
father's death.

620
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,040
Also, it was her

621
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,200
who told Xiao Shangqi.

622
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Chen Fei'er told him that?

623
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,560
That time,

624
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,720
Xiao Shangqi didn't say anything

625
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,320
and he pushed me away.

626
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,720
He chose to work with Chen Fei'er.

627
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,080
Now, Chen Fei'er

628
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,320
has given him

629
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,400
the important information again.

630
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
What? She's everywhere.

631
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,640
Are you angry

632
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,600
or jealous?

633
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,200
I just suddenly realised that

634
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,120
when I was taking care of

635
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,640
Xiao Shangqi in the hospital,

636
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,720
I almost

637
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,040
forgot how bad he hurt me.

638
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,280
So, I've decided.

639
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,720
No matter

640
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,200
they want to work together

641
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
to deal with Zhao Mingxuan

642
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,360
or what,

643
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't want to be

644
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,520
in the triangle love anymore.

645
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,440
Okay, I support you.

646
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,920
Why did you buy

647
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,800
their toothbrush again?

648
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,720
Don't we have it?

649
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,000
It's not a toothbrush.

650
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,960
It's an oral irrigator.

651
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,040
I bought it for you.

652
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,040
It suits me.

653
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,920
I have one, too.

654
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,000
Well,

655
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,520
you hardly come back.

656
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,320
Sui said

657
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,400
we'll go barbeque

658
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,400
on the hill tonight

659
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
and enjoy the night view.

660
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,280
Let's go together.

661
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,160
I'm begging you.

662
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
Don't you feel tired

663
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
going out every night?

664
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm tired,

665
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,400
but Sui Mingwei

666
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,640
is so hyped up.

667
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,640
He organises something every day.

668
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,520
Go ahead. I'm not joining.

669
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,720
No.

670
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,880
Are you worried

671
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,560
that

672
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,440
he's not over you yet?

673
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,880
No.

674
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm just not in the mood today.

675
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,440
Okay.

676
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,400
Sometimes, learn to let it go.

677
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,120
Leave all these

678
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,720
to time.

679
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,440
Don't be too stubborn.

680
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm leaving. I have something on.

681
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,480
Help me to put this upstairs.

682
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,480
Thank you.

683
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,280
Enjoy.

684
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,160
Learn to leave it to time.

685
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,760
Hello.

686
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,159
You went back home?

687
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
(Yunlan Jifeng)
Your house has nothing to eat.

688
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,360
(Yunlan Jifeng)

689
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,040
(Yunlan Jifeng)
Why not I ask Mo

690
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,280
(Yunlan Jifeng)

691
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,920
(Yunlan Jifeng)
to go check you out?

692
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,360
Did you take the medicine with you?

693
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,480
No worries.

694
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,920
Get them to take everything

695
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,760
back tomorrow.

696
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,719
Okay.

697
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,560
Well,

698
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,920
what do we do to Chen Fei'er?

699
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
She's checked in.

700
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,320
It's not like she'll leave

701
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,159
in one or two days.

702
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,440
She said

703
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,520
she has the evidence
against Zhao Mingxuan,

704
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,880
but she's not telling us what it is.

705
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,720
I

706
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,280
will try to ask her.

707
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,600
No need to do anything.

708
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
Since she wants to stay in Jifeng,

709
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,520
just treat her

710
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,680
as a normal guest.

711
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,080
Okay.

712
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,040
But let me say this.

713
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,880
You need to understand Xiaoran.

714
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,200
If it's not for Chen Fei'er's wedding

715
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,840
and all

716
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,960
the things happened after that,

717
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,160
you two wouldn't have

718
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
come to this stage.

719
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,840
When someone's been hurt once,

720
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,840
she'll become very sensitive.

721
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,160
What are you looking at?

722
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,720
This one.

723
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,040
Chen Fei'er.

724
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,680
She checked in yesterday.

725
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,360
Don't you think this name

726
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,400
sounds familiar?

727
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,120
Also,

728
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,200
it was Mr. Lin who brought her here

729
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,320
yesterday.

730
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,360
Don't simply look into
the guest's privacy.

731
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,040
I remember now.

732
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,040
Deju's

733
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,080
wedding of the century. She...

734
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,280
You're saying she's that...

735
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,400
The Princess of Yunduan who is known

736
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,440
as being rejected in the wedding.

737
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,000
Miss Chen, good morning.

738
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
Did you rest well last night?

739
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,960
Wusu and Hupu

740
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,280
are really different.

741
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,400
A vice president of

742
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,120
Black Pine Needle hotel

743
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,120
is gossiping with his staff.

744
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm sorry.

745
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm sorry, Miss Chen.

746
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,840
Where's Mr. Xiao?

747
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,360
Which room is he staying in?

748
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,480
Since you're gossiping about me,

749
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
you should know that

750
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,720
Xiao Shangqi punched the groom

751
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,520
in the wedding

752
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,960
and took me away.

753
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,920
I don't have to say more

754
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,440
about my relationship with him.

755
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,600
Mr. Xiao's not staying in the hotel.

756
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,240
He's rented a house outside.

757
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,920
He's not staying in the hotel?

758
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,840
Give me his address.

759
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,160
Miss Chen,

760
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:50,960
look,

761
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,960
Mr. Xiao has just been discharged.

762
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,320
He's resting at home.

763
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,200
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

764
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,480
You can tell me

765
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,880
if you need anything.

766
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,960
Mo,

767
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,320
inform everyone

768
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,120
not to look for

769
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,920
Mr. Xiao.

770
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,520
Okay.

771
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,840
I'll inform everyone now.

772
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,720
Mr. Lin.

773
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,120
What are you trying to do?

774
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,720
I'm fully in charge

775
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,760
of Jifeng Hotel.

776
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,280
We don't have to trouble Mr. Xiao.

777
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,200
Shangqi and I

778
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
will be talking about private matters.

779
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
What can you be in charge of?

780
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,360
Is it about Zhao Mingxuan?

781
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,560
I can be fully in charge of that, too.

782
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
Mr. Xiao needs to be resting at home.

783
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,480
If he wants to see you,

784
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,920
he'll contact you.

785
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,920
Have you taken your breakfast?

786
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,120
Jifeng's breakfast

787
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,920
has got many varieties.

788
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,320
Do you want to try it out?

789
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,400
No need.

790
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm full from talking.

791
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,880
How do you feel today?

792
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,320
Did you eat on time?

793
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,920
Yes.

794
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,440
Look at you now.

795
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,040
You just got recovered

796
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,480
and you're not resting.

797
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,160
You keep eating food

798
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,120
that's not nutritious.

799
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,120
Is there no progress?

800
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,320
I'm about to go to Wusu's
concrete batching plant

801
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,920
and the nearby concrete plant

802
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,600
to take a look.

803
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,360
Maybe there'll be some bribery evidence

804
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,760
when they were constructing Qingshan.

805
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,160
Won't you ask about

806
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,000
what Chen Fei'er did

807
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
in Jifeng in the past two days?

808
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,280
Stop her from coming here.

809
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,480
I don't want to see her.

810
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,040
She kept asking about you.

811
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,800
She even tried to convince us

812
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,600
that your relationship

813
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
with her is close.

814
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,240
I think

815
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,880
she's holding all the evidence

816
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,680
to show you her contribution.

817
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,040
Why not you use the beauty trick?

818
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
It will help.

819
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,280
I don't want to owe her anything.

820
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,480
I don't want to see her.

821
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
I don't want to have anything

822
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,320
to do with her.

823
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,320
Okay.

824
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,120
You're not bowing down
to authority, wealth,

825
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,880
and beauty.

826
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,560
What if

827
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,960
you do this

828
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,000
and you get sick,

829
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
but He Xiaoran doesn't want

830
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,160
to be with you?

831
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,920
I couldn't reach her lately.

832
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,840
Okay, leave me alone.

833
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,080
Get back to work.

834
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,880
I don't need an hourly worker here.

835
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,800
Go now.

836
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,080
You lock yourself at home

837
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,240
and check the information day and night.

838
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,400
You'll only get more confused.

839
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,320
Actually, I have some work

840
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,480
that suits you well.

841
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,720
Mr. Lin,

842
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
you're arranging some work for me?

843
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,520
I dare not.

844
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,720
But, as the boss,

845
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
you should be thoughtful
about your staff,

846
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,640
right?

847
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm all alone

848
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,800
in handling Jifeng.

849
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,200
Just share the burden with me.

850
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,840
Okay, stop checking.

851
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,000
Run the errand for me.

852
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,760
I'll cook a nice meal for human

853
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,720
for you.

854
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,720
Enough.

855
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Where am I going?

856
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,480
Xiaoran,

857
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,760
are you busy in the afternoon?

858
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,960
No. Is there any news to cover?

859
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,600
No. Mr. Ma

860
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,840
told me that

861
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,360
he wants you to record

862
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,360
an advertisement.

863
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,520
Me?

864
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,320
Yes.

865
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
He said this client

866
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,000
was a loyal audience, a loyal fan

867
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,520
of Dajiabang.

868
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,000
He wants to hear your voice.

869
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,320
Just do him a favour

870
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,480
and earn some extra money.

871
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,680
Okay.

872
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,360
Since he's Dajiabang's audience,

873
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,440
I'll surely do him this favour.

874
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,200
That's it.

875
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,200
I'll just tell him.

876
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,520
Miss Liu.

877
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,840
It's been a while.

878
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,280
Xiaoran.

879
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,280
Mr. Ma asked me to come here

880
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,040
to record the advertisement.

881
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,280
Mr. Xiao is already here.

882
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,480
You do have a good partnership.

883
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,680
The program was ended,

884
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,600
but you have the chance

885
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,400
to record the advertisement together.

886
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,080
Right, Mr. Xiao?

887
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,680
It's Jifeng's advertisement?

888
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,720
We're counting on you, Miss He.

889
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,240
Mr. Xiao, don't you have

890
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,280
many things to do?

891
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,400
Why are you free to

892
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,920
come and supervise
a small advertisement?

893
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,040
I've been discharged.

894
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,120
I'm just resting.

895
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,720
So, I'm rather free.

896
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,200
But, my body

897
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
is fine now.

898
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,560
Let's begin then.

899
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,760
Miss Chen,

900
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,880
I really can't tell you.

901
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,160
Okay,

902
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,760
no need to tell me

903
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,880
where Mr. Xiao is staying.

904
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,240
Just tell me

905
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,760
what he did in Wusu.

906
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,840
Nurse.

907
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,680
Can you do me a favour?

908
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,560
What's wrong, Madam Wang?

909
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
I can't remember

910
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,800
which ward I'm staying in.

911
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
I can't remember

912
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,040
if it's the second or the third area.

913
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,600
I've forgotten.

914
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,360
Don't worry, Madam Wang.

915
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,120
I'll bring you back there.

916
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,440
Thank you.

917
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,280
Don't worry.

918
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,160
Don't worry, miss.

919
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:23,800
Mr. Sun.

920
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,480
Don't worry about her.

921
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,600
I have her room card.

922
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,160
I'll bring her back there.

923
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

924
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,360
Thank you.

925
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,600
Look at how confused I am.

926
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,440
I can't remember anything.

927
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,880
Mr. Sun,

928
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,280
didn't you

929
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,640
go to Mr. Xiao's place today?

930
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,640
Why are you back so soon?

931
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,040
You remember this well.

932
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,400
I went to Mr. Xiao's place

933
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,720
last week.

934
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,280
Let's go. Be careful.

935
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,640
Wasn't it today?

936
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,840
No way.

937
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,800
Look at how confused I am.
