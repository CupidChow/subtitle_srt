The few hundred-yuan difference

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
of our place compared to Qingshan

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
was paid off by Mr. Xiao.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,400
Okay, I have another meeting.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
I just wanted to spend some money
to clear the home early.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,320
I understand.

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
Lizhen's nurse didn't make a mistake.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,240
At least it means the place that
they settle down is

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,000
fine.

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,400
Mr. Sun's myocardial infarction
was an accident.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,640
Now, we need to find Mr. Pan

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,920
and find out

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
who instructed him to do so.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,320
Where are you going?

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,960
Qingshan.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I want to ask those

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,520
who are close to Mr. Sun

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,120
if anyone knows

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
where his nephew is.

36
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,922
(Qingshan Nursing Home)

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,320
Do you know where
his nephew is staying?

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Why are you looking for him?

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
Are you taking a revenge?

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,720
Mr. Wan,

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
do you have his nephew's

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
contact number?

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,720
No.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,320
Can you think about it?

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,000
I really don't have it.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,040
Mr. Luo.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,200
Well,

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,000
do you know where Mr. Sun is?

50
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,760
Since he's been discharged

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,920
and he doesn't want to see you,

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,320
he must have his reasons.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,080
How did it go?

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,240
You're looking for him diligently.

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,200
Any news?

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,520
They think that

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm a bad journalist.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,320
I didn't get any information from them.

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,000
What about you?

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
When Mr. Wang was still around,

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,720
there would be a monthly

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
family day event.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,360
The photos and the reports

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
would be recorded.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
After his son took over,

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,440
the event stopped

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
as well as the information.

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
If we can find that,

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,280
maybe there will be

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,160
some useful information.

71
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,840
Are you not feeling cold?

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,360
You didn't even close the window.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,640
It can't be closed.

74
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
(NO.3 Blue Dream)
(You won't get the formula)

75
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
(because I made that only for)

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,680
(He Xiaoran.)

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
and Indian sandalwood.

The fragrance that Sui Mingwei

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,920
made for you

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,680
is the essence oil

83
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
for sleeping purpose.

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,360
You haven't been sleeping well?

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Why didn't I know about that?

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,520
What?

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Do you think I'm having

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,480
insomnia

89
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
after breaking up with you?

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm just too busy with work.

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
I didn't rest well.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,080
Don't think too much.

93
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,000
It has nothing to do with you.

94
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,000
That's great.

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,240
What are you doing?

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,920
Let me see.

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,680
(Get someone to send an electric heater)

99
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,440
(to the data room.)

100
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,080
Mr. Lin,

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,040
you're in a good mood today.

102
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,960
If someone does well

103
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
in his work,

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
he'll be complimented as

105
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
being capable.

106
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,480
However, if a relationship
has been restored,

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,960
it's like watching a miracle.

108
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,440
The most beautiful thing in the world

109
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,560
is love.

110
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,440
How did you get this feeling

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,280
from the browsing data?

112
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,760
I was about to look for you.

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,240
Get an electric heater ready

114
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,040
and send to the data room.

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,560
Okay,

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
right away.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Mr. Xiao.

118
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,320
Xiaoran.

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
The electric heater is here.

120
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,880
Okay.

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Thank you.

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,800
You're welcome.

123
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,760
Well, Mr. Xiao,

124
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
the preparatory group needs you

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
to sign the budget.

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Go ahead.

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm fine here.

128
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
I can help Xiaoran.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
It's just the information
of the family day, right?

130
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay.

131
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,599
Xiaoran, I'll look at this side.

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,880
Xiaoran.

133
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Actually, Mr. Xiao

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,280
cares about you a lot.

135
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,680
Although he didn't say that,

136
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,400
we all know it by heart.

137
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,120
You know what?

138
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
When the news went wrong that day,

139
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,680
Mr. Xiao didn't care

140
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
about the public relation
department's objection

141
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,320
and explained for you

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,320
at once,

143
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,040
to clarify that you have nothing
to do with Qingshan.

144
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,040
Do you know how important

145
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,880
the Qingshan project is

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
to Mr. Xiao?

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
If Qingshan is gone,

148
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,880
Jifeng will be gone as well.

149
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,280
Why?

150
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,440
Mr. Xiao mortgaged Jifeng

151
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
to get the fund

152
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
to rebuild Qingshan.

153
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,760
Lately, they always talk about
this is the last battle

154
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,560
in the meeting.

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
Now, this happened.

156
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,520
Mr. Xiao and the preparatory group

157
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,440
are working day and night.

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,960
Why did he have to mortgage it?

159
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Yunlan is not giving him money?

160
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Mr. Xiao left Yunlan.

161
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,720
I don't know about the details.

162
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,120
Okay.

163
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,320
Go take a look.

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay, no problem.

165
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
Take a look at this.

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,320
Check this.

167
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,360
Check this as well.

168
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,120
Mr. Xiao, our current plan

169
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,000
is this.

170
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Amend the statute.

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,440
Make no mistake.

172
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
Amend all

173
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,080
the statutes.

174
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,640
Okay.

175
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,960
Revise it a bit.

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Okay.

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,080
How did it go?

178
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,440
Are you satisfied?

179
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,680
Listen.

180
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,360
I spent a lot

181
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,880
and topped up some money

182
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,360
to buy this for you.

183
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,320
From what I know,

184
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,080
you won't do any business

185
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
that will cause you a loss.

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Don't tease your mother.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll let things slide

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,520
as you messed Mr. Xiao up.

189
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,600
Go on. What's the point?

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,080
Qingshan

191
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
is now in a mess.

192
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
So,

193
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
we need to send them help

194
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
and win their hearts

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
to get the deal

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,720
from them,

197
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,240
right?

198
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Qingshan has been scolded so badly.

199
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you really want to
collaborate with him?

200
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
You rascal.

201
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,640
I'm not trying to scold you,

202
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,200
but what did I teach you?

203
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
We need to have foresight
in doing business.

204
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
Look 10 steps ahead
before taking one step.

205
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
Why don't you understand?

206
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,520
Yes,

207
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,560
he's been

208
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,280
kicked out of the family.

209
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
But sooner or later,

210
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
he will make a comeback.

211
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,360
If we get closer

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,560
to him now,

213
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,840
we'll surely earn money in the future.

214
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,000
What do you mean?

215
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Kicked out of the family?

216
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:54,567
(Qingshan Nursing Home)

217
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,080
Sir,

218
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
I want to order six cups of latte.

219
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
I want one of them to be skimmed milk.

220
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,280
And one more shot.

221
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,760
You and

222
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,960
Qingshan's boss have

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,840
the same taste.

224
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,720
He drinks like this, too.

225
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,400
I didn't have

226
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,720
skimmed milk at first.

227
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
I bought it for him.

228
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,120
I even asked him this.

229
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,720
"You're not fat.

230
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
Why are you drinking skimmed milk?"

231
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,080
He said

232
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,520
his girlfriend taught him this.

233
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,280
He's used to it already.

234
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,600
Mr. Zhao, how may I help you?

235
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,440
I've heard about Qingshan.

236
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm just here to see

237
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,840
if you need any help.

238
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,840
Mr. Zhao, you have a lot of connections

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,160
and news came to you quickly.

240
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,080
Qi.

241
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,520
Your father has passed away.

242
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,440
Your brother even got rid of you.

243
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,400
If it was someone else,

244
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,160
he could be living a loser life

245
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
and hiding somewhere.

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,960
I didn't know you're so determined.

247
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,160
You're still doing business.

248
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,040
Isn't this Miss He?

249
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
I'm sorry

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,440
to have got you involved.

251
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,760
But if you continue to

252
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,080
stay by his side,

253
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,600
most probably

254
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
this kind of accident

255
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,960
will happen to you again.

256
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,120
I dare you.

257
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,640
I dare not.

258
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

259
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,080
I dare not do anything.

260
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,520
But, Qi,

261
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
I want you to know

262
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,520
accidents happen

263
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
without acknowledging you.

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,120
I'll return

265
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,800
what you said back to you.

266
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,320
Well,

267
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Xian and Fei'er

268
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
are very obedient.

269
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
If you've figured it out one day,

270
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,840
I'll keep a position for you.

271
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm leaving.

272
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,800
Mr. Xiao...

273
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
When did it happen?

274
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,720
A few days after you left Hupu.

275
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,960
All the things happened

277
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,480
on those few days together.

278
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,360
Yunlan, Deju,

279
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,880
and funeral.

280
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,440
It was a mess.

281
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,800
I didn't know how to tell you.

282
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,640
Even if I said it,

283
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,160
it would've sounded like an excuse.

284
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,400
No one will take this

285
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,800
as an excuse.

286
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,320
I remember you told me that

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
he was not feeling well.

288
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,160
I didn't know...

289
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
He was about to recover.

290
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,480
That day,

291
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,520
the doctor said he had

292
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,960
acute heart failure.

293
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
It happened suddenly.

294
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
They weren't able to rescue him.

295
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
But I know

296
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Zhao Mingxuan did that.

297
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,760
Why did he...

298
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
Does Xian know about this?

299
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,880
It's been a while.

300
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,480
What?

301
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,120
Since we last talked like this,

302
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,120
like normal conversation.

303
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,600
I've said so much

304
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,880
that I shouldn't have told you.

305
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,160
You think

306
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,800
you shouldn't have told me this?

307
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,120
Xiaoran.

308
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,480
Now, Qingshan

309
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
is the battlefield between
me and Zhao Mingxuan.

310
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
I don't want to get you involved.

311
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
But, I'm already here.

312
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Once you've found the truth,

313
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,240
go back and be a journalist.

314
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,280
Don't come near this place anymore.

315
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,879
What's coming

316
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
is going to be worse.

317
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,080
The legs are mine.

318
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,600
No one can stop me

319
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,000
from going anymore.

320
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,879
Don't you know that

321
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,440
the worse the place is,

322
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,360
the more the journalists should monitor?

323
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
Be it you or Zhao Mingxuan,

324
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,520
if I see

325
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,960
you've committed crime,

326
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,240
I'll not go easy on you.

327
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,520
Are you saying that when He Xiaoran

328
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,120
was waiting for Xiao Shangqi,

329
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,520
his father passed away?

330
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
So, it's not that he didn't come back,

331
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,840
he just can't come back.

332
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
It's all excuses.

333
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Why can't he come back?

334
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,640
Can't he make a call

335
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,600
or send a WeChat message?

336
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
He didn't say anything until now.

337
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,760
What's that all about?

338
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,280
I think in his world,

339
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
there's no He Xiaoran.

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
Since you think it's nothing,

341
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,000
why did you

342
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,080
come here in a rush?

343
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,040
Since he doesn't need her

344
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
and she's not on his list,

345
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,560
why did he come back now

346
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,760
and make things tough for her?

347
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Do you think if I tell

348
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Xiaoran the truth,

349
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,960
she'll insist on

350
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,280
breaking up with him?

351
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,920
Sui Mingwei,

352
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,440
I wanted to tell you earlier.

353
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,840
Don't you think

354
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,080
your intention is too obvious?

355
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
Let's not talk about the truth.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,600
When Xiaoran is back later,

357
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
what are you going to tell her?

358
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,760
Are you going to ask her

359
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,120
why when you called her,

360
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,800
it's Xiao Shangqi who picked it up?

361
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,640
Or it's so late now,

362
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,360
where has she been?

363
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,800
Is she being with him?

364
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,360
Come on.

365
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,720
He Xiaoran was a host
for a relationship program.

366
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,160
She will find out

367
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,840
no matter how hard

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
you're trying to hide.

369
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,120
If she's asking you back now,

370
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
do you still want to go along
and confess to her?

371
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,080
What if she

372
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,000
rejects you again?

373
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,240
I know you've been

374
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
showing concern to her lately.

375
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,200
So, I didn't say

376
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,040
much to you.

377
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
But, are you going to

378
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,240
keep doing this?

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,360
If you managed to hide it,

380
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,640
you'd feel sad.

381
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,040
If you didn't manage to hide,

382
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,320
I can only say that

383
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,080
you'd have a lot more to suffer.

384
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,280
Mr. Xiao, I've got a car ready.

385
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,600
Do you want to go home?

386
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll stay in Jifeng.

387
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,520
Didn't you go home lately?

388
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,840
It's okay.

389
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Since Jifeng is in the city,

390
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,120
why not

391
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,080
you two go back together?

392
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,440
No need.

393
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,360
I've got a taxi.

394
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,000
Mr. Xiao, are you going back now?

395
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I've asked about the electricity card.

396
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,560
You don't have to get another one.

397
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,920
Just call the power supply bureau,

398
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
ask for the number

399
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,880
pay for it, and it will do.

400
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,680
The electricity card is lost?

401
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,760
Did you look for it?

402
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,000
It should be in the chest of drawers.

403
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,520
Where?

404
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
There are all sorts of cards

405
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,680
in the blue bag.

406
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,840
I'll go back and check.

407
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,840
I think it's there.

408
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,320
Just look for it in the chest.

409
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
The taxi is here. See you.

410
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,320
Why do I think that you two

411
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,760
are getting back together?

412
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,720
You're home.

413
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,120
Sui was here?

414
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,280
He left.

415
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,440
- I...
- I...

416
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,680
Well, go ahead.

417
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,800
Go ahead.

418
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,760
Sui just got to know something

419
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,160
about Xiao Shangqi.

420
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
He asked me to tell you this.

421
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,560
Xiao Shangqi didn't

422
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
get to come back from Hupu

423
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,680
because...

424
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,920
It's because his father has passed away.

425
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,520
He was kicked out of the company.

426
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,080
I wanted to tell you this, too.

427
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
You've found out?

428
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,280
Tell me.

429
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,160
What are you thinking?

430
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,400
If I have to say this,

431
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,840
it's too late.

432
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,160
His toughest days

433
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,800
have gone.

434
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Even the word of comfort

435
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,400
is meaningless now.

436
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
We want to find someone to rely on

437
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,200
when we're in trouble,

438
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,880
but he stayed away from you.

439
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,120
His change is great.

440
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,360
But I think he didn't change,

441
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,920
it's the environment.

442
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
Are you feeling bad for him?

443
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,520
Why?

444
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
He chose to

445
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,360
break up with me.

446
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,920
Do you still love him?

447
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:55,121
(Electricity card)

448
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,360
We've checked everything.

449
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,280
We have all the information

450
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
except for Mr. Sun's.

451
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Why is the window opened again?

452
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,400
The data room's window
is always like that.

453
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,400
It can't be closed.

454
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,120
It really can't be closed.

455
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,040
(Profile)
Sun Zhengyi.

456
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,760
This is the one.

457
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
His report

458
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,040
is neat compared to others'.

459
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,840
This page is so long.

460
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,440
This is the first time he saw

461
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,680
his nephew's wife.

462
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,680
He's written so much.

463
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,120
Hello.

464
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,440
I've found the clue.

465
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,240
I went to Mrs. Pan's workplace

466
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,640
and found out where they're staying.

467
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
But the neighbor said

468
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,040
they've moved to a new place.

469
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,520
They always brag on

470
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,720
how nice
the new neighborhood is.

471
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,280
So, this is

472
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Mr. Pan's new house?

473
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
(Miss He.)

474
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,640
(Look.)

475
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,720
(Pipi is recovering well.)

476
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,880
(Thank you for)

477
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,360
(exposing that terrible clinic.)

478
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,200
(Otherwise,)

479
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,120
(more animals will get hurt.)

480
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,440
(The management takes this matter)

481
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:32,920
(seriously.)

482
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,640
(The entire neighborhood)

483
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,760
(increased the facility)

484
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,800
(for the persons with disabilities.)

485
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,040
(Thank you, Miss He.)

486
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,720
You worked hard on this.

487
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Let's go.

488
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
Let's buy a mango cake.

489
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,040
When she's troubled,

490
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,760
let her

491
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,800
eat something sweet.

492
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,200
Also,

493
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,920
you told me that you have

494
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,800
finished the laundry detergent at home.

495
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,400
I'll buy some for you.

496
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,200
What's the brand that you're using?

497
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,000
It's quite fragrant.

498
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,560
When are you going to stop contributing?

499
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,400
When she falls in love with you?

500
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
What are you talking about?

501
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,040
When I'm sick of it,

502
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll let go.

503
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,720
So pathetic.

504
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,440
Just like

505
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,160
mango is your least favorite,

506
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,320
but you still need to

507
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,120
buy a mango cake.

508
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,240
Get lost.

509
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,240
Let's go after eating.

510
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,920
Enjoy yourself.

511
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,120
It seems to be Mr. Pan's car.

512
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,880
Let's go.

513
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,400
Dear.

514
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,360
Be careful.

515
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,120
Mr. Pan.

516
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,600
No.

517
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,200
How did you get here?

518
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,880
Mr. Pan.

519
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,680
I thought we've reached an agreement
to settle things,

520
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,920
why did you spread the rumors?

521
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,560
What are you talking about?

522
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:06,960
You...

523
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,240
You took the rebate.

524
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,920
And you.

525
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,560
Who knows

526
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,280
if you killed a man

527
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,720
to save RMB 500

528
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,280
monthly?

529
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
Let me tell you.

530
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,080
You two are in this together.

531
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm doing justice.

532
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,560
I want to expose you two.

533
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,400
I moved here so that

534
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,720
you won't come and take a revenge.

535
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,880
Look.

536
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,120
You've even come here.

537
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,960
Are you going to stop or not?

538
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,680
Mr. Pan,

539
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,800
let me be frank.

540
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,600
Did someone instruct you to do this

541
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,720
and promise to give you
something in return?

542
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,880
No way.

543
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,000
The house here is around
RMB 20,000 per square meter.

544
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,320
The monthly rent here is
around RMB 8,000.

545
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,120
Where did you get the money?

546
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,920
My nephew got the bonus

547
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,440
as the best employee.

548
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,600
Do you understand?

549
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,280
He's resigned from his workplace.

550
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,200
A day before the report was made.

551
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,480
You've resigned?

552
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I...

553
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,560
I have money.

554
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,440
Who are you to ask me
where I got the money?

555
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:55,880
I...

556
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,440
Get lost!

557
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,520
Get lost.

558
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,280
Mr. Pan,

559
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,600
I know you might have been

560
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,440
used by someone.

561
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,160
But when everything comes out,

562
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
you'll have to pay the price

563
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,320
for what you've done.

564
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,640
Instead of waiting until then,

565
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,200
why not

566
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,320
come with us and clarify the things?

567
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,440
I know you're smart.

568
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,720
Don't do something that
you'll regret later.

569
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,360
Think about it.

570
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,560
Did you really take
the money from others?

571
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:35,880
Hello.

572
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

573
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,200
We didn't get

574
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,160
to discharge everyone.

575
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,240
Mr. Wang wanted us to

576
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,360
get another disclaimer.

577
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,960
Get him to sign it.

578
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,120
Okay.

579
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,800
You insisted on discharging them today.

580
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,560
Does it have anything
to do with Mr. Xiao?

581
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,960
After my father passed away,

582
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,640
he left behind

583
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,120
an uncompleted contract of assignment

584
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,320
which is Qingshan.

585
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,680
80% of the clauses

586
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
were listed.

587
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
The date was decided by him as well?

588
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Did you take over Qingshan

589
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,360
to fulfill

590
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,600
his wish?

591
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,120
It's more than that.

592
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,760
Qingshan was Deju's property,

593
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,480
but it was sold at a low price.

594
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,080
It's suspicious.

595
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,000
My father did it so secretly.

596
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,880
After Zhao Mingxuan got the news,

597
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,720
he came to me right away

598
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,040
and went against me at all cost.

599
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,880
Mr. Pan

600
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,440
and Mr. Wang

601
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
should be instructed by him.

602
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,600
He did that

603
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,200
to stop me from

604
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,240
buying and transforming Qingshan.

605
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,960
I think

606
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,360
there are some secrets unknown.

607
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,240
But I have yet to find out.

608
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,080
I can only go along with it.

609
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,200
If you clarified

610
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,720
that Qingshan's not yours,

611
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,080
and you didn't do that to protect me,

612
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,840
maybe you could've

613
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,160
discharged them
according to the agreement.

614
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,400
Are you concerned about me?

615
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
I just don't want to owe you anything.

616
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,200
Xiaoran.

617
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,160
Thank you.

618
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,160
Is it hard

619
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,280
to tell me

620
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,960
what's in your heart?

621
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,600
I'm just thinking.

622
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,680
If this conversation

623
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
came earlier,

624
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,320
it'd be great.

625
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,480
What are you doing here?

626
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,160
Xiaoran.

627
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,520
Let's go home.

628
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,120
What are you doing?

629
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,080
It's the home theatre night.

630
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
What movie are we watching?

631
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,280
A blockbuster.

632
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,360
Sit down here.

633
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,400
Sui bought a mango cake

634
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,080
for you.

635
00:31:58,122 --> 00:31:59,242
(Mailroom)

636
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,200
Hello.

637
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,560
Miss He,

638
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Mr. Sun is looking for you.

639
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,840
Make it quick.

640
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,080
Okay.

641
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Who are you talking about?

642
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,520
Mr. Sun from Qingshan Nursing Home.

643
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
Ask him to wait for me.

644
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,760
Where are you going?

645
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,320
Carry on. I need to go out.

646
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,760
No, where are you going?

647
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,000
(Miss He.)

648
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:25,760
(Look.)

649
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,840
(Pipi is recovering well.)

650
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,800
(Thank you for)

651
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,640
(exposing the terrible clinic.)

652
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,240
(Otherwise, more animals will)

653
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,160
(get hurt.)

654
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:37,840
Miss He.

655
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,240
Mr. Sun.

656
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,320
Miss He.

657
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,920
This old man

658
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,960
insisted on looking for you.

659
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,440
I told him that you're suspended.

660
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,520
He's been waiting for you here.

661
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
I had to call you.

662
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,520
Thank you.

663
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,600
My nephew took away

664
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,640
my mobile phone

665
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,560
and we moved out overnight.

666
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,280
I sensed that something

667
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,920
might happen.

668
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,080
But, you think about it.

669
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
I can leave the nursing home

670
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,280
and live with my nephew

671
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,080
for the later part of my life.

672
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,520
I'd rather be muddled

673
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,080
since everything seemed to be

674
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,040
too good for me.

675
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,960
So, I didn't say anything

676
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,320
until you found us.

677
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,080
Is Mr. Pan

678
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,400
willing to clarify things with us?

679
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,480
Miss He,

680
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,280
can I be the one

681
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,120
who reported it?

682
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,960
My nephew needs to take care
of his wife and baby.

683
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,040
If things are coming out,

684
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,160
can you

685
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,680
tell them that I made the false report?

686
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
I'll take

687
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,560
all the consequences.

688
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,560
I'm old already.

689
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I've lived enough.

690
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,360
Mr. Sun,

691
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
I was framed and suspended.

692
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,120
Why does it sound like

693
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,240
you're being threatened?

694
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,760
If you disagree,

695
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,800
I'll look for Mr. Xiao.

696
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,480
It's not about that.

697
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
Listen to me...

698
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,800
If you want to help your nephew,

699
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,199
you shouldn't beg anyone.

700
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,719
You have to do it yourself.

701
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,719
How did it go?

702
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,719
I've sent someone to investigate it.

703
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,279
Mr. Sun has taken a snapshot

704
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,279
of Mr. Pan's conversation with that guy.

705
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,279
The person should be

706
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,000
the mastermind.

707
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,239
Mr. Xiao,

708
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:39,600
we've found out that

709
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,560
he's one of the guys who

710
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:41,279
spread

711
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,640
the business and media collusion.

712
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,920
Look for them.

713
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,440
I'll get the legal department with me.

714
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,199
Don't forget

715
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,400
we've promised Mr. Sun

716
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
that we'll give Mr. Pan a chance

717
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,800
after we find the truth.

718
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Xiaoran,

719
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,000
he has caused the project
in Qingshan to stop

720
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
and got you suspended.

721
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
I think we don't have to go easy on

722
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,640
this kind of person

723
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,320
who

724
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,400
is extremely selfish.

725
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,480
Everyone would make a mistake.

726
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,360
To me,

727
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,400
his mistake is

728
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,040
not unforgivable.

729
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,640
What kind of mistake

730
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,560
is unforgivable?

731
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,800
(The nursing home's
business and media collusion)

732
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,920
(has got the latest progress.)

740

(to gain some attention,)

741
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,800
(so I did it without thinking twice.)

742
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,960
(I apologize to)

743
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,600
(Qingshan Nursing Home)

744
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,280
(and the journalist involved)

745
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,680
(here.)

746
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,760
(I'm sorry.)

(any legal responsibilities.)

749
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,360
Look at him.

750
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
He apologized so quickly.

751
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,960
He's just a shield.

752
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:55,805
(News has no boundary)

753
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,800
Mr. Zhang.

754
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,600
Miss Zhou.

755
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,480
This is how the entire matter

756
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,240
went.

757
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,040
Mr. Pan has

758
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,320
clarified about this matter.

759
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,120
When will my position be reinstated?

760
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,600
Are you not going to

761
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,040
pursue his accountability?

762
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,680
He's apologized to me.

763
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,840
Also, because of Mr. Sun

764
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,800
and the baby,

765
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm willing to forgive him.

766
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,960
After this incident,

767
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,160
you must remember.

768
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,360
As an investigative journalist,

769
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,600
you have too many reasons

770
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,400
to be attacked.

771
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,680
Don't let others catch your flaw.

772
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,360
I'll take note from now on.

773
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,000
But if I'm scared to do anything

774
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,160
just because

775
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,120
I don't want my flaws to be seen,

776
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,960
how can we exercise

777
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,000
news righteousness?

778
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,560
This is the good journalist
that you've trained.

779
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Okay, come to work tomorrow.

780
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,080
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

781
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,920
How can you

782
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,800
mess this trivial matter up?

783
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,920
Luckily, I've prepared early.

784
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,080
What did Mr. Wang say?

785
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,200
He just wants to have more money

786
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,120
to pay the compensation to Xiao Shangqi.

787
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
He's negotiating with us.

788
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,680
Negotiating?

789
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
Find some people to

790
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,520
speak to him nicely.

791
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
I'm prohibited from
collaborating with Qingshan?

792
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:28,960
Yes.

793
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,840
Damang Mountain Chamber of Commerce
has sent us the memorandum.

794
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,600
If we supply to
Qingshan and Jifeng,

795
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,920
we'll lose the chance to

796
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,520
work with all their hotels and shops

797
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
permanently.

798
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,440
Mr. Xiao will be in trouble then.

799
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,440
Isn't he coming from Yunlan in Hupu?

800
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,240
Yes.

801
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,280
I heard that he was kicked out.

802
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,440
I've been doing business

803
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,760
in Wusu for many years.

804
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,680
This is the first time
I'm being threatened like this.

805
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,000
I, Fan Xixi, am not willing to be

806
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,120
controlled by others.

807
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,960
What can you do?

808
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,080
What can I do?

809
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
I'll go against them.

810
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,080
Now,

811
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,640
we'll need someone

812
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,280
to stand up as the local supplier

813
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,040
from Wusu.

814
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,280
They're not following our rules

815
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,960
and trying to instruct us what to do.

816
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,920
They're not playing by the rules.

817
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:30,920
Let's go.

818
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,280
Have you thought of what to eat?

819
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm buying you a meal to celebrate
that my position has been reinstated.

820
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,800
Save the money.

821
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,280
We'll eat out today

822
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,200
for free.

823
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,880
My mother asked me out for a nice meal.

824
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,800
I told her I had
an appointment with you two.

825
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,560
So, she asked you two to come along.

826
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,760
Go ahead then.

827
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,440
Next time...

828
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,640
Let's go together. Come on.

829
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Let's go together.

830
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,240
Don't mind it.

831
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Xixi always buys us

832
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,600
a nice meal, right?

833
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,600
Yes. Let's go.

834
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,360
Let's go.

835
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,600
Don't worry. It's okay.

836
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,000
Come on.

837
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,880
We're a family.

838
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,560
How's it, Mr. Xiao?

839
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,880
Anything that you fancy?

840
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,480
Most of the brands here

841
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,760
are some best quality local brands.

842
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,880
It's beautiful,

843
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,840
and functional.

844
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,040
Most importantly,

845
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,520
it has a good rating online.

846
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,560
I've used this before.

847
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,560
It's not bad.

848
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,360
It suits our positioning very well.

849
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,680
That's great.

850
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,600
I told you.

851
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,680
There's nothing in Wusu that

852
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,760
I can't handle.

853
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
Damang Mountain Chamber of Commerce's

854
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,320
method

855
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,280
is despicable.

856
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,000
Don't worry.

857
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,440
Look for me at once

858
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,640
whenever you need anything.

859
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,640
Thank you.

860
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,560
Mother.

861
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,240
You're here.

862
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,440
Why is he here?

863
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,680
What are you talking about?

864
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,960
Mr. Xiao

865
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,840
is my VIP guest.

866
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,560
Furthermore,

867
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,760
isn't it great

868
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,400
for you young people

869
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,320
to hang out together?

870
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,520
This is...

871
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,120
Hello, Mrs. Sui.

872
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,000
Hello.

873
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,600
Mother,

874
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,280
this is the person
I always mentioned to you,

875
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,000
Xiaoran.

876
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
You're Xiaoran?

877
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,640
Wei always

878
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,200
talks about you.

879
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,320
I've finally met you today.

880
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,920
Hui,

881
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,840
are you two staying together?

882
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,240
Yes.

883
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,480
Thank you

884
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,680
for taking care of Hui.

885
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,080
No,

886
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,000
we take care of each other.

887
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,360
What a coincidence.

888
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,520
You know each other?

889
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,880
We're familiar with each other.

890
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,680
I think you're just faking it.

891
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,040
Xiaoran,

892
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,800
let's take a seat.

893
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,640
Thank you.

894
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,960
Here, Mr. Xiao.

895
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,680
Please take a seat.

896
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,560
Okay.

897
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,440
I like

898
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
to hang out

899
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,160
with young people

900
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,280
the most.

901
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,600
Xiaoran.

902
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,200
Actually, I wanted

903
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,880
to meet you earlier.

904
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,400
You're from Hupu.

905
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,360
You're not familiar with the place
and the people here.

906
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,640
Look for me

907
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,920
if you need anything.

908
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,520
Thank you, Mrs. Sui.

909
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,480
Don't call me Mrs. Sui.

910
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,320
Call me Xixi.

911
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,080
We all call her Xixi.

912
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,600
Great.

913
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,600
Xixi.

914
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,560
Actually, it's fine.

915
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,520
I've been staying in Wusu

916
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,720
for many years now.

917
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,920
I'm familiar with this place.

918
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,560
It's okay.

919
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,040
My family believes that

920
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,000
more friends mean more connections.

921
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,240
In the future, Xixi

922
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,240
will be the path for you. Cheers.

923
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,920
Thank you.

924
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,000
Mr. Xiao.

925
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,720
Let me tell you.

926
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,000
In business,

927
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,920
losing something might

928
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,800
bring you something better.

929
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,400
Yes.

930
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,400
I think we don't need

931
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,640
the usual suppliers

932
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,040
at all.

933
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,880
We can localize it

934
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,000
and do great.

935
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,080
Well said.

936
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,400
In the future,

937
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,320
my son will be involved

938
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,720
in our future collaboration.

939
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,880
Okay.

940
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
No need.

941
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,680
I don't need it.

942
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,000
What are you talking about?

943
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,320
My son

944
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,520
is not humble at all.

945
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,880
However,

946
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,560
in this small place,

947
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,920
it's easy to become outstanding

948
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,240
in doing something.

949
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,320
Then we'd get proud easily.

950
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,320
But,

951
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,080
he's got a lot of certificates.

952
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,760
Just like

953
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,560
swimming,

954
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,400
football

955
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,480
and ice hockey.

956
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,600
Well,

957
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
especially basketball.

958
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,320
He plays really well.

959
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,240
He has a lot of girl fans.

960
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,280
Do you know that, Xiaoran?

961
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,280
You're hiding well.

962
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,880
He looks handsome
when he plays basketball.

963
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,240
He told me that
you like to exercise, too.

964
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,080
There's a basketball court out there.

965
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,800
Go and try it out

966
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,880
after eating.

967
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,440
No, I'm not good at it.

968
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,280
It's not good to play basketball
after eating.

969
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,280
It's not good for the stomach.

970
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,400
Mr. Xiao,

971
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,080
do you want to try it out?

972
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,920
Xiao Shangqi knows how
to play basketball?

973
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,960
I haven't seen him play
after graduation.

974
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,000
Not sure of what happened

975
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,880
to him today.
