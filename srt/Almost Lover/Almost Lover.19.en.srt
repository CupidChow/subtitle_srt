They can be saved. Good.

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,940
I already have a lot of candies.

19
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,420
I don't like them.

20

You give them to me every day.

You don't care when you're busy.

Sweet food

25
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,220
can also relieve stress and anxiety.

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,300
This is the true practical

27
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,500
experience as a journalist.

28
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,820
With you by my side,

29
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,180
why would I feel anxious?

30
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,740
Sui.

31
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,980
You just got back yesterday.

32
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,540
You're full of energy now.

33
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,420
I haven't been back in a while.

34
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,220
It's good to tidy up.

35
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
It's sunny today.

36
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,540
I came to dry my blanket.

37
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,980
Right. You haven't said

38
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,340
why you suddenly came over?

39
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,700
Didn't I

40
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,300
mention on the way back

41
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,820
yesterday?

42
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,060
I wanted to eat Zhang's fried dumplings.

43
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,500
Hui is busy so she won't come.

44
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,660
She asked us to go over first.

45
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,700
We can wait.

46
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,940
But we can go to the supermarket

47
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,460
on the way.

48
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,420
I need some groceries at home.

49
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,300
Drop me at the supermarket

50
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,260
on the way later.

51
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:40,820
All right.

52
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,500
Let me get changed.

53
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,020
Wait for me.

54
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,420
She is so normal.

55
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,980
Xiaoran, welcome back.

56
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,500
It's been tough for you guys.

57
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:58,860
Xiaoran,

58
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,380
you left for Hupu for so long.

59
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,300
You didn't

60
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,060
bring back some

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,260
good food from there for us?

62
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,340
That's not right.

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,580
Apologies.

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,540
I came back in a rush.

65
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,900
I didn't have time to prepare.

66
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,100
Why don't I treat

67
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,020
everyone to dinner tonight?

68
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,300
Don't be bothered by them.

69
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,860
Upon returning, Xiaoran

70
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,580
has taken on the most

71
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,900
tiring job in the team.

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,540
The development meeting of
the Damang Mountain Development Zone

73
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,820
and the whistle-blowing of

74
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,260
falling objects at Cuihe.

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,140
Are you sure you still

76
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,620
want her to treat you to dinner?

77
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,100
I'll treat her then.

78
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,020
Xiaoran,

79
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,740
after returning from training,

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,780
you have high awareness.

81
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,620
Lately, everyone

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,700
has taken on quite a bit of my work.

83
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,660
Now that I'm back,

84
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,460
leave it to me.

85
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
All right. Don't just stand there.

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,740
Get to work.

87
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,660
You only think of eating.

88
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,540
You took on so much work

89
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,500
the moment you came back.

90
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,180
Can your body take it?

91
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,900
I feel like something

92
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,060
is off with you.

93
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,420
But according to my experience,

94
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,020
when I get busy,

95
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,580
time passes quickly.

96
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,260
Don't worry.

97
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,380
I'll do a good job.

98
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Take care.

99
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,220
(Hupu Huayang Hospital)
Your father's condition

100
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,140
has stabilized.

101
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,380
We'll transfer him to the normal ward

102
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,700
for observation for a few days.

103
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,820
Then, he can be discharged.

104
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,140
Next, the main thing is to

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,460
take care as he recovers.

106
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,180
He can't overwork himself

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,980
and don't

108
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,740
trigger him.

109
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,540
Got it. Thank you.

110
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,260
Thank you.

111
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,660
I'll accompany father in the room then.

112
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,140
All right.

113
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,480
(14th)

114
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,900
Mr. Xiao.

115
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,180
A few suppliers have

116
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,460
requested for an advanced
payment of the remaining funds.

117
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,940
They're waiting at the office.

118
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,380
They won't leave if it isn't sorted.

119
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,220
I'll deal with it.

120
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,380
Deju is moving so fast.

121
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,220
Contact the other suppliers.

122
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,980
There must not be any problems

123
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,460
in the near term.

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,860
All right.

125
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,980
Set up a meeting with Mr. Gao

126
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,220
in the afternoon in two days.

127
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,740
All right.

128
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,740
We want our payments.

129
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,740
Give us a statement.

130
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,700
Everyone, calm down.

131
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,940
Everyone, calm down.

132
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,860
Listen to me.

133
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,860
Mr. Xiao has already

134
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,500
done the necessary

135
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,380
according to your feedback.

136
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,860
We've also looked into it

137
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,380
(Community Committee)
but couldn't find anything.

138
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,820
(Community Committee)

139
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,020
(Community Committee)
Look. Before you came,

140
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,140
(Community Committee)

141
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,260
(Community Committee)
they threw it down.

142
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,340
The orders are torn.

143
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
I don't know which customer this is.

144
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,180
How immoral.

145
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,780
How can we trust you?

146
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,820
How can we trust you?

147
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,140
Please trust that the company

148
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,140
will give everyone

149
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,740
a clear solution.

150
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
We're all old employees.

151
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,820
Thank you, everyone.

152
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:09,940
Hello.

153
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,020
May I ask if the Gong Bao chicken for

154
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,260
Cuihe has been sent?

155
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,180
Hold on. Let me check.

156
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,740
It's the order ending with 6768,

157
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,740
302, unit one,

158
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,780
Cuihe?

159
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,460
Yes.

160
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,260
It says here the order
has been delivered.

161
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,340
Did you not receive it?

162
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,620
I may have gotten it wrong.

163
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,340
Thank you.

164
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,420
302, unit one.

165
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,060
Qi.

166
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,220
I think father's not feeling well.

167
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,220
We found certain special traits

168
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
among children who were hurt

169
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,700
by their biological families.

170
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,340
If they were neglected

171
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,660
by the parents

172
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,180
while growing up,

173
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,300
they lack a sense of security.

174
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,300
They would become very dependent

175
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,380
on a close relationship with someone.

176
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,660
They would perceive them
as their last straw of hope

177
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,860
and hope for love from them.

178
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,900
Then, can you let me

179
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,780
have Xiao Shangqi?

180
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,020
Nobody has been kind to me

181
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,700
ever since young.

182
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,700
I don't know what happiness is.

183
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,940
He Xiaoran,

184
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,900
can you give me some?

185
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,300
You already have so much.

186
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,500
You got so much easily.

187
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,420
Please give me some.

188
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,980
Please.

189
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,060
(I beg you.)

190
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,300
Miss He.

191
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,660
Professor Liu.

192
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,100
Thank you for accepting the interview

193
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,620
from Wusu Radio & TV Group.

194
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,740
The talks you did at

195
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,780
the Children's Palace

196
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,020
are very meaningful.

197
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,540
I have one last question

198
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,340
for you.

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,540
Please.

200
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,220
Some say the lucky ones are

201
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,140
healed by their childhood
all their lives

202
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,140
while the unlucky ones

203
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,860
spend the rest of their lives
healing from their childhood.

204
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,340
Would this kind of personality

205
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,700
prevail throughout their lifetime?

206
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,900
Of course not.

207
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,620
Many scars can be healed.

208
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Please give me some.

209
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,660
Please.

210
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,700
I beg you.

211
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,220
I've done everything I can

212
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,020
for you.

213
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,340
Thank you.

214
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Sir, thank you.

215
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,260
Miss He,

216
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,460
after returning from Hupu,

217
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,340
you've become very hardworking.

218
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,700
You work long hours.

219
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,140
Why are you running the

220
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
fieldwork for your team?

221
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,700
I like doing fieldwork.

222
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
It's better than staying

223
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,740
in the office.

224
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,780
Be careful on your way back.

225
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,780
All right.

226
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,460
Bye.

227
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:24,980
Bye.

228
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
I haven't seen you in days.

229
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,300
Are you all right?

230
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,260
What could happen to me?

231
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,460
I've left for Hupu for too long.

232
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
There's so much work to do.

233
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,500
Why do I hear that

234
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,260
you've been taking on everything?

235
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,580
Are you using work to numb yourself?

236
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,500
How can that be?

237
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,220
It's just that the busier I am,

238
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,580
the faster time passes.

239
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,620
Did Xiao Shangqi say when

240
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,100
he's coming back?

241
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,460
You caught a cold?

242
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,100
Are you all right?

243
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,100
I'm fine.

244
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
I could have caught it

245
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,820
while staying up drafting last night.

246
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,180
Someone I interviewed this afternoon

247
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,580
gave me a tangerine.

248
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
I'll peel it and

249
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,300
eat it later.

250
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,820
I'll then wash the skin
and soak it in water

251
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,740
for the vitamin C.

252
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,660
Xiaoran.

253
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,620
How long do you plan to

254
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,820
live like this?

255
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,500
What?

256
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,780
I trust him.

257
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,460
I've said all the mean stuff.

258
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,540
I don't believe he won't return.

259
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,660
Fine.

260
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,900
I think I get it,

261
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,700
but you must

262
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,060
pay more attention to it.

263
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,220
These are all fine.

264
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,220
Go ahead.

265
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,780
All right.

266
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,350
(He Xiaoran)

267
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,300
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Are you busy?)

268
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,620
(Xiao Shangqi)

269
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,860
(Nurse station
Treatment room)

270
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,620
Get out. I don't need it.

271
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,460
What's with his temper?

272
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,380
What's wrong?

273
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,940
The old man won't let me wash him.

274
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,500
He insists for his caretaker.

275
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,180
You go on. I'll do it.

276
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,260
Father.

277
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,580
Slowly.

278
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,420
Where is Madam Zhang?

279
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,940
I sent her home to rest.

280
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,580
I've sent away

281
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,140
everyone from the office.

282
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,820
There's no use of them staying here.

283
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
They would only disturb you.

284
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,380
You've lost weight.

285
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,860
What?

286
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,380
Let me do it.

287
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,460
Let me do it.

288
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,740
I didn't think I would age this quickly.

289
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm aging from the inside.

290
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,180
I'm useless now.

291
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,540
I have to trouble you for

292
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,860
simple matters like these.

293
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,740
I'll cut your nails for you.

294
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:58,860
Come.

295
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,820
Qi.

296
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,660
Don't move.

297
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,420
I've never cut nails

298
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,540
for anyone else.

299
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,420
What if I accidentally cut you?

300
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,900
You have to sign
the termination contract

301
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,180
with Deju.

302
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,020
Bring it here.

303
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,540
(Termination contract)

304
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,100
Trim this part, too.

305
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,460
Trim it cleanly.

306
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,620
All right.

307
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,340
Right.

308
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,660
Let's go for a walk in a bit.

309
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,500
Get some sunlight.

310
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,260
All right.

311
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,380
Now that I nearly missed death,

312
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,020
many of my memories

313
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,060
flashed past my head

314
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,300
like a movie.

315
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,340
I, Xiao Zhenyun, have

316
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,420
succeeded in many things,

317
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,900
but I have failed

318
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,540
my two children.

319
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,340
Father.

320
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,020
Don't say that.

321
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,540
At least, not for me.

322
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,500
I wasn't hardworking enough.

323
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,500
Xian.

324
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,580
All these years,

325
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,060
I've been asking around for a cure.

326
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,780
Actually I know

327
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm the only one struggling with

328
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,060
this mental block.

329
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,540
I can't let go of your leg.

330
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,540
I know that the more I am doing this,

331
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,660
the more I am suppressing you

332
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,540
and the more you can't forget your injury.

333
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,980
Although all these years,

334
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,980
I made a lot of arrangements for you,

335
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,100
I never trusted you.

336
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,420
I couldn't trust

337
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,500
you could live a good life.

338
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,020
Father.

339
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,340
Yes.

340
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,500
I don't have to mention Qi.

341
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,380
Because I always felt that

342
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,940
your brother was injured in this.

343
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,780
So, I paid a lot of attention to him.

344
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,100
I let you drift everywhere.

345
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,060
As long as you were out of sight,

346
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,980
you were out of mind.

347
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,220
So, in the end,

348
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,140
that only strained the

349
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,260
relationship between the three of us.

350
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I don't know how to face your mother.

351
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,420
I can't swallow this.

352
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,500
I can't face her.

353
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,940
Father.

354
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,940
Don't think like that.

355
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,460
Mother died young.

356
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,340
You had to take care of us

357
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,300
and Yunlan.

358
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,620
It's very tough.

359
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,660
Right, Qi?

360
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,660
Often,

361
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,780
I didn't feel like I have a family.

362
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,620
Qi.

363
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,420
What I have is guilt

364
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,100
I can never make amends to.

365
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,260
As a father,

366
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,380
you didn't do your job well,

367
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,580
but as your son,

368
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,380
I think I'm worse.

369
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,580
Actually, I always wanted

370
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,420
someone to care about me

371
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,420
and ask how I've been,

372
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,460
but I never expressed

373
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,020
that need to you

374
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,580
or my brother.

375
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,740
After I got together with Xiaoran,

376
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,460
I saw how her family interacted,

377
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,180
and I slowly realised that

378
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,540
even with

379
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,780
biological relatives,

380
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,580
you need each other

381
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,540
to support each other.

382
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,700
That way,

383
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,420
we can then get closer.

384
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,740
Father.

385
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,900
Not everyone

386
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,900
gets a second chance to learn
and make amends.

387
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,420
We're all lucky

388
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,580
to have more time.

389
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,620
Yes, we have more time.

390
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,340
You are in a stable condition now,

391
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,340
and I'm sure Yunlan will

392
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,420
rise up again.

393
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,460
Right?

394
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,540
Qi.

395
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,140
You're young and energetic.

396
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,860
Xian and I

397
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,940
have many years of
foundation and experience.

398
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,420
We're a formidable team.

399
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,980
As long as the three of us

400
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,100
work together,

401
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,180
there's nothing we can't do.

402
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,860
Well, where is Xiaoran?

403
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,980
I've been hospitalized.

404
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,460
Is she not coming to visit me?

405
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,060
Xiaoran...

406
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,340
Xiaoran has returned to Wusu.

407
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,500
Ranran,

408
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,300
I've prepared all the

409
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:44,940
side dishes you like.

410
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,340
I can just send them to you.

411
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,540
Mother,

412
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,140
I just wanted to make
some side dishes.

413
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,300
I can't taste anything.

414
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,140
I want to eat it with porridge.

415
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,300
By the time your package gets here,

416
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,220
it'd be too late.

417
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,940
(If I learn how to do it,)

418
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,420
(I can make it more for myself.)

419
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,340
(I can make some for Xiao Shangqi, too.)

420
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,820
You've gone back

421
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,660
for so many days.

422
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,340
When is Qi

423
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,740
going back?

424
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,500
What about this?

425
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,300
I'll go look for him.

426
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,700
I'll ask him for you, okay?

427
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,180
All right.

428
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,740
Fine, I won't do that.

429
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,180
Let me tell you.

430
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,260
You're alone there.

431
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,140
You must learn how to

432
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,380
take care of yourself. Got it?

433
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,540
Didn't you say

434
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,380
I'll need white vinegar? What else?

435
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,980
(First, two spoons of vinegar.)

436
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,780
(And then, one spoon of sugar.)

437
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,460
(Two spoons of soy sauce.)

438
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,180
(Do you have oyster sauce?)

439
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,820
What trouble are you causing here?

440
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,780
Nothing.

441
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,500
Mr. Xiao rarely makes porridge for me.

442
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,660
I wanted to give it a try.

443
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,980
A patient should

444
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,820
lie in bed properly.

445
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,860
Let me try it.

446
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,380
Hold on.

447
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,900
Careful. It's hot.

448
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,220
You don't know.

449
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,860
This is best served hot.

450
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,580
Good.

451
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,900
It's nice.

452
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
I caught a cold. It's contagious.

453
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,260
If you pass it to me,

454
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,540
maybe you'll get better.

455
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,460
Come. Drink it while it's hot.

456
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,940
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Xiaoran, I'll go back tonight.)

457
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,980
Have you told He Xiaoran?

458
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,020
Father is right.

459
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,140
Go back tonight.

460
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,900
Explain to her.

461
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,340
Discuss your future plans

462
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:20,980
with her.

463
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,420
Does she know father is sick?

464
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Don't wait if you want to coax a girl.

465
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,940
Do you have experience?

466
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,820
Where did I get the experience?

467
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,900
I'll beat you.

468
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,380
Come.

469
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,620
At Jifeng,

470
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,300
I saw you doing this with Lin Zong.

471
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,300
This feels more like being brothers.

472
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,020
Right?

473
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,060
Let's go.

474
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,420
Well, I left the contract at the ward.

475
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,460
I have to go get it.

476
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,700
Wait for me.

477
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,740
I'll go get it.

478
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,860
Wait for me in the car.

479
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,500
Go on.

480
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,600
(Patient ward)

481
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,500
Mr. Xiao,

482
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,940
I heard you're not feeling well.

483
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,380
I came to see you.

484
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,900
You didn't even bring flowers

485
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,500
to visit a patient.

486
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,260
You're not sincere.

487
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,220
It's good that you're here.

488
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,260
Take that contract with you

489
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,220
(Termination contract)
when you leave.

490
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,400
(Termination contract)

491
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,340
We can still

492
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,780
talk it out.

493
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,500
My stance is the same.

494
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,340
As long as Xiao Shangqi

495
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,060
apologizes to me,

496
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,140
then this

497
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,460
would be settled.

498
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,300
Mingxuan.

499
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,420
Your actions

500
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,780
tell me that you fear Qi.

501
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,140
I fear him?

502
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,820
Mr. Xiao.

503
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,260
Your jokes are so funny.

504
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,620
You don't know

505
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,340
the mess

506
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,460
at Yunlan, right?

507
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,500
Without you there,

508
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,420
do you think your two sons

509
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,180
can handle it?

510
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,860
I trust them

511
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,340
because they are the children

512
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,860
I am proud of.

513
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,540
Yes.

514
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,980
Ever since young,

515
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,340
whenever people brought up

516
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,620
the Xiao family's children,

517
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,540
they're smart and

518
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,460
outstanding.

519
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,100
They're under the spotlight.

520
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,140
Now, between the two of them,

521
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,580
the elder one is crippled

522
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,900
while the second one is dumb.

523
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,620
Zhao Mingxuan!

524
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,540
Why?

525
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,540
Mr. Xiao.

526
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,180
Are you panicking?

527
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,380
I know you well.

528
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,980
You don't give empty words.

529
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,220
You weren't done that day.

530
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:13,900
Go on.

531
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Show me

532
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,540
your cards.

533
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,100
My last resort

534
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,820
is my relationship with your father.

535
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,380
So, I advise you

536
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,620
to stop this while you still can.

537
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Don't talk about my father!

538
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,820
He's dumber.

539
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,620
I want to show him

540
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,140
how the outstanding

541
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,460
Xiao brothers

542
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,900
will kneel before me!

543
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,660
Also, Xiao Zhenyun,

544
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,100
I don't care what you know,

545
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,060
but don't fight with me.

546
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,860
Otherwise, I'll make your two sons

547
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,940
pay for it.

548
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,860
I, Xiao Zhenyun, have done business

549
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,900
for many years.

550
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,500
I've never been afraid of threats.

551
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,380
Did you think I was threatening you?

552
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,100
Then, there is something

553
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,740
I must tell you.

554
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,550
(Hospitalization for payment)

555
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,060
Sir, please remain calm.

556
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,460
What happened to my father?

557
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,340
Maximize the dosage.

558
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,940
What happened to my father?

559
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,740
We're saving him.

560
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,860
Sir, please remain calm.

561
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,060
I'm sorry. We did our best.

562
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,700
Qi.

563
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,660
My condolences.

564
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,580
I didn't know

565
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,780
Mr. Xiao

566
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,140
was still unstable.

567
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,300
We were just talking

568
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,260
and suddenly he felt unwell.

569
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,060
I then pressed the

570
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,140
emergency call button.

571
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,580
But in the end,

572
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,020
he didn't make it.

573
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,340
Take care.

574
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,060
I'll leave first.

575
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,700
(The main cause of your father's death)

576
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,860
(is heart failure.)

577
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,940
(If you require)

578
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,100
(further verification,)

579
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
(you have to submit a request)

580
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,620
(for an autopsy.)

581
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,940
(Mr. Xiao, my condolences.)

582
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,420
(As a father,)

583
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,180
(you didn't do your job well,)

584
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,340
(but as your son,)

585
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,700
(I think I'm worse.)

586
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,060
(Not everything will go)

587
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,500
(as you wish.)

588
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,260
(Don't forget. You owed your brother.)

589
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,980
I'll pay back

590
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,740
what I owed him.

591
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,140
But as a father,

592
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,300
do you not

593
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,340
owe me anything, too?

594
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,260
I gave birth and brought you up.

595
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,700
What do I owe you?

596
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,500
(We're almost there.)

597
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
(Hope is in front of us!)

598
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,020
Drink some water.

599
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
(Not everyone)

600
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,100
(gets a second chance to learn
and make amends.)

601
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,020
We're all lucky

602
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,140
to have more time.

603
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,500
We're a

604
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,260
formidable team.

605
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,780
As long as the three of us

606
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,940
work together,

607
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,980
there's nothing we can't do.

608
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,100
(He Xiaoran)

609
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,300
(Hello.)

610
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,740
(The number you have dialled)

611
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,580
(can't be reached.)

612
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,220
(Please...)

613
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

614
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,620
Next time, at this hour,

615
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,140
I must still report to Mr. Xiao.

616
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,660
Lin Zong.

617
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,860
Xiaoran.

618
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,220
You...

619
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,700
I wanted to ask

620
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,460
if you can reach Xiao Shangqi.

621
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,660
We spoke this morning,

622
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,100
but it was a brief call.

623
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,460
Can I know

624
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,420
what you talked about?

625
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,100
We just spoke about

626
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,340
Jifeng's strategy in the

627
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,020
second half of the year.

628
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,140
Second half of the year?

629
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,180
This morning, there was a memo

630
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,860
that Mr. Lin is now

631
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,380
Jifeng's acting general manager.

632
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,940
Congratulations.

633
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,580
I saw the news

634
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
about the wedding online.

635
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,060
There are many rumors

636
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,060
about Yunlan lately.

637
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,220
I heard they restructured

638
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,980
their core business.

639
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,580
Jifeng

640
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,980
is considered a peripheral asset.

641
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,100
We're not in Hupu.

642
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
I didn't hear

643
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,700
anything of use.

644
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,180
He sounded very tired

645
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,420
over the phone.

646
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,740
I don't think he'll

647
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,540
make it back so soon.

648
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,740
(Xiaoran.)

649
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,380
(Please give me some time.)

650
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:57,780
How long?

651
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,380
Seven days.

652
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,140
(Fine, I'll wait for you.)

653
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,820
Xiaoran.

654
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,100
It's fine.

655
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,020
I heard what I needed to hear.

656
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,340
Goodbye.

657
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:21,540
Xiaoran,

658
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,500
why don't you have breakfast

659
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,220
at the hotel first?

660
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,580
Xiao Shangqi didn't go back.

661
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,620
Why?

662
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,780
How would I know?

663
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,780
I spoke to Xiaoran over the phone

664
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,580
this morning.

665
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,820
She had a strong nasal voice.

666
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,260
I don't know if she cried

667
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,940
the night before

668
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,300
or she has a bad cold.

669
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,900
I don't care.

670
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,300
Hello.

671
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,300
I'll have

672
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,220
cold medicine

673
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,180
and

674
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,940
fever medicine.

675
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,460
You can't mix them.

676
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,380
It could get worse.

677
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,820
If it's a normal cold,

678
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,500
it'll go away in seven days.

679
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,460
How many days has it been?

680
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,340
Seven days.

681
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,740
What's wrong?

682
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:05,940
Right.

683
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,820
It's the last day today.

684
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,780
Give me some of those first.

685
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,460
How much is it?

686
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,620
You've changed.

687
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,420
You still remember their
seven-day promise.

688
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,940
Don't care about the outcome.

689
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,580
Just wait with her

690
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,340
till the end tonight.

691
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,740
How much is it?

692
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,820
RMB 75.

693
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,540
Hello?

694
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,980
All right. Got it.

695
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,100
Let's go.
Something happened at the radio station.

696
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,020
What happened?

697
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,100
Everyone seated here

698
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,860
are senior management and elders
at the company.

699
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,860
You've fought alongside

700
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,740
my father before.

701
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,500
Yunlan is now at

702
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,940
a crucial juncture.

703
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,380
So, I ask for everyone

704
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
and hope that everyone

705
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,980
can weather this with us.

706
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,700
Mr. Xiao.

707
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,820
This is a heavy price

708
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,900
for your punch.

709
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,060
The contract has been terminated.

710
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,060
Deju takes up 90% of our sales.

711
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,620
How many employees

712
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,500
can you feed with that?

713
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,180
What's the use of saying that?

714
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,140
We should fend for ourselves.

715
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,540
Before my father passed away,

716
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,700
he was already planning

717
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,700
to wean off Deju.

718
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,900
This plan has just

719
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,980
been brought forward.

720
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes, we know that.

721
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,940
Mr. Xiao Shangqi,

722
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,380
you have opened up several deals,

723
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,820
but based on the Xiao family's

724
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,820
current situation,

725
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,140
how many would be

726
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,020
willing to help us?

727
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,220
Do we have news from Mr. Gao?

728
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,180
He's still overseas.

729
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,660
He's overseas now?

730
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,980
I think

731
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,300
he's avoiding us.

732
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,500
How sure are you?

733
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,020
Give us reassurance.

734
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
So that we can be mentally prepared.

735
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,540
We all have families to feed.

736
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,580
We can't afford to lose.

737
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,900
70%.

738
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,420
There are four companies planning to

739
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,100
sign with us, including Zhisheng.

740
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,940
I don't want to give up on Mr. Gao.

741
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,500
They take up the largest proportion.

742
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,980
The remaining three are considering.

743
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,900
They said they'll decide

744
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,460
after the funeral.

745
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,380
Apologies, everyone.

746
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,900
Let's adjourn for now, okay?

747
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,420
The caretaker found this
under father's bed.

748
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,140
Is it yours?

749
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,260
No.

750
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,380
It's not mine either.

751
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,940
Sir, please remain calm.

752
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,620
What happened to my father?

753
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,620
What did the caretaker say?

754
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,260
Where was

755
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,220
this tie clip found?

756
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,420
When was it left there?

757
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,940
What do you mean?

758
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,660
Father was recovering fine.

759
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,740
When we left,

760
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,700
he was clearly fine.

761
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,300
How could he die in such a short time?

762
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,260
Qi.

763
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,860
I don't care what you think.

764
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,780
Father is old.

765
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,140
There are many causes

766
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,220
of heart failure.

767
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,140
Father's heart failure

768
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,820
must have happened from
an argument with someone.

769
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,060
He grabbed the person by the tie.

770
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,340
Right.

771
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,660
That person is Zhao Mingxuan.

772
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm calling the police.

773
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,340
I must call the police.

774
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,540
Now.

775
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,700
Why are you calling the police?

776
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,500
Even if Zhao Mingxuan did that,

777
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
is this proof?

778
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,420
Can this be proof?

779
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,300
What's the most important thing now?

780
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Father's funeral.

781
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,300
How many eyes

782
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,820
are watching Yunlan?

783
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,900
Can't you let father

784
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,660
leave in peace?

785
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,300
I beg you.

786
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,300
I'll get to the bottom of this.

787
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,540
Father was fine.

788
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,540
We had time.

789
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,260
(Learn the party's history,
innovative thinking)

790
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,780
Xiaoran.

791
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,500
Feng, what's the matter?

792
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,300
Come with me.

793
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,500
Something happened to Dajiabang.

794
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,700
Let's go.

795
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,900
(Be practical, open new horizon)

796
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,660
(Goodnight)

797
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,580
What happened?

798
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,460
Sui Mingwei and I returned
for a few days,

799
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,020
and we felt something was off.

800
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,340
Earlier, we were told

801
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,620
that we were suspended.

802
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,900
The show was upgraded.
The name was changed, too.

803
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,100
Only the new staff can stay on.

804
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,900
Sui Mingwei!

805
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,980
Why did you hit someone?

806
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,300
Are you mad?

807
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,060
I've begged our supervisor
all afternoon.

808
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,060
Just so I could get

809
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,700
some good positions for you all.

810
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,860
You're the hardest to handle!

811
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,100
I was afraid you would cause trouble!

812
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,500
And it happened!

813
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,540
I get it now.

814
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,460
So,

815
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,420
Li Hui and I were given a break

816
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,900
so that you can send us away

817
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,500
to revamp the show, right?

818
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,260
Mr. He.

819
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,420
You're pretty sneaky.

820
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,180
This is final.

821
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,460
What I want to do

822
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,380
is to give you all

823
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,220
some good positions.

824
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:33,940
Tell me.

825
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,820
Where are you going after

826
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,580
settling us?

827
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,380
