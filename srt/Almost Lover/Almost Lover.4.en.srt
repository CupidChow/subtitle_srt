made with kitchen seasonings.

21

Half about taste, half about story.

23

It doesn't taste very good.

Miss Wang said

41
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:34,526
there's a noodle house without a sign

42
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,646
(below her childhood home.)

43
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:37,966
(It's certainly attractive.)

44
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:40,166
(The most memorable delicacy)

45
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,326
(is often what you've been eating
since you were a child.)

46
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:43,606
(The taste)

47
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,566
(is concealed with silent companionship.)

48
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,326
(It'll instantly bring you back)

49
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,166
(to certain memory from few years ago.)

50
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,966
In my opinion, the most memorable food

51
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:54,246
is my father's

52
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:55,326
sweet and sour spare ribs.

53
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:57,366
(Whenever I eat it,)

54
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:58,486
(I feel like)

55
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,526
(it's very healing.)

Where's this Hometown Noodle House?

57
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,166
There's one on Sanxiangkou.

58
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,366
I think it's moved after that.

59
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,006
I think it should be around still.

60
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:16,766
What about the spiced beef?

61
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,286
A fan said it's particularly delicious.

62
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,966
It's from a mobile stall
in the west of the city.

63
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,846
I tried that before.

64
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:24,246
This is what they do.

65
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,686
They have limited beef.

66
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,846
They'd leave after selling
5 kg of beef every day.

67
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,526
Is there something that you don't know

68
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,606
and you haven't eaten in Wusu?

69
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:35,366
That's why.

70
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:36,886
Spending efforts collecting these

71
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,606
is no better than asking me directly.

72
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:39,806
Tell me

73
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:41,806
where's the food impressing you

74
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:42,686
the most then.

75
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,126
Are you going to tell

76
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:49,086
Xiao Shangqi

77
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,246
after this?

78
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:51,406
That's for sure.

79
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:52,686
It's a sponsored event.

80
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:53,846
It should be given to Jifeng

81
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:54,926
after the complete collection.

82
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:56,486
I'll just tell him

83
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,486
directly then.

84
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,726
Are you so familiar with him?

85
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,686
I could still help

86
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:03,846

Something good.

90
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:33,406

91

Well done on this procurement plan.

is with patented technology.)

Okay.

I'll implement it.

Meng and others at the kitchen
have checked out

the dishes.

111

which have duplicated with the list

113

made by Miss He.

114

Do you think

115
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:24,766
Miss He deliberately let him send over

116
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,086
for you?

117
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:27,366
And he's embarrassed

118
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:28,126
to admit it,

119
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:29,006
so he gave a trickster look

120
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:29,846
on purpose.

121
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,006
Is that so?

122
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,566
Yes. They said

123
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:34,486
many dishes in the list

124
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:35,486
are very hard to find now.

125
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:36,606
It's impossible to find

126

invite someone to dinner.

It's actually you.

137

00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:14,806
to taste it?

Yes.

No.

It's a treat to you from Mr. Xiao.

148
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:43,966
Did you

149
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:44,926
upgrade the whole hotel

150
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,846
for Black Pine Needle's rating?

151
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:49,566
Mr. Xiao said it before.

152
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:51,726
Will he go back to Hupu

153
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,326
after that?

154
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:55,726
I don't know.

155
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,086
Yunlan has so many businesses.

156
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,326
It doesn't make sense for them to leave

157
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,286
the younger son here to waste his life.

158
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:03,726
I think the same, too.

159
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,486
May him leave soon after the rating.

160

Miss He,

161
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,006
you work so hard

162
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:12,326
just to make him leave?

163
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:21,006
Mr. Xiao.

164
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,086
I tasted the sweet and sour spare ribs.

165
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:28,926
It's delicious.

166
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:30,646
It's better than the one I made.

167
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,406
Mo also showed me

168
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,486
your new menu.

169
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,286
I think every dish in it

170
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:37,446
is attractive.

171
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,486
It shouldn't be

172
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:40,366
a problem for a diamond rating.

173
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,206
It'll surely be listed
by Black Pine Needle.

174
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:45,006
I've done tasting.

175
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:46,366
I have to go now.

176
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,446
Bye.

177
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:48,646
Let me send you home.

178
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,326
It's okay.

179
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:52,966
Thanks for doing this for Jifeng.

180
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,566
No.

181
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:56,246
Thanks for doing it to send me away.

182
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:57,566
You've worked so hard.

183
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,126
I've prepared a gift to thank you.

184
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:01,526
I'm afraid

185
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:02,606
you can't bring it home alone.

186
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:15,566
This is it.

187
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,766
Leave it on the floor.

188
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:22,846
Aren't you inviting me in
to sit for a while?

189
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:44,526
The kitchen is there.

190
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:48,406
Aren't you Mr. Xiao? What a rare guest.

191
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,046
Do you stay together?

192
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:57,086
Yes. We stay together.

193
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:58,606
We're housemates who
spend all day together.

194
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,686
The ex-housemate staying in this loft

195
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,086
has gone back to hometown for good.

196
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:03,486
The room had been left empty

197
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:04,526
so I came.

198
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,326
What's this?

199
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:09,486
House-warming gift?

200
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,006
Thank you.

201
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,006
It isn't for you.

202
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:14,286
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:15,886
In our house-sharing rules,

204
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:17,046
we share food.

205
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:18,246
Your pickle

206
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:19,406
suits my taste, too.

207
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,006
I should taste it.

208
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:28,566
Do you want a drink?

209
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:32,566
Yes.

210
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,166
Hot or cold?

211
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:37,966
Drink it. It's warm.

212
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:39,766
Thank you.

213
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,006
Old classmate, aren't you?

214
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:02,086
Let's play game.

215
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:21,046
You win.

216
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,486
Do you know the Bully in Wusu?

217
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,566
Either in game or reality,

218
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:31,726
whether it's four wheels or two,

219
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:32,766
I won't

220
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,446
lose.

221
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,526
Don't brag. Let's have one game.

222
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:36,486
Bring it on.

223
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,326
Enjoy yourselves. I have to go.

224
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:05,006
Carry on first.

225
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:07,406
Xiao Shangqi.

226
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:14,406
Do you also tend to forget your phone?

227
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:17,206
Thank you.

228
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,686
You're an adult.

229
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:22,846
You get angry after losing in a game.

230
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:23,886
Don't worry.

231
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,326
I'll avenge you later.

232
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,486
Is it convenient to
share a house with a man?

233
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,686
Do you mean Sui?

234
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,446
You don't know

235
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:34,606
the market, do you?

236
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,486
Character, routine and living habit

237
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:38,006
are far more important than gender

238
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,726
when you rent a house nowadays.

239
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,486
Sui

240
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,446
is a perfect housemate.

241
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,006
And I've also saved

242
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,406
the brokerage fee

243
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,966
and deposit for this house.

244
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:50,726
You've really

245
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:52,406
become good at budgeting

246
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,126
after three years.

247
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,406
I only have slightly more

248
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:59,086
social experiences than you do.

249
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,646
You're free to consult me

250
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:01,486
anything any time.

251
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,366
Well, when's

252
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:08,766
the selection

253
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:09,766
of Black Pine Needle?

254
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:11,486
You do want to send me away

255
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,326
whole-heartedly.

256
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:21,486
He Xiaoran.

257
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:23,406
I'm really happy

258
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:24,686
to meet you again.

259
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,006
During this time in Wusu,

260
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,166
I've recalled many things in the past.

261
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,206
But I want to do something

262
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,086
for you now.

263
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,246
Either I did it wrong or it fell short.

264
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:37,126
And everything you do,

265
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:38,926
you do it

266
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:40,566
only to make me get out
of your sight sooner.

267
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,046
Jifeng will be assessed next week.

268
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,886
I hope you wouldn't find it too late.

269
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:22,606
(It's a deal to get)

270
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,086
(the time capsule seven years later)

271
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,926
(when we're 25 years old.)

272
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,566
(Come no matter what.)

273
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,286
(Okay.)

274
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:29,286
(The iron triangle remains together.)

275
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,486
(Remains together.)

276
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:33,886
He Xiaoran,

277
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,406
you're using this to keep the pickle?

278
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,446
It seals well.

279
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:57,246
(Black Pine Needle's Desirable Hotel's)

280
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:58,566
(new selection)

281
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,566
(is in full string.)

282
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:00,806
(It's learned that there're ten hotels)

283
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,086
(nominated in Wusu.)

284
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:03,326
(The jury is conducting)

285
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:04,246
(an all-round inspection.)

286
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:05,886
(The result will be produced
in no time.)

287
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,406
(Please look forward to it.)

288
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:11,646
Mr. Lin.

289
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,526
I notice Jifeng

290
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,126
has suddenly become so good.

291
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,366
Normally,

292
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:20,166
we're tormented

293
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,206
(by Mr. Xiao.)

294
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,686
(He said he dislikes red color.)

295
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,166
(All the restaurant tablecloths)

296
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:24,766
(were replaced.)

297
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:27,286
(And he said he's sick
of drinking coffee.)

298

(All kinds of exotic drinks)

299
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,406
(were added at the lobby.)

300
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,366
(The laundry detergent was working fine.)

301
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,646
(He insisted that it didn't smell good
and got it replaced.)

302
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:36,406
(But after all the trouble,)

303
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:37,126
(I suddenly realized)

304
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:38,926
(that his unreasonable requests)

305
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:39,966
(happened to score for)

306
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:40,840

Have a safe trip.

310
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:47,486
(He only played dumb.)

311
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,126
Your coffee is served.

312
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:56,966
Thank you.

313
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,326
What would you need?

314
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:03,166
A cup of coffee.

315
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:04,606
Okay. Please wait for a moment.

Mr. Lin.

324
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:17,486
Thank you for your hard work
in this period.

325
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:19,526
Good job.

326

Mr. Xiao is here.

Mr. Xiao.

328
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,326
We've been selected.

329
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:25,526
It's really unexpected.

330
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:26,686
Will we have

331
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:28,726
a raise?

332
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,006
What's the hurry?

333
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,446

everything

335
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:33,646
will increase.

No.

339

Mr. Xiao, you aren't in a good mood

340
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:44,686
lately.

341
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:45,926
Is it too harsh on you?

342
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:48,486
Shall we celebrate

343
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,926
to change everyone's mood?

344
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:52,086
Yes. Don't we have team building

345
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,446
every year at this time?

346
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,406
Yes.

00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:55,806
Mr. Xiao, let's go.

348
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,006
- Let's go, Mr. Xiao.
- Let's go, Mr. Xiao.

349
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:57,646
Let's go.

350
00:15:58,486 --> 00:15:58,926
Okay.

351
00:15:59,366 --> 00:15:59,966
Shall we

352
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,246
invite Miss He, too?

353
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,206
She's considered

354
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:02,646
a great contributor.

355
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:03,406
Never mind.

356
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:09,006
She may not want to come.

357
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:15,286
Mother, is your information reliable?

358
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,606
Jifeng is going to be acquired.

359
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:20,526
The new general manager

360
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:22,006
is really amazing.

361
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:24,446
He's certainly from Hupu.

362
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:25,766
Look.

363
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:27,486
He's just joined the company.

364
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,286
The hotel is instantly listed

365
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,126
as Black Pine Needle's Desirable Hotel.

366
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:32,246
It even produces

367
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:33,406
a diamond restaurant.

368
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,246
The value has been multiplied.

369
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,846
He went through all the trouble

370
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,526
just to sell it for a higher price.

371
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,246
Stop it.

372
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:47,606
I heard it from my friend

373
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,886
in the industry.

374
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:49,766
They're engaged

375
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:50,646
with the buyer.

376
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,086
Mr. Xiao

377
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:56,166
first let us fall to the bottom

378
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:57,086
and then he sponsored us.

379
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:58,166
He played the sentimental card

380
00:16:58,326 --> 00:16:59,366
so that others committed

381
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:00,686
whole-heartedly.

382
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:03,486
Every move was calculated.

383
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,006
What are you babbling?

384
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,886
I need to tell Xiaoran.

385
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:09,766
Who?

386
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:11,006
Enjoy yourself, mother.

387
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:13,926
You haven't taken a bite.

388
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:15,125
Mr. Xiao.

389
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,086
Cheers.

390
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:18,726
I hope you'd continue to take us up

391
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,246
to the next level next year.

392
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:23,326
Seize the Silver Pine Needle,
Golden Pine Needle,

393
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:24,846
and all the colored titles.

394
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:26,566
I'll finish it. Help yourself.

395
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,926
Here.

396
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:30,566
Go and have fun.

397
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,206
Okay, Mr. Xiao.

398
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,086
I talked to Miss He.

399
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,206
She said she'd decide later.

400
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,326
She didn't promise anything.

401
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,326
I didn't ask about this.

402
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:56,846
Mr. Xiao.

403
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:57,846
You spent so much effort

404
00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,166
to get Jifeng on the Black Pine Needle.

405
00:17:59,366 --> 00:17:59,926
Is it a way

406
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:02,046
to achieve certain goal?

407
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:03,646
What's your plan for the future

408
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:04,766
of Jifeng?

409
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:06,446
Can you tell me

410
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:07,846
before returning to Hupu?

411
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:10,646
Mr. Xiao.

412
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:11,926
Can I take a selfie with you?

413
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,126
Let's take it with Mr. Lin.

414
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:14,326
Sure.

415
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:18,366
Make a victory sign.

416
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:19,406
Cheer up a bit, Mr. Lin.

417
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:28,366
Smile.

418
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:29,606
Mr. Xiao.

419
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,086
Miss He.

420
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:43,566
I thought you didn't want to come.

421
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,606
I did you such a great favor.

422
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,046
It's not too much to attend
your celebration dinner,

423
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:51,166
right?

424
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:56,006
Xiao Shangqi.

425
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:57,606
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,726
Three years ago, I thought

427
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,086
you drew a clear line between us

428
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:03,406
in the most resolute way.

429
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,006
I used a very long time

430
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,486
to accept the fact.

431
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:08,886
After meeting you again,

432
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:10,686
I realized there were so many

433
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,006
misunderstandings in it.

434
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,046
I'm actually in a mess.

435
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,246
To seek peace,

436
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,006
I worked hard to chase you away.

437
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:20,806
Why?

438
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,406
You'll get peace after I leave?

439
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:30,966
But you're really strange.

440
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:33,046
You just want to be listed
on Black Pine Needle.

441
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:34,006
Does my purpose

442
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,326
of helping

443
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,406
matter so much?

444
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:38,766
Yes.

445
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,286
Drink this

446
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:44,566
and we're still friends.

447
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:45,926
The next time

448
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:46,846
when you come to Wusu again,

449
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:47,526
remember to find me.

450
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:48,766
I'll treat you to a meal.

451
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:51,966
Sure.

452
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:07,526
Cheers.

453
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:08,926
Colleagues.

454
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,046
Next, let's invite

455
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:11,846
our great contributor, Miss He

456
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:13,406
to host

457
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:14,806
Jifeng's Truth or Dare.

458
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:15,606
Put your hands together!

459
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:16,686
- Good!
- Good!

460
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,446
- Great!
- Great!

461
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,486
I'll take it easy then.

462
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:24,326
You can see two boxes

463
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:25,366
beside me.

464
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:26,606
Later,

465
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,446
I'll draw someone's name

466
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:28,606
from the box to my left.

467
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:29,486
That person

468
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:30,646
shall draw a question from the box

469
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:31,526
to the right.

470
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:32,286
You may also choose

471
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,246
truth

472
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:34,486
or dare.

473
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:35,606
Do you understand?

474
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:36,966
Yes.

475
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:38,606
Let's begin.

476
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,006
Who's the lucky one?

477
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:50,246
Who's it?

478
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:51,086
Mo.

479
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:53,246
Mo.

480
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:54,526
Go now.

481
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:57,246
Here I come.

482
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:58,406
Draw one from that box.

483
00:20:58,646 --> 00:20:59,926
Lucky audience tonight.

484
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,686
Tell a secret not known by others.

485
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,606
You all know I have no secret.

486
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,166
You definitely have one.

487
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:13,286
You may tell Mr. Xiao's secret.

488
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,006
I know his secret.

489
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,006
Yes. Tell Mr. Xiao's secret.

490
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:17,486
You mustn't make it up.

491
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,566
Mr. Xiao, I'll say one?

492
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:22,326
Hurry up and say it.

493
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:25,326
When I was cleaning

494
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:26,246
Mr. Xiao's office,

495
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,526
I discovered a secret.

496
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,886
Behind Mr. Xiao's

497
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,166
tall and handsome appearance

498
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,006
is a

499
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:35,086
boy who likes cartoon.

500
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,006
Cartoon?

501
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:38,046
Yes.

502
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,566
There's a bird bluetooth radio

503
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,006
on his desk.

504
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:42,606
You don't know, do you?

505
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:43,886
Mr. Xiao is still a person

506
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,526
with a childlike mind.

507
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:08,606
There're also bluetooth speakers

508
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:09,566
in our hotel.

509
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,686
Do you think they aren't cute enough?

510
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:13,846
It's given by a friend of mine.

511
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,886
Was it given by Miss He?

512
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:20,886
Miss He.

513
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,086
You spent so much effort the other day

514
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:24,926
to make sweet and sour spare ribs

515
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,166
and the pickle in person.

516
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,326
Wasn't it

517
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,686
for Miss He to eat?

518
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:40,286
How lively.

519
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:41,926
True.

520
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,206
Jifeng is sold for a good price.

521
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,366
It should be celebrated.

522
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:46,126
What are you talking about?

523
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:47,566
What are you babbling?

524
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:49,646
Jifeng has just been listed
on Black Pine Needle.

525
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:50,846
It's just the beginning of good times.

526
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:51,846
Yes.

527
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:53,046
You spouted nonsense.

528
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:56,806
Ask him if I make sense.

529
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,166
Mr. Xiao,

530
00:22:58,366 --> 00:23:01,406
is what he said true?

531
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,686
Jifeng will be taken over soon.

532
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:10,366
Ji...

533
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:11,566
Wait. What about us

534
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:12,846
if Jifeng is sold?

535
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:13,886
- Yes.
- Yes.

536
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,246
- What about us?
- What about us?

537
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:17,966
The new operator will take charge

538
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:19,086
of the personnel management.

539
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:20,766
You brat.

540
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,166
You said all the good things

541
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:24,686
to get me to sell

542
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,046
my noodle house.

543
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:27,886
You lured me here.

544
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,806
Did you get me here

545
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:31,406
only to sell the hotel for a good price?

546
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:33,326
I also came here after closing my stall.

547
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:34,246
Change of owners

548
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,486
is a major personnel reshuffle.

549
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:36,566
Did you think about us?

550
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,366
Cut it out.

551
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:38,166
Yes.

552
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:39,526
I just bought a dress

553
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:40,526
with my credit card today.

554
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,886
What should I do if I'm laid off?

555
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,326
I can't stay a minute longer.

556
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,126
Let's go!

557
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,126
Meng!

558
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:50,046
Take it easy.

559
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,046
Calm down.

560
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:00,126
Wait a minute.

561
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:01,766
Xiaoran,

562
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:03,046
don't you get it yet?

563
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:05,406
You've also been duped by him.

564
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,286
He used you for his own benefit.

565
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:08,686
He used our program.

566
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:14,966
Let's go.

567
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:34,406
Wait a minute, everyone.

568
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,886
Can you calm down?

569
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:39,966
Liu.

570
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,126
What's the hurry?

571
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,446
There's no outcome yet.

572
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:44,606
You...

573
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:59,526
Sui, you shall leave first.

574
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:09,846
Mr. Xiao.

575
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:10,926
The compensation of transfer

576
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,166
that you applied has been approved.

577
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:13,606
There's no precedent for this
in the group.

578
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,166
And about the additional
guarantee contract

579
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:15,886
of keeping the original

580
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:16,686
Jifeng staff,

581
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:17,686
the buyer has agreed to it, too.

582
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:18,566
Got it.

583
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:32,846
Why have you come back?

584
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:35,886
I haven't finished eating.

585
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:50,126
Xiaoran.

586
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:52,646
Why is it you every time?

587
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:55,006
What?

588
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,606
It's the same when we were staying
in the hotel during schooling days.

589
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,486
It's you who remained

590
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,286
in the end whenever this happened.

591
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:08,886
That's because I knew better
than anyone else.

592
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:09,846
You're most afraid of being left

593
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:10,766
on your own.

594
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:12,886
You still need the sound of radio
to put you to sleep

595
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,606
until now.

596
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:23,646
Don't you think I'm using you?

597
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,406
Do you need to use me

598
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:29,926
when you really want to do something?

599
00:26:35,806 --> 00:26:37,046
I don't know about
business consideration,

600
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:38,846
but I trust you.

601
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:40,806
You aren't a person who
does things without principle

602
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,206
and is in a reckless manner.

603
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,366
But I can understand

604
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:45,766
their anger.

605
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,366
Consider a bit more for them

606
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:52,166
if you can.

607
00:26:57,726 --> 00:26:58,366
All right.

608
00:26:58,566 --> 00:26:59,766
I didn't ask you to consider it now.

609
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:01,126
Dig in.

610
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:05,206
Okay.

611
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:15,166
It's frightened me.

612
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:18,206
Are you afraid of that?

613
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,486
No way.

614
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,526
Wait.

615
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:29,086
Scare him!

616
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:30,006
He Xiaoran.

617
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,126
Stop. I'm going to be deaf.

618
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,326
Xiao Shangqi.

619
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:36,606
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

620
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:37,606
The winner pricks a balloon.

621
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:38,886
The loser drinks beer.

622
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,486
Bring it on. It's a deal.

623
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:45,806
Come on.

624
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:50,486
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Paper.

625
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:51,486
Drink it.

626
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,086
Come on.

627
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:01,846
Rock-paper-scissors.

628
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:03,886

Compared to all you've done

after coming to Jifeng,

658

today,

672

I really have nothing to worry.

673
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:04,006
Mr. Cheng.

674
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:07,086
This place has changed so much.

675
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,766
I almost can't recognize it.

676
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,326
Is this Mr. Xiao?

677
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:11,086
Yes.

678
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:12,406
He's Mr. Cheng.

679
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:13,806
An old customer of ours.

680
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:14,846
Executive Suite 806

681
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:16,206
is reserved just for him.

682
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:17,726
I'll leave you to talk.

683
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:19,126
Okay.

684
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:21,926
Nice to meet you, Mr. Cheng.

685
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:23,366
I'm Xiao Shangqi.

686
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:24,446
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

687
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:27,606
I heard you know this hotel

688
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:28,406
very well.

689
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:31,326
If it's about familiarity,

690
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,286
I should be more familiar than you do.

691
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,206
My wife liked Wusu very much.

692
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:38,606
More than ten years ago,

693
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,406
Jifeng was the one and only hotel
with a star rating

694
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:42,566
in Wusu.

695
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:44,966
We came for holidays every year.

696
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:48,006
Four years ago, my wife

697
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:49,326
came here to spend the last moment

698
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:50,846
of her life.

699
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:54,366
I'm sorry to hear that.

700
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,206
After so many years,

701
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:58,566
this is the first time
that I have the courage

702
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:00,206
to face our past.

703
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:01,366
Young man.

704
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:02,886
You're pretty amazing.

705
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:05,246
In such a short period of time,

706
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,966
you got Jifeng listed
on Black Pine Needle.

707
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,966
Had I known the news,

708
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,126
it could've saved your trouble of

709
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:12,806
helping to improve the hotel.

710
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:15,046
There are too few of sentimental buyers

711
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:16,246
somehow.

712
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:18,686
Indeed.

713
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,286
Hotels in many people's opinion

714
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,566
are just temporary stays.

715
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:25,886
Whether traveling or wandering,

716
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,766
it's a temporary escape

717
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:31,286
in the search

718
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:32,966
for the meaning of life.

719
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:34,726
Home

720
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:36,806
is their ultimate destination.

721
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:39,526
And the warmth of Jifeng Hotel

722
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:41,366
is hidden in

723
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:44,406
small corners.

724
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,566
I'll acquire this hotel

725
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:49,366
only to keep my memory in the suite.

726
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:51,886
Frankly,

727
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:54,006
I've actually engaged with some buyers

728
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,366
in this period.

729
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:57,526
You know Jifeng the best.

730
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,566
I trust you'll be able to keep it.

731
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,606
Do you like sweet and sour spare ribs?

732
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,366
In my age,

733
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:08,606
I should've given up the sweet tooth.

734
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:14,966
Extra dishes.

735
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:17,886
Please don't mind.

736
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:19,326
I let you come

737
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:20,726
to bid you a farewell.

738
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:21,726
It's not to deal with you.

739
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,086
I just want to take you

740
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:24,766
to the place

741
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,046
I like the most before you leave.

742
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:32,646
It certainly has a nice view.

743
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,526
I think I remember

744
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,526
the world's top-three night views.

745
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:40,446
They are Mount Hakodate in Hokkaido Japan,

746
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:42,046
Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong China,

747
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,326
and Napoli in Italy.

748
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:45,486
You must have been to all of them?

749
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,926
You've travelled a lot.

750
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:53,086
They're said to be
in the millions of dollars

751
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:55,046
range.

752
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:56,606
As for Wusu,

753
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:59,526
it should be worth

754
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:00,566
1,000 yuan.

755
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:03,606
Although this city

756
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:05,846
isn't as prosperous as Hupu,

757
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,286
it has the kind of

758
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:09,046
scarce warmth.

759
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,166
If you get too tired

760
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,406
in Hupu in the future,

761
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:13,326
think about this place.

762
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:14,966
I think its night view

763
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:16,245
is priceless.

764
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,366
That's a pretty high rating.

765
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:23,806
He Xiaoran.

766
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:28,446
I've decided to stay in Wusu.

767
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:34,126
However...

768
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,285
I can't sell the hotel to you.

769
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:38,886
Why?

770
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,366
I'll always keep

771
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:43,566
room 806 for you.

772
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:47,526
I want to run the hotel myself.

773
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:49,205
Just like you,

774
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:50,886
I also have

775
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:51,566
something I want to keep.

776
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:53,846
I couldn't leave it to others.

777
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,886
You're saying you want to stay in Wusu

778
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:05,606
and continue to run Jifeng?

779
00:35:08,246 --> 00:35:09,406
Are you kidding?

780
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:10,846
What about Hupu?

781
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,486
The truth is, all these years,

782
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:14,726
whether in Hupu

783
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,006
or overseas,

784
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:17,966
I stayed in the hotel alone.

785
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,686
So, no matter in which city,

786
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:22,806
I had no sense of belonging.

787
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:28,206
You've been alone?

788
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,566
Actually, to me,

789
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:34,366
it doesn't matter where it is

790
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:35,846
as long as I've done

791
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:38,126
what I need to do and
what I want to do.

792
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,406
As for Hupu,

793
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:45,606
there is nothing really worthwhile

794
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:47,366
for me to stay.

795
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,406
But here,

796
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:52,926
at least there's you.

797
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:00,926
Is it so hard to understand?

798
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:03,446
Actually, all these years,

799
00:36:03,646 --> 00:36:04,966
I've been listening to radio programs

800
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:05,846
to aid my sleep.

801
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:06,686
Now, I can

802
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:08,646
move and stay next to the radio station.

803
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,606
I can listen to your program every day.

804
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:13,166
What's better than this?

805
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:25,726
Hello.

806
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:26,766
He Xiaoran,

807
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:27,606
come back now.

808
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:28,566
I can't enter as I forgot the key.

809
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:29,286
Xiaoran,

810
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:30,766
it's okay. You don't need to come back.

811
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:32,726
No worries.

812
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:34,166
I'll be right back.

813
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:35,366
What are you doing? No.

814
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:36,686
Stop calling her.

815
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:37,566
How do we enter then?

816
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:38,406
Wait here.

817
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:39,646
She's dining.

818
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,406
I can't hold it anymore.

819
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,166
I'm sorry.

820
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,766
My housemate forgot to bring his key.

821
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:45,806
Sui Mingwei?

822
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:49,646
It's okay.

823
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:51,526
There's still a long time to come.

824
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,646
We still have plenty of time

825
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,406
to appreciate this priceless night view.

826
00:36:57,726 --> 00:36:58,526
Let's go.

827
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:00,606
I'll go and get the car here.

828
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:01,486
Wait for a while.

829
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:02,486
Never mind.

830
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:04,806
It's the time of heavy traffic.

831
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:06,766
I'll just take a shared bicycle.

832
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,446
Why did you still go to a supermarket

833
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:13,446
in the middle of the night?

834
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,366
I went to pick Hui up

835
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:19,086
and I bought some stuff for you.

836
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:20,326
It's Xiaoran's favorite.

837
00:37:20,526 --> 00:37:21,446
What does it have to do with me?

838
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:25,086
Don't you have Tang Yan

839
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,406
as your spiritual food?

840
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:27,806
Everything else

841
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:28,326
should be free.

842
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,166
I remember there are still a lot

843
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:30,846
in the house.

844
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:32,846
Just keep it.

845
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:34,086
Don't you girls

846
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:34,806
like to stock up things?

847
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:35,726
Don't be shy.

848
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:37,766
He's ruined the farewell dinner.

849
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:39,846
It's nothing.

850
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:42,246
Look at Xiaoran.

851
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:42,846
She's so broad-minded.

852
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:45,086
Isn't it just an old classmate?

853
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,006
Do you need to do so much
to say goodbye?

854
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,166
He said he won't be leaving.

855
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:55,086
What do you mean by that?

856
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:56,406
Has it been postponed?

857
00:37:57,046 --> 00:37:58,126
He said he wants to stay

858
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:00,206
and focus on running Jifeng.

859
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:04,526
Is it purely for work?

860
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,600
(Jifeng Hotel)

861
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:17,486
Mr. Cheng's price

862
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,446
was high enough.

863
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:19,406
Why did you reject it?

864
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:20,886
Don't be too greedy.

865
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:23,406
It's a good fight for Black Pine Needle,

866
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:24,726
but you should know

867
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:27,166
Jifeng merely has a good shell.

868
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,726
This should be the best time

869
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:31,206
to act.

870
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:32,686
Like you said,

871
00:38:33,286 --> 00:38:34,486
Jifeng needs a very long time

872
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,566
to really become

873
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:36,886
a quality hotel.

874
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:38,326
So, I've decided to stay

875
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:40,126
and continue to run Jifeng.

876
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:41,526
Qi,

877
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,206
I didn't cultivate you all these years

878
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:43,886
for you

879
00:38:44,126 --> 00:38:45,566
to pass time in a small place.

880
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,446
You took whichever move
launched by Zhao Mingxuan.

881
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,206
You'll always be in the passive state.

882
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,166
What's in your mind now?

883
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:52,286
Open up a new battlefield.

884
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:54,926
Turn defence into attack.
Double the counterattack.

885
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:57,006
Too ambitious.

886
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,046
All these years,

887
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:00,846
no matter what your purpose was,

888
00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:01,966
I've never

889
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,246
disobeyed your arrangements,

890
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,446
because I owed you that.

891
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:08,566
Why do you bring this up again?

892
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,006
Because this place

893
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:12,806
has something that I want to cherish.

894
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:14,686
But this time,

895
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,126
I want to continue to complete the game

896
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:18,806
in my way.

897
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:21,446
I promise you.

898
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:24,726
I won't let Yunlan lose.

899
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:42,166
Mingxuan.

900
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,486
Well...

901
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:44,686
Thank you.

902
00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:45,846
I'm sorry to have troubled you

903
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:47,086
on Qi's matters.

904
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:49,646
You gave him such a good chance

905
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:50,566
to practise.

906
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:51,766
You let him practise in Wusu.

907
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:52,886
I'm really thankful.

908
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:55,286
Uncle Xiao.

909
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:57,046
I've just taken over the group.

910
00:39:57,326 --> 00:39:58,326
I'd be a bit overwrought.

911
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,246
No.

912
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,446
Hotel business

913
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:02,326
is your family's largest segment.

914
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:04,766
I've been asking a lot lately.

915
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,286
Forgive me if I've ever

916
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:07,286
offended you.

917
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:08,446
No.

918
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,606
I know you're worried that

919
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:12,606
Yunlan is a long-established enterprise,

920
00:40:12,926 --> 00:40:14,606
and its old-fashioned thinking

921
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:15,686
can't keep up

922
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:16,966
with the thinking of you youngsters.

923
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:18,126
But Qi

924
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:19,166
should've gained much knowledge

925
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,966
after being abroad for so many years.

926
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:23,406
You can be assured of it.

927
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:24,806
Yes.

928
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:26,326
Okay. Thank you.

929
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:27,406
Okay.

930
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,526
Yunlan is certainly one of the top

931
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,406
operating companies.

932
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:37,726
We thought

933
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:38,846
it's a hot potato.

934
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:40,966
But in Xiao Shangqi's hands,

935
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,486
he turned waste into precious.

936
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,726
I heard he's staying in Wusu.

937
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,686
I knew Qi could be a great person

938
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:47,806
ever since he was still a child.

939
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,006
He wasn't trained much.

940
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:50,406
He's so good at business

941
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:51,726
as soon as he gets started.

942
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,206
What a business talent.

943
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:03,726
Mingxuan.

944
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:04,886
(Younger Zhao Mingxuan)
Mingxuan, are you okay?

945
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:05,806
Mingxuan.

946
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:06,646
It's Xiao family who's always in

947
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:07,606
the limelight.

948
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,606
Why are you so stupid?

949
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,926
You stuttered when you spoke
only a few words on the stage.

950
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:14,366
It's okay. He's still young.

951
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,806
Young? Let's not mention Xiao Xian.

952
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,646
Xiao Shangqi is few years younger
than him.

953
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,126
He's always above him.

954
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:21,846
From tomorrow onwards,

955
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,566
hire a teacher to teach him
public speaking.

956
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:25,646
Don't eat and don't sleep
unless he speaks well.

957
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:27,286
He sleeps

958
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:28,326
only five to six hours every day.

959
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,566
What else do you want?

960
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,846
A loving mother always spoils her son.

961
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:32,406
You...

962
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:33,486
Don't blame mother.

963
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:34,966
I'll work hard.

964
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:00,700
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

965
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:11,366
Hello.

966
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:13,326
Okay.

967
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:14,726
Wait a moment.

968
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:15,606
Let me check.

969
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:22,486
I used to see this phrase.

970
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,486
The person you're waiting

971
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,806
may see you again

972
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,766
and come back to you.

973
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:31,126
(In fact, a reunion)

974
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:32,286
(after a long time)

975
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,206
(is not repeating the same mistake,)

976
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:36,446
(but a good greeting.)

977
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:39,726
(This)

978
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:41,686
(will be the last song tonight.)

979
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:43,686
(I dedicate it to the young friend)

980
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,966
(who's just called in.)

981
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:48,526
This is Dajiabang For Everyone.

982
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:49,886
See you next time.

983
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:00,406
I'm not that late, right?

984
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:01,886
No.

985
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,366
Come on. What's the mission?

986
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,926
I just wanted to ask you out
for some food.

987
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:08,606
Here?

988
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:09,446
Since I want to stay in

989
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:10,966
Wusu for good,

990
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:13,526
I need to know more about this city

991
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:14,846
and be part of this life.

992
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:16,326
So,

993
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:18,246
I want to be part

994
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:19,326
of your life first,

995
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,526
is that okay?
