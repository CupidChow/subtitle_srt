17
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:40,497
Mr. He.

18
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,217
You're pretty sneaky.

19
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:49,977
This is final.

20
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:52,257
What I want to do

21
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,177
is to give you all

22
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:55,017
some good positions.

23
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:56,737
Tell me.

24
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:58,617
Where are you going after

25
00:01:58,897 --> 00:01:59,377
settling us?

26
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,177
You're getting promoted, right?

27
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,217
I pray you'll go far, Mr. He.

28
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:19,937
Enough.

29
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:34,777
Xiaoran,

30
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:37,497
ever since you left,

31
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:39,417
it feels like Dajiabang

32
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,577
is slowly dissolving.

33
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:59,737
Sui Mingwei told me

34
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,297
he'll be on leave for a few days.

35
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:03,777
At that time, I was summoned.

36
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,937
They said it was to let the

37
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,217
old timers rest before a promotion.

38
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:11,617
I thought about it.
This is a form of motivation, too.

39
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,657
Look at Li Hui.

40
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:15,457
She's not doing well either.

41
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:16,737
So,

42
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:19,617
I sent both of them off.

43
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:21,737
Did you also just find out

44
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:22,857
about the personnel change?

45
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:26,737
Not really.

46
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,377
After they both left,

47
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:31,177
I felt something was wrong.

48
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:32,937
Wenwen just won't listen to me.

49
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,377
We had to vote

50
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:35,977
on everything.

51
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,217
The newcomers

52
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:39,857
would always be on her side.

53
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,177
Is there nothing

54
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:42,097
we can do to

55
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,017
turn Dajiabang around?

56
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,017
I'll speak to Liu.

57
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,857
Don't meddle in this.

58
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:52,497
It won't be good to you

59
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:53,897
if this gets to the TV station.

60
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,017
I just don't want Wusu

61
00:03:58,457 --> 00:03:59,377
to lose

62
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:00,297
all its charm.

63
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,217
Did something happen with you?

64
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:07,057
No.

65
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:09,897
Everything has a life span.

66
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,897
Our show had its glory days.

67
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:15,737
No matter how we hold on,

68
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,297
we can't return to how it was.

69
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,737
It's time to end it.

70
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:26,097
Dajiabang

71
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,337
has been managed by me
all my life.

72
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:36,297
It's time to end it.

73
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:43,337
Then,

74
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,257
what are your plans?

75
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:45,737
What about Feng?

76
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:47,417
Feng?

77
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,457
He's pretty sharp.

78
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:50,897
I heard

79
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:51,577
he applied a job in

80
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:52,897
a software company.
His next job is secured.

81
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:56,177
Sui and I have decided.

82
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:57,977
He's returning to his family's
fragrance factory.

83
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,257
I'm done here, too.

84
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,217
I'll go work for Hao

85
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:01,857
if anything.

86
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:03,897
I thought you can't
play the guitar anymore.

87
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,097
I can serve dishes.

88
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,137
I wanted to quit this place long ago.

89
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:14,897
Mr. He doesn't say it,

90
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,097
but I can tell

91
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,657
he's upset about it.

92
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:18,657
Dajiabang was

93
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,777
his baby, too.

94
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,737
He ended it

95
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:22,657
with his own hands.

96
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:25,617
All right.

97
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:27,097
What's the big issue?

98
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:29,057
Only Mr. He cares about it.

99
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,297
He retired early because of this.

100
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,697
Silly, right?

101
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:37,097
All right.

102
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:40,057
I shouldn't misunderstand him.

103
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:41,697
I'll invite everyone

104
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:42,497
out for his farewell dinner

105
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:43,537
one day.

106
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:44,137
It will do.

107
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,457
A farewell party.

108
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:47,657
I'll also apologise to him.

109
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,377
I thought all the problems

110
00:05:58,097 --> 00:05:58,657
would be solved

111
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,697
after returning to Wusu.

112
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,417
Now that I think of it,

113
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,177
maybe

114
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:07,297
the previous Wusu

115
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:08,617
doesn't exist anymore.

116
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:15,897
Why didn't Xiao Shangqi

117
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:16,897
return last night?

118
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:19,457
Did something happen?

119
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,217
I heard Lin Zong

120
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:24,257
say that he called him

121
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,777
to arrange the upcoming work.

122
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,377
I understood then.

123
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,977
He has so much

124
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,857
to deal with at Hupu.

125
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,097
Or maybe Chen Fei'er

126
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:37,817
is not

127
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:38,897
letting him go.

128
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:40,617
He has to take care

129
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:41,737
of his family business, too.

130
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,377
I was confident at first.

131
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,897
I trusted that I had

132
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:48,737
a special place in his heart.

133
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:49,897
So, I gave him one week

134
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,977
to settle everything.

135
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,017
But as time passed,

136
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,897
my confidence waned.

137
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,257
The special place he had

138
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,657
in my heart also shrunk.

139
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,137
Did you know?

140
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:06,897
Last night, he suddenly said

141
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:07,777
he'll come back early.

142
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:08,937
I was overjoyed.

143
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:12,217
In the end, he didn't.

144
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,177
I told myself.

145
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:23,097
There is no

146
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:24,097
wrong choice for him.

147
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:25,737
I should respect his decision.

148
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:29,297
As the days go by,

149
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,057
I feel like

150
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:33,977
I've been abandoned

151
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:34,817
by him.

152
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:42,937
All right.

153
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:44,217
Don't you still have

154
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,297
a seven-day promise?

155
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,217
Maybe something

156
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:48,617
came up last night.

157
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:49,337
Forget it.

158
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:50,897
What could have happened?

159
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,857
If anything, he shouldn't

160
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,657
just apologize and

161
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,377
make Xiaoran wait here.

162
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:57,497
Eat your food.

163
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,217
How can you drink with a cold?

164
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:04,177
It's just a little. It's fine.

165
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:05,937
Let me pour you a glass.

166
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:06,617
Let me pour you a glass.

167
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:12,857
Here.

168
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:23,977
Xiaoran.

169
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:25,297
Come home with us.

170
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:27,937
No need. I'll call a taxi.

171
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:31,377
I'm saying, move back in with us.

172
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,097
It's boring for you to

173
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:33,896
live alone in that big house.

174
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,177
Didn't I tell you before?

175
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:36,977
The loft is

176
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:38,097

198
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:02,337
there was a document

for Jifeng here at Mr. Xiao's place.

218
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:01,617
No.

your best red wine.

Mr. Zhao.

Make this quick.

224
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,417
Mr. Gao, it's nothing.

225
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:19,897
I just wanted us

226
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,337
to get to know each other.

227
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:24,017
Mr. Zhao, are you in a better mood now?

00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,417

229
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:26,817
you've been doing a lot.

230
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:29,417
But, Xiao Shangqi is

231
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,657
pretty daring.

232
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,857
This scheme of trickery

233
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:34,497

with a beauty.

235
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,377
I wouldn't dare work

236
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:38,697
with someone like that.

237
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:39,977
What do you think, Mr. Gao?

238
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,177
Mr. Gao,

239
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,137
are you planning to

240
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,137
work together with Yunlan?

241
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:53,057
Yes, that's right.

242
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:54,377
Mr. Gao,

243
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:55,777
I advise you to be

244
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,377
cautious at this time.

245
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:58,737
Now that Xiao Zhenyun is gone.

246
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,697
Yunlan has lost its pillar.

247
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:02,177
Look at Yunlan Hotel.

248
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:03,617
What has it become?

249
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,417
Who would dare work

250
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:07,297
with them in our industry?

251
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:10,177
Also, Mr. Gao,

252
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:11,697
I've already found

253
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,497
a better operator.

254
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,417
They are better than
Yunlan in every aspect.

255
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:17,777
If you need,

256
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:19,537
I can recommend them to you.

257
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:25,697
We've found her.

258
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:35,617
You should know

259
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:36,497
(Call log)
some of these people.

260
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,617
(Call log)
You may not know some of them.

261
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:41,657
For example, Mr. Zheng Haoping

262
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:43,217
(Zheng Haoping, Wang Song)
is Yunlan's

(Ji Gaojie, Jia Yangyang)
top official.

264
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,137
He was the groomsman
at our parents' wedding.

265
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:48,777
This is Mr. Wang Song.

266
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,417
Father helped him

267
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:51,497
in his greatest time of need.

268
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:52,937
He would pay us a visit

270
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,577
with his family.

271
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:56,897

It's father's last journey.

274
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:11,017
I didn't invite

275
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,377
his business partners

276
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:13,377

278
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:16,537
(Xu Haohao, Zhang Chaoyang)
fought beside father

279
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:17,257
all along.

280
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,337
These were the items

281
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:25,737
your father used often.

(Happy birthday

287
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,497
father loved to use

288
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:05,337
this as a bookmark.

289
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,017
This was the birthday card

290
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:10,777
we made for him.

291
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:11,897
Yes.

After that incident that year,

294
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:18,497
we've stopped celebrating

295
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,697
his birthday with him.

296
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:25,217
I remember that

297
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:27,537
you kept complaining

298
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,337
about how hard it was to

299
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,457
(Happy birthday Xiao Xian Xiao ShangQ)
write your name.

300
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,737
You would replace it with
an English letter.

301
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:35,417
He would reprimand you

302
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:38,057
and say you can't dismiss this.

303
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,017
He was always strict.

304
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,657
A Qilin is a sign of luck.

305

Ever since you were born,

307
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:57,097
he had

308
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,257
high hopes in you.

309
00:14:59,017 --> 00:14:59,537
Truly.

310
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,897
I misunderstood him too much.

311
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:09,697
It's too late to know it now.

312
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,297
Look at how clumsy I am.

313
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:17,617
I was tidying up

314
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,177
his items

315
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,137
to take with him,

316
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,377
but I broke

317
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:23,537
his flower vase.

318
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,337
How could he leave just like that?

320
00:15:58,497 --> 00:15:59,617

really knows how to find a good spot.

322
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,257
I can't reach him anymore.

323
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,497
Xiao Zhenyun died.

324
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,617
He wouldn't have time for you.

325
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,337
Do you know why I came to see you?

326
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:18,897
You're worried that

327
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:20,537
I would speak to the journalists

328
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:23,017
and expose your true colors.

329
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:27,937

330
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:30,697
You don't have to be

331
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,137
so hostile with me.

332
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:35,337
You were with me for a few years.

333
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:36,657
I nearly married you.

334
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:38,497
I like you.

335
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:42,377
It was all fated.

336
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:44,977
I know.

337
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:46,817
You feel that

338
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:47,777
with the news you have about me in hand,

339
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:50,857
it would be of some value,

340
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:51,417
right?

341
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:55,977
I'm not that dumb.

342
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:58,777
I won't do stupid things

343
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:00,337
for small benefits.

344
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:05,897
Mingxuan,

345
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,576
I've lost everything.

346
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,457
I don't have anywhere to go
and I don't have anyone to rely on.

347
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,377
All these years, I was

348
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,657
sincere to you.

349
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:19,377
I put in the effort.

350
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:21,657
To be honest,

351
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,417
what did I do wrong in this wedding?

352
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:25,617
I was just a pawn everyone

353
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:26,457
sacrificed.

354
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,097
If you keep silent,

355
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,577
I won't harass you.

356
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:35,537
Or

357
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:39,737
I'll give you a choice.

358
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,097
Come back to me.

359
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,497
What do you mean?

360
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:53,737
Didn't you say

361
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:54,777
you were sacrificed?

362
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,017
I think you're

363
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,057
the spoils

364
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:02,417
in this battle

365
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:04,897
between Xiao Shangqi and I.

366
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:10,937
You won't become

367
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:12,417
Mrs. Zhao.

368
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:14,577
Just be with me.

369
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,897
You don't have to worry
for the rest of your life.

370
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:17,697
We'll live

371
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,537
our lives accordingly.

372
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,177
Anyway,

373
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:22,017
you've been with me for many years

374
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,297
and you're not useless.

375
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,177
As for your parents,

376
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,217
I'll deal with them

377
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,337
separately.

378
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,337
I won't let them harass you.

379
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:36,697
Why?

380
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:43,617
Don't tell me

381
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:47,737
a woman like you

382
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,497
would care about titles?

383
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:12,097
When you've decided,

384
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:15,417
call me.

385
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,040
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

386
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,200
(Mourning)

387
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:20,137
Sui.

388
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:23,777
What are you doing?

389
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:26,257
Last night,

390
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:28,137
I had too much to drink.

391
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:29,777
Why did I come here?

392
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,457
Did you sleep here all night?

393
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,657
He was afraid you would
do something stupid.

394
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,137
He came here to watch over you
at midnight.

395
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:37,097
He would leave before you go to work.

396
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,897
You overslept today.

397
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,377
What are you talking about?

398
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,537
This is what friends

399
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:43,137
should do.

400
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,297
It's nothing embarrassing.

401
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,097
Look at you two.

402
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:47,377
I bought breakfast for you two.

403
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:48,017
Eat up.

404
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:50,137
Come quickly. You must be freezing.

405
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:55,857
Hui, this guitar...

406
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,617
I took the guitar back.

407
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,017
Even if I don't want the job
in the radio station,

408
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:09,017
I can't be

409
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,337
a waitress, right?

410
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,497
I want to try again.

411
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:15,537
Let me show you.

412
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:30,177
That's not right.

413
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:35,977
Don't panic.

414
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:37,697
It's early. You're up,

415
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:39,137
but the guitar isn't.

416
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:40,177
Do it slowly.

417
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:41,257
Yes.

418
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:44,537
Let me try again.

I wasn't confident.

But, I really wanted to

439

I can do it,

440
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,697

All right.

00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:06,257
Wait for me.

Hui.

How did you do it suddenly?

449
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:17,097
I was over it in Hupu.

450
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,137
Maybe because

451
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:19,497
I didn't have the guitar there.

452
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:20,537
That's enough.

453
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:22,017
You didn't take this

454
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,537
back this morning, right?

All these years,

469
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:55,337
I've never made him happy.

470
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:58,737
Now, it's too late.

471
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:06,977
Mr. Xiao Shangqi,

472
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:08,617
we included

473
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:09,297
our employees' contacts

474
00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:09,817
in all the invitations

475
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:10,497
we sent out.

476
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:12,097
There will be someone to receive guests.

477
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:13,857
Now, let us vet through the

478
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:15,137
program for the funeral.

479
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:17,217
Once it starts, we'll play
the mourning music.

480
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,697
Then, all rise

481
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,257
and bow to the body.

482
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:22,897
Presentation of flowers and
then the eulogy.

483
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,257
How is it?

484
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:33,057
He must be busy.

485
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:37,097
(Xiaoran.)

486
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:39,057
(Can you give me some time?)

487
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,017
(How long?)

488
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:41,817
(Seven days.)

489
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:43,817
Should I stop

490
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:44,897
finding him excuses?

491
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:48,697
Seven days have passed.

492
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:43,577
A few days ago,

493
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:48,697
I listened in to Goodnight.

494
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:52,777
I thought Dajiabang

495
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:53,497
is over when

496
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,817
it passes to Wenwen,

497
00:26:57,937 --> 00:26:59,137
but it's not bad.

498
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:02,937
The content was good and edgy.

499
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:05,737
I looked at the official page.

500
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:07,657
The fans like her.

501
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:10,137
That's because of

502
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:12,217
the good foundation we built.

503
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:15,737
To be honest,

504
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:17,657
that lady

505
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:19,257
is pretty talented.

506
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:27,457
After I returned,

507
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:31,457
I realized that the things

508
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:32,177
I wanted to protect

509
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:33,257
are no longer here.

510
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,897
Dajiabang seems to

511
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,177
no longer exist,

512
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,457
but in fact, it's getting better.

513
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:51,257
Maybe some things

514
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:52,257
are like that.

515
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:56,617
Only after you let go,

516
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,257
then you'll both grow.

517
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:05,337
All right.

518
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:15,297
Can you take me back?

519
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,297
Of course.

520
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:19,497
We welcome you anytime.

521
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,097
Seriously.

522
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:25,417
Let's go.

523
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:27,977
What are you waiting for?

524
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:28,897
Go pack your things.

525
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:29,857
We'll move today.

526
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:43,657
Why aren't they here yet?

527
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:49,057
Let's wait a little longer.

528
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,000
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

529
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,257
Hello.

530
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:20,417
This is a small token from

531
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:21,777
Mr. Zheng Haoping.

532
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:23,577
He can't make it today.

533
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,937
All right. Help me thank Mr. Zheng.

534
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:35,137
Mr. Xiao Shangqi.

535
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,137
Mr. Wang Song called and said

536
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:38,377
he can't make it personally.

537
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,377
Mr. Liu Wen called and said

538
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:41,777
he's ill.

539
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:44,777
Mr. Xiao Shangqi,

540
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,577
should we call

541
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:47,377
the rest on the guest list

542
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,937
to check?

543
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:50,057
No need.

544
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:55,257
Out of sight, out of heart.

545
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,537
Father was proud all his life.

546
00:29:58,857 --> 00:29:59,577
Who knew no one

547
00:29:59,737 --> 00:30:01,297
would come to his funeral?

548
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,260
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

549
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:12,857
Xian.

550
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,457
First bow.

551
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,940
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

552
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,497
Bow again.

553
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,100
(Xiao Zhenyun, Bai Yunying)

554
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,817
Third bow.

555
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:56,777
Xian.

556
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:01,257
From now on,

557
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:04,777
it's just the two of us.

558
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:33,937
Mr. Gao.

559
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:34,697
Mr. Gao.

560
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:37,937
At this time,

561
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,537
no one is willing

562
00:31:40,937 --> 00:31:42,297
to offend Deju openly.

563
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:44,937
The same goes for me.

564
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:50,177
Thank you for coming.

565
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:52,497
I've known your father for many years.

566
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:54,257
I didn't think

567
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,097
he would pass away so suddenly.

568
00:31:57,177 --> 00:31:58,617
I came to see you two.

569
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:02,257
My condolences to you both.

570
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:05,817
Mr. Gao.

571
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:07,537
We have a contract signing

572
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:08,697
in the company this afternoon.

573
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:13,377
Talking about business,

574
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:16,977
in view of the group's interests,

575
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:19,257
our intention to work with you

576
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:20,697
should be temporarily

577
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:23,537
put aside.

578
00:32:24,297 --> 00:32:24,777
Mr. Gao.

579
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:25,657
Qi,

580
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,377
I truly admire you.

581
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:29,017
To be honest,

582
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:32,257
you showed your thorns too early.

583
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:34,777
You must remember. In business,

584
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:36,057
at any time,

585
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:38,817
you must not show all your cards.

586
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:41,137
You hold a huge responsibility

587
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:43,537
in this current mess.

588
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:46,457
Learn your lesson.

589
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:50,457
However, every trough

590
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:52,497
may have a hidden chance

591
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,617
to break through.

592
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:56,777
I'll leave first.

593
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:16,537
Do you still want these?

594
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:17,737
If this isn't enough,

595
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:19,017
I'll look for a box.

596
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:21,977
Let's not take these.

597
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:22,617
We'll throw them out.

598
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:29,057
Xiaoran,

599
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:30,497
what about these?

600
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:36,137
There must be an order
to tidying things.

601
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,297
I may still

602
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:38,017
need this box.

603
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:38,737
If you put it like that,

604
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:39,697
I can't reach it.

605
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:40,537
When you need it,

606
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:41,337
I'll be here.

607
00:33:42,337 --> 00:33:42,897
Let me carry you.

608
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:46,657
All right.

609
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,417
I got it.

610
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:50,897
You're so scheming.

611
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,417
I don't want it anymore.

612
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,057
Mr. Gao

613
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,257
is Yunlan's final hope, right?

614
00:35:02,697 --> 00:35:03,377
If even he is unwilling

615
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:04,457
to help,

616
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:05,977
the rest wouldn't dare

617
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,137
offend Zhao Mingxuan.

618
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:12,297
Thank you for sending my father off.

619
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,537
Be it appreciation or apology,

620
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,457
leave it to me.

621
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,417
I've checked out of the hotel.

622
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:22,257
You were right.

623
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:24,977
I must think of my future plan.

624
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:28,697
This is your choice.

625
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,377
No need to tell me.

626
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:32,617
What do you mean?

627
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,377
Did Zhao Mingxuan tell you

628
00:35:36,097 --> 00:35:37,417
about my father's death?

629
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,657
You're here today

630
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:42,777
to check if

631
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:43,777
I have lost to him totally.

632
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,417
This is to help you decide

633
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,057
whether to choose him or not.

634
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:50,177
Am I right?

635
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:53,897
Shangqi.

636
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:56,257
Reality is always biased

637
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:58,737
towards the ruthless ones, right?

638
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:03,697
I have to go now.

639
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:05,977
I have another question.

640
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:11,257
Was your wish sincere

641
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:13,417
in that

642
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:15,577
time capsule?

643
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:19,857
When I was 18 years old,

644
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:21,857
it was.

645
00:36:26,737 --> 00:36:27,417
But now,

646
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:30,257
I only love He Xiaoran

647
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,017
alone.

648
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:41,537
This is Mr. Xiao's

649
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:42,737
will.

650
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,217
According to his wishes,

651
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,297
the elder son, Xiao Xian,

652
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:48,097
will inherit the Xiao family's villa.

653
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:49,577
The remainder will be split equally.

654
00:36:50,337 --> 00:36:50,937
This is the division

655
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:51,857
of shares in Yunlan.

656
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:52,777
If you both

657
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:53,697
have any questions,

658
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:54,697
you can call me anytime.

659
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:57,377
All right. Thank you.

660
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:58,697
My condolences.

661
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,417
The view here is great.

662
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,417
Our parents are finally together again

663
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:12,337
to rest.

664
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:16,137
Qi.

665
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,777
Father did his will last time

666
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:20,057
and didn't have time to change it.

667
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:22,697
That's why I have more shares.

668
00:37:22,697 --> 00:37:23,497
I don't care about this.

669
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,577
Yunlan is in a mess.

670
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:32,937
I don't know how long

671
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:33,897
we can hold on.

672
00:37:35,497 --> 00:37:36,177
There's something I always

673
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,337
wanted to ask.

674
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:39,497
Have you called He Xiaoran?

675
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,617
In view of this,

676
00:37:42,217 --> 00:37:43,057
you may not be able to

677
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,337
return to Wusu soon.

678
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:46,137
Will she understand?

679
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:49,337
So many things happened so suddenly.

680
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:50,697
I don't know how

681
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:52,057
to tell her either.

682
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:55,577
I know what she wants,

683
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:57,897
but I can't even give her something

684
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,057
as simple as company.

685
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,097
I feel like I keep

686
00:38:02,257 --> 00:38:02,977
disappointing her.

687
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:05,697
Qi.

688
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:07,177
Xian.

689
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,217
I have doubts over father's death.

690
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,777
Things are uncertain with Yunlan.

691
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,377
I would only

692
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:21,057
make her worry

693
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,097
by telling her all these.

694
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:26,817
Do you still suspect Zhao Mingxuan?

695
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:31,257
We don't have concrete evidence,

696
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,177
but he's the prime suspect.

697
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:38,057
He has an ulterior motive.

698
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:39,537
It's not easy to

699
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:40,977
find something on him.

700
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:42,857
But Qi,

701
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:43,897
listen to me.

702
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:45,537
The first thing we must do

703
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,377
is to protect Yunlan.

704
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:49,377
All right?

705
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:04,577
Miss Chen,

706
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:06,057
why are you back here?

707
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:08,937
I'm just here for a bit.

708
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,177
I won't disrupt your work.

709
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,977
Mingxuan is at work.

710
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,097
You don't have to tell him.

711
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:15,457
I can't do that.

712
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:16,457
If something happens,

713
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:17,817
I'll get in trouble.

714
00:39:18,377 --> 00:39:20,617
The passcode hasn't changed.

715
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:21,857
You're heading out to get groceries.

716
00:39:22,017 --> 00:39:23,137
Pretend you didn't see me.

717
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:24,617
Well...

718
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:29,017
Madam Wang.

719
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:32,457
How did I treat you?

720
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:34,937
I'll be out for half an hour.

721
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:35,937
Don't

722
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:37,137
take anything.

723
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:39,937
All right.

724
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:22,217
Didn't you say half...

725
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:25,937
Mingxuan.

726
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,337
What are you doing here?

727
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:32,457
I came to look for you.

728
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:33,617
For me?

729
00:40:33,977 --> 00:40:35,337
I feel a little sad living

730
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:36,257
outside for so many days.

731
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:38,297
I came back to get some clothes.

732
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:48,697
Have you decided?

733
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:52,657
After going to the cemetery today,

734
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,217
I get it now.

735
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:56,537
You went to Xiao Zhenyun's funeral?

736
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:03,617
What do you think?

737
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:05,217
Pretty sad.

738
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:08,577
Xiao Shangqi's stubbornness

739
00:41:08,737 --> 00:41:10,057
will only hurt himself

740
00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:12,137
and those around him.

741
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:15,297
Why do I feel like

742
00:41:16,697 --> 00:41:18,017
you still care for him?

743
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:19,817
I just think

744
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,417
you're stronger than I thought.

745
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:24,577
You're more ruthless, too.

746
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:26,817
I pity him.

747
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:28,537
Although he

748
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:29,697
doesn't love me,

749
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:32,097
he has done

750
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,617
a lot for me.

751
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:36,937
Based on what I heard,

752
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:39,777
I think

753
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,697
you didn't make the right choice.

754
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:45,217
Is it even a choice?

755
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:49,697
Of course, it's you.

756
00:41:52,897 --> 00:41:53,777
I don't need a title.

757
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,857
Mingxuan, I just want to be with you.

758
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:00,737
Think twice.

759
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:02,977
Once you've made this decision,

760
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:05,057
you're officially

761
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:07,937
on opposing teams with Xiao Shangqi.

762
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:11,017
I can't place my bets

763
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:12,657
on a losing game

764
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:14,977
over past feelings, right?

765
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:19,257
Also,

766
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:22,257
when we were together,

767
00:42:22,937 --> 00:42:24,857
we were happy,

768
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,097
right?

769
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:32,137
Fei'er,

770
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,337
I didn't think you were

771
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:35,577
this head-over-heels

772
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:40,297
for me.

773
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,097
But Fei'er,

774
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:49,217
you're right.

775
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:51,777
You coming back to me

776
00:42:52,977 --> 00:42:54,177
makes me feel like

777
00:42:56,497 --> 00:43:00,137
beating him just gets more interesting.
