I'm Xiaoran's high school classmate.

19
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:44,433
Now, I'm an employee in Jifeng.

20
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:48,033
So, Mr. Lin

21
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:48,873
is your superior.

22
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,033
No wonder you're taking care of his son.

23
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:54,793
Yes.

24
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:56,073
Li Hui is making a video call.

00:01:59,153 --> 00:01:59,673
Hui.

26
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:01,153
Congratulations.

27
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,993
I have a performance tomorrow.

28
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,433
So, I can't be there.

29
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:05,193
I'll drink here with you.

30
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:05,553
Come on.

31
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:06,713
Come on.

32
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:07,553
Thank you. Cheers.

00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:14,313
Yes, Sui is here as well.

35
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,033
Here.

36
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:16,593
Talk to her.

37
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:21,593
New clothes?

38
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:24,113
I bought this earlier.

39
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:25,513
It's nice.

40
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,073
Okay, go ahead and eat first.

41
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:35,873
I'm not going to disturb you all.

42
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,033
I'm hanging up. Bye.

43
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:42,713
Won't you chat with her?

44
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,073
That's wine.

45
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:49,313
Drink slowly.

Are you not happy?

50
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:06,313
I need to

51
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,113
discuss something with you later.

52
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:08,513
Okay.

53
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:09,473

54
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:09,793
Okay.

00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:07,433
I'm not going in.

60
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:09,313
Wait for me. I'll send you home.

61
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,153
No need. I'll get a taxi.

62
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,313
Feng thought that we're

63
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:15,273
seeing each other.

64
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:17,392
Are you upset about that?

65
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:21,833
No.

66
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:23,033
Why did you...

67
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:26,633
Lin Zong.

68
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,353
I know

69
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,513
you actually treat me well.

70
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,473
I like you, too.

71
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:34,233
You and Taiyang have really

72
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:35,193
made me feel the warmth

73
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,193
like sunlight.

74
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,113
I enjoy it so much.

75
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,753
But I realised today that

76
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:44,553
something is not right.

77
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:47,913
What's not right?

78
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:52,673
Let's not talk about this now.

79
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,153
Bring Taiyang in and get him to bed.

80
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,113
Don't catch a cold.

81
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:56,113
I'm going home now.

83
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:05,713
Xiaoran,

84
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,273
you're getting ready to start
the marriage leave tomorrow?

85
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,193
I'm handling over my work.

86
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,233
I've already applied

87
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,233
leave.

88
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,353
Is there anything?

89
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,473
I've discussed with Lili

90
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:19,673
and we want you

91
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:20,673
to have the right

92
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,953
to choose for yourself.

93
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:34,433
What's the matter?

94
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,553
Are you not happy?

95
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:38,833
No.

the substitution of the journalist

99
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:52,513
of the international station
in Li Country.

100
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:54,193
But she got pregnant

101
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,193
and she can't make it.

102
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:57,393
We need someone to replace her.

103
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,313
The flight takes off

104
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,193
at 8 p.m. tomorrow.

105
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,153
We need to go to Shenzhen

106
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,553
to do an internal training

107
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,113
for a week

108
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,153
and depart in batches.

109
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:13,313
I...

110
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:16,673
- You want to go?
- I...

111
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,073
I want to go.

112
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:23,953
What if I said no?

113
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,033
I know this is

114
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:27,953
rather sudden,

115
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,313
but you know that

116
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:30,513
becoming a war correspondent

117
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,313
has always been my dream.

118
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,553
We've also been through

119
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:35,833
so many things.

120
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,993
I believe the long-distance relationship

121
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:39,473
will not affect our love,

122
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:42,353
but we may not be able to meet

123
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:43,713
for a while.

124
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,593
It could be half a year.

125
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:47,993
It could be a year.

126
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:50,233
What about our wedding?

127
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:51,273
Wait for me to come back.

128
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,553
We'll get the marriage certificate

129
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,953
and resume the road trip

130
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,353
when I'm back,

131
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:57,073
okay?

132
00:06:58,073 --> 00:06:58,873
No.

133
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:01,953
I don't agree with that.

134
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:03,953
Xiaoran.

135
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:05,353
I know

136
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:06,633
a war correspondent sounds cool,

137
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,473
but do you know how dangerous it is?

138
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:10,673
This is not about the distance

139
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,913
and the marriage certificate.

140
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,233
I don't want to lose you anymore.

141
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:20,113
I know.

142
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:22,913
Xiao Shangqi.

143
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:28,593

144
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:29,553
Take a rest first.

145
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,233
I was carrying stuff

146
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:45,793
so I didn't see your message.

147
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:47,593
Just stay where you are.

148

306
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:40,793
He's just absent for a while.

307
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:42,993
It's because of Mr. Sui

308

that the retail is doing well.

309
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:47,633
Am I angry about that
he's absent?

310
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,673
I'm angry because
he's such a coward now.

311
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,593
He's no longer

312

brave and carefree.

313
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:53,873
You're nothing like

314

315

I haven't finished talking.

316
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,033
I dare you to get her back.

317
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,033
Don't you think Mr. Sui

318
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:06,153
is different now?

319
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,913
What are you talking about?
Carry on with the meeting.

320
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,273
Mr. Hua, Miss Li,

321
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,753
I'm Chen Fei'er from Xinrui Advertising.

322
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:13,633
If your company

323
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:14,753
needs anything for your publication,

324
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,273
you can contact me.

325
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:18,553
I'll leave you be.

326
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:21,433
I'll leave you be.

327
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:50,393
It's been a while.

328
00:21:58,473 --> 00:21:59,193
How's Taiyang doing?

329
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:00,753
He's fine.

330
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,913
He's about to graduate
from the kindergarten.

331
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:04,873
How are you?

332
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:08,313
I'm now working in Xinrui Advertising's

333
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:08,913
marketing department.

334
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,793
Business development manager?

335
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:14,273
Not bad.

336
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:16,713
I thought

337
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:18,393
you've left this city.

338
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:19,673
I didn't know that you're still in Wusu.

339
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:24,713
Taiyang's about to
celebrate his birthday.

340
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:26,833
How did you know that?

341
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,513
Look at you.

342
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:33,273
Taiyang always sends me messages

343
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,193
using your mobile phone

344
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:35,313
and you're not aware of that.

345
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:37,633
Really?

346
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,153
Don't take it personally.

347
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:41,553
I'll scold him later.

348
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:43,393
Well,

349
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:44,793
see you then.

350
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,313
The children's restaurant
on the Peixin Street.

351
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:01,273
How did it go?

352
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:31,674
(From He Xiaoran who is missing you)

353
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,153
(The place where I am now)

354
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:47,233
(is the refugee camp.)

355
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,713
(Let us take a closer look)

356
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:50,033
(at their current situation.)

357
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:52,433
(Although the condition is poor,)

358
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:53,393
(they're still)

359
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:54,633
(hanging children's
pictures and paintings)

360
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:55,953
(on the walls.)

361
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:57,713
(It shows us that)

362
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:59,073
(they're having hopes for the future.)

363
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,393
How's everything?

364
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:24,913
- It's okay.
- Not bad.

365
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:28,273
Wang.

366
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,233
Get a plate.

367
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,193
(There's no water in the hotel
that I'm staying.)

368
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:44,953
(Can you relate how it feels for)

369
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:46,273
(not being able to shower
after a long day?)

370
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,793
(The weather is good though.)

371
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:50,953
(Although the safety here is bad,)

372
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:52,473
(the nature is fair.)

373
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,033
(The sunshine here is
as bright as Wusu.)

374
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,113
(When are you coming back?)

375
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:06,953
She'll not reply the important question.

376
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:19,713
Do you wish to see my reply
or me back here?

377
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:28,713
Isn't this the person
who just walks away

378
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,313
and seldom calls?

379
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:31,553
Why are you back?

380
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:33,153
Of course I need to come back.

381
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:34,073
I need to come back to get married.

382
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:37,153
I came to look for you after landing

383
00:25:37,273 --> 00:25:38,193
without putting back my luggage.

384
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:39,873
Get married?

385
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:41,673
With whom?

386
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:43,313
Do I know him?

387
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:19,753
Xiaoran.

388
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,233
When did you come back?

389
00:26:22,393 --> 00:26:22,873
I just came back.

390
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,073
Does Mr. Xiao know? I...

391
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:25,953
He's in there.

392
00:26:29,113 --> 00:26:30,593
Did he pretend like
he doesn't care again?

393
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:31,633
It's okay.

394
00:26:32,313 --> 00:26:33,033
I'm prepared

395
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,313
for this.

396
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:35,553
Coaxing is easy.

397
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,433
After all, I was a hostess for
a relationship program.

398
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:38,113
I got this.

399
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:55,473
(Sorry, the number you've dialled)

400
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:56,713
(cannot be reached at the moment.)

401
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,313
Mr. Xiao.

402
00:26:58,793 --> 00:26:59,193
Mr. Xiao.

403
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:01,033
Your parcel.

404
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:02,393
What's it?

405
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:03,473
Take a look.

406
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:17,993
Mr. Xiao.

407
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:20,193
Let me wash it

408
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:21,353
and get some water for you.

409
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:22,753
It must be sweet.

410
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:25,753
Go ahead.

411
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:26,473
Sure.

412
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,353
Be careful not to break it.

413
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:28,153
Don't worry.

414
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:31,273
What does this mean?

415
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:38,073
(Working on different careers,)

416
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:40,873
(but we're not going to be separated.)

417
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:44,473
Mr. Xiao.

418
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,833
You should stop

419
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:48,953
your little game.

420
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:50,553
Don't go overboard.

421
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:52,873
The delivery guy said

422
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,753
Xiaoran is asking you out

423
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:55,873
to eat crayfish at the usual place.

424
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:56,953
If you agree to go,

425
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:57,633
send her

426
00:27:57,793 --> 00:27:58,553
a photo immediately.

427
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,353
I'll wash the cup.

428
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:15,939
(Working on different careers,
but we're not going to be separated.)

429
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:17,633
That's all for my report.

430
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:18,913
Thanks again for giving me

431
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:19,793
this opportunity.

432
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:24,793
Okay, the meeting is adjourned.

433
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,433
Okay.

434
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:34,913
It's tough not

435
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:35,753
to reply my email, right?

436
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,793
Miss He,

437
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,273
you've got so much in return this time.

438
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:43,993
It's not easy to get my husband.

439
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:46,313
If you need anything,

440
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:47,353
just let me know.

441
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,433
The entire news channel
will adjust accordingly.

442
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:51,473
What?

443
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,073
Was my joke that bad?

444
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:54,033
No, I just feel cold

445
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:54,913
in here.

446
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:57,273
Really?

447
00:28:58,993 --> 00:28:59,873
Why are you so warm?

448
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:00,713
This is not right.

449
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:02,393
Am I having a fever?

450
00:29:03,313 --> 00:29:04,433
It's okay. I'll go get some medicine

451
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:04,953
from the infirmary.

452
00:29:05,113 --> 00:29:06,033
Hurry up.

453
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:07,273
I was thinking

454
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:08,313
if the air-con was turned on.

455
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,433
Take care of yourself.

456
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:30,873
(Sorry, I can't make it today.)

457
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:43,073
What's going on?

458
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,713
I'm here.

459
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:45,833
Where are you?

460
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:55,513
Wait for me.

461
00:29:57,855 --> 00:30:01,675
(Emergency department,
inpatient department)

462
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:11,913
Where is He Xiaoran? What happened?

463
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:12,873
(Patient ward)
She's having a high fever.

464
00:30:13,073 --> 00:30:14,033
According to
the international movement records,

465
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,233
she could be infected.

466
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,313
We're arranging the checkups for her.

467
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:17,273
Don't go in.

468
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,833
No one can go in before
the illness is verified.

469
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:22,513
Xiaoran.

470
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:26,553
Why did you come in here?

471
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:27,673
You might get infected.

472
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:28,593
Get out now.

473
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:29,633
What did the doctor say?

474
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,393
The doctor said I'll only be healed

475
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:34,753
by getting married.

476
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,113
Will you save me?

477
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:46,473
You have yet to say yes.

478
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:48,313
Will you save me?

479
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:51,633
You need to marry me to save me.

480
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:56,793
You lied to me?

481
00:30:59,193 --> 00:30:59,913
Only you can pretend that you're sick,

482
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:00,673
but I can't?

483
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:03,393
Also, I'm not pretending.

484
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:04,793
I'm really sick.

485
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:05,913
It's just that

486
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,633
I exaggerated it a little.

487
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:13,353
Of course we can get married,

488
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:14,793
but you must not frighten me

489
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,393
again like this.

490
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:17,513
Also,

491
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,553
I don't wish you to leave me anymore.

492
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:28,633
Are you okay?

493
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:07,473
I want to eat the cake.

494
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:09,993
No, someone is not here yet.

495
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:12,673
We're already eating.

496
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:14,393
She won't come.

497
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,473
She will.

498
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:16,193
No worries.

499
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:17,073
Let's eat something else first.

500
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:18,153
Taiyang, sit down.

501
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:19,753
Father,

502
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,993
I want to call Madam Fei'er.

503
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:24,793
Madam Fei'er

504
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:26,873
might be busy now.

505
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:29,513
Let's eat the cake, okay?

506
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,153
Taiyang,

507
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:43,233
so many friends were here to celebrate

508
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:44,233
your birthday.

509
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:45,233
Are you happy?

510
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:48,473
Father,

511
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:52,633
I know you like Madam Fei'er,

512
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:53,633
but why Madam Fei'er

513
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:55,353
didn't come?

514
00:32:57,793 --> 00:32:59,353
Is it my fault?

515
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:00,353
Of course it's not.

516
00:33:00,513 --> 00:33:01,873
Why would it be your fault?

517
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:03,553
It's because of me.

518
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:09,593
It's because of me.

519
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,073
My car was broken.

520
00:33:17,553 --> 00:33:19,073
It delayed me for a while.

521
00:33:21,153 --> 00:33:22,833
Taiyang, happy birthday.

522
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:36,473
I didn't want others to think that

523
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,513
I can only rely on a man

524
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:42,633
to another man

525
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,993
and become a burden to you and Taiyang.

526
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,233
So, I wanted to

527
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,313
prove myself first

528
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,233
and stand by your side

529
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,753
bravely and openly.

530
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:02,393
I didn't manage to get a taxi

531
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:04,113
so I ran here in a rush.

532
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,433
I might not be as clean and as beautiful

533
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,113
as before now.

534
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:10,873
Taiyang.

535
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:13,113
Lin Zong.

536
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,272
Will you accept

537
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:18,352
the current me?

538
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:22,193
Do you know how much Taiyang and I

539
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:24,193
have missed you in the past six months?

540
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:28,113
I'm sorry.

541
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:30,433
I didn't look for you

542
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:32,433
because I once

543
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,513
forced someone to stay.

544
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:36,593
I know that

545
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:37,873
you deserve

546
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:38,913
a better life,

547
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:40,073
but Fei'er,

548
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:40,752
if that's the reason

549
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,473
that you left,

550
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:46,113
you really didn't have to leave

551
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,073
because you're good enough.

552
00:34:57,313 --> 00:34:57,793
Do you know

553
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:02,313
that's always what I wanted to hear

554
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:04,153
since young?

555
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,153
Madam Fei'er.

556
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:13,113
You're great.

557
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:14,833
I like you the most.

558
00:35:55,713 --> 00:35:56,353
Taiyang!

559
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,833
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

560
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:00,993
Come and eat the cake.

561
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:14,073
Go in and have a look.

562
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:30,713
Sui.

563
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:33,713
Sui.

564
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,073
Congratulations on your grand opening.

565
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:44,753
When will you get
the marriage certificate?

566
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:48,233
It's brand new.

567
00:36:51,273 --> 00:36:52,593
Okay, enough.

568
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:05,033
It's happening today.

569
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:07,953
How I wish Li Hui was here.

570
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:15,153
I have only known Li Hui for a few years

571
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:16,593
and I miss her so much.

572
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:17,553
You and her

573
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:19,233
are childhood friends.

574
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:20,433
It's been a while.

575
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:21,433
Don't you miss her?

576
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:26,153
She didn't contact me.

577
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,313
I heard from Xixi that

578
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,953
you've been

579
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:32,193
surfing the Internet.

580
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,673
No, I was...

581
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:36,433
Sui,

582
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,273
are you happy lately?

583
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:45,593
I've never seen

584
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:46,593
you being such a coward.

585
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,873
You even used a fake ID

586
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,393
to show your concern.

587
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:53,433
Li Hui told me that

588
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:54,513
you're someone

589
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,033
full of sense of safety.

590
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:57,993
You'd never be scared of losing

591
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:58,993
and couldn't be careless.

592
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:00,393
You're living a carefree life

593
00:38:00,673 --> 00:38:02,153
so others would envy you.

594
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,113
Why are you so different

595
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:06,433
when it comes to her?

596
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:11,713
Love makes someone brave.

597
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:14,313
Guess what makes someone timid?

598
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:19,713
What?

599
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,593
It's love, too.

600
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:24,673
There's something one

601
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:25,673
can't figure out by himself.

602
00:38:49,353 --> 00:38:50,073
Dajiabang For Everyone's

603
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:51,393
20th Anniversary Special Program?

604
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:53,873
Although the name of the program
has changed to Goodnight,

605
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:54,713
the core of it

606
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:55,913
is still Dajiabang.

607
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:57,033
So, the station wants

608
00:38:57,153 --> 00:38:57,993
to sell emotions.

609
00:38:58,953 --> 00:38:59,873
I didn't want to look for you,

610
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:02,873
but in the online voting

611
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,153
about which host should have a comeback,

612
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:05,393
you got the most votes.

613
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:10,113
I'm so popular

614
00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:11,553
among

615
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:12,993
the audiences.

616
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,513
Don't be so proud of yourself.

Today's Dajiabang For Everyone's

631
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,073
20th anniversary.

632
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:40,193
The program name was changed
and the hosts were changed.

633
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:43,553
The listenership was once

634
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:44,433
below average

635
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:45,953
for a long time,

636
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,273
but it was once the most famous program

637
00:40:48,473 --> 00:40:50,033
in the station.

638
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,833
Some people started their career here

639
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,673
and some people retired here.

640
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:00,553
It's been 20 years.

641
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:03,313
It's been a beam of light that

642
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:04,273
shines in the dark.

643
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:06,393
It once

644
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:08,953
made you and I warm.

645
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:10,953
Today,

646
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:12,993
let's

647
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:13,873
talk about

648
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:16,553
the story about time and love.

649
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,353
(In the sea of time,)

650
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:22,353
(we'll go to a faraway place
along with the tide.)

651
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:26,513
(We met and we got
separated from each other.)

652
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,713
(We've been through the joy of reunion)

653
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:32,593
(and the pain of losing.)

654
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:38,153
(After being ground by the wave,)

655
00:41:38,593 --> 00:41:40,033
(we've finally understood that)

656
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:42,433
(love is neither contribution
nor redemption.)

657
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:44,513
(It's not even playing)

658
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:45,953
(someone's perfect role.)

659
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:47,873
(Only when you become better,)

660
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:50,153
(you'll meet a better person to love)

661
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:51,873
(and a better life.)

662
00:41:55,553 --> 00:41:56,433
(After going through hardship,)

663
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:58,273
(there might be more to come.)

664
00:41:58,913 --> 00:41:59,753
(After solving the problems,)

665
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,913
(there might be more to come.)

666
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:06,313
But when we're not
afraid of losing anymore,

667
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:08,873
we'll have the courage to move forward.

668
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:13,153
Everyone knows that I love you,

669
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,433
but only we'll know

670
00:42:16,753 --> 00:42:17,433
what

671
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:18,913
love is.

672
