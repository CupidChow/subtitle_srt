What do you think?

18
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,090
Can you go back with us

19
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,610
after the wedding?

20
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,170
I think so.

21
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,290
You think so?

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,290
Can we

23
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,250
or can't we?

24
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,570
Tell us the exact answer.

25
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,210
Well,

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,450
I'll book the rooms,

27
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,610
okay?

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,290
I've just moved back home.

29
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,290
I'm busy with work lately.

30
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,130
Moving back home is more convenient.

31
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,770
Xiaoran,

32
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,850
what's wrong?

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm thinking

34
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,370
it's good that

35
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,770
your relationship with your father
and your brother

36
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,410
has improved.

37
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,610
After so many years,

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,210
I've started to learn

39
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,130
how to get along with them.

40
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,290
Xiaoran.

41
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,770
Actually...

42
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:00,850
Nothing.

43
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,410
You're busy.

44
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,210
Don't worry about

45
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,650
booking the homestay.

46
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,210
We'll talk about it by then.

47
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:10,730
Okay.

48
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,570
You came back to stay here suddenly.

49
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,290
Others might think

50
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,290
you want to stay in Hupu.

51
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,730
How's Zhisheng's proposal

52
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,610
so far?

53
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,570
If you don't mind,

54
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,610
I'll go with you to meet

55
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,330
Mr. Gao next week.

56
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,530
I can help you

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,370
and share your burden.

58
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,290
What do you think

59
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,210
if I stay here?

60
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:48,797
(Zhisheng Financial Management Co. Ltd.)

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,290
Didn't you want to go back?

62
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,290
Why do you want to stay suddenly?

63
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,970
Are you thinking of helping me?

64
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,930
Or you want to lay hold of

65
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,530
the big business, Zhisheng?

66
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,010
I stay here for Yunlan.

67
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,730
I've never thought of

68
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,970
taking anything away from you.

69
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:14,890
Yes.

70
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,330
We're brothers.

71
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,089
You're not taking anything away.

72
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,250
Also, if you stay here,

73
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,810
it won't affect me much.

74
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,730
I had to ask Zhao Mingxuan

75
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,850
for business before.

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,730
I'll just have to ask from you
in the future.

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,210
You're doing well.

78
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,770
I should just work
from behind the scene.

79
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:29,730
Right?

80
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,130
Xian,

81
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,610
when are we going to stop this

82
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,090
where I owed you something

83
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,050
and you're worried about me?

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,090
Aren't we

85
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,730
brothers?

86
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,250
Yes.

87
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,370
Now, you have everything

88
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,130
and you're talking about
how we're brothers,

89
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:48,730
right?

90
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,610
Do you think that I don't want to

91
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,610
forget about the past?

92
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,930
Do you think that
I don't want to be myself?

93
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,410
Stay here.

94
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,210
It's good that you stay here.

95
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,570
It takes about 23 seconds to

96
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,970
walk from the entrance to the center.

97
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,650
Give me your hand.

98
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,610
Here.

99
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,010
It seems like Mr. Xiao is worried that

100
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,930
you might be starving.

101
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,650
Let's finish the walk

102
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,570
and we can go for a meal.

103
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,130
Mr. Zhao, you're here.

104
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,130
Mingxuan.

105
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,490
Mingxuan.

106
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,810
This is Xiaoran.

107
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,170
You're meeting her
for the first time, right?

108
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,570
Are you Qi's

109
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,490
girlfriend?

110
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,050
Hello.

111
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,610
I only saw the substitute

112
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,730
in the previous rehearsals.

113
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,330
I've finally seen you today.

114
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,690
We could hardly meet.

115
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,610
Let's have a meal together.

116
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,490
Fei'er told me that

117
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,370
you two

118
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,050
met again in Wusu.

119
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,930
Then, it's my credit

120
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,690
to help

121
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,050
you both

122
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,890
meet again.

123
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:41,890
Yes.

124
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,370
Thank you, Mingxuan.

125
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,290
Miss He, what do you do

126
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,730
in Wusu?

127
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,010
I'm a news journalist.

128
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,050
Not bad.

129
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,530
But now,

130
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,930
there are lesser and lesser

131
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,650
responsible news journalists.

132
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,010
Many of the journalists
just spread rumors around.

133
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,930
Few days back,

134
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,970
I heard of a gossip.

135
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,210
They said Yunlan

136
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,290
is trying to get Zhisheng's project.

137
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,970
After I had a meal with Mr. Gao,

138
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,690
I found out that

139
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,930
you guys just played golf together.

140
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,730
Don't you think the journalists

141
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,290
are publishing fake news?

142
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,130
Yes.

143
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,130
I even told Mr. Gao that

144
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,810
as long as Yunlan and Deju

145
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,050
are still in collaboration,

146
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,530
we'll try our best

147
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,010
and no one will be able to accuse us.

148
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:29,890
Mr. Zhao,

149
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,570
don't worry.

150
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,890
Qi, look at you.

151
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:34,970
We're like brothers.

152
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,330
There's nothing I should be
worried about.

153
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,170
Zhisheng is the leading group,

154
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,570
but their core management team

155
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,490
is in Hupu.

156
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,930
You'll go back

157
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,730
to Wusu anyway.

158
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,370
Yes.

159
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,370
Lately,

160
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,690
Xiaoran has also told me

161
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,530
a lot of interesting things in Wusu.

162
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,450
When did I tell you anything?

163
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,850
You're so eager to go back.

164
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,450
Let's not talk about Zhisheng.

165
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,810
As long as Qi's willing to stay in Hupu,

166
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,890
Deju

167
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,930
will have a lot of businesses

168
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,930
for you.

169
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,530
But, I know Qi well.

170
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,050
He was so loyal

171
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,730
in his previous relationship.

172
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,210
Which previous relationship?

173
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,650
But indeed,

174
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,730
Wusu is

175
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,490
a place

176
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,850
with human touch

177
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,450
and without much conflict.

178
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:35,929
So, we both

179
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,130
like that place.

180
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,450
But, if he can have

181
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,130
more opportunities in Hupu,

182
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,450
staying here is fine.

183
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,450
Xiaoran,

184
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,730
it's not easy

185
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,730
to maintain
a long-distance relationship.

186
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,410
If he stays in Hupu,

187
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,490
I'll surely stay here, too.

188
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,770
It's not going to be
a long-distance relationship.

189
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,530
Well, Mr. Zhao,

190
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,970
give him whatever

191
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,370
businesses you have.

192
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,810
My boyfriend

193
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,970
is well known for

194
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,250
his capability and capacity.

195
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:07,970
You can rest assured

196
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,970
to pass him the businesses.

197
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,730
Miss He,

198
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,050
don't you want to work in Wusu anymore?

199
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,490
Fei'er told me that

200
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,290
you're an independent woman

201
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,290
and you're career-oriented.

202
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,010
Developing my career in another place

203
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,650
means I'm not
an independent woman anymore?

204
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,330
Since I can become a news journalist

205
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,090
in Wusu,

206
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,930
I can work

207
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,770
in other places.

208
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,530
Otherwise,

209
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,090
I'll just try to get a job
in Hupu TV Station.

210
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,170
Here. Cheers.

211
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,210
Why are you smiling?

212
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,210
What you said just now

213
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,810
was so amazing.

214
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,330
Xiaoran,

215
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,770
thank you for supporting me.

216
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,890
Who was supporting you?

217
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,010
Do you think I said that

218
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,010
to make you proud?

219
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,850
I've decided

220
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,130
to stay in Hupu.

221
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,650
Really?

222
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,970
You've thought it through?

223
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,530
Of course.

224
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:40,970
You've been so busy

225
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,690
lately.

226
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,130
You even had to find time for golf.

227
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,930
It's for that Mr. Gao, right?

228
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,970
Although Zhao Mingxuan was

229
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,890
so full of himself,

230
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,330
I understood that

231
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,970
you need to stay in Hupu

232
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,130
to get Mr. Gao's business deal,

233
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,730
right?

234
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,090
Not only Mr. Gao,

235
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,530
Yunlan needs to stabilize the business

236
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,170
in Hupu to get rid of Deju.

237
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,130
If I don't stay here,

238
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,450
it's hard to do that.

239
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,290
You must have been worried.

240
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,490
You wanted to stay
but you can't tell me.

241
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,730
I don't want to put you in a tough spot.

242
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,290
I also don't want you to sacrifice

243
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,530
yourself for my career.

244
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:20,970
I'm not the sacrifice.

245
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,410
If I can get a job

246
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,290
in Hupu TV Station,

247
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,530
that's exaltation.

248
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,090
Do you think I can do it?

249
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,370
Of course.

250
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,170
You're He Xiaoran.

251
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,410
You've decided to stay?

252
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,650
What about Xiaoran?

253
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,290
Xiaoran has decided

254
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,050
to stay in Hupu with me.

255
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,170
Bring her here for a meal
when she's free.

256
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,730
Also,

257
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,330
thank her for me.

258
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,210
Okay.

259
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,290
Mr. Gao.

260
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,770
Mr. Gao.

261
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,610
Qi.

262
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,450
Xian.

263
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:36,690
How's it?

264
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,610
Let's play for two rounds.

265
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:38,730
Okay.

266
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,210
Xiao Xian has been asking me out.

267
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,290
I'm a bit busy lately.

268
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,490
I hardly got a chance
to play golf today.

269
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,210
So, I asked him to come and talk here.

270
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,250
I was talking to Mr. Gao about

271
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,250
how you managed to get Jifeng

272
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,610
on the Black Pine Needle
in a short period of time.

273
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,530
Qi will surely manage

274
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,610
Zhisheng well.

275
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,930
How's it, Qi?

276
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,730
Can we sign the agreement now?

277
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,010
My only condition is that

278
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,570
the person in charge must stay in Hupu.

279
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,570
I haven't got to tell you, Mr. Gao.

280
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,410
I've decided to stay here

281
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,890
and give it my all

282
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,850
to work for Zhisheng.

283
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,930
Okay.

284
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,250
I will find some time and bring
a bottle of good wine.

285
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,530
We'll celebrate it.

286
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,170
Okay.

287
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,370
Take care.

288
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,290
Take care, Mr. Gao.

289
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,090
Since you're going to stay,

290
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,330
do it well.

291
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,130
Tell me if you need anything.

292
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,250
It doesn't mean I'm somebody

293
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,530
with Zhisheng's deal in hand.

294
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,690
You're still the pillar of Yunlan.

295
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,850
There will be more businesses coming in.

296
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,610
The coming businesses

297
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,770
will be counted on you.

298
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,210
After you came back,

299
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,450
Yunlan has got the opportunities

300
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,930
that we didn't dare to think about.

301
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,810
So, everyone thinks highly

302
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,610
of you.

303
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,170
More people will choose you

304
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,410
in the future.

305
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:07,930
Keep it up.

306
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,370
Mr. Gao,

307
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,330
I'll be frank.

308
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,250
Qi has been studying

309
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,770
overseas for years.

310
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,850
Honestly, he's inexperienced.

311
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,850
Also, I'm the one managing Yunlan

312
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,890
all these years.

313
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,890
I'm very experienced.

314
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,530
I believe that as long as Zhisheng...

315
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,130
Xiao Xian,

316
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,730
I don't doubt your ability.

317
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,370
I understand.

318
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:40,970
You've managed

319
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,010
Deju well all these years.

320
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,130
You're meticulous,

321
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,290
detailed

322
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,570
and comprehensive.

323
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,890
However,

324
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,450
Zhisheng and Deju

325
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,130
are different enterprises.

326
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,530
We need someone

327
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,810
sharper

328
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,850
and someone with international vision.

329
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,490
Furthermore,

330
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,610
you're so busy.

331
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,650
You can't handle so many things.

332
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,370
Honestly,

333
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,730
Yunlan's current status

334
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,730
is not good enough

335
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,570
for Zhisheng.

336
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,930
I'm willing to try,

337
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,050
because I like Qi.

338
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,450
Are you going to stay for real?

339
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,570
So, the last report

340
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,570
and the chance to go on stage

341
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,890
can be given to other members.

342
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,970
If they report it to the management,

343
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,050
they can get the bonus.

344
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:06,850
It's good.

345
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,370
But, don't worry.

346
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,450
I'll still get

347
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,410
the information ready.

348
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,650
What do you plan to do?

349
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,930
I want to get a job in
Hupu Radio & TV Group.

350
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,010
I've checked.

351
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,090
There'll be a recruitment

352
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,170
next month.

353
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,570
You're resigning without
having the next job?

354
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,290
You're brave.

355
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,210
Well,

356
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,210
let me help you

357
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,170
find out more first

358
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,370
and give you a book list.

359
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,770
The books here are quite complete.

360
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,490
You can do the revision here.

361
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,130
We'll get to become colleagues soon.

362
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,770
Okay.

363
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,690
I'm leaving.

364
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,170
Bye.

365
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,209
Why are you here?

366
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:17,570
I'm here to comfort you.

367
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,370
Let me find you a book?

368
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,050
What?

369
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,530
I want to get closer to you.

370
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:56,722
(Mental Disorder Solutions)

371
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,410
(I thought you're preparing
for the exam.)

372
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,210
(I didn't know you're researching this.)

373
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,970
(Li Hui's matter)

374
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,090
(is a knot in my heart.)

375
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,730
(I can't go back and solve it for her.)

376
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,890
(I need to find a way.)

377
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
(Get rid of trouble by
seeking fun by yourself.)

378
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,500
(Being cheerful and optimistic
can help reduce and release stress.)

379
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,250
I plan to give her this

380
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,170
when I announce that I'll stay in Hupu

381
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,530
tonight.

382
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,450
I hope I can help her

383
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,410
to get through this.

384
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,090
Hello.

385
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,250
You asked us for a meal secretly

386
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,610
and you changed the place here.

387
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,610
Go ahead.

388
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,010
What are you going to announce?

389
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,530
You're getting married?

390
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,290
Not yet.

391
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,650
No.

392
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,890
We have decided

393
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,650
to stay here.

394
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,450
We'll stay in Hupu.

395
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,730
That's great.

396
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,450
What's with your facial expression?

397
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,410
Two people from Hupu

398
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,690
have decided to stay in Hupu.

399
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,850
Is that something shocking?

400
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:51,970
We just decided it.

401
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,370
But, we'll still go back together

402
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,410
for the road trip to the homestay.

403
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,330
We'll have fun going back.

404
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,290
When we're back in Wusu,

405
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,610
we'll settle the things there

406
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,770
and come back here.

407
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,490
Mr. Xiao's business is huge in Hupu.

408
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,570
What about you?

409
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,850
What are you going to do with Lili?

410
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,250
I'll resign

411
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,330
and start all over again here.

412
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,050
You're indeed my best friend.

413
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:12,570
You're brave.

414
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:12,850
Here.

415
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,250
I bless you both.

416
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:14,730
Thank you.

417
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,330
Come on.

418
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,770
Eat now or it will turn cold.

419
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,330
I heard that

420
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,490
many talent scouts will come here.

421
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,850
So, many underground bands

422
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,090
will perform here.

423
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,690
A guitarist was performing

424
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,810
impromptu here

425
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,970
and was scouted.

426
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,210
Hello.

427
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,730
Are you happy tonight?

428
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,250
Yes!

429
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,610
Tang Yan?

430
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,570
Yes!

431
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,410
Here's the song for you all,

432
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,450
"Yes".

433
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,530
Why is he here?

434
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,170
What a coincidence.

435
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,090
Bravo!

436
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,010
I heard that he's

437
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,850
performing in Hupu.

438
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,090
That's lip sync.

439
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,530
He's asking for trouble.

440
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,810
Let's go. I have no appetite.

441
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:23,970
I'll help

442
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,930
you gain your appetite.

443
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,410

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,200

how did you know that
he was using lip sync?

493
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,730
I know a lot.

494
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,970
He'll play his record

495
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,130
if the pay is under RMB 10,000.

496
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,170
He said that he wants to
protect his voice.

497
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,330
Screw it.

498
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,360

500
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,210
Li Hui,

501
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,930
do you know that

502
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,890
you've ruined my future?

503
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,930
Do you really need to be so mean?

504
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,330
I don't need to,

505
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,570
but you deserve it!

506
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,450
You scolded him well, Hui.

507
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,050
Let's go.

508
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,730
Let's go to Yunduan's bar.

509
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:58,930
No need.

510
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,050
I'll just drink the beer
by the river tonight.

511
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:02,530
Okay.

512
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,970
I'll go buy more.

513
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,530
Wait here.

514
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,890
Hupu is great.

515
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,930
It's a big city.

516
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,890

517
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,130

518
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,330
What?

519
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,850

play the guitar anymore,

520
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,210
you sing well.

521
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,570
But if one day

522
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,530
you think of it again

523
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,330
and you want to

524
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,850
pick up guitar again,

525
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,610
and I'm not beside you,

526
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,450
read this.

527
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,610
Perhaps it helps.

528
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,050
Thank you.

529
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,970
I'm reluctant.

530
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,450
Being with you is so happy.

531
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,730
There's nothing to be reluctant.

532
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,050
This is not life and death.

533
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,170
Wusu is not far away.

534
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,570
It's just a five-hour drive.

535
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,650
Do you think

536
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,810
I'm getting more confident about

537
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,530
my love for Xiao Shangqi

538
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,450
as I want to stay in Hupu

539
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,930
or I'm getting less confident?

540
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,570
Why do you think so much?

541
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,770
No matter where you are,

542
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,770
a good relationship

543
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,890
will grow stronger.

544
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,330
No one can guarantee

545
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,770
you can love him for a lifetime.

546
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,410
But, try your best

547
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,290
to stay close

548
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,410
when you're together.

549
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,890
Wusu is not far away from Hupu.

550
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,690
If you're bored,

551
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,210
we'll just come over.

552
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,650
Stay close.

553
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,090
Stay close.

554
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,290
Sui,

555
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,530
stop staring at me.

556
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,170
My back is shivering.

557
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,370
Just be frank.

558
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,610
Don't think that you can just stay here

559
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,490
and everything will be fine.

560
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,760
What do you mean?

561
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,770
You took

562
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,570
the first step before me,

563
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,090
and I paused it.

564
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:22,930
I didn't give up.

565
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,850
I'm waiting for you two to break up

566
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,330
and...

567
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,610
Anyway,

568
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,890
if you managed to make her stay in Hupu,

569
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,490
treat her better.

570
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,770
Look at Tang Yan.

571
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,930
If you hurt her,

572
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,650
you'll get it from me.

573
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,450
Ruler of Wusu,

574
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,530
you've just caused a scene.

575
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,610
Is your adrenaline still

576
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,090
secreting?

577
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,170
Sir, your beer.

578
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,610
Okay. Thank you.

579
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,210
I'm serious.

580
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,610
I heard you.

581
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,450
What are you talking about?

582
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,730
You're so happy.

583
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,810
The beer is here.

584
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,450
Hold on.

585
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,770
If you're able to catch me,

586
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,890
I'll drink all the six cans of beer.

587
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,090
Come on.

588
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:08,770
Your tolerance is low.

589
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,170
How much can you drink?

590
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,290
Are you sure?

591
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,130
Drink it all.

592
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:13,610
Give it to me.

593
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,370
Catch him!

594
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:15,970
Sui Mingwei!

595
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,130
Hurry!

596
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,890
Give it to me.

597
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,530
Fei'er,

598
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,850
are you here to visit your parents?

599
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:14,579
(Mahjong center)

600
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,170
I didn't expect the rain
to be so heavy this year.

601
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,370
It's raining heavily out there

602
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,370
and it's leaking inside.

603
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,130
How do we live this kind of life?

604
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,250
Didn't you get the dowry

605
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,010
as the deposit of the two-bedroom house?

606
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,730
Why are you acting so pitiful here?

607
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:31,690
Fei'er.

608
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,370
Why did you ask me to come back?

609
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,170
Go ahead.

610
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,330
Tell her.

611
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,290
Fei'er,

612
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,810
your brother's house

613
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,570
has been renovated,

614
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,450
but the location is remote.

615
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,370
After you get married,

616
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,170
someone needs

617
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,290
to take care of us.

618
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:45,930
Who is going to take care of us?

619
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:46,730
It's your brother.

620
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,570
So, we need a car
for our convenience.

621
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,330
Are you crazy?

622
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,330
You should know your boundary.

623
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,810
Ridiculous!

624
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,570
Enough.

625
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,250
Talk nicely.

626
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,090
Why did you do that?

627
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,610
Fei'er,

628
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,490
we're not giving it

629
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,410
to an outsider.

630
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,970
He's your brother.

631
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,930
After you get married

632
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:07,810
and someone bullies you there,

633
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,690
it's your brother who is

634
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,370
going to help you.

635
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,170
There's RMB 300,000 in this card.

636
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,730
From today onwards until
the wedding is over,

637
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,610
don't let me see you again.

638
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,530
Why are you here to pick me up today?

639
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,130
I suddenly have a dinner meeting.

640
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,050
Wear this later.

641
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,050
Tidy yourself up.

642
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,130
Did you come home

643
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,250
to discuss about

644
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,210
the wedding?

645
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,970
You don't have to pull a long face.

646
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,290
Didn't you marry me

647
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,450
to sever ties

648
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,650
with the bad past?

649
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:43,325
(How To Become Deju's Bride)

650
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,090
I'm just

651
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,290
someone without my name.

652
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,290
I have no right to be unhappy.

(How To Become Deju's Bride)

654

If your name is written here,

655
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,930
will someone want to see it?

656
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:09,970
Besides being

657
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,410
Zhao Mingxuan's,

658
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,010
no one cares about who I am,

659
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,690
how I feel

660
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,410
and what happened to me.

661
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,530
Why do you have to
bring me to the dinner?

662
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,530
Get off.

663
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:41,690
Mingxuan.

664
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,170
I don't want to repeat myself.

665
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,010
Zhao Mingxuan.

666
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,250
Eat hot pot and drink Sprite.

667
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,050
It's the perfect combination.

668
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:18,730
Come on.

669
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,730
Thank you, Mr. He.

670
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,250
Most welcome.

671
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,290
The next question.

672
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,490
The highest building in Hupu.

673
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,570
Hupu Tower.

674
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,890
Yes, I know the answer, too.

675
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:29,410
Here.

676
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,290
The next question.

677
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,770
Which tunnel is

678
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,250
the first tunnel in Hupu?

679
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,530
The first tunnel in Hupu.

680
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,930
It's...

681
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,050
Let me search it for it.

682
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,170
Hupu Street Tunnel.

683
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:39,930
Yes!

684
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,970
- Yes!
- Yes!

685
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,410
I couldn't get the answer.

686
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,410
Yes.

687
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,330
We won.

688
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,810
The third prize.

689
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,610
We won the third prize?

690
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:51,530
Look.

00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,170
is quite interesting.

695
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,370
This hotel was newly opened lately.

696
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,570
The group is promoting it,

697
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,770
so we got all the support.

698
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,490
Yes.

699
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,370
Look.

700
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,370
What's the prize for the third prize?

701
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:05,930
Okay.

702
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,690
Yunmu Spa Hotel's

703
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,850
weekend two days one night voucher.

704
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,730
Spa Hotel?

705
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,810
Two days one night?

706
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,050
This hotel is in the south of the city.

707
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:19,730
The average fee for one night

708
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,810
is over RMB 2,000.

709
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,090
Over RMB 2,000?

710
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,010
Dear, look.

711
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:27,930
I told you

712
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:28,930
to use your brain more

713
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:29,970
and read more books.

714
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,970
It can prevent us from getting dementia.

715
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,050
We can also win some prizes.

716
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,250
Yes.

717
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,850
I think obviously someone

718
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:36,930
is letting you win it easily.

719
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,210
You can't say that.

720
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:41,810
Look.

721
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,050
Although the event

722
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,810
is planned by Qi's company,

723
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,210
your father and I

724
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,730
won it

725
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,250
fair and

726
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,170
square.

727
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:50,770
Right, dear?

728
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,290
Yes.

729
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,530
Over RMB 2,000 a night.

730
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,050
We've never stayed in
such an expensive hotel before.

731
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,050
Yes.

732
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,290
We'll go there this weekend.

733
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,370
Sure.

734
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,410
We must go.

735
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,370
Well,

736
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,770
do I need to wear a swimsuit

737
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,130
to enter

738
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,450
the spa hotel?

739
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,210
For the spa? Yes.

740
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,650
Look at how happy your parents are.

741
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,250
There's a loophole in the event.

742
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,530
If it's so easy to win the prize,

743
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:35,410
won't you suffer a loss?

744
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,050
I've asked them to make some changes.

745
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,730
Your parents' questions are simpler.

746
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:39,809
It's not random.

747
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,170
I knew you were cheating.

748
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,650
But why the third prize?

749
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,730
That way,

750
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,210
they're happy

751
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,530
and we're happy.

752
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,369
It's a win-win situation.

753
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,210
Why?

754
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,770
You have to come home

755
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,690
after the training.

756
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,290
How can you not come home

757
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,410
before 11 p.m.?

758
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,650
Xiao Shangqi,

759
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,210
you're cunning.

760
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,850
Shangqi,

761
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,370
can you help me?

762
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:51,890
You're here, too?

763
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,450
I really can't get a taxi here.

764
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,410
Get in the car first.

765
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,130
We can't pull over here.

766
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,330
Thank you.

767
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,170
Be careful.

768
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,450
Here. Ran said
you love to eat noodles.

769
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,850
You must be hungry. Eat now.

770
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,330
Thank you, Mrs. He.

771
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,490
It's okay.

772
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,090
Ran told me that
you're getting married.

773
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,450
Mr. He and I

774
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,410
didn't prepare in advance.

775
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,570
Here is a red packet for you.

776
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,530
It was from the Chinese New Year.

777
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,130
Please don't mind it.

778
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,490
Here, take this.

779
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,250
I've never received any red packet

780
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,490
(Lucky Money)
like this since young.

781
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,090
It's good.

782
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,090
Okay.

783
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,810
I'll go for a walk with your father.

784
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,250
I'll leave you be.

785
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,570
Eat slowly.

786
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,450
Tell us what happened.

787
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,650
Just like what you see.

788
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,090
I don't want to go to Yunduan

789
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,450
or go home in a mess.

790
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,690
Just because you talked back at him?

791
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,650
He dropped you at

792
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,090
the dangerous place and left you alone?

793
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,450
Is he still a man?

794
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,890
So many people are curious about

795
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,410
why Zhao Mingxuan must

796
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,170
marry me

797
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,570
instead of others.

798
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,210
All these years, I've learned

799
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,370
arts and piano for him.

800
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,490
I went to the orphanage to take care

801
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,290
the kids that are so much
luckier than me.

802
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,330
I've got to know him completely.

803
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,970
I know what he wants

804
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,970
when he looks at me.

805
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,810
I'll adjust myself

806
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,330
based on his needs.

807
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,530
No one else can do this

808
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,610
except for me.

809
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,650
Aren't you tired?

810
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,090
It's still better than

811
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,010
working in a mahjong center.

812
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,330
Forget it.
Send me back to Zhao's residence.

813
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,370
Why are you looking like that?

814
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,250
Where else can I go?

815
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,250
Yunduan, mahjong center

816
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,930
or your house?

817
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,410
Do you think Zhao Mingxuan

818
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,570
will take time to

819
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,050
apologize to me?

820
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,090
Let's go.

821
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,330
We'll send you back.

822
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,170
How did you come back?

823
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,530
Xiao Shangqi and He Xiaoran

824
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,770
sent me back.

825
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,730
You looked for Xiao Shangqi?

826
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,370
Aren't you afraid that I'll get jealous?

827
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,570
No matter how he helps me,

828
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,530
I'll still come back to you

829
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,610
eventually.

830
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,210
Isn't this what you like the most?

831
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,570
Fei'er,

832
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,250
you know I like

833
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,490
how smart you are.

834
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,730
But tonight,

835
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,890
you shouldn't have let me think

836
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,890
your smartness is gone.

837
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,330
Well,

838
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,450
go get an accessory tomorrow

839
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,610
as my apology

840
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,050
for tonight, okay?

841
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,050
No need.

842
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,130
But, I have another wish.

843
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,250
You've improved.

844
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,450
You're negotiating now.

845
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,850
This wedding is important to me.

846
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,890
I hope my parents will join it.

847
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,930
But, don't worry.

848
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,290
I'll not embarrass you.

849
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,650
Thank you, Mingxuan,
for giving my beloved daughter

850
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,410
the warm companion.

851
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,850
Take her as...

852
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,290
The future...

853
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,050
The storm in the future.

854
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,290
To face the storm in the future.

855
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,770
Fei'er.

856
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,170
Xiaoran.

857
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,650
I'm sorry.

858
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:12,850
I wanted to return the shirt to you

859
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,250
and I needed you to come over.

860
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,890
Your hand is so beautiful.

861
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,810
It's just like scallion.

862
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,450
It's just that it's a bit cold.

863
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,130
You need to drink more warm water
even in summer.

864
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,530
Don't drink cold water.

865
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,130
Here, come and taste the tea.

866
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,290
I'll bring it with me

867
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,690
in all four seasons.

868
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,850
She's the bridesmaid.

869
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,370
You two should read

870
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,410
from the wedding speech script.

871
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,290
I want to see how it goes.

872
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

873
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,490
I'm picking my parents for the wedding.

874
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,890
Help me out.

875
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,330
Hello, everyone.

876
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,770
I'm the bride's mother.

877
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,010
A daughter is the parents'

878
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:52,930
quilted jacket.

879
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,050
But, to me and her father,

880
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,330
Fei'er

881
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,170
is more than just a quilted jacket.

882
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,330
She's our beloved

883
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,330
from the bottom of our heart.

884
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,770
We're glad to have Fei'er

885
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,090
as our daughter.

886
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:09,850
Four dots.

887
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,490
Mrs. Chen,

888
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,850
they gave you

889
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,690
RMB 300,000?

890
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,130
Your daughter

891
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,530
is not a quilted jacket,

892
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,130
but a money printing machine.

893
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,570
How lucky I am.

894
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,210
They've been dating for so long,

895
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,530
yet we've never seen him here.

896
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,130
Yes.

897
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,610
Nine characters.

898
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,010
My son-in-law is earning money

899
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:29,730
every minute.

900
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,490
Why should he come here?

901
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,530
Playing mahjong with us?

902
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,330
They should invite me to their house

903
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,650
if they want to see me.

904
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,970
Five dots.

905
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:37,890
Really?

906
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,570
Mrs. Chen,

907
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,850
did he buy a house for Fei'er?

908
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,570
Of course. Nine bamboos.

909
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,850
Bring us there

910
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,930
to check out the new house.
