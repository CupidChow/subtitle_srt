=Episode 2=

17
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:47,002
He Xiaoran.

18
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:48,722
Who was the person

19
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:49,522
that made the last call

20
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:50,722
to us last night?

21
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:52,002
Invite him over.

22
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:53,562
We'll do another episode to

23
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,402
expose the mysterious call.

24
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,722
What mysterious call?

25
00:01:58,722 --> 00:01:59,482
Furthermore,

26
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:00,842
we've ended the program.

27
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,002
This morning,

28
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:04,882
we were discussing
about your next stop.

29
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,002
No one wanted to take you in.

30
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,402
Everything is on hold.

31
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:09,362
You know what?

32
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:11,602
We're trending now.

33
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:13,322
Our boss made a decision

34
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,841
that we need to ride on this advantage.

35
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,122
As long as you can find
the person who called,

36
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:19,242
we'll do a sequel.

37
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:20,362
Maybe our program

38
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,242
can be kept.

39
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,082
That's great, Xiaoran.

40
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,282
I'm not going.

41
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:26,922
That guy is crazy.

42
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:28,322
When he thinks it through,

43
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:29,362
I just want to run away.

44
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:30,922
How can we invite him here?

45
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:32,562
He's messing around with me.

46
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:34,442
Qi,

47
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,122
why did you go to Wusu

48
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,562
and take over an old hotel?

49
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:39,722
Why do you just look at things
on its surface?

50
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:40,682
That's fast that

51
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,202
you already knew
what happened yesterday.

52
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:43,642
Qi, listen.

53
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,682
I've allowed you to have fun
overseas for three years

54
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,362
and that's to show others.

55
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:48,762
What you've learned and experienced

56
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,522
all these years

57
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:51,802
are not the capital
for you to be willful.

58
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:53,122
Qi,

59
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:54,962
Deju has changed the person in charge.

60
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:56,562
Ever since Zhao Mingxuan was promoted,

61
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,042
he keeps suppressing Yunlan.

62
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:58,962
He's obviously trying

63
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,842
to step over Yunlan.

64
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:02,362
What does it imply?

65
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:05,322
It implies that crises and chances
are there together.

66
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:06,962
I asked you to come back

67
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,722
so that during the critical
early stage of Deju

68
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,042
having the person in charge changed,

69
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,442
you can help your brother
to regain his authority.

70
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:14,642
Father,

71
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,362
after so many years,

72
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:17,162
you've been treating me like

73
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,402
a chess piece for your game.

74
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:19,282
You sent me overseas,

75
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:20,922
so that

76
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:22,442
you can use me in the future.

77
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:24,802
But I don't want to be
your chess piece anymore.

78
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:26,562
Since I'm back,

79
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,122
I want to try playing chess.

80
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:31,042
Give me three months,

81
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:33,082
I'll go back to Hupu then.

82
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:35,122
As for this old hotel,

83
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:36,962
just wait and see.

84
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:41,122
Hello.

85
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,036
(Can't miss these foods and places
in Wusu.)

86
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,349
(Meng's Noodle House, small but tasty.)

87
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,373
(I was lining up in
Meng's Noodle House, too crowded.)

88
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:56,562
Lin Zong.

89
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:58,082
Come here.

90
00:03:58,722 --> 00:03:59,202
Prepare

91
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,162
and go out with me.

92
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,202
Mr. Xiao,

93
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,122
I didn't see it.

94
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,762
Where are we going?

95
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:06,562
Don't ask.

96
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:07,482
Just come with me.

97
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:09,162
Mr. Xiao.

98
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,122
A newly appointed person will
definitely show off his capability.

99
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:16,442
Now, Mr. Xiao, you must be busy

100
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:17,562
doing that.

101
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:19,362
Good luck.

102
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,161
Isn't this the person

103
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,122
who said she

104
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:24,161
never wanted to see me again?

105
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,161
Friends bring you opportunity.

106
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,882
One less enemy causes you
less headache.

107
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:28,442
Right?

108
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:29,802
So, we're

109
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,402
enemies now?

110
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,602
You've been going against me
all these years,

111
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,402
right?

112
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:36,802
Go ahead.

113
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,002
What do you want me to do?

114
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:42,762
Well,

115
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:44,682
because you called our hotline,

116
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:45,562
our program

117
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:46,602
has become popular once again.

118
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:48,202
As long as you come to our program,

119
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:48,842
we can

120
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,122
continue with it.

121
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:51,762
But, don't be nervous.

122
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:52,522
You'll just have to

123
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,642
read out our script loud

124
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:54,282
accordingly.

125
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,002
Hold on.

126
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:56,362
Do you think I don't want to go

127
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,482
because I'm nervous?

128
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,802
To revive a program

129
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:00,842
from death

130
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,602
takes so little?

131
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:05,602
Mr. Xiao,

132
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:06,482
do you need

133
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:07,402
any help from me?

134
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:08,322
I'm all ears.

135
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:11,002
Here.

136
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:15,842
Go.

137
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:17,202
Negotiate to half the price

138
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:18,642
and record the final price

139
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:19,402
of the vegetables.

140
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:21,402
Go now.

141
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:25,762
Hi, sir.

142
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:26,882
How much is the tomato?

143
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:27,922
This is RMB 5.

144
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,002
What about RMB 2.5?

145
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:30,442
No way.

146
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:32,602
How much is the cauliflower?

147
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:33,402
How much is 0.5 kg?

148
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:34,242
RMB 6.

149
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:35,482
What about RMB 3 for 0.5 kg?

150
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,242
Go away!

151
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,442
How can you bargain like that?

152
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:38,122
Sir,

153
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,402
how much is the grass carp?

154
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:40,442
This is RMB 16.

155
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:41,882
Can it be RMB 6 for 0.5 kg?

156
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:42,922
This is RMB 8.

157
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:43,602
What about RMB 10?

158
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:44,602
Give me the intestine for free.

159
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:45,482
Intestine for free?

160
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:46,282
I'm not selling.

161
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:47,562
If I buy more, can it be RMB 15?

162
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:48,682
If you're not buying anything,

163
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,122
go somewhere else, okay?

164
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,122
Satisfied?

165
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:55,682
Thank you.

166
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,960
Let's go to the next place.

167
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:02,562
Do you want to eat noodles here?

168
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,842
The queue is so long.

169
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,322
We can only queue up by ourselves,

170
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:06,562
and we can't get the number.

171
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:08,242
Let's queue up.

172
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,014
(Cash only)

173
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:16,602
Sir,

174
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:18,962
do you take WePay?

175
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,602
Cash only.

176
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:21,842
Otherwise, just leave.

177
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:25,402
They only take cash here.

178
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:26,522
I didn't bring money with me.

179
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,962
Why not we come again next time?

180
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:29,042
I don't like to wait.

181
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,442
No matter it's next time,

182
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,562
explanation or apology.

183
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:37,642
You should've told me
that you have cash.

184
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,642
The taste is not bad.

185
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,802
No wonder the owner's temper is so bad,

186
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,482
but the customers keep coming.

187
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:49,082
How did you find this place?

188
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:57,322
Right,

189
00:06:58,242 --> 00:06:58,922
ask the owner

190
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:00,002
for his WeChat.

191
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:06,722
They only take cash.

192
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,242
Do you think he's using WeChat?

193
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:10,362
Get his number then.

194
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:18,762
Sir,

195
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:20,242
can you please give me

196
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:21,202
your phone number?

197
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,842
Whose number is 250?

198
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:23,442
Come.

199
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:24,922
Let me do it.

200
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:26,362
Number 250?

201
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:26,922
Yes.

202
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:27,282
Be careful.

203
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:28,002
Thank you.

204
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,482
Number 13, your noodle is ready.

205
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:30,922
Let me do it.

206
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:31,562
Where's number 13?

207
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:32,562
Here.

208
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:36,802
Thank you, sir.

209
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:41,242
The owner said

210
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,602
he might not be able to
pick up calls.

211
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:51,762
Mr. Xiao,

212
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:53,202
are you satisfied today?

213
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:54,882
Our program is at 10 p.m.

214
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:55,962
You can be here by 9 p.m.

215
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:57,282
Clear me

216
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:58,642
from your blocked list.

217
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,082
Otherwise, how can I find you?

218
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:02,882
Yes.

219
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:08,362
My dear friend, Xiao Shangqi.

220
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,162
Look.

221
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:10,720
(Settings, Edit contact, Starred, Block)

222
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,722
I'll be waiting for you tonight
at the door.

223
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,002
After picking you up,

224
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:16,082
we'll run through the scripts.

225
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:19,602
Who said I'm going?

226
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:23,882
Dajiabang For Everyone

227
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:24,842
is a low-standard program

228
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:25,842
that's going to end.

229
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:27,482
What does that have to do with me?

230
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,002
Are you upset?

231
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:35,322
Congratulations.

232
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:37,162
You've felt one tenth of what

233
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:38,042
I felt.

234
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,602
Why is she not here yet?

235
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:04,442
The starting speech was recording.

236
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:06,682
No worries. All will be well.

237
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:08,162
When the song is finished,

238
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:09,242
I'll do it if she's not here.

239
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:11,882
Can I make it?

240
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:12,922
You're finally here.

241
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:13,882
Where's your audience
who called the hotline?

242
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:14,802
He's here.

243
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,082
Where's he?

244
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:35,402
Welcome back.

245
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:37,642
This is FM78.8,

246
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:38,842
Dajiabang For Everyone.

247
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,202
I'm your host, He.

248
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:42,922
I'm sure you remember

249
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,762
the mysterious call last night.

250
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,522
Actually, the person who called

251
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,642
was a long-lost friend of mine.

252
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:50,362
He's Xiao.

253
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,042
Our story

254
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,162
goes back to

255
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,082
many years ago.

256
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:57,722
That time,

257
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,282
I was transferred to a new high school.

258
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:00,682
On the first day,

259
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:01,722
I met a few gangsters.

260
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,402
(Younger He Xiaoran)
What are you doing?

261
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:04,442
We want to

262
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:05,522
be your friends.

263
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:14,202
Get lost!

264
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,082
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

265
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,553
(Younger Xiao Shangqi)

266
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:32,922
(Xiao)

267
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:34,602
(was so brave and he saved me.)

268
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:36,042
(Ever since then,)

269
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:38,002
(we became good friends.)

270
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:39,562
(At school,)

271
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,122
(we learned together)

272
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:42,562
(and grew together.)

273
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,522
(We spent the best days)

274
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,122
(of our youth together,)

275
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,082
(and our friendship was pure and true.)

276
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:52,002
(Such pure friendship)

277
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,282
(was gone on one fine day.)

278
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,122
Today,

279
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:00,682
my friend, Xiao,

280
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:02,922
is here in the studio.

281
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,402
Let's welcome him to tell us

282
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:08,162
the embarrassing past.

283
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,282
Is that okay, Xiao?

284
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:13,082
Okay.

285
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:25,522
Is she playing the recording?

286
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:26,882
I don't know.

287
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:29,122
Xiao went to university

288
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:30,362
and started to

289
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:31,762
date different girls

290
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:33,562
at the same time.

291
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,002
I once told him not to,

292
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:36,202
but he insisted.

293
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:37,362
Xiao,

294
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,322
why didn't you

295
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,602
end a relationship

296
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,442
before you start another relationship?

297
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:45,962
I don't like to wait.

298
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:48,202
They only take cash.

299
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:49,242
I didn't bring money.

300
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,882
Why not we come again next time?

301
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,162
I don't like to wait.

302
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,762
Then, Xiao

303
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:58,122
would buy things for his girlfriends.

304
00:11:58,402 --> 00:11:59,682
He maxed out his credit card.

305
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:01,922
Then he went and got a personal loan.

306
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,242
Due to the compounding interest,

307
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:04,402
he can't afford to pay the money.

308
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,882
Then he came and borrowed money from me.

309
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:07,922
At that moment,

310
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:09,602
I couldn't bring myself to reject him.

311
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:11,602
After all, he used to be

312
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,922
my best friend.

313
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:15,882
I lent money to Xiao.

314
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:17,282
Then he went missing.

315
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,202
We lost contact.

316
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:21,322
He ran away.

317
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:22,402
Xiao,

318
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:24,442
now you looked for me again.

319
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,282
What do you want from me?

320
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,322
I should apologize to you

321
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,282
for betraying you.

322
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:33,362
I'm sorry, He Xiaoran.

323
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:34,802
I'm sorry.

324
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:37,762
How was your life

325
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:38,762
overseas?

326
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:40,242
A bit better than yours.

327
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:42,402
You didn't get to know new friends?

328
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:43,882
He Xiaoran,

329
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:44,442
why did you suddenly

330
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:45,322
start caring about me?

331
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:46,802
Just a small talk.

332
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,082
Compared to these,

333
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:49,202
shouldn't you

334
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:50,642
apologize to me

335
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:52,002
for betraying me?

336
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,162
When did you start becoming
so stubborn

337
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,202
about apology?

338
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,322
I should apologize to you

339
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:58,282
for betraying you.

340
00:12:58,802 --> 00:12:59,882
I'm sorry, He Xiaoran.

341
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:00,642
I'm sorry.

342
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:01,642
It's too late.

343
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:03,962
Not every apology

344
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,282
will be accepted and forgiven.

345
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:07,642
Xiao,

346
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:10,322
let bygones by bygones.

347
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:12,122
It's useless to talk about it.

348
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,482
I hope you'll live a good life

349
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,762
from now on.

350
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,562
Let's listen to a song.

351
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:29,203
♪The night is dark and real♪

352
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:30,042
It's great.

353
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,682
Mr. He sent a message to compliment us.

354
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:42,883
♪Looking at the familiar stranger
next to me♪

355
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:43,722
(Miss He,)

356
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:45,642
(I'm waiting for you at Jiangbei Bridge.)

357
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:47,122
(See you there.)

358
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,043
♪I want to admit tonight's innocence♪

359
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,362
I'm sorry?

♪The gentle tone♪

361
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,402
He Xiaoran,

362
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:07,922
your classmate has left?

363
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:09,802
Why didn't you treat him to a meal?

364
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:12,802
Leave my classmate alone.

365
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:13,962
Are we continuing our program?

366
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:14,802
Is it fixed?

367
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,362
Yes.

368
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,682
Boss said it's interesting and trending.

369
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,322
Mr. He,

370
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:29,722
there's something

371
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,722
that I need to tell you.

372
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:31,922
What's it?

373
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:35,322
In today's program, I was using

374
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:36,802
recording.

375
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:38,962
Recording?

376
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:40,882
The timing was not right.

377
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,642
You sound like we didn't use

378
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:44,042
recording before.

379
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,322
I did some editing.

380
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:51,482
He Xiaoran,

381
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:53,762
you're terrible.

382
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:55,602
Didn't I do it to keep the program?

383
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:56,482
Don't worry.

384
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,962
I'm taking all the responsibility.

385
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,122
I'll write

386
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,362
a full report.

387
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,162
Well,

388
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,042
I'll represent the program

389
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:06,962
and look for him.

390
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:08,322
I'll apologize

391
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,562
to him.

392
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:12,322
It's okay.

393
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:14,562
We'll talk about this later.

394
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:15,562
Let's go.

395
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:17,122
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

(Reception Office)

397
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:23,122
Hello.

398
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:24,002
Hello, Miss He.

399
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:24,882
Can you come over?

400
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:26,522
Sorry, sir.

401
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:27,162
Please leave.

402
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,042
I've told you many times.

403
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:29,922
I'm not the person

404
00:15:30,122 --> 00:15:30,762
who harassed her yesterday.

405
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,002
Don't you understand?

406
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,042
He Xiaoran.

407
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:38,322
Miss He,

408
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,482
he insisted that he's your friend.

409
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:40,202
Do you know him?

410
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:41,362
Xiao.

411
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:42,362
Miss He.

412
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,602
We just spoke to each other

413
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:44,442
on the program.

414
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:46,882
No worries.

415
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,482
I just used your voice

416
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,402
on the program.

417
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,202
As long as you don't come up
and tell the world,

418
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,122
no one will know it's you,

419
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:54,922
okay?

420
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:56,642
You used my voice.

421
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,442
Did you ask for my consent?

422
00:15:58,762 --> 00:15:59,602
I've used it.

423
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:00,842
That's vandalism.

424
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:01,842
Did you know that?

425
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:02,642
No.

426
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:06,442
Xiaoran, can we go now?

427
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:07,722
- Yes.
- No.

428
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,402
Let's go, Xiaoran. Let's go for a meal.

429
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,162
I'm hungry.

430
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:11,722
Let's go.

431
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:12,402
Let's go for a meal.

432
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,762
Let's go.

433
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:19,642
This program

434
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,802
has a lot of weird audiences.

435
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:21,202
Look.

436
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:21,962
There's a guy, Lone Star, in the group

437
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:22,722
that has been commenting.

438
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,082
He asked Miss He

439
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:25,002
to meet him under the bridge.

440
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:27,922
Well...

441
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,522
Where's Mr. He?

442
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:35,802
He's making a call.

443
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:36,882
Are you trying to scare me?

444
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:38,642
Just now I called your friend,

445
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:39,602
Xiao.

446
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,362
He said that the recording

447
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,482
wasn't edited by you.

448
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:44,322
He said he took the interview.

449
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,442
He said that?

450
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,282
It's not a big deal.

451
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:54,042
Come on.

452
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:58,802
Come on.

453
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:00,962
Enough, pour lesser.

454
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,438
(Dajiabang audience group)

455
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,362
(Night Lone Star,)

456
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,161
(go back now.)

457
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:17,602
(Miss He won't be going.)

458
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,482
(Will he commit suicide?)

459
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,362
(Otherwise,
why did he choose this place?)

460
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:33,441
(Night Lone Star wants to add you)
Back then, Dajiabang

461
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,922
was the best

462
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,082
of the best programs.

463
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,602
If your call was picked up

464
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:41,762
and you're able to talk to the host,

465
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:44,122
you could show off in front
of your friends

466
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,522
for a month.

467
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:47,242
Do you like it?

468
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,002
Go ahead. What song is that?

469
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:48,722
Well,

470
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:49,482
I'm leaving.

471
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:50,402
I just remember
that I have something on.

472
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:51,402
Let me see you off.

473
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:52,162
No need.

474
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,322
Carry on.

475
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:54,802
Eat more for me.

476
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:35,762
Miss He,

477
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:37,842
you're finally here.

478
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,642
Mr. Liu, you...

479
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:40,922
You're...

480
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,002
Yes, it's me.

481
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:43,162
Well,

482
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:44,682
don't be scared.

483
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,522
I just want to talk to you

484
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:47,762
before I die.

485
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:49,402
Don't be scared, really.

486
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:50,082
It's fine.

487
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:51,482
What...

488
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:52,322
What do you want to do?

489
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:53,722
Just talk to me.

490
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,042
Mr. Liu.

491
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:00,042
- Mr. Liu.
- Don't come near.

492
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:00,842
Come down first.

493
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:01,762
Don't come near or I'll jump off.

494
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:02,842
Come down first.

495
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,162
You tricked her out of her sympathy

496
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:05,402
and lured her here.

497
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,242
You're such a terrible person.

498
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:09,362
Who are you?

499
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,402
Why you every time?

500
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,842
How could you say I tricked her?

501
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:16,682
I'm sick of living.

502
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,442
I just want to talk to her before I die,

503
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:19,242
can't I?

504
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:20,842
Mr. Liu,

505
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:21,962
didn't you say

506
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:23,282
you have something to talk to me?

507
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:24,922
Come down and we'll talk about it.

508
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,082
Come down first.

509
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,362
He.

510
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:41,642
I know.

511
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,322
You're a nice person.

512
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:49,002
I've heard of your program a lot.

513
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:52,122
Actually, I'm the same as you.

514
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:53,722
I...

515
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:55,282
I did everything

516
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,482
to help my friend.

517
00:19:58,922 --> 00:19:59,802
I've borrowed a lot of money

518
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,602
to help him.

519
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,202
After he took the money,

520
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,962
he's gone.

521
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,522
They took my wife and
my children away from me.

522
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:15,082
I escaped to one city

523
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:17,002
and then to another city.

524
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,202
I have nowhere else to go.

525
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:20,442
I've been in this city

526
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:22,682
roaming for more than six months.

527
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,962
I really can't do anything.

528
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:27,242
Maybe in his story,

529
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,082
you're the one he's not able to contact.

530
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:30,482
He wants to return the money,
but he can't find you.

531
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:31,642
No way!

532
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:33,282
He owes me money!

533
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,522
He's gone!

534
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,882
If someone wants to hide from you,

535
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,882
he'll block you, delete your number
and run away!

536
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:40,202
You can't

537
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:41,002
track him!

538
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:43,922
Mr. Liu,

539
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:45,722
it's okay. Come down first.

540
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:46,722
What are you doing?

541
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:48,242
Don't call the police!

542
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:50,162
I'm taking a video.

543
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,682
It has nothing to do with us at all.

544
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:52,402
Stop taking video of me.

545
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:53,642
- Stop taking video of me.
- What are you doing?

546
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:54,562
Well,

547
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,562
I heard that you look the ugliest
if you die of drowning.

548
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:58,962
The corpse will be swollen

549
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,282
and your parents can't
even recognize you.

550
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,602
Well,

551
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:03,522
your wife and children are gone.

552
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,562
No family will come and identify you

553
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,602
after you die.

554
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:09,082
Also,

555
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,842
this Miss He here

556
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,282
is good at editing videos.

557
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,282
After you die,

558
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:17,962
she will change the whole story

559
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:21,242
and who knows how it will become?

560
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,522
Stop taking video!

561
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:50,122
Are you okay?

562
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:56,602
Actually,

563
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:58,682
I dare not commit suicide.

564
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:10,522
Mr. Liu, you know what?

565
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,362
"My life is gone"

566
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,002
is the biggest cage

567
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,202
in this world.

568
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:20,562
Don't go in.

569
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:24,762
(To you,)

570
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:25,802
(my current life)

571
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:27,242
(is terrible,)

572
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:28,962
(but I like this kind of life)

573
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:30,602
(that's full of trivial matters.)

574
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,042
(If something nice happens,)

575
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:32,962
(I'll be very happy)

576
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,202
(like on cloud nine.)

577
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:39,842
Think about it.

578
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:43,162
You're desperate

579
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:45,282
because you hold nice hopes

580
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:47,402
towards the world.

581
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:48,802
As long as you're alive,

582
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:50,842
even though nothing good happens,

583
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,282
there are bad things going to happen.

584
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:53,642
As long as something happens,

585
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,962
be it bad or good,

586
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:57,842
at least it

587
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,202
means something has happened.

588
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:00,242
As long as

589
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:01,402
you work hard,

590
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:02,322
your life

591
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:05,002
will become better.

592
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:06,562
Yes.

593
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,442
Even something bad happens...

594
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:13,482
I've learned how to

595
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:14,682
face it over the years.

596
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:19,202
When we're at the bottom,

597
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,642
every step that we take

598
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,242
is going up.

599
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:24,002
Am I right?

600
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,282
He,

601
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,482
thank you for coming.

602
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:32,962
Thank you.

603
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:38,922
Keep it up.

604
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:55,882
Why did you come here?

605
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,282
I was worried that you'll be
dragged into the river.

606
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:04,242
You haven't apologized to me.

607
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:08,642
Fine.

608
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:10,522
Let's be frank today.

609
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:13,282
Just because

610
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:15,162
I confessed my love to you,

611
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:16,762
I have to apologize to you?

612
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:19,602
What do you mean by

613
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:21,242
you confessed you love to me?

614
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:28,922
Answer me.

615
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:30,482
Why did you leave that night?

616
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:31,762
Which night?

617
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,402
The day of our graduation night.

618
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:38,362
(There was a boy.)

619
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:39,762
Hello.

620
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:41,042
(He's been staying in the hotel
since young.)

621
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:42,762
Fei'er.

622
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:44,562
(Sometimes, he'd feel lonely.)

623
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:45,322
Where are you?

624
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:46,882
(But he's bright)

625
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:47,922
(and easygoing.)

626
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:50,082
(After graduation,)

627
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:53,322
(we'll walk on separate paths.)

628
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:54,882
(We might...)

629
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,122
Fei'er.

630
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:08,722
Fei'er.

631
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,802
Fei'er.

632
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:20,402
What happened to your face?

633
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,362
Don't be afraid.

634
00:25:39,762 --> 00:25:42,002
I had an emergency that day.

635
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,522
I left in the middle of the event.

636
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:46,242
So, on the next day,

637
00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:47,682
I didn't get to send you to the exam.

638
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,642
I'm sorry.

639
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,842
You've seen it?

640
00:25:58,082 --> 00:25:58,922
What?

641
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:00,242
The video.

642
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:01,882
What video?

643
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:17,082
Why not add me back on WeChat?

644
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:22,402
What are you doing?

645
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:33,322
I don't normally

646
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,522
use my phone

647
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,242
and read my text.

648
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:37,482
Plus,

649
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,002
the signal in my office is poor.

650
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:41,522
Let's use WeChat.

651
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:45,002
Thank you.

652
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
(Jifeng Hotel)

653
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:07,082
I've spent so much effort
to repair this.

654
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:08,322
I've gone to all the electrical shops.

655
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:09,602
And finally, I've fixed it for you.

656
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:11,202
Thank you.

657
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,842
Your hobby is special.

658
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:15,482
This is old.

659
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,402
I'm leaving.

660
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:34,602
(Miss He,)

661
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:35,762
(I can't listen often to)

662
00:27:35,762 --> 00:27:36,722
(your program anymore.)

663
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:38,362
(Your friend, Xiao,)

664
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:39,562
(has bought me the ticket.)

665
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:41,362
(I've decided to go back home)

666
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:42,682
(and start over again.)

667
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:44,442
(All the best to you.)

668
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:45,322
Li Hui,

669
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:47,562
how many we have recorded today?

670
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:50,722
Let me see.

671
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:53,602
"The battle of a reformed family."

672
00:27:54,202 --> 00:27:56,362
"My best friend and my little brother."

673
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:57,362
Xiaoran,

674
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:58,402
what else do you have there?

675
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:03,082
Let's stop recording.

676
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:04,402
Let's pick up

677
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:05,482
real audiences' calls.

678
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,602
Real audiences?

679
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,442
How many real audiences do we have?

680
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:12,002
Furthermore,

681
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:13,082
we can't control it.

682
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:14,722
Just pick up every call
that we're able to pick up.

683
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:16,482
All the fake set-up recordings

684
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:18,242
can only draw attention

685
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:19,482
for a short period of time.

686
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:20,922
If we want to do this program
on a long term basis,

687
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:22,122
we need to be able to help others

688
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:23,362
for real.

689
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:27,442
Is this He Xiaoran that we know?

690
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:29,282
She's inspired.

691
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:32,722
I just don't want to be

692
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:34,082
like Mr. Liu

693
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:35,402
and give up like this.

694
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:37,242
He Xiaoran is right.

695
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:38,762
Although our program

696
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:40,802
is able to continue,

697
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:42,562
we don't have any audiences

698
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:43,562
and we don't have any reputation.

699
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,442
We'll be eliminated easily.

700
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,402
So,

701
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:49,242
if we can get some advertisement,

702
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:51,402
we'll have time to build

703
00:28:51,602 --> 00:28:52,922
our real audiences

704
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:53,602
and reputation over time.

705
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:55,482
It's not a big deal.

706
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:56,802
I'll get my mother

707
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,242
to sponsor us.

708
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:00,522
Why not ask her

709
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:02,002
to just give us money?

710
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,562
I don't mean to let you down.

711
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:07,202
Advertisement?

712
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:08,362
We don't even get to read a slogan

713
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:09,722
for one year plus.

714
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:13,762
But, there's a chance.

715
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:14,962
Next month,

716
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:16,562
the NRTA is opened for tendering.

717
00:29:17,682 --> 00:29:19,602
You're really taking a big step.

718
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,522
NRTA's open tendering

719
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:22,962
only happens twice a year.

720
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,162
Many programs

721
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,322
will try their best to get the tender.

Welcome to join
the school news agency.

744
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:10,922
The school news agency
welcomes everyone here.

745
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:12,162
Hi,

746
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:12,962
what does the news agency

747
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:13,922
give away as a present?

748
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:15,402
The anime association gave us key chain.

749
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:16,802
The literature association
gave us notebooks.

750
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:17,602
What about you?

751
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:19,042
We're not giving out anything.

752
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:19,922
But as long as you join

753
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:20,802
the school news agency,

754
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:22,482
you can speak up for yourself

755
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:23,482
and show your attitude

756
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:24,682
towards life.

757
00:30:24,882 --> 00:30:26,242
You can record the realest

758
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:28,282
greatness and simplicity of this era.

759
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,042
If you're interested,

760
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,082
I can brief you

761
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:31,802
the exciting journals

762
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,042
that we've done before.

763
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:34,202
Okay.

764
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,082
Just last month,

765
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:38,602
we interviewed a school.

766
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:54,882
Xiaoran, this way.

767
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:01,082
Aren't you silly?

768
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:01,842
Is the equipment more important

769
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:02,842
than your body?

770
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:05,962
The equipment doesn't cost much,

771
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:07,642
but the video recorded

772
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,842
and the interviews are valuable.

773
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:10,922
If this is the war zone,

774
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:12,002
there's no second chance.

775
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:13,202
Xiaoran,

776
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:15,242
you really want to become
a war correspondent, don't you?

777
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:16,362
Of course.

778
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:17,962
If you can't

779
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:18,642
stop the war,

780
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:19,962
- tell the world
- Tell the world

781
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:21,522
- the truth.
- the truth.

Mr. Wang,

784
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:37,882
can you give me more time?

785
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:39,522
I want to introduce our program.

Dajiabang For Everyone

787
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,642
is a very meaningful program,

788
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:43,362
and it has a history

789
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:44,362
of more than 10 years.

790
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:45,242
It's engaged with emotions,

791

living and cultures.

792
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,242
Can we set up an appointment

793
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:49,922
with you for next week?

794
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:55,682
Mr. Wang, see you.

This is the document you asked for.

796
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,002
Get me a car.

Are you going out?

798
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:09,802
Pull over at the bus station
across the street.

799
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:16,802
No need, sir.

800
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:17,642
Thanks, but no.

801
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:20,522
Get another one.

802
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,202
Okay.

803
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:27,602

Mr. Xiao,

809
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:48,842
I heard that Miss He

810
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:50,802
is busy with the tendering lately.

811
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:52,562
She goes off work late every day.

812
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:55,442
Thank you, sir.

813
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,042

00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,562
including all the interviews
that he has done,

815
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:16,722
all the things that he has said,

816
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:18,642
and his family background.

817
00:33:18,882 --> 00:33:19,682
Make sure you know

818
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:21,202
what topics he's interested in

819

is.

Yes.

I got it checked.

827

The concentration is too high.

828
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:34,082
It's just that there's no related news.

829

is the trending top 10

849
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:22,202
real?

850
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:23,442
How did it come by?

851
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:24,442
Also,

852
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:26,002
how did you approach your clients?

853
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:27,842
Actually, I've heard of these.

854
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,042
The colleagues from
the advertising department told me

855
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,321
lately a lot of clients

856
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:32,442
were complaining that

857
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:34,402
a host with the surname He

858
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:35,882
kept bothering them.

859
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:38,162
But, two clients said that

860
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:39,602
they're willing to know more
about our program

861
00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:41,281
on the pitch meeting.

862
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,281
Can we have 10 minutes?

863
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:45,321
I know

864
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:46,761
all the other programs have 30 minutes

865
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,042
on the pitch meeting.

866
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:49,442
We just need 10 minutes.

867
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,362
I also heard from Mr. He that

868
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:53,402
10 years ago,

869
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,522
you were a host

870
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:55,602
for Dajiabang, too.

871
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:57,082
I believe you love

872
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,082
this program, right?

873
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:01,162
Can you give us

874
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,002
a chance?

875
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:03,962
You're bombarding me like how

876
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:05,282
you bombarded the clients.

877
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:06,002
Eight minutes.

878
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:07,362
That's fine.

879
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,082
I admire your

880
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,722
pestering skill.

881
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:18,322
Just like how I was when I was young.

882
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:20,562
Well,

883
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,002
go out with me.

884
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:26,322
(Feel at home)
Miss Zhou,

885
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:27,522
I'm the general manager of Jifeng,

886
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:28,522
Xiao Shangqi.

887
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:29,482
Welcome.

888
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:31,242
Mr. Xiao, you're young and capable.

889
00:35:31,602 --> 00:35:32,562
Let me introduce.

890
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:33,762
This is my colleague.

891
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:36,242
Miss He from Dajiabang For Everyone.

892
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,362
You know each other?

893
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,322
We were classmates and friends.

894
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:41,482
Not too close.

895
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:44,202
Excuse me.

896
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,082
Let me pick up a call.

897
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:45,842
Okay.

898
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:46,682
Hello.

899
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:48,962
I can't speak for you.

900
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:49,882
My words don't carry weight.

901
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,042
Don't worry.

902
00:35:52,562 --> 00:35:53,442
I know roughly about

903
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:54,482
your job scope.

904
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,202
Fake the audiences' recording,

905
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:57,642
draw attention by giving out brochures,

906
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:59,162
pester the clients,

907
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:00,962
and go around with your boss

908
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:02,602
to flatter others.

909
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:04,762
He Xiaoran,

910
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:06,602
is this what you want?

911
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:07,842
You're so free.

912
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:08,922
You know everything.

913
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,242
Resign as soon as possible.

914
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:11,482
If you continue

915
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:12,482
staying in Wusu,

916
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:13,882
you're gone.

917
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:15,242
It's my fault that

918
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:16,362
I didn't explain myself clearly.

919
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,002
When I'm done with my works,

920
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:19,202
come back to Hupu with me.

921
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:23,122
How is it?

922
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:24,802
Can we start now?

923
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:28,842
This way, please.

924
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:30,002
Let's go to the ballroom first.

925
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:30,802
Okay.

926
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:31,842
Let's go.

927
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,482
This is the ballroom.

928
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:40,282
Although the facility looks

929
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:41,442
a bit old,

930
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:42,802
it will look nice

931
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:43,882
after decorating.

932
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,322
Are you okay?

933
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:48,202
I'm sorry.

934
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:49,682
I have this thing.

935
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:51,002
I'm allergic to

936
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,642
a dusty place.

937
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,122
The carpet

938
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:58,002
hasn't been washed for a while, right?

939
00:36:58,922 --> 00:36:59,762
It seems like my former classmate

940
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:01,402
has a new illness now.

941
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:03,602
Wusu is not as suitable for you

942
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:04,962
as Hupu.

943
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:08,682
I

944
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:09,882
have stayed in the places with good air

945
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:10,842
for too long.

946
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:13,482
So, when I came to a dirty place
like this,

947
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:14,882
I became allergic.

948
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:22,642
The view is beautiful.

949
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:25,202
The environment is not bad.

950
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:27,362
Miss Zhou,

951
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:28,562
is that a layer of dust

952
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:29,962
in the glass?

953
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:32,042
You didn't wash it clean.

954
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:34,122
When did you become

955
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:35,202
a perfectionist?

956
00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:36,602
This observation of yours

957
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:37,922
shouldn't be hidden
in a late night program.

958
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:39,122
I'm not a perfectionist.

959
00:37:39,362 --> 00:37:40,202
I'm a realist.

960
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:41,442
Mr. Xiao, I wonder how you

961
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:42,242
can endure

962
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:43,642
an environment like this.

963
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:46,602
Our advantage here

964
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:49,042
is our location.

965
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:50,562
Next,

966
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:51,482
guestroom.

967
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:52,762
Please.

968
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:00,402
The guestroom is not soundproof
and the mattress is too hard.

969
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:01,282
Also,

970
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:02,682
the office desk is damaged.

971
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:04,042
The hygiene of the place is bad.

972
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:05,842
All the goods are cheap.

973
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:07,922
Also, the renovation here

974
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:09,162
is a little too old.

975
00:38:09,562 --> 00:38:10,522
Their breakfast here

976
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:11,602
is known to be awful.

977
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:12,922
The package meal should be

978
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:14,442
terrible as well.

979
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:16,562
I heard that lately they had
power shortages, too.

980
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,082
I encountered that myself two days back.

981
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:19,962
Why not we go to another hotel?

982
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,602
It's just like what you said.

983
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:24,242
The facility here is

984
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:25,642
not satisfying,

985
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,722
but Mr. Xiao is right, too.

986
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:29,122
The location is good.

987
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:30,682
It's near to our station.

988
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:31,802
Also, I've read

989
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:32,762
Mr. Xiao's proposal.

990
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,162
Besides having the detailed researches

991
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:35,122
on all the activities

992
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:36,602
in the past five years,

993
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:37,962
they added the design

994
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:39,202
that's full of Wusu's historical flair.

995
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,482
I think it's attractive.

996
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,402
Miss Zhou, don't worry.

997
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:43,762
We'll improve on

998
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,042
all the issues that you raised.

999
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,362
Actually, we're planning to

1000
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:47,362
renovate the whole hotel

1001
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,082
for the open tendering.

1002
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:50,362
Don't worry.

1003
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:51,762
I'll make sure the tendering

1004
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:52,522
is done properly.

1005
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:53,922
That's great.

1006
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:56,562
But, looking at the current situation,

1007
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:57,602
I personally think

1008
00:38:57,842 --> 00:38:58,682
the quotation

1009
00:38:58,802 --> 00:38:59,922
is on the high side.

1010
00:39:00,362 --> 00:39:01,442
Can you reduce it?

1011
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:02,842
Like 20%?

1012
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:04,442
Miss Zhou,

1013
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,962
this is our first collaboration.

1014
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:06,842
Actually,

1015
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:07,682
I want to represent Jifeng

1016
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,802
to express our sincerity,

1017
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:10,642
especially for He Xiaoran.

1018
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,042
She was my classmate.

1019
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:12,842
I need to

1020
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:13,842
show her a favor.

1021
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:15,002
No need.

1022
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:16,482
Let's do it the formal way.

1023
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:18,082
Since Xiaoran

1024
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,722
thinks the rooms are not good,

1025
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:20,882
the rooms will be free of charge.

1026
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,042
Also,

1027
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:23,362
since she thinks the food is not nice,

1028
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:24,602
that'd be free of charge, too.

1029
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:25,722
You just need to pay

1030
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:26,482
for the hall.

1031
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:31,482
Miss Zhou,

1032
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:32,642
do consider it.

1033
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:33,882
I still have something on.

1034
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:35,162
Looking forward to working with you.

1035
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:35,962
Okay, sure.

1036
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:37,442
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

1037
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:38,082
Thank you.

1038
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:38,802
Thank you.

1039
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:46,442
He,

1040
00:39:47,522 --> 00:39:49,402
he shows you a big favor.

1041
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:50,362
This will save us

1042
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:51,522
a lot of money.

1043
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:53,122
All right.

1044
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,322
Now, you have to go up

1045
00:39:55,322 --> 00:39:56,202
to the stage.

1046
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:57,642
You're in.

1047
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:58,682
The duration will be the same as others,

1048
00:39:58,922 --> 00:39:59,762
half an hour.

1049
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:00,522
But, show me

1050
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:01,442
your script

1051
00:40:01,682 --> 00:40:02,722
before you go up.

1052
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:03,722
It has to be preapproved.

1053
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:05,922
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

1054
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:06,962
Okay.

1055
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,242
I'm going back to the station now.

1056
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:17,402
I still owe him a favor now.

1057
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:24,002
I knew

1058
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:24,962
we can't let him take in any client.

1059
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:26,122
We didn't have any event
in the past three years.

1060
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:27,322
This event will cost us
three years' of expenses.

1061
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,482
Everything is basically free.

1062
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,322
We got the job as it's affordable.

1063
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:32,802
It's all free,

1064
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,322
just because of that host...

1065
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,922
It seems like you're not

1066
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,082
happy with my decision.

1067
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,082
No way, Mr. Xiao.

1068
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:42,642
I can understand, Mr. Xiao.

1069
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:43,882
You have foresight.

1070
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:47,322
Either good or bad,
we're profiting from it.

1071
00:40:47,602 --> 00:40:48,122
Bad?

1072
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:48,842
No

1073
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:49,682
No, Mr. Xiao.

1074
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:51,322
Lin's saying that

1075
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:53,042
reducing the price

1076
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:53,962
may not be a good way

1077
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:54,842
in long term.

1078
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:56,282
If we mess it up,

1079
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:57,722
it's embarrassing.

1080
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:58,922
What are you saying?

1081
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:00,842
You're right.

1082
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:03,202
So, I've promised Miss Zhou

1083
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,082
to renovate the hotel.

1084
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:07,162
She gave me some opinions
for the proposal.

1085
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:08,642
After taking a look,

1086
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:10,722
it's really the style that I like.

1087
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:13,482
Where do we have the money

1088
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:15,042
for the renovation?

1089
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:16,082
Money?

1090
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,762
We'll bear the cost.

1091
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:19,402
What about the guests?

1092
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:21,362
Cancel all the booking.

1093
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:23,122
We'll start the renovation

1094
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:24,562
once the guests have checked out.

1095
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:25,311
(Jifeng Hotel)

1096
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:35,061
(Coming soon)

1097
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:43,762
Father.

1098
00:41:44,642 --> 00:41:46,162
Why are you so upset?

1099
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:47,080
Look at this.

1100
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,933
(Financial statements)

1101
00:42:00,922 --> 00:42:01,682
So many expenses.

1102
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:03,322
Ever since Qi went there,

1103
00:42:03,602 --> 00:42:05,122
the expenses are getting higher.

1104
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:06,482
We're not only losing

1105
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:07,682
the operating fund now.

1106
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:08,802
Now, Jifeng

1107
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,282
is like a black hole, father.

1108
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:12,162
Are you going to let him
do this at will?

1109
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:15,882
What's Zhao Mingxuan doing?

1110
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:17,162
What else can he be doing?

1111
00:42:17,282 --> 00:42:18,002
He's waiting for us to fail.

1112
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,402
It's spreading in the industry that

1113
00:42:20,562 --> 00:42:21,082
Yunlan

1114
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:22,122
has this parasite in the company,

1115
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,202
who will one day destroy the company.

1116
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:25,882
I think this was

1117
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,002
spread by him.

1118
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:29,042
If we allow this to go on,

1119
00:42:29,442 --> 00:42:30,082
our reputation

1120
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:31,122
will be affected.

1121
00:42:31,522 --> 00:42:32,202
Father.

1122
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:44,922
He asked for three months.
That's fine.

1123
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:47,242
If there's no improvement,

1124
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:48,442
let's see what he's going to say.

1125
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:07,282
He's making such a scene.

1126
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:12,962
He's nothing like anyone
from Xiao family.

1127
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:15,922
Just monitor him. No need to bother.

1128
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:18,122
Just let him do what he wants.

1129
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:20,962
If he makes more mistakes,

1130
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:22,642
Xiao's reputation

1131
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:24,282
will be stained further,

1132
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:26,162
