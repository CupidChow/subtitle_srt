Then you...

19
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:46,228
You feel guilty because
you've done something wrong.

20

Otherwise, you wouldn't have

panicked over a little mouse.

22
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:05,908
I'll leave my resignation letter

23
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:06,748
on your desk tomorrow.

24
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:10,788
You can sue me,

25
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,548
but let me settle down

26
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:13,468
Taiyang first.

27
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,788
Actually, Zhao Mingxuan helped you

28
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,468
because he wanted to grab hold
of your weakness

29
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:25,908
for his benefits.

30
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,108
The favor he gave you

31
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,108
would just be installment.

32
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:32,548
You should know

33
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,188
his personality by now.

34
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,108
I can forgive you this time.

35
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:40,908
Everyone in Jifeng

36
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:42,548
relies on you as a big brother.

37
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:44,508
Mr. Lin,

38
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:46,948
please

39
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,708
think twice next time
before you do anything.

40
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:52,348
Go now.

41
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:16,708
(Hello, everyone.)

42
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,668
(This is Wusu's traffic broadcasting,)

43
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,668
(FM78.8, Dajiabang For Everyone.)

44
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:23,988
A while ago,

45
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:25,388
Jifeng Hotel was exposed

46
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,708
on the Internet
for their hygiene issue.

47
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:27,828
There's an update to this.

48
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,188
After investigation,

49
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:30,468
it's proven that

50
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:32,108
the one who snuck into
Jifeng's kitchen

51
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:33,868
was their former chef, Hu.

52
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:34,868
He admitted that

53
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:36,908
he made a fake video

54
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:38,468
because he's not satisfied
of being fired

55
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:40,108
and he avenged himself by doing so.

56
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,268
He's now under

57
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,308
police's investigation.

58
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:43,748
And the related unit

59
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:44,588
has investigated and stated that

60
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,788
Jifeng's restaurant's hygiene

61
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:48,148
met the requirements.

62
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:48,788
But of course,

63
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,868
letting someone malicious
in to the kitchen

64
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:51,668
has exposed that

65
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:52,628
there's a loophole in their management.

66
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:53,588
Therefore,

67
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:54,588
they've launched

68
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:55,628
a series of actions,

69
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:58,028
like hiring a third party

70
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:58,708
to monitor them,

71
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:00,348
setting an open day every month

72
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:01,668
to let the guests visit them,

73
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,268
and doing a livestream in the kitchen.

74
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,228
This is Jifeng's operation

75
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,748
after the settlement.

76
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:09,428
Although

77
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:10,828
what happened was not delightful,

78
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,148
the attention to us

79
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:13,268
has increased.

80
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:14,628
(Jifeng)

81
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:15,908
(Brand Development)
(is not looking for perfection,)

82
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:17,668
(but an accurate position.)

83
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:18,548
(We're focusing on our strength
and avoiding our weakness.)

84
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:19,588
(The future is secured.)

85
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:21,948
Mingxuan,

86
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,028
we collaborate

87
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:24,987
mainly on operating

88
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,028
five-star chain hotels,

89
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,948
but Jifeng is

90
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:31,468
a special case.

91
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,148
You can let us handle

92
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:35,708
the hotels with specialty

93
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:37,588
that you have.

94
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:40,948
Mr. Xiao,

95
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,068
you don't have many people

96
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:44,028
in Yunlan.

97
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:45,348
Can they handle that?

98
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:48,628
I'm old

99
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,468
and I can't handle it.

100
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:51,708
But Qi said that

101
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:54,148
(Brand Development)
(Jifeng's operation mode)

102
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,188
(is digitalized.)

103
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:59,748
(It can save the cost on the manpower.)

104
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:01,228
(It's a leverage.)

105
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:11,348
Let me think about it.

106
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:24,748
Mr. Xiao.

107
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:27,028
Your coffee.

108
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:27,708
Thank you.

109
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,948
Mr. Xiao, you're in a good mood.

110
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,068
Well,

111
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:35,508
tell Mr. Lin

112
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:37,028
to pay more attention to Jifeng

113
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:38,268
these few days.

114
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:39,588
I have something else to do.

115
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,228
Okay.

116
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:41,268
Do you need my help

117
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,148
with some important things?

118
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:46,668
I'm moving.

119
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:02,748
You're here.

120
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:09,908
Done keeping the things?

121
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:19,588
All ready?

122
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,348
It's an auspicious day.

123
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,508
Today is good for moving in
to a new house.

124
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:24,508
Let's go.

125
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:45,628
(From today onwards,)

126
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,468
(Xiao Shangqi and I)

127
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,268
(will have a home in Wusu.)

128
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:50,908
(We'll have the life)

129
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,468
(where both of us are staying together,)

130
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:53,828
(eating three meals a day
in four seasons.)

131
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,588
(We are walking in and out)

132
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,628
(with same hands and legs.)

133
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:00,268
(I can hug him)

134
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:01,708
(when I turn around.)

135
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,388
(Be it sunny or rainy,)

136
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,628
(the house is full of
the temperature of two.)

137
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,588
(This kind of life)

138
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,868
(is where you'll smile)

139
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,148
(waking up in the middle of the night.)

140
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:38,148
What?

141
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:39,508
Nothing.

142
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:46,908
Have a seat.

143
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:51,708
Come on.

144
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:14,548
Xiaoran,

145
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:17,108
welcome home.

146
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:35,548
Come in.

147
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,108
How's the housekeeping coming along?

148
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:40,988
Almost done.

149
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,868
Why the clothes are all rolled up?

150
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,548
Rolling it up saves space.

151
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,028
It's said that
girls have a lot of stuff.

152
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,628
How come you only
have a suitcase with you?

153
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:53,948
I was renting a house.

154
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:54,788
Who knows if I'd

155
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:55,748
move out very soon?

156
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,988
Then I can move out as I please.

157
00:08:58,188 --> 00:08:59,148
Everything extra is the burden.

158
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:07,628
Xiaoran,

159
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:09,908
from today onwards,

160
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,468
you don't have to worry about anything.

161
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,148
Just choose your favorite.

162
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:15,948

all the parcels to the radio station?

251

Bye.

260
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:35,828
Why didn't you tell them

261
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,108
you're in a relationship with me?

262

when I first came to Wusu,

264
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:46,868
they weren't supporting me.

265
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,748
I came here without their permission.

266
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:50,068
Although they didn't know

267
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,588
what happened to us,

268
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:52,628
they knew

269
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:53,628
we had stopped talking to each other.

270
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,668
I think I need to explain

271
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,268
to them in person

272
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:58,668
so that they can accept it.

273
00:12:59,308 --> 00:12:59,988
No wonder

274
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:01,588
when I went to your place,

275
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:02,788
they were very cool

276
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:03,468
to me

277
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,948
and asked me not to contact you anymore.

278
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,708

348
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:56,828
A news journalist

349
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:57,828
has to turn on

350
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:59,108
the phone 24 hours a day.

351
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:00,308
You need to be ready.

352
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,268
I need to ask Mr. He first.

353
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:05,188
He's agreed.

354
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,626
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

355
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,028
It's given to me by my father!

356
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:11,908
I can't give it to you!

357
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:15,108
I want it!

358
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:15,788
Dear, what's going on?

359
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:18,628
It's just a book.

360
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:19,268
I'll buy it for you.

361
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:19,868
Return it to him.

362
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:24,788
How can you hit others?

363
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,308
Whose uncivilized child is this?

364
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:28,828
This is your son?

365
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:30,028
What's wrong?

366
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,268
He's my son.

367
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:35,108
You saw it.

368
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,668
Your son hit my son.

369
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,028
Apologize to us.

370
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:38,948
Madam,

371
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,468
who should actually apologize?

372
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:41,668
If you want to know,

373
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,988
let's find a place to talk.

374
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,188
What's going on?

375
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:45,548
Are you his boss?

376
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:46,988
Your staff

377
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,148
allowed his child to hit others.

378
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:49,668
Are you going to do something?

379
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:50,708
Hello.

380
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,508
It's common that children
have some conflicts.

381
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:53,468
If the adults leave it as it is,

382
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:54,628
it's the adults' responsibility.

383
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:56,148
Well,

384
00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:57,988
do you need me to call the police?

385
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:58,988
We'll check the CCTV

386
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,948
to see who started the fight

387
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:02,268
and check whose fault is this.

388
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:09,228
You're bullying us.

389
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,028
What kind of hotel is this?

390
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:10,828
Dear, let's go.

391
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:13,628
Let's go.

392
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,548
Are you okay, Taiyang?

393
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:22,948
He's okay.

394
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:25,788
Take him to rest.

395
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:47,068
What's wrong?

396
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:48,628
Not in a good mood?

397
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,548
Is it because

398
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:52,148
I'm not by my mother's side

399
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:54,788
that mother's being laughed at, too?

400
00:19:58,828 --> 00:19:59,988
Are you missing your mother?

401
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:15,788
She's just taking a different road

402
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:17,188
from us,

403
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:19,948
but it's also a road to happiness.

404
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,188
News channel?

405
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,668
I didn't expect that
the missing person livestream

406
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,668
and scotching rumors for Jifeng

407
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:49,348
could bring me this opportunity.

408
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:52,188
However,

409
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,028
Dajiabang has just started to
show improvement.

410
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:55,508
I'm reluctant

411
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:56,788
to leave now.

412
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,068
Silly girl.

413
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:00,868
Like what you said,

414
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,228
you're just few levels apart.

415
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,028
You can meet

416
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,188
whenever you want to meet.

417
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:07,988
Keep it up, Journalist He.

418
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:10,828
It's nice to hear it.

419
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:12,108
Well,

420
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:13,348
they wanted to come

421
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:14,348
for housewarming.

422
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:15,468
I want

423
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:16,988
to gather everyone there

424
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:17,708
for a meal.

425
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:18,388
What do you think?

426
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:20,388
Sure.

427
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,708
My girlfriend has the say.

428
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:37,588
Xiaoran.

429
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:41,228
What is this?

430
00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:42,708
Come on.

431
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,068
Slow down.

432
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:43,788
Be careful.

433
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:45,948
So huge?

434
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:48,868
A housewarming gift.

435
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:50,708
I told you to buy something small.

436
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,508
It's so huge. So tiring.

437
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,388
Mr. Xiao gave us

438
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,748
a big jar of pickles.

439
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,148
It's huge, too.

440
00:21:58,508 --> 00:21:59,228
It's my turn now.

441
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:00,908
I have to make it huge, too.

442
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:02,188
It's sufficient.

443
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:03,668
So much green.

444
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:04,268
Others might think

445
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:05,188
you're trying to say something else.

446
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:07,788
Why didn't you tell me earlier
about this great idea?

447
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:08,628
I could've prepared more.

448
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:09,988
Enough talking.

449
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,068
Didn't you two buy

450
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:11,868
some new furniture?

451
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,508
He bought one that can
get rid of formaldehyde

452
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,508
from the florist owner.

453
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:16,748
It's such a big tree.

454
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:18,148
So tiring.

455
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:18,908
Thank you.

456
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:20,628
Most welcome.

457
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,308
You decorated this place

458
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,148
like a newly-wed's place.

459
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:28,708
Xiaoran,

460
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:29,428
we're here.

461
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:29,908
We're here.

462
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:30,548
Mr. He.

463
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,508
Congratulations.

464
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:32,148
Thank you.

465
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:32,868
Congratulations.

466
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:33,988
Everyone is here.

467
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:34,788
Change to slippers

468
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:35,588
and let's eat.

469
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:36,348
Thank you.

470
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,588
Come on.

471
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:37,828
Change to slippers.

472
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:38,228
Follow me.

473
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,468
Come in.

474
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,108
Congratulations on moving in
to a new house.

475
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:43,868
Thank you.

476
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,788
Xiaoran, congratulations on being
recruited to the news broadcasting.

477
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:47,028
Mr. Xiao.

478
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:48,028
Mr. Xiao.

479
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:49,468
Did you know that

480
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:51,308
Dajiabang has a nickname?

481
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,468
It's called radio station recycle bin.

482
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,828
We keep people that others don't want.

483
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:58,468
Li Hui is

484
00:22:58,908 --> 00:22:59,988
fierce and ferocious.

485
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:01,708
She argued with others three times

486
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:02,988
in the music channel.

487
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,548
And she fought with them in the end.

488
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:06,548
Sui Mingwei.

489
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,068
The tyrant of radio station.

490
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:09,748
A walking arguing machine.

491
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:11,108
He will do anything

492
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,268
that's absurd.

493
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:15,908
I came here on my own will.

494
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:17,108
Sui helped me before.

495
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:18,548
Good boy.

496
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:19,788
You're honest.

497
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,148
Our Grim Reaper,

498
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,068
Xiaoran,

499
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:26,508
has finally graduated

500
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:28,508
from Dajiabang.

501
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,668
I haven't had the sense of achievement

502
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:34,468
for so long.

503
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,068
Mr. He.

504
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,708
Why are you being sad?

505
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:39,548
I'm not sad.

506
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:40,108
I used to think that

507
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:41,828
since Dajiabang's going to end,

508
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:43,468
I'll retire in honor and glory.

509
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:44,908
I didn't expect

510
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,548
to have hustled again with you.

511
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,308
Hustle?

512
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,148
You tortured us before.

513
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:52,788
I remember

514
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,148
when I first came,

515
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:55,388
you asked me to

516
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,668
look for the gossip every day.

517
00:23:57,988 --> 00:23:58,628
Also, to fight for

518
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:00,108
the listenership,

519
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:01,188
the few of us

520
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:02,068
had to stay

521
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:03,188
in the cheap forum every day.

522
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:03,868
Whenever it comes to
discussing the topics,

523
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,708
we'd go lower than others.

524
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:08,948
Remember

525
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,668
how we changed our voices for

526
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:11,348
the recording?

527
00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:12,988
Yes.

528
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:13,988
That's nightmare.

529
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:17,788
But honestly,

530
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:19,548
Dajiabang was revived

531
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,308
because of

532
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:21,868
Mr. Xiao's phone call.

533
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:22,828
No.

534
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:24,148
Yes.

535
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:28,308
Mr. Xiao.

536
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:31,028
I, He,

537
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:32,708
toast to you.

538
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:34,988
Don't say that.

539
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:42,628
Thank you.

540
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:44,308
Have a seat.

541
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:44,868
Have a seat.

542
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:45,828
Pour the wine.

543
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:46,908
Yes.

544
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:47,948
You two from Hupu

545
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:49,468
have made this house
a newly-wed's place.

546
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:51,028
Are you planning

547
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:51,748
to settle down in Wusu?

548
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:53,108
I know

549
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:54,628
Hupu's aura must be

550
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:55,828
different from yours.

551
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:56,588
Otherwise,

552
00:24:56,908 --> 00:24:57,628
why did you only get together

553
00:24:57,828 --> 00:24:58,548
after so long?

554
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:07,988
We like Wusu.

555
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:10,068
What's wrong settling down here?

556
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:11,668
We want to stay here

557
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:12,668
forever.

558
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:14,028
By then, we'll receive

559
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,348
our pension together.

560
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:18,188
Pension?

561
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,548
You should look for Zhou Lili
for pension.

562
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:22,988
You can't get a dime from me.

563
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,588
Can't you share half of yours with me?

564
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:25,108
Stingy.

565
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:25,828
Come on.

566
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:26,348
Let's drink.

567
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:27,188
Let's drink.

568
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:28,028
Let's drink, Mr. Xiao.

569
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:28,428
Come on.

570
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:30,148
Congratulations once again.

571
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:31,068
Thank you.

572
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:31,948
Congratulations.

573
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:32,588
Thank you.

574
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:33,268
Come on.

575
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:36,988
It's cooked. Let's eat.

576
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:37,708
Come on.

577
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:39,308
Stop talking.

578
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:43,708
Mr. He, slow down.

579
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,388
Let's drink.

580
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:44,908
Slow down.

581
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:45,948
Let me do it.

582
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:46,508
Let's drink.

583
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:46,868
We're leaving.

584
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:47,388
Okay.

585
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:48,828
Thank you.

586
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:49,508
Till here.

587
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:49,988
We're leaving.

588
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:50,988
Take care.

589
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:51,668
Bye.

590
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,068
Bye.

591
00:25:57,948 --> 00:25:58,748
Go in.

592
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:02,068
You drank too much today.

593
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:03,628
I'm happy.

594
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:06,508
Slow down.

595
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:13,148
Not bad.

596
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,908
When we were chatting,

597
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:20,308
it reminded me of

598
00:26:21,228 --> 00:26:23,188
the days when I first came to Wusu.

599
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:25,948
I was lost.

600
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:30,068
But, after I met you again,

601
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:31,428
I feel like

602
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:34,148
good things keep happening.

603
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:35,988
It motivates me.

604
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,548
Xiao Shangqi,

605
00:26:40,188 --> 00:26:42,348
I really like Wusu.

606
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,588
Although this place is not

607
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,948
as prosperous as Hupu,

608
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,548
it has the fun of a small city.

609
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,028
The distance among the people

610
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,428
is not that far.

611
00:26:56,388 --> 00:26:57,388
For example,

612
00:26:57,988 --> 00:26:59,188
when you buy something

613
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,668
more than five times,

614
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:03,628
the seller recognizes you.

615
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:06,588
If you have no coins for

616
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:08,228
taking a bus,

617
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,108
someone will pay for you.

618
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:15,388
Although I came here

619
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:16,068
by mistake,

620
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,868
I really like this place.

621
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,908
I want to stay here.

622
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:25,908
Let's stay here,

623
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:26,628
okay?

624
00:27:29,908 --> 00:27:30,308
Okay.

625
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:15,908
I still think something
is wrong with them.

626
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:19,108
I think something is wrong with you.

627
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:21,468
They're staying together

628
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:22,748
and you're being ridiculous.

629
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:24,428
Didn't you notice?

630
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:26,548
When we mentioned Hupu,

631
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,628
they were acting strange.

632
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:29,068
Especially Xiao Shangqi.

633
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:30,348
Look.

634
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:31,268
His family is

635
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:32,228
running hotels.

636
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:33,708
Their base is in Hupu.

637
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:35,228
He's not staying in Hupu.

638
00:28:35,268 --> 00:28:36,388
Why did he come and hide here?

639
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:38,908
The plant was RMB 360, right?

640
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:41,428
Let's split the bill.
I'll transfer it to you.

641
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:43,028
RMB 180.

642
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:45,468
I'm talking about relationship.

643
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:46,668
How could you keep talking

644
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:47,788
about money?

645
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:49,628
You're being ridiculous

646
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,308
because

647
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:52,028
you're not troubled by money.

648
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:53,828
I've transferred the money to you.

649
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:02,588
Father.

650
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:04,668
You're still up.

651
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:08,668
What do you think about

652
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:09,588
what happened in Jifeng's restaurant?

653
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:12,748
Business competition.

654
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,108
It's just the matter of time
for being framed or jeopardized.

655
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,148
Lately, you and Zhao Mingxuan

656
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:19,188
are not fighting that much.

657
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:24,268
No.

658
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:26,508
It's not.

659
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:30,668
Now,

660
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:32,948
it's bad

661
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:33,988
if the outsiders say

662
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:34,748
you brothers are not on good term.

663
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:37,548
Xian.

664
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:40,068
I don't expect you're going to be

665
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:41,148
close to your brother.

666
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:43,988
But who is our family
and who is not,

667
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:44,708
you should know that.

668
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:48,988
Father,

669
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,468
I understand.

670
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:53,708
But you saw how

671
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:55,868
Qi is being too high profile.

672
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:57,948
He doesn't listen to
the headquarters' opinion.

673
00:29:59,308 --> 00:29:59,668
Yes.

674
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,148
We survived the crisis this time,

675
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:02,988
but his

676
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:04,108
wayward action

677
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:06,868
is about to get him in trouble.

678
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:17,348
What do you think?

679
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,708
I want to go to Wusu

680
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:22,548
and learn about

681
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:24,108
the situation.

682
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:25,948
Jifeng has

683
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:27,068
no employee turnover.

684
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:28,468
This is too dangerous.

685
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:30,468
Zhao Mingxuan has
been managing Jifeng

686
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,068
for many years.

687
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:31,988
I don't believe that

688
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:33,148
none of his people is there.

689
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:34,868
What do you think?

690
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:42,388
(Regarding Yunduan Hotel's opening,)

691
00:30:42,948 --> 00:30:43,628
(I hope Qi)

692
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:44,548
(can come back as soon
as possible to help.)

693
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:45,308
It's Zhao Mingxuan.

694
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:53,868
Mr. Xiao.

695
00:30:54,628 --> 00:30:55,108
This is bad.

696
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:56,708
Someone forced his way into your office.

697
00:30:56,948 --> 00:30:57,308
He...

698
00:30:57,628 --> 00:30:58,388
He...

699
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:13,108
What a rare guest.

700
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:14,628
What's the matter?

701
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:15,668
Why are you here?

702
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,468
Jifeng was taken over

703
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,068
from Deju.

704
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,108
Since you want to hold it for long,

705
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:23,908
shouldn't you

706
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:25,108
check the employees?

707
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:28,588
How would you know that I didn't check?

708
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:30,228
I've found out

709
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:31,028
about the restaurant.

710
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:33,628
Lin Zong

711
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:34,988
used to be Zhao Mingxuan's

712
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:36,148
staff.

713
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,188
Why didn't you fire him?

714
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:40,948
Xian,

715
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:42,548
did something

716
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:43,908
go wrong in Hupu?

717
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:45,148
Why did you

718
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:46,348
come and interfere with my matter?

719
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,548
Even if the matter is trivial
and far away,

720
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:51,268
it's not yours.

721
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:52,468
Father and I

722
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:53,708
allowed you to do something,

723
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:54,788
but it doesn't mean

724
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:56,028
you can run away from Yunlan.

725
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:58,028
So, as

726
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,388
the executive president
of the headquarters,

727
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:01,988
I'd like to fire someone.

728
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,148
Will you say no to that?

729
00:32:04,828 --> 00:32:05,788
Firing Lin Zong

730
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,508
to tell the whole company

731
00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:11,068
that Jifeng and I have to listen to you?

732
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:11,708
No,

733
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,188
not listening to me,

734
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:14,708
it's for the sake of Yunlan.

735
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:15,868
Qi, I admit that

736
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:17,428
you're managing Jifeng

737
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:17,988
well,

738
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:19,108
but you have to know

739
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:20,348
you'll one day leave this place and

740
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:21,308
come back to Hupu.

741
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:23,348
That's your home battlefield.

742
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:25,108
No worries.

743
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,308
I'll stay here for a few days

744
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:30,268
and help you manage
the staffing structure.

745
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:33,268
After all, if the problem
in Jifeng is not solved,

746
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,468
Hupu's side will not be at ease.

747
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:52,508
Okay, go back to work.

748
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:56,588
Miss Zhou.

749
00:32:58,148 --> 00:32:58,908
Xiaoran, you're here.

750
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:01,388
Let's stop your work for a while.

751
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:02,708
Let me introduce.

752
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:04,108
She's the new colleague

753
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,548
in Team A, He Xiaoran.

754
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:06,708
Let's welcome her.

755
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:07,708
Hello.

756
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:09,108
Hello.

757
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,228
The working pace is rather fast here.

758
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,708
Everyone is direct and straightforward.

759
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:14,668
Just get used to it.

760
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:15,828
Well,

761
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,428
what do you think about this script?

762
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,228
I can tell

763
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:26,268
migrant workers and normal workers'

764
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:27,548
difficulties on settling down

765
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:28,468
the young children.

766
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:29,948
But?

767
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:32,268
Shouldn't we

768
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:33,748
go deep from the perspective
of the kindergartens

769
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:34,788
that accommodate the children

770
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,028
and see how they operate

771
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:37,308
in details?

772
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:39,068
Okay.

773
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:39,668
This is your

774
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:40,708
first interview.

775
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:41,308
Go back to work.

776
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:42,388
That's your seat.

777
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:43,908
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

778
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:45,468
Don't call me Miss Zhou.

779
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:46,628
Just call me Lili.

780
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,108
- Keep it up.
- Lili.

781
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,980
(Migrant child placement)

782
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,708
Our care for those unsettled children

783
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:08,588
is non-profit,

784
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:09,668
but the government

785
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:10,588
is giving us

786
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:11,548
certain subsidy.

787
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:12,748
We have a lot of

788
00:34:12,988 --> 00:34:13,708
personalized nurseries,

789
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:14,948
mainly to help

790
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:16,227
the parents with special needs

791
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:17,267
to ease their burden

792
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:18,508
on taking care of the children.

793
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,187
What are they doing there?

794
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:24,187
That's an award ceremony of

795
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:25,667
the children from the middle class

796
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:26,988
participating in
the municipal painting competition.

797
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,508
The theme was "My Home".

798
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:33,468
Your performance is great.

799
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:34,548
Come and put on the medal.

800
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:35,667
Okay.

801
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,308
Certificate.

802
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:38,548
Hold it well.

803
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:40,628
My father said

804
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,948
all the happiness

805
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,828
comes out

806
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:44,988
from my mother's love.

807
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:46,388
That's all my painting is about.

808
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,028
Okay, go down.

809
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,468
This kid

810
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:52,348
is from the rabbit class.

811
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,187
This class is one of the many

812
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:54,988
personalized classes

813
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,068
we have.

814
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:57,628
All the parents of the children

815
00:34:57,868 --> 00:34:58,747
in this class are basically

816
00:34:58,948 --> 00:34:59,908
working on weekends.

817
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,588
Most of them are working on shifts

818
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:02,428
or on holidays.

819
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:03,028
So,

820
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:03,548
they can come

821
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:04,308
on weekends.

822
00:35:04,908 --> 00:35:05,628
This is a teaching building

823
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:06,228
in our school.

824
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:08,148
Here's where the children have fun.

825
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:09,028
Hold this.

826
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:12,668
Why not you

827
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:13,548
take a look around?

828
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:14,428
Wait for me.

829
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:20,388
Miss,

830
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:22,148
what are you doing here?

831
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:29,708
Miss Wang,

832
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:31,348
that weird person

833
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,548
is looking for Taiyang,

834
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:33,388
but she can't tell

835
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:34,188
what their relationship is.

836
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:34,788
Where is she?

837
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,226
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

838
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:39,948
What does it mean by

839
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:42,068
bearing the consequences for
not telling the truth?

840
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:43,788
It's so scary.

841
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:44,988
We need to write down
our working experiences

842
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:45,988
for which date and which month.

843
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,788
Our industry is not stable.

844
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:48,348
Also,

845
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:49,228
we've been working so long

846
00:35:49,468 --> 00:35:50,068
in Jifeng.

847
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,468
Who can remember everything?

848
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,028
Yes.

849
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:52,468
What's going on?

850
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:54,268
Don't mention it.

851
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:55,988
Yesterday, someone from
the headquarters was here.

852
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:57,708
He's more difficult than Mr. Xiao.

853
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:58,868
He wants to do a background check

854
00:35:59,108 --> 00:35:59,908
on all the staff.

855
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:05,748
You're all resting here.

856
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:08,388
Let's go.

857
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:12,828
Mr. Xiao,

858
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:14,148
look at you.

859
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:15,628
Who is here?

860
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:17,988
My elder brother.

861
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:19,308
Your elder brother is here?

862
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:20,828
Why are you here?

863
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:23,628
I went for an interview

864
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:25,228
in Taiyang's kindergarten,

865
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:26,668
but I met a woman

866
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,388
who was asking for Taiyang.

867
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:29,908
I felt that it's strange

868
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,188
so I wanted to tell Mr. Lin.

869
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:32,468
But, he came back,

870
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:33,748
so I...

871
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:37,348
Who was the woman

872
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:38,228
that you met?

873
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:43,548
She

874
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,388
could be Taiyang's mother?

875
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:47,228
I thought...

876
00:36:51,148 --> 00:36:52,468
She left a long letter behind

877
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,668
and left decisively,

878
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:55,508
so I didn't look for her.

879
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:59,268
She had someone that she loved,

880
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:02,068
but their relationship
was not consistent.

881
00:37:02,748 --> 00:37:03,588
And I

882
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,708
was waiting for her for four years

883
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:09,188
faithfully.

884
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:11,708
She finally turned around and saw me,

885
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:13,788
then we had Taiyang.

886
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,308
However,

887
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,108
on Taiyang's 100-day celebration,

888
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:19,948
she went missing suddenly.

889
00:37:24,388 --> 00:37:25,028
Where did she go?

890
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:27,268
She went and looked for
the man she loved.

891
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:29,068
She said she'd leave

892
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:30,708
the mistake to me in the letter.

893
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:32,428
But back then,

894
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:33,468
I was looking at the young Taiyang,

895
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:35,228
and I was thinking to myself,

896
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:36,828
how could

897
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:37,988
someone call a cute baby

898
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:39,628
a mistake?

899
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:42,988
He's obviously a gift.

900
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:46,868
How did she find out that

901
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:47,868
you're here?

902
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,308
When we were separated,

903
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:51,508
I sent her a message that

904
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:54,068
I've brought Taiyang here.

905
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:56,708
There are only a few kindergartens
around here.

906
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:03,868
But she was there suddenly.

907
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:04,908
She regrets it?

908
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:05,908
She wants to bring Taiyang away?

909
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:08,548
I don't know.

910
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:11,308
But, she will probably come again.

911
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:13,348
What are you planning to do?

912
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:14,428
Taiyang's matter

913
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:15,428
is our matter.

914
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:16,748
No matter what you plan to do,

915
00:38:16,988 --> 00:38:18,028
we'll support you.

916
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:20,308
I think

917
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:21,868
Taiyang has the right

918
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:22,468
to meet his mother.

919
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:23,828
If she really wants

920
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:24,748
to look for Taiyang,

921
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:26,548
Taiyang has his right to choose.

922
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:29,468
I'll respect Taiyang's decision.

923
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:32,228
Well, Mr. Xiao,

924
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,148
I understand why your brother is doing

925
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:35,108
the background check.

926
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,028
If it's possible,

927
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:38,068
can you extend

928
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:38,948
the last day for me?

929
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:41,748
Maybe she'll come to the kindergarten

930
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:43,308
or Jifeng for me.

931
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,988
Are you saying that
the restaurant's issue

932
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:01,108
is related to Lin Zong?

933
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,268
Actually, Lin Zong

934
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:06,828
takes relationship seriously.

935
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:09,468
Regarding that matter,

936
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:11,108
I understand his situation.

937
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:12,468
I don't want to put him in
a tough situation.

938
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,708
Then talk nicely to your brother.

939
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:19,068
I wanted to just

940
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,228
go along with Xiao Xian.

941
00:39:20,948 --> 00:39:21,708
He's here trying to

942
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,308
take over the authority.

943
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:24,588
As for Lin Zong,

944
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:25,308
I...

945
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:27,708
Jifeng is Lin Zong and Taiyang's home.

946
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:28,948
Today, when I went to interview

947
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:30,308
Taiyang's kindergarten,

948
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:31,788
I saw Taiyang's painting.

949
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:33,828
The home that he painted is Jifeng.

950
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:41,188
Look.

951
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:46,508
Last time when the light was down,

952
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:47,388
we all called Jifeng

953
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:48,788
ZiX Hotel.

954
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:58,788
No matter how you choose,

955
00:39:59,068 --> 00:39:59,628
Taiyang's matter

956
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:00,548
is my matter.

957
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:04,788
Let me think about it.

958
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:48,148
Xiaoran.

959
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:49,708
I'm coming in.

960
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:53,748
Xiaoran.

961
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:03,548
Here.

962
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:04,428
Look.

963
00:41:04,668 --> 00:41:05,548
What's this?

964
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:06,588
David.

965
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:07,148
David.

966
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:08,508
What about this?

967
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:10,668
I don't know.

968
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:11,428
You don't know?

969
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:12,468
What's this?

970
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:13,188
Spider.

971
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:13,828
Spider.

972
00:41:18,028 --> 00:41:19,388
You're the journalist, He, right?

973
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:20,268
Anything I can help you?

974
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:21,628
Nothing.

975
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:22,628
I'm just looking around.

976
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:23,628
You don't have to bother about me.

977
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:24,748
Call me if you need anything.

978
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:25,268
Sure.

979
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,468
I've talked to the human resources.

980
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,228
According to the termination procedure,

981
00:41:39,468 --> 00:41:40,388
we need to talk to Lin Zong in person.

982
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:42,508
Will you do it or I'll do it?

983
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,028
I'll do it.

984
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:46,828
But, Yunlan

985
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:48,148
has a few reasons to

986
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:48,748
terminate a staff.

987
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,388
Violation of employee regulations,

988
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:51,708
serious mistake,

989
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:52,788
and affecting the team.

990
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,668
Which one do we use to
terminate Lin Zong?

991
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,508
Was the restaurant incident
not impactful enough?

992
00:41:58,708 --> 00:41:59,548
Where's the evidence?

993
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:05,388
Xian,

994
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:08,388
it's easy to fire a staff,

995
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,068
but we can't break the rules.

996
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:11,108
Otherwise, there are many people

997
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:11,988
working here,

998
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:13,588
how can I manage them?

999
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:18,828
I don't know if you

1000
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:20,108
really want to keep him

1001
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:22,308
or you simply don't want
to listen to me.

1002
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:25,468
But, it's okay.

1003
00:42:25,948 --> 00:42:27,228
It's not hard to find one's

1004
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:28,508
mistake.

1005
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:43,308
Cake.

1006
00:42:43,348 --> 00:42:43,828
Here.

1007
00:42:43,948 --> 00:42:44,308
Thank you.

1008
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:45,388
It's yours.

1009
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:46,348
Thank you.

1010
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:47,148
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

1011
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:49,708
Here. Hurry.

1012
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:50,628
It's tasty.

1013
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:51,508
It's tasty.

1014
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,748
Anyone has no fork?

1015
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:54,388
Everyone has it.

1016
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:55,588
You don't have it?

1017
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:57,308
I'm eating this.

1018
00:43:00,588 --> 00:43:00,828
Is it tasty?

1019
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:01,628
It's tasty.

1020
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:02,668
The cake is tasty.

1021
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:05,868
Mr. Xiao Xian.

1022
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:08,108
This is...

1023
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:10,028
All the rooms are booked today.

1024
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:10,948
I brought

1025
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:11,868
the colleagues from
the housekeeping department

1026
00:43:11,948 --> 00:43:12,548
for a celebration here

1027
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:13,588
to reward everyone.

1028
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:15,908
You bought a cake today.

1029
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:17,508
Will you be giving out money tomorrow?
