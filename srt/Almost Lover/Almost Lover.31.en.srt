This is not working.

18
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:41,947
I wonder when we can

19
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:43,067
find any clue.

20
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:48,267
Xiaoran.

21
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:51,427
Thank you for helping me

22
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:52,787
and keeping me company.

23
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:53,907
I'm not.

24
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,507
I've been meaning to tell you

25
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,267
I did all these

26
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:01,267
because

27
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:02,227
I want the wicked Zhao Mingxuan

28
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,267
to be arrested,

29
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:04,387
and that's all.

30
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:14,627
What do you plan to do next?

31
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:16,907
Let me send you home first.

32
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,187
She has become senile

33
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,627
after going in to the nursing home,

34
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:23,867
but

35
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:26,187
Xiao Shangqi is approaching her.

36
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,467
She's senile.

37
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:32,747
What do we do next?

38
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:36,467
Using her to distract Xiao Shangqi

39
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,947
is not a bad idea.

40
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,107
Clean things up

41
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:43,827
and monitor closely.

42
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:47,547
Chen Fei'er has gone back to Jifeng.

43
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:52,107
My little brother

44
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,987
loves to collect rubbish.

45
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,387
I need to go back to Hupu.

46
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:04,107
I guess I need to

47
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,587
give it all there.

48
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:08,707
The car is ready.

49
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:11,507
I'm counting Jifeng on you.

50
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:12,867
Don't worry.

51
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,227
I'll go back to the station first.

52
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:20,147
I can't help much

53
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,587
with the things after this.

54
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,547
Can you wait for me to come back?

55
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,907
I don't want to

56
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:44,147
wait for anyone anymore.

57
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:47,707
All the best.

58
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:25,187
Xiaoran.

59
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:27,267
Anything?

60
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,227
Please take your compensatory leave

61
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:30,227
as soon as possible.

62
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:31,467
Otherwise, it's going to expire.

63
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,347
I'm not taking it.

64
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,027
Why?

65
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,187
We have enough manpower

66
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:37,107
and there's not much work lately.

67
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,987
Hand over the jobs to Sun.

68
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:39,947
No.

69
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,387
What should I do if I'm not working?

70
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:42,907
What should you do?

71
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:43,867
You can do anything.

72
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:44,827
Go and have fun.

73
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:46,827
Otherwise, just sleep on your bed.

74
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,347
Why not you give me your leave?

75
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:53,907
Look at you.

76
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,267
Take a good rest.

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:59,000
(Hupu Yunlan Management Company)

78
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,067
What are you doing here?

79
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,667
I'm here to show you concern.

80
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,107
Now, Yunlan has got nothing left.

81
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:33,627
You've been gathering funds lately.

82
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,227
You have even sold the building.

83
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:37,187
But you only managed to pay half

84
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:38,107
of the compensation.

85
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,587
Do you know what happened to Wei?

86
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,627
I heard that he molested
his female subordinate

87
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:45,587
and was reported.

88
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:47,987
Now, he's divorced
and his kids have left him.

89
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,587
I think what happened to him

90
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:53,507
should be

91
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,187
caused by you all.

92
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:57,307
It's all done by you,

93
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,147
right?

94
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,627
Actually, everything now

95
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:04,387
is just the beginning.

96
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:06,827
Stop hanging in there.

97
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:10,307
You should just settle the account

98
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,067
and declare bankruptcy.

99
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:15,307
Are you afraid that your father

100
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:18,267
will not rest in peace

101
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,387
seeing how his company

102
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,107
is ruined by you?

103
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,187
I think he didn't

104
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:29,347
really die in peace.

105
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:30,467
Zhao Mingxuan.

106
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:32,107
Don't worry.

107
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,587
You can't be laughing for too long.

108
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:37,747
Why?

109
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,307
Because of you

110
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,507
or

111
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,187
Yunlan that has nothing left?

112
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,187
I was free two days back,

113
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,267
so I went to visit your father.

114
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:52,787
You brothers

115
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:53,827
have not been visiting him

116
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,267
for a while, right?

117
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,147
I've told him

118
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:59,187
about how pathetic you are

119
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:00,707
and I've burned your IOU

120
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,307
for him to see.

121
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,147
You're terrible!

122
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:21,907
I got it.

123
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:23,507
Well done.

124
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:29,587
What?

125
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:30,947
Why are you smiling?

126
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:33,747
Do you remember Jia Wen?

127
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,146
Our CFO.

128
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:37,786
So unlucky.

129
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,227
He met a car accident

130
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,666
and died at a young age.

131
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,267
But Qi,

132
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:45,507
I want you to know that

133
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:47,347
even if you dig his grave out,

134
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:48,947
he's just an unlucky man.

135
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,307
You won't be able to find anything.

136
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,947
You didn't find anything

137
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,347
and you went back to Hupu.

138
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:58,427
Have you thought about

139
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:00,547
if I was one step earlier than you?

140
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:10,667
Wen has left important
information behind

141
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:12,227
before he died.

142
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:14,707
Investigating the case using the clue

143
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,667
has indeed spent a lot of my time.

144
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,067
Luckily,

145
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,667
it's not too late.

146
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:45,467
What's going on?

147
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:47,187
No, what's wrong?

148
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:48,067
No.

149
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:49,267
You can't park your car here.

150
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,267
It's dangerous.

151
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:50,987
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:51,907
I have something urgent.

153
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:53,027
Can you get a designated driver?

154
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:54,987
Where can I find
a designated driver now?

155
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:02,507
Where's my mobile phone?

156
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:07,707
It's been handled.

157
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:10,227
Make it clean.

158
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:11,987
Don't leave anything behind.

159
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:23,787
You're very careful.

160
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:27,027
The accident happened at
a newly repaired road.

161
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:27,987
There was no surveillance camera.

162
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,867
But, you didn't expect that

163
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:31,387
it's been recorded by the dashcam

164
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:32,947
of the truck passing by.

165
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,707
Li.

166
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,187
The person in the footage...

167
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:38,827
How can it be?

168
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,027
It's been a while...

169
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,067
This is a commercial truck.

170
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,387
According to their company rules,

171
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,067
all the dashcam footage

172
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,067
has to be uploaded

173
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,627
to the cloud as a copy.

174
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:50,827
You don't say.

175
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,267
It's recorded in high definition

176
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,147
so it's really clear.

177
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:06,187
Are you thinking that

178
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,547
this has legal effect?

179
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,067
No?

180
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,067
What about this?

181
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,987
What do you plan to do next?

182
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:26,747
Let me send you home first.

183
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:36,987
Let me do this.

184
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,787
It must be stuck.

185
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:48,747
Wait here.

186
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:49,827
Let me check for you.

187
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:02,267
(Jia Wen might have expected)

188
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,067
(his ending.)

189
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:04,987
(So, he tried his best)

190
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:06,547
(to make a copy of the information)

191
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:07,467
(that he handled.)

192
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:09,307
(We'll just buy)

193
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,067
(the most expensive ones.)

194
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:12,267
(We'll buy)

195
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,667
(the things as we discussed.)

196
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:16,387
(Let Wen)

197
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:18,867
(handle the price difference.)

198
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,827
(Li, can we really do this?)

199
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,587
(I've followed Mr. Zhao for many years.)

200
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,267
(Let me tell you the truth.)

201
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:27,547
(We've done)

202
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,867
(this many times.)

203
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:31,987
(Don't worry.)

204
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:33,627
(We won't shortchange you.)

205
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:35,507
(And you won't be investigated.)

206
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:41,587
I have more of this sort of recording

207
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,507
about cutting corners

208
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:43,627
and taking rebate.

209
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:44,947
Li,

210
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,627
I didn't know that you're quite active

211
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:48,987
in this kind of situation.

212
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,347
Wen has recorded

213
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:53,787
all the dirty money transaction clearly.

214
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:54,827
This kind of recording

215
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,187
is nothing but the tip of the iceberg.

216
00:13:57,907 --> 00:13:58,987
Through his clue,

217
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:00,787
we can easily find

218
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:01,947
all the evidence of you

219
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,107
doing money laundering.

220
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:05,347
Well,

221
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,467
I've checked and found out about this.

222
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:10,587
Zhao Mingxuan.

223
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,507
You go overseas every year

224
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:16,427
for illegal gambling.

225
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:18,307
No wonder

226
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:20,547
you need all the money to

227
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:21,827
to pay back

228
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:23,987
the debt.

229
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:30,947
Qi.

230
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,187
Why did you...

231
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,667
Why did I wait until now?

232
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,467
Because I want to show you

233
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,347
all the evidence

234
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:45,227
so that you can't escape

235
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:46,427
the legal judgement!

236
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:00,227
Well,

237
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:02,387
the police have verified

238
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,867
the critical evidence of Li

239
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,587
involving in the crimes.

240
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:10,667
Zhao Mingxuan.

241
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:14,947
You're the main perpetrator.

242
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:35,707
Hello?

243
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:43,067
The police

244
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:44,467
have entered Deju

245
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,747
and wanted to seal the place
for investigation.

246
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:02,707
Not me!

247
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,387
He asked me to do all these!

248
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:06,027
I have the recording, too.

249
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:07,307
He asked me to do all these.

250
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:08,467
It's him!

251
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:10,467
Yes.

252
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,067
I have evidence.

253
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:14,747
I want to report about him.

254
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,067
I'll surrender myself.

255
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,147
I want to redeem myself!

256
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:19,227
Zhao Mingxuan!

257
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:28,827
Zhao Mingxuan.

258
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:30,947
You can't run away.

259
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:32,987
Don't struggle for nothing.

260
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,267
Qi,

261
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:50,827
when your father and Xian neglected you,

262
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,427
who was accompanying you?

263
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,787
I did something wrong,

264
00:16:59,187 --> 00:16:59,787
but I've always treated you

265
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:00,907
as my own brother.

266
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,667
Why are you doing this to me?

267
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:10,826
I know.

268
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,427
I know you've always hated me.

269
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,826
You're blaming me for

270
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,227
what I've done to Xian.

271
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:20,106
But back then,

272
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,787
I was just a kid, too.

273
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:25,427
I've admired and envied you

274
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,267
since young.

275
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,107
Didn't I try to make it up to you

276
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,227
after I made the mistake?

277
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,027
As for your father,

278
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:37,787
if he didn't threaten me,

279
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:40,747
I wouldn't have been so impulsive.

280
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:44,787
Zhao Mingxuan.

281
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:47,827
This is the first time I see

282
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,387
how anxious you are.

283
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,747
After all, you're scared to die, too.

284
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:54,107
Aren't you afraid?

285
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:56,867
Why not

286
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,227
we die together?

287
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:04,747
You're too pathetic.

288
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:07,947
You take me as the imaginary enemy

289
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:11,147
and you gamble to have
the sense of achievement.

290
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,587
There's nothing else besides hatred

291
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:13,307
in your life.

292
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,347
You've harmed so many people!

293
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,227
You still lose end of the day!

294
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:18,987
You're afraid of death,

295
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,307
but have you lived before?

296
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:30,867
I've lived before.

297
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,267
I've lived under your shadow.

298
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,427
You've ruined my everything

299
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,467
since I was young.

300
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,027
But why can't you

301
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,107
just disappear?

302
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,027
I regret

303
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:54,267
that I didn't kill you earlier.

304
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:57,467
Didn't you feel sorry

305
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:58,747
to your father?

306
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,187
I'll send you to see him now

307
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:05,867
to show him

308
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,427
who is the winner in the end.

309
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:35,667
Zhao Mingxuan!

310
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,067
You have no more chance.

311
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,067
Come on.

312
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:46,427
Kill me!

313
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:47,947
Come on!

314
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:48,787
Qi!

315
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:49,507
I've destroyed

316
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:50,547
the whole Xiao family!

317
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:51,347
I have nothing to lose!

318
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:52,467
Come on!

319
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:53,987
Do you think I dare not?

320
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:55,307
Qi.

321
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,307
You should pay the price for murdering,

322
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:00,827
but I won't let you

323
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:02,067
die so easily.

324
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:04,667
Zhao Mingxuan,

325
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,587
you're gone.

326
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:08,787
Police! Freeze!

327
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:36,347
Are you okay?

328
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,620
(Xiao Shangqi)
(How did it go?)

329
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,400
(Xiao Shangqi, how did it go?)

330
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,140
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Deju Group's CEO, Zhao,)

331
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,700
(Xiao Shangqi)
(is suspected to commit several crimes)

332
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,620
(Xiao Shangqi)
(and has been arrested)

333
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:29,387
(for future investigation.)

334
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:33,147
Well done.

335
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:41,867
It's finally come to an end.

336
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,107
Miss He, you're sleeping
until now again?

337
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:04,627
I'm enjoying my life.

338
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:06,147
Come back home for dinner.

339
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:06,907
I'll cook.

340
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,867
I'll go back earlier then.

341
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,107
I'll get Sui to come as well.

342
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:12,587
Okay.

343
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:20,787
Mr. Gao.

344
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,427
After Deju's matter is over,

345
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,067
we've hired a batch of

346
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,547
employees that were fired,

347
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:27,907
so don't worry.

348
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,067
We have the ability

349
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:30,347
to operate steadily.

350
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:31,267
Of course,

351
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:33,427
we want to thank you.

352
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,587
Thanks for still trusting us

353
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,427
and letting Yunlan

354
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:37,427
manage Zhisheng.

355
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:38,987
Thank you.

356
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:43,267
After defeating

357
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:44,387
Zhao Mingxuan,

358
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,547
it has proven that

359
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:47,147
you brothers are capable

360
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:48,827
and you've

361
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:50,347
convinced me totally.

362
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,787
But Qi,

363
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:54,147
I'm really curious.

364
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,627
Since Yunlan

365
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:56,947
is cleared from suspection

366
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:58,787
and we have opened a branch in Hupu,

367
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:00,427
where else are you going?

368
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:05,747
I still have something
that I want to do.

369
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:06,987
Yes.

370
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:08,947
The most important thing in life.

371
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:14,987
Dear,

372
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,147
what are we eating tonight?

373
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,307
Dear, cook

374
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,267
fried egg with tomato for me.

375
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:21,147
Okay.

376
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:21,987
I'll cook for you.

377
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:24,187
How much is this tomato?

378
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:24,987
RMB 5.

379
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,307
How about RMB 2.50?

380
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:27,587
No way.

381
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,307
Everyone, stop for a while.

382
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,707
Open your mailbox.

383
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:40,547
Have a look

384
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:41,307
at the effect.

385
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:44,667
This is...

386
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:45,507
What?

387
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:46,907
This has been localised.

388
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:48,667
Did you do that?

389
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:50,827
You're talkative.

390
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:52,267
From now on,

391
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:53,467
we'll play this music video

392
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:54,867
on the screen in the office

393
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:56,187
during lunch time.

394
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:57,707
Did you hear that?

395
00:23:58,507 --> 00:23:58,987
Mr. Sui,

396
00:23:59,187 --> 00:23:59,747
are you ready?

397
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:01,827
Let's go. We're getting late.

398

♪Afraid of losing confidence in my eyes♪

399
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:07,547
Isn't this Hui's EP?

400
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,387
You kept saying

401
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:10,587
she signed with a swindler's company.

402
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,147
You got it wrong.

403
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:15,747
I'm fine with that.

404
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:16,787
Let's go.

405
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:17,667
Let's go.

You're back.

408
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,067
I'm so tired.

409
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,467
I've asked Sui to come,

410
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:42,587
but he said he's going out
for a business trip

411
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:43,587
so he can't make it.

412
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:45,427
Only I'm here to celebrate with you.

413
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:48,667
Okay.

414
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:53,667
You've released your EP.

415
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:55,067
He must be the happiest man

416
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,107
in the entire Wusu.

417
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:56,947
You two have been friends

418
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:58,027
for so long.

419
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,347
You don't have to do this.

420
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:02,827
I know he did it for my own good,

421
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:04,947
but that's what makes me sad.

422
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:05,947
He's so sure that

423
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,027
I'll be harmed for revenge.

424
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:07,667
Isn't that because

425
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:08,747
he doesn't believe in my ability?

426
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,027
No way. He wouldn't do that.

427
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,947
He's just overly concerned.

428
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:17,747
He was too harsh with his words.

429
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:18,987
He doesn't know

430
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:20,307
how to talk to you now.

431
00:25:24,187 --> 00:25:24,947
I always know

432
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,107
what I want to do,

433
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:28,547
so I normally don't care about

434
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:29,467
how others look at me

435
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:30,587
and talk about me,

436
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:32,427
but he's different

437
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:35,027
and his words will always reach

438
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:35,987
the deepest place of my heart.

439
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:36,907
I'm not feeling good.

440
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:39,067
He just likes to run his mouth.

441
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:44,147
Okay.

442
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:45,587
When he comes back,

443
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,787
I'll try to talk to him.

444
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:47,547
Seriously.

445
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,587
That's right.

446
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,107
Didn't you...

447
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:55,507
That fellow stole your songs.

448
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,460
(Play all)

449
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,500
(Play all)
These are your songs, right?

450
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,560
(Play all)

451
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:03,427
That producer

452
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:04,827
released a song for you,

453
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:06,907
but he gave the rest of them

454
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:07,867
to Tang Yan.

455
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,147
I'll look for him in the company.

456
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:13,627
I've asked someone to go there.

457
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:14,827
It's closed.

458
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:18,947
What should we do now?

459
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:20,587
Do you still have

460
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,027
all the manuscripts?

461
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:25,627
I've given them all to Zheng Jie.

462
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:31,707
You guessed it right.

463
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:34,707
I told you...

464
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:36,147
I'm just at
the resident performer's level,

465
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:38,947
but I thought

466
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,627
I can be a professional singer.

467
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:43,587
I was just saying.

468
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:56,707
This is my first time

469
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,147
seeing Hui like this.

470
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:03,467
Those people are too despicable.

471
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:04,987
They've stolen her effort

472
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:05,947
for the past few years.

473
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,347
It's not just this.

474
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:10,747
She's bothered because

475
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:12,747
you don't believe that she can succeed.

476
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:15,307
She has just proven herself.

477
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:16,387
Why would I not believe

478
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:17,507
that she can succeed?

479
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:18,627
I'm saying success

480
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:19,827
doesn't come easily.

481
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:22,347
It's useless that you tell me
and make me understand.

482
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:23,827
Tell her.

483
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:02,667
I...

484
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,947
When I was taking revenge on Tang Yan,

485
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:07,507
I just wanted to vent my anger.

486
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:10,067
When he was taking revenge,

487
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,027
he set up a huge trap.

488
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:13,267
Do you know why?

489
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:18,387
That's because he's

490
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:20,027
a useless trash.

491
00:28:22,427 --> 00:28:23,707
But you're different, Hui.

492
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:25,347
You're talented.

493
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,147
So, when he was taking revenge on you,

494
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,027
he just wanted

495
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,027
to grab some precious from you

496
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:32,627
for himself.

497
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:42,667
No need to comfort me.

498
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,587
Those songs are not precious.

499
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,027
It's just that

500
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:55,507
even if no one likes to listen to it,

501
00:28:57,867 --> 00:28:59,547
that's everything to me.

502
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,427
I just want to make music.

503
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:09,707
Can you please

504
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:10,947
leave me alone?

505
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:47,227
Hello?

506
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,620
(Fragrance research and development room)
Wei,

507
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:50,787
you went for a business trip

508
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,387
and disappeared?

509
00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:55,307
The horoscope says

510
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:56,947
you'll have a new relationship.

511
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:57,907
How is it?

512
00:29:58,267 --> 00:29:59,827
Have you met a pretty girl?

513
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:08,707
You...

514
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:11,627
You went for a business trip,
didn't you?

515
00:30:11,987 --> 00:30:13,227
I didn't go.

516
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,947
Well, why is Huihui here?

517
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:22,667
Is Shan around?

518
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:24,187
I have some legal issues to ask him.

519
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:31,067
Did you do

520
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,387
something bad again, rascal?

521
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,547
Xixi,

522
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:36,747
it's about me.

523
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:48,827
Your contract is not easy to deal with.

524
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,067
The clauses are not favouring you.

525
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:52,827
You can't really get back

526
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:54,787
the copyright of the songs,

527
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,147
and if you

528
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:57,227
bleach the contract,

529
00:30:57,427 --> 00:30:58,787
you need to compensate
them RMB 500,000.

530
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,027
The lawsuit is going to
be taking some time.

531
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:02,867
It's hard to predict the outcome

532
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:04,907
because we don't know

533
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:06,187
how prepared they are.

534
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:08,267
Still, we need to sue him.

535
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,227
I don't care about the result.

536
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:11,187
I just want to disgust him.

537
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:12,187
I can't let him live a carefree life.

538
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:14,667
Let me arrange a team

539
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:15,867
to handle this.

540
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,227
How about the legal fee?

541
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:21,987
Mr. Sui's matter is our matter.

542
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:23,347
We can't charge you.

543
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:25,787
Let's make thing clear.

544
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:27,387
I have some savings.

545
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,587
I can sell my equipment

546
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:32,827
to pay this.

547
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:35,507
Thank you.

548
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:38,787
I'll pay for it.

Is this real?

573
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:27,787
I bought this by lining up

at 3 a.m.

575
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:30,907

Okay, I'll take this.

577

How much is it?

590
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:01,387
I bought it at RMB 6,000.

591

You can take it with RMB 3,000.

RMB 2,000.

593

Look at the scratch here.

594
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,347
That won't affect

595
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:07,587
the function.

596
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:08,867
Sir,

597
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:09,827
do you know how

598
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:10,587
she got the scratch?

599
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:11,707
It's scratched by the famous band,

600
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:12,867
Grey Horse.

601
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:14,427
Stop lying.

602
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:16,427
You remember well.

603
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,747
You even know Grey Horse.

604
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:19,267
Of course.

605
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,027
I remember

606
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:22,547
I was chasing them down for 2 km

607
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:24,587
and asked them to pay RMB 200
as compensation.

608
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:26,387
Sir, let me tell you.

609
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:27,867
When she was singing

610
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:28,787
at Xuehai Bar,

611
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,587
the members  of Grey Horse

612
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,507
were drinking there.

613
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:32,427
They got drunk

614
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:34,147
and kicked the amplifier before leaving.

615
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,787
It fell off the door.

616
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:37,227
I had to chase after them.

617
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,307
Okay, I'll buy this.

618
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:41,307
RMB 3,000.

619
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:42,547
Okay.

620
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:47,947
Okay.

621
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:49,947
Why not you just take this away?

622
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:51,387
Sure.

623
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:52,387
Be gentle.

624
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,227
Thank you.

625

Tang Yan stole Li Hui's songs.

655
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:00,107
I heard that he's attending an event

657

00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:03,947
Shame on him.

659
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:04,627
I need to meet him.

660
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:06,707
You need evidence to prove

661
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:07,507
that it's music plagiarism.

662
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:08,707
Don't cause me any trouble.

667
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,827
I believe you'll become more famous

668
00:35:20,027 --> 00:35:20,867

669
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:21,747

I'll talk to the few

Sure.

Everyone knows that

683
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:56,987
the originality of songs are difficult

684
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,427
and most precious.

685
00:35:58,667 --> 00:35:59,747
Today, we're glad to

686
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,787
have invited

689
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,547
his inspiration.

690
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:05,507
Let's welcome him.

691
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:11,827
The album that I released today

692
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:13,627
is about my life

693
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:15,267
since I was a student.

694
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,387
It can be seen as the epitome

695
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:18,507
of the moments in my life.

696
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:20,387
My favourite is "Greetings At Dawn".

697
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:22,267
The sad melody is moving.

698
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:23,187
I can tell

699
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:23,907
Mr. Tang Yan

700
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:24,867
must have written it

701
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,187
after experiencing

702
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:27,507
a tough relationship.

703
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:29,067
Can you share with me

704
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:30,627
the story behind this?

705
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:34,867
I wrote this song

706
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:38,307
for the one I loved the most.

707
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:40,667
Normally, people would say

708
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:43,187
good morning and good night,

709
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:44,907
but the greetings at dawn

710
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:45,747
will only happen

711
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,267
between the closest people.

712
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,107
After spending the night together,

713
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:52,107
the twilight,

714
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,467
vagueness,

715
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:55,787
and sweetness

716
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:57,107
at dawn

717
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,427
are hard to be expressed.

718
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:00,787
That's why I named it

719
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,867
"Greetings At Dawn".
[*Li'an in Pinyin]

720
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,427
That's amazing.

721
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:05,587
Li'an

722
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,507
is the Li'an Port

723
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:09,227
in Lingshui, Hainan.

724
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,307
It's where Li Hui's parents went

725
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:12,707
after they divorced.

726
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:15,627
This song was not written about love,

727
00:37:15,907 --> 00:37:17,027
but to her father whom

728
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,387
she hasn't met for 10 years.

729
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:19,467
You said

730
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,787
you wrote this song

731
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:22,627
but you didn't even know about this?

732
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:25,867
Stop being ridiculous.

733
00:37:26,107 --> 00:37:26,947
I'm being ridiculous?

734
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,187
Everyone, please look at the lyrics.

735
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:30,627
The fishing port,

736
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:31,947
coconut forest and paddy field
in the song

737
00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:33,987
are all talking about Li'an Port.

738
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:35,987
If you want to change the word "Li'an",

739
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,747
you have to change a lot of

740
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:38,827
the lyrics.

741
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,227
Tang Yan,

742
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:42,467
you stole someone's song

743
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:44,347
and you didn't even bother to change it.

744
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:46,507
Well, it seems like it.

745
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:48,547
My goodness.

746
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:49,947
My goodness.

747
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,027
My goodness.

748
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:51,707
He stole the song?

749
00:37:51,707 --> 00:37:52,307
Yes.

750
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:53,067
He stole the song?

751
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:54,067
My goodness.

752
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:56,587
How can he do this?

753
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,827
This is plagiarism.

754
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,500
(RMB 2,000)

755
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,147
I'm selling off my guitar.

756
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:18,067
Anyone needs a guitar?

757
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:19,307
Come and take a look.

758
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,467
Why did you reduce the price,

759
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:25,227
Hui?

760
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,400
(RMB 1,500)

761
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:30,107
Let's go home after selling it.

762
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:31,667
I'll buy it.

763
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:35,347
Take this as a gift

764
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:36,747
from me.

765
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:39,547
I'm not selling it then.

766
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,427
I don't care.
I've transferred the money.

767
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:44,427
Hui,

768
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:46,867
you'll succeed for sure.

769
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:48,907
You're different from others

770
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,787
because you're glowing.

771
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:54,707
Stop it.

772
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:58,587
It's good to sell them all.

773
00:38:59,027 --> 00:38:59,947
It's a clean cut.

774
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,267
Forget about the past

775
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:02,507
and start afresh.

776
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:12,547
(Li'an)

777
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,267
Miss He is doing great.

778
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:16,307
(is the Li'an Port in Lingshui.)

779
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:18,467
(It's where Li Hui's parents went)

780
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:19,947
(after they divorced.)

781
00:39:20,947 --> 00:39:22,507
(This song was not written about love,)

782
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:23,787
(but to her father whom)

783
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,147
(she hasn't met for 10 years.)

784
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:26,747
Hello?

785
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:28,307
Let me tell you.

786
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:30,547
This time, we'll destroy

787
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:31,827
Tang Yan.

788
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:33,427
It's amazing.

789
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:36,267
He talked about twilight at dawn.

790
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:37,867
So disgusting.

791
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:39,547
I've asked my friends

792
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:41,507
to post this online.

793
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:43,387
We

794
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:44,627
will chase him out

795
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:45,627
of the industry forever.

796
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:46,467
Okay.

797
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:48,067
Let's talk about this
after the court case.

798
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:49,467
How's Li Hui?

799
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,387
I'm bringing her to have a meal

800
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:53,627
with my mother.

801
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,107
Drop by later.

802
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:56,387
I'm now at Linglong Mountain.

803
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:57,427
It'll be late when I reach there.

804
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:58,387
Go ahead without me.

805
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:00,107
Bye.

806
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:20,107
Again.

807
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:21,827
Rock, paper, scissors!

808
00:40:22,227 --> 00:40:22,827
You lost again.

809
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,667
Rock, paper, scissors!

810
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:29,227
You lost again.

811
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:30,067
Taiyang,

812
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,587
aren't you silly?

813
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:34,067
Rock, paper, scissors!

814
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:35,907
Be gentle.

815
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:37,507
You...

816
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:55,547
I'm here to visit Taiyang.

817
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:56,907
He said he can't fall asleep.

818
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,147
So, I was thinking to

819
00:40:58,307 --> 00:40:59,227
play with him and get him tired.

820
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,907
And you got yourself tired.

821
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,467
Did you watch the news?

822
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,667
Zhao Mingxuan was arrested.

823
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:17,307
I saw that.

824
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:20,187
You don't need to

825
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:21,947
go to the backyard at midnight anymore.

826
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:23,787
It's cold.

827
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:26,987
So,

828
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:29,427
you turned on the light at the corridor?

829
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:31,947
That's why.

830
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,867
The light was turned off at 11 p.m.

831
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:35,747
on the first night.

832
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,827
But, it has been turned on
all night lately.

833
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,867
Thank you for turning on the light.

834
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:43,707
It's kept me accompanied.

835
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:45,707
When I can't fall asleep at night,

836
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:46,707
being there for a while

837
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:47,947
will calm me down.

838
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:50,987
I won't be at peace

839
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:52,827
as long as he's not arrested.

840
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:55,867
But, everything is fine now.

841
00:41:56,187 --> 00:41:57,067
It's come to an end.

842
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:58,987
That's why you switched
from the backyard

843
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:00,987
and came here to look for Taiyang?

844
00:42:05,347 --> 00:42:06,707
Taiyang's age is great.

845
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:08,627
His life has just begun.

846
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,947
He hasn't made any mistake.

847
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:13,187
It's all clean.

848
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:15,547
Just like a piece of white paper.

849
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,467
There's unlimited possibility.

850
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:20,707
Zhao Mingxuan has paid the price.

851
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:22,227
But,

852
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:24,347
I can't go back anymore.

853
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,307
What are you talking about?

854
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:30,787
You haven't even lived

855
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:31,707
half of half your life.

856
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:37,547
I know

857
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:39,467
half is this much.

858
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,107
Let's say

859
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:49,787
you can live until 100 years old,

860
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:52,787
half of half your life

861
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:53,907
is just until here.

862
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:56,147
You're now here.

863
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:57,827
After turning a short corner,

864
00:42:58,467 --> 00:42:59,427
you still have a long

865
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:00,387
way to go.

866
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:02,747
You can live however you want.
