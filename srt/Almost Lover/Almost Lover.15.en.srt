Since you've loved me for so long,

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,310
I'll return it all to you.

19
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,390
How are you going to return it?

20
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,390
Be careful.

21
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,030
Come here and lie down.

22
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,390
This is not bad.

23
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,070
Not bad.

24
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,310
It's all in the past now.

25
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,550
Xiaoran.

26
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,870
Why are you here?

27
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,670
I came here

28
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,510
before dawn.

29
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
I want to let you sleep a little longer

30
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,110
and wake you up later.

31
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,510
Anything?

32
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,790
I'm sorry, Xiaoran.

33
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,830
I was drunk yesterday.

34
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,910
I forgot about what happened later on.

35
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,550
So, you're using that as an excuse?

36
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,750
No, I'm not.

37
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,750
It's my fault.

38
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,190
It's my fault.

39
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:36,830
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,710
So, how will you make it up to me?

41
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,070
I heard from

42
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,790
the hotel lobby manager.

43
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,830
I knew why you were angry

44
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,630
about yesterday.

45
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,630
It's my fault.

46
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,990
I was afraid that if I had told you,

47
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,750
you would've misunderstood.

48
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,510
Why are you showing me this?

49
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,470
In that morning,

50
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,390
Chen Fei'er indeed has come
to my room.

51
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,990
She wanted to order
some food in my room.

52
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,270
I asked her to leave but she refused.

53
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,350
So, I came out by myself.

54
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,030
Xiaoran.

55
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,270
I know we have a lot

56
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,950
of memories in Hupu

57
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,590
and some of those

58
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,510
are bad memories.

59
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,710
Although

60
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,270
I can't change it,

61
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,110
at least now and in the future,

62
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,830
I hope we can get along well

63
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,390
and not be affected

64
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,110
by those bad memories.

65
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,750
Well,

66
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,550
did

67
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,030
we really fight last night?

68
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,630
Or you didn't hurt me badly?

69
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,630
Last night,

70
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,750
you suddenly confessed your love to me.

71
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,310
It's all truth after drinking.

72
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,230
You said you love me.

73
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,230
You said you love me so much.

74
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,110
You said you love me so much

75
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,270
and can't live without me.

76
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,270
I think I said that.

77
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,670
Besides the confession,

78
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,670
did I not do something more
to express myself?

79
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,710
Can you be nice and

80
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,270
take breakfast with me?

81
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,230
I have yet to brush my teeth.

82
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,590
I'm not complaining.

83
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,550
Let me make it clear.

84
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,310
I didn't mean to overhear you.

85
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,190
I only heard about

86
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,750
eating breakfast.

87
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,870
We have breakfast at home.

88
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,470
Do you want to come in and eat?

89
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,550
That'd be great.

90
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,430
Come on.

91
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,710
Try this.

92
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,230
My mother cooked this.

93
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:18,910
It's good for hangover.

94
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,110
Thank you, Mrs. He.

95
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,910
You're welcome.

96
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,190
I heard that you asked Ran

97
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,990
to pick you up last night.

98
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,590
Did you drink a lot?

99
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,070
Mr. He,

100
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,150
I'll take note next time.

101
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:34,590
Why is your tolerance so low?

102
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,550
Come over tonight.

103
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,470
I'll teach you.

104
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,109
Teach me?

105
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,630
You drank a lot last night.

106
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,950
If you drink again today,

107
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,830
your tolerance will

108
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,430
improve.

109
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,110
Don't simply teach him.

110
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,670
I'm not.

111
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,870
Well, you both like

112
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,190
this dish.

113
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,270
I've made some

114
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,990
and kept it in the fridge.

115
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,990
Whenever you're here,

116
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,910
you can eat it.

117
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,190
Thank you, Mrs. He.

118
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,470
You're welcome.

119
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,030
When you go back,

120
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,550
I'll teach Xiaoran.

121
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,070
Making this is troublesome.

122
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,430
Teach me then.

123
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,950
I'll learn.

124
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,390
You're not free to learn this.

125
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,590
Chengsen's order

126
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,230
will increase our sales for 20%

127
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,670
besides Deju.

128
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,430
Why was the deal blown?

129
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,950
I'll find a better partner.

130
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,910
I've found out what happened.

131
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,750
Mr. Lan called me.

132
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,430
Why wasn't the agreement signed?

133
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,710
You know.

134
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,870
Mr. Lan said he wants to help me

135
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,310
to suppress Xiao Xian

136
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,870
and when I'm managing Yunlan,

137
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,830
I should give him some benefits.

138
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,870
We're now

139
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,310
dealing with Zhao Mingxuan.

140
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,110
Everyone of us

141
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,030
has been very careful.

142
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,510
If every partner that we're getting

143
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,350
is having their own agenda,

144
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,590
our lives

145
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,910
by then will only

146
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,670
become worse.

147
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,430
Yunlan will become the shield

148
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,990
when others are fighting

149
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,830
with Deju.

150
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,350
I might be old.

151
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,790
I thought

152
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,070
we don't have to clarify

153
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,230
when others think

154
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,590
you brothers are not on good term.

155
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,670
Then others

156
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,150
will put their guard down.

157
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,870
It seems to me now

158
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,750
it has become the point

159
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,830
where others are using it
against us.

160
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,870
In the future, I'll

161
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,830
get in the sales.

162
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,430
After the deal is on,

163
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,110
Xiao Xian will take over from there.

164
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,110
Did Xian talk to you
about something?

165
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,830
This is my own idea.

166
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,350
After the wedding,

167
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,070
I'll go back to Wusu.

168
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,990
You still want to go back?

169
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,710
I don't understand

170
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,630
what's there

171
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,910
for you to be so eager to go back.

172
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,950
There's something I treasure

173
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,710
but you can never

174
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,150
provide forever.

175
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,950
Are you talking about He Xiaoran?

176
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,710
Qi,

177
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,470
I always thought you'll be back in Wusu

178
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,590
for the chess game

179
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,910
you always talked about.

180
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,430
Of course.

181
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,270
You're young.

182
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,230
You're energetic and ambitious.

183
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,230
I know,

184
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,230
but you can't keep thinking

185
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,310
about things

186
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,030
that are useless

187
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,390
and give up on your career

188
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,230
for relationships.

189
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,630
Give up?

190
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,230
I was the one being abandoned.

191
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,390
No matter how you got to know

192
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,670
about He Xiaoran,

193
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,590
I hope you don't do anything to her.

194
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,390
She has nothing to do with you.

195
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,590
I'm her boyfriend's father.

196
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,590
Surely she has something to do with me.

197
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,350
Yes.

198
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:15,910
The father

199
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,790
that has been absent

200
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,230
in all my life.

201
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,990
Or should I say,

202
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,830
a father who

203
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,110
treats me as a tool.

204
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,230
Qi!

205
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,510
Mr. Xiao.

206
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,710
Dr. Sun is here.

207
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,110
Okay.

208
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,390
Finally, we have time

209
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,470
for just the two of us.

210
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,390
So nice.

211
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,910
Yes.

212
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:05,990
What's wrong?

213
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,470
It's my father's birthday today.

214
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,750
He loves to play golf.

215
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,670
So, you plan to buy him a club?

216
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,830
He'll surely be happy.

217
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,550
Forget it.

218
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,870
I'll only make him angry.

219
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,190
Let's go.

220
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,790
I'll send the wedding proposal

221
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,830
to Chen Fei'er later.

222
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,310
You should go home first.

223
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,110
Fei'er,

224
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,710
here's the draft of

225
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,550
the wedding proposal.

226
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,710
Take a look.

227
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,230
Let's

228
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,150
decide on

229
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,830
the style.

230
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,110
Let's have a meal together

231
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,990
and talk about it.

232
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,750
I need to go home later.

233
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,350
How's your relationship

234
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,230
with your family lately?

235
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,790
Actually, I always think that
your father...

236
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,790
It's my family matter.

237
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,910
It has nothing to do with you.

238
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,310
Okay.

239
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,470
I'll not say anything.

240
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,590
Since you want to go home,

241
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,590
can I just ask Xiaoran out
for a meal then?

242
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,550
After all,

243
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,150
we need to discuss about the dress code.

244
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:17,870
Hello.

245
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,150
Xiaoran,

246
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,310
where are you?

247
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,870
You're in Xiao Shangqi's home?

248
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,190
You've met each other's parents

249
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,630
so soon?

250
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,190
Xiao Shangqi!

251
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,550
Miss He,

252
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,670
what do you like to eat?

253
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,790
I'll prepare it.

254
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,390
Please cook sweet and sour pork ribs.

255
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,710
Xiao Shangqi likes it, too.

256
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,270
Okay.

257
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,830
There are dishes
that Xiao Shangqi likes, too?

258
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,110
He likes sweet and sour pork ribs,

259
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,470
home-cooked braised eggplant,

260
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,310
and crayfish.

261
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,750
We're renting a house in Wusu.

262
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,750
We always cook.

263
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,870
You should try his dishes
if there's a chance.

264
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,670
You cooked and rented a house?

265
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,150
He's used to five-star hotel.

266
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,910
Can he get used to the rented house?

267
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,110
Do you know that Xiao Shangqi

268
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,350
had to listen to radio program

269
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,830
before he could fall asleep?

270
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,030
I don't know.

271
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,550
That's his habit since young.

272
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,750
No matter how luxurious the hotel is,

273
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,870
it's nothing better than

274
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,750
having parents by his side.

275
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,190
I thought he likes to be alone.

276
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,830
Ever since Xian was injured,

277
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,990
he became more and more rebellious

278
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,750
and lonelier.

279
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,350
He's not easy to teach.

280
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,190
I heard about

281
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,670
that incident, too.

282
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,950
He told you about that incident, too?

283
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,830
Actually, the person who was hurt

284
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,990
in that accident was not only Xiao Xian.

285
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,990
You keep asking him to

286
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,070
help Xian

287
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,230
to remind him

288
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,870
to make it up to Xian,

289
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
but have you thought about

290
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,550
Xiao Shangqi

291
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,190
was only eight years old then?

292
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,150
All these years,

293
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,630
he's guilty

294
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,950
and feels wronged,

295
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,430
but more than that,

296
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,270
he's sad for being neglected by you.

297
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,110
Did you ask me

298
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,510
what's so good about Wusu?

299
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,270
Actually, Wusu is just

300
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,310
a small town.

301
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,030
Riding a shared bicycle for an hour

302
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,710
will send you from the east
to the west of the city.

303
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,510
But, to Xiao Shangqi,

304
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,070
his friends are there.

305
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,550
Someone cares about him there.

306
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,990
What he's been asking for

307
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,510
is just

308
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,430
the warmth of a family.

309
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,390
Why did you come back so soon?

310
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,390
- Where's He Xiaoran?
- Chengsen...

311
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:13,830
In the backyard.

312
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,029
What's wrong with you?

313
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,630
Push it lightly.

314
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,309
You're a girl,

315
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,350
but you're strong.

316
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,269
Xiao Shangqi.

317
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,190
You're back.

318
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,150
Father,

319
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,750
why didn't you tell me

320
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,990
before asking her here?

321
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,910
What?

322
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,350
Are you afraid that

323
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,190
I'd kidnap her?

324
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,550
This is the golf club
you bought for Mr. He.

325
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,510
I brought it here.

326
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,830
Mr. He likes it.

327
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,710
You're quite generous.

328
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,790
But,

329
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,830
it's not working well.

330
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,310
You're not young anymore.

331
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,870
Why would you blame

332
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,230
the club for your bad skill?

333
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,430
You can come and eat now.

334
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,990
Miss He, this way.

335
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,750
Thank you.

336
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,630
Mr. He, let's eat.

337
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,310
Let's eat.

338
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,230
Qi,

339
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,030
your girlfriend

340
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,390
is interesting.

341
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,990
Why did father say to her?

342
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,950
I didn't overhear.

343
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,950
But, Miss He

344
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,790
knows a lot about plants.

345
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,830
She was talking about gardening

346
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,670
with your father

347
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,830
in the yard

348
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,070
for so long.

349
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,710
I think your father likes her.

350
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,510
Well,

351
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,270
would you like some wine?

352
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,830
I'll pass. Thank you, Mr. He.

353
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,630
Okay.

354
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,390
We'll drink by ourselves.

355
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,670
Well,

356
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,470
how's the wedding preparation?

357
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,230
I heard we've found a pianist

358
00:18:59,390 --> 00:18:59,950
as the guest.

359
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,310
We've found

360
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,350
a famous

361
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,950
Chinese pianist, Shen Meng.

362
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,150
During the wedding,

363
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,510
he'll be playing the piano
with the bride.

364
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,910
Who does he think

365
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,230
his fiance is?

366
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,230
How's the selection of
the general manager?

367
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,030
I've found a few.

368
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,510
They studied abroad.

369
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,590
There shouldn't be a problem.

370
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,630
Do you always talk about work

371
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,310
on the dining table?

372
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,110
Let's eat.

373
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,550
The longevity noodle is here.

374
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,710
Today,

375
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,910
as Miss He said,

376
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,630
there's only one noodle.

377
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,390
Mr. He,

378
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,270
I wish you

379
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,070
a long life.

380
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,790
Happy birthday to you.

381
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,030
Okay.

382
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,790
Thank you.

383
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,710
Mr. He, please eat the noodle.

384
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,670
Don't bite it off.

385
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,550
I'm not young anymore.

386
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,790
Why so particular?

387
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,910
It has to be particular.

388
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,670
Do you know what?

389
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,550
On my birthday,

390
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,310
my mother asked me to remember that.

391
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,310
But when I was eating

392
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,750
the birthday longevity instant noodle,

393
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,550
I had it bitten off.

394
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,470
Guess what happened.

395
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,190
What happened?

396
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,590
I was having back luck the whole day.

397
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,470
I think you were quite lucky that day.

398
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,030
I were quite lucky.

399
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,230
But, Mr. He,

400
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,310
as long as you don't bite it off,

401
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,150
I believe you will be

402
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,110
even luckier.

403
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll try my best.

404
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,830
Keep it up.

405
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,470
Keep it up.

406
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,270
Hope is before you.

407
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,550
Hope is before you.

408
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,030
Water.

409
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,510
Drink some water.

410
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,310
It's okay.

411
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,790
Mr. He, are you okay?

412
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,670
I'm okay.

413
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,430
I'm okay.

414
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:04,950
Sir,

415
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,670
Mr. Chen just called

416
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,990
to ask you out for golf tomorrow.

417
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,750
It's been a while

418
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,430
since I joined them.

419
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,230
Well,

420
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,670
bring the club

421
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,110
Qi bought for me tomorrow.

422
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:15,990
Okay.

423
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,830
Father.

424
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,710
I'll go with you tomorrow.

425
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:28,870
Okay.

426
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,550
Here.

427
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,630
Let's drink.

428
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,950
Happy birthday, Mr. He.

429
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,870
Let's eat.

430
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
My father asked you to come.

431
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,190
Why didn't you inform me?

432
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,190
Xian came to look for me

433
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,470
and said Mr. He wanted to see me.

434
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,270
It's Mr. He's birthday.

435
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,550
So, rejecting him is not good.

436
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,990
I texted you.

437
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,270
I was in a hurry to meet you.

438
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,230
I left my mobile phone

439
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,230
in the bridal shop.

440
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,710
Were you thinking that Mr. He

441
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,710
was about to give me a few millions,

442
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,190
forcing me to break up with you?

443
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,950
You've watched too many idol series.

444
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,750
Come on.

445
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,150
Well,

446
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:25,830
when did you

447
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,950
buy that golf club?

448
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,990
I bought it when I was passing by.

449
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,110
I'm telling you.

450
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,510
Mr. He didn't say it,

451
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,590
but when he saw

452
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,670
the golf club,

453
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,630
I can tell that

454
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,630
he was very happy.

455
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,990
Otherwise, he wouldn't have taught me

456
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,070
how to play golf.

457
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,670
Xiaoran.

458
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,030
Actually, you don't have to

459
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,990
do this for me.

460
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,150
Actually, I think

461
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,470
your father is friendlier

462
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,830
than I expected.

463
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,390
Also, he's asked me a lot

464
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,110
about the things in Wusu.

465
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,590
Why did he ask you?

466
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,510
Is there anything tasty there?

467
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,510
Are you used to the food there?

468
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,390
How's Wusu's weather?

469
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,310
What do we do

470
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,310
when we're not working?

471
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,430
He asked about these?

472
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,990
I was surprised, too.

473
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,310
As a father, I think

474
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,430
he doesn't know much

475
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,310
about his sons.

476
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,670
Looking at how

477
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,110
he was trying to ask about your life,

478
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,350
I think

479
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,150
it's not true that he doesn't

480
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,110
care about you.

481
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,790
It's just that after so many years,

482
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,990
you're not close with him anymore.

483
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,030
He doesn't know

484
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,550
how to communicate with you anymore.

485
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,630
He could talk to me, an outsider,

486
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,550
easily.

487
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,110
Yes.

488
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,430
After coming back this time,

489
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,550
I feel that he's getting older.

490
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,710
His body is getting weaker, too.

491
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,710
Let's make use

492
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,070
of the time in Hupu

493
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,390
to know him better

494
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,750
and foster the relationship with him.

495
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:49,750
Okay.

496
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,950
You're playing well.

497
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,070
You've improved, old man.

498
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,070
I'm learning from you.

499
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,110
Okay, learn from me.

500
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,270
Good morning.

501
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,550
Father.

502
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,590
Good morning.

503
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,150
Good morning.

504
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,790
Father.

505
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,230
You were drunk last night?

506
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,990
How did you know?

507
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,110
The comments were great.

508
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,710
I'm much more confident now.

509
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,630
Control how you drink.

510
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,110
If you can't,

511
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,550
others wouldn't believe that

512
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,350
you can develop the business.

513
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,710
Why is your tolerance so low?

514
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,790
Come over tonight.

515
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,430
I'll teach you.

516
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,950
Teach me?

517
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,110
You drank a lot last night.
If you drink again today,

518
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,990
your tolerance will

519
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,550
improve.

520
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,390
Father,

521
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,710
are you free tonight

522
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,710
to drink with me?

523
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,510
What?

524
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,990
I drank a lot last night.

525
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,590
If I drink again tonight,

526
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,750
it's like a practice.

527
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,310
My tolerance will improve after that.

528
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,670
What nonsense is that?

529
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,070
Come on.

530
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,830
You're playing well.

531
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,990
It seems like

532
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,110
you really like to play golf.

533
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,110
Mr. Gao, you're flattering me.

534
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,430
I just like the sense of achievement

535
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,510
of the accuracy

536
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,670
of putting the ball

537
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,750
into the hole

538
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,430
from few meters away.

539
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,190
You must be doing well

540
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,830
in the business arena.

541
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,470
Well, Mr. Gao,

542
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,350
the agreement between Zhisheng
and the operating company

543
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
is about to end, right?

544
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,030
Yes.

545
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,470
The current operating company

546
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,150
wants to extend the agreement with us.

547
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,990
He suggested us to enter
the Southeast Asia market

548
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,870
in the next three years.

549
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,030
Qi,

550
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,670
what do you think

551
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,510
about this suggestion?

552
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,510
In my opinion,

553
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,590
instead of being

554
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,110
a latecomer in the mature

555
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,270
Southeast Asia market,

556
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,430
why not stay in the current battlefield,

557
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,590
continue to harvest

558
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,590
and stablilise
the optimised opportunity.

559
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,390
Not bad.

560
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,750
It seems like he's done his homework.

561
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,950
Mr. Gao,

562
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,110
even though you want to
enter the foreign market,

563
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,950
Southeast Asia will not be

564
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,030
the best first stop.

565
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,150
From what I understand,

566
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,990
the foreign-funded

567
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,030
operating company you're using

568
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,670
is not doing well these two years.

569
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,710
They're trying to move back

570
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,310
to their headquarters in Southeast Asia.

571
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,350
They're the one benefited the most

572
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,990
from this idea.

573
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,430
Zhisheng's the leading group
in the industry.

574
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,230
If Yunlan

575
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,870
is able to collaborate with Zhisheng,

576
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,590
we'll surely think far

577
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,750
and pay much attention

578
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,790
to bring Zhisheng

579
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,230
up to the next level.

580
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,510
Zhenyun,

581
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,750
he's more straightforward than you.

582
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,710
Okay.

583
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,550
I'll give you a chance.

584
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,310
Show me the proposal.

585
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,750
But I have a condition.

586
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,830
The person in charge

587
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,230
must base in the big camp of East China,

588
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:10,870
Hupu.

589
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,270
can you do that?

590
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,750
Mr. Gao, let's look
at the proposal first.

591
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:19,870
Okay.

592
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,070
Let's go.

593
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,830
Qi,

594
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,990
you played well today.

595
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,190
You've impressed Mr. Gao.

596
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,430
When did you start to plan this?

597
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,950
I didn't plan it.

598
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,670
I just wanted to play golf with you.

599
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,430
The food in that restaurant is tasty.

600
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,590
I must bring you there.

601
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,190
Well, Xiaoran,

602
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,630
the training is about to end.

603
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,030
When are you going back?

604
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,470
After the wedding.

605
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,670
Why won't you stay in Hupu?

606
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,110
Why must you go back there?

607
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,150
Is that place so nice?

608
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,030
I've never been there.

609
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,150
It's beautiful and out of the world.

610
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,790
You should go and take a look.

611
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,550
I feel like going back now.

612
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,030
He Xiaoran.

613
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,950
Xiaoran.

614
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,350
I'm leaving now.

615
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,030
Bye.

616
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,710
Why are you two here?

617
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,670
I missed you!

618
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,390
To attend the wedding?

619
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,550
My mother gave me a lot of money

620
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,430
for me to widen my horizon here.

621
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,150
What horizon is this?

622
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,430
You don't know.

623
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,550
It's a wedding,

624
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,390
but in their hotel circle,

625
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,670
they're the leader in the industry

626
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,990
holding a social banquet.

627
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,270
Money has been paid.

628
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,270
You're also here.

629
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,550
I might as well just come.

630
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,990
I've also brought Hui

631
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,870
here for fun

632
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,350
to ease her from heartbroken.

633
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,270
Stop it.

634
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,470
I'm here to see Xiaoran.

635
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,630
What about Dajiabang?

636
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,390
It's upgraded.

637
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,390
We've added some new staff
these two days.

638
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,030
They want to adjust

639
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,110
the airing time.

640
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,910
We've been airing the recording
these few days.

641
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,230
That's great.

642
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,390
You're about to bloom soon.

643
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,870
Listen.

644
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,030
Mr. He has been

645
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,310
showing off to others

646
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,310
recently.

647
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:16,950
He said,

648
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,950
"We're on air

649
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,270
every night lately.

650
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,830
We're back to the peak."

651
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,830
Where are you two staying?

652
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,030
Mr. He found us

653
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,070
our partner hotel.

654
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,350
It's even discounted for the staff.

655
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,630
I'm really happy to see you

656
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,950
in Hupu.

657
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,310
Let me make this clear.

658
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,110
Li Hui will stay with me
at home tonight.

659
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,150
Okay.

660
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,030
Why am I being abandoned

661
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,750
as soon as I arrived?

662
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,710
I don't care.

663
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,750
You'll buy me this meal.

664
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,710
I'll order more meat.

665
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,030
Eating is all you know.

666
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,070
You two keep hitting me.

667
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,150
I might go crazy.

668
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,510
I've brought some nice food for you.

669
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,670
Great.

670
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,150
It's our best friends night.

671
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,230
You're abandoning your boyfriend.

672
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,230
But, it's great that they can come

673
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,910
to the wedding.

674
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,510
I'll be really busy soon.

675
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,550
They can keep you company.

676
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,550
I'm thinking,

677
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,150
after the wedding,

678
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,030
maybe we can drive home.

679
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,710
Then,

680
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,950
we'll be able to see a lot of
views along the journey.

681
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,950
Take it as a road trip.

682
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,510
What do you think?

683
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,150
Are you thinking of going back to Wusu?

684
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,910
Of course.

685
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,550
Although Wusu is great,

686
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,110
Hupu is not bad, too.

687
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,990
At least I can keep my parents company

688
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,070
staying at home.

689
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,070
But,

690
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,750
I've just become a journalist in Wusu.

691
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,190
I'm not done with writing news.

692
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,350
The living pace in Hupu is quick.

693
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,870
I can't even meet my friends often.

694
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,310
It's not like in Wusu.

695
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,150
We can meet

696
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,070
my friends from Dajiabang

697
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,950
for a meal.

698
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,990
What about you?

699
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,550
Don't you miss them from Jifeng?

700
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,070
Lin Zong and Taiyang.

701
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,590
What about the flowers

702
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,270
and plants at home?

703
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,790
The succulent is fine without water
for a few days.

704
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,510
But, what about the crane flower?

705
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,590
What?

706
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,790
Nothing.

707
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,750
Let's go back together and water them.

708
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,670
Ran's new pajamas

709
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,630
suits you well.

710
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,390
Well,

711
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,710
here's the toothbrush for you.

712
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,710
I've changed

713
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,550
the electric toothbrush head.

714
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,270
There are many modes to it.

715
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,270
Thank you, Mrs. He.

716
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,670
I have one.

717
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,830
Xiaoran gave it to me as a gift.

718
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:45,630
Really?

719
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,630
That's great.

720
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,390
Then you know how to use it.

721
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,470
Thank you, Mrs. He.

722
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,470
Look.

723
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,990
Ran keeps saying that

724
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,510
all her friends in Wusu

725
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,070
take care of her well.

726
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,310
Thank you so much.

727
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,390
Xiaoran is the one taking care of us.

728
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,550
We missed her so much.

729
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,110
So, we've come to meet her.

730
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,390
Look.

731
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,870
Why are your friends so nice?

732
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,590
You...

733
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,110
Mother.

734
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,830
Let us have some time to talk.

735
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,110
Okay.

736
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,230
Carry on.

737
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,470
I'll go to bed.

738
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,750
Sleep early.

739
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,590
Okay.

740
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,950
Good night.

741
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,070
Good night.

742
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,310
Your mother is nice.

743
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,550
Now, you have two toothbrushes.

744
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,910
One in Wusu and another one in Hupu.

745
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,470
Not bad.

746
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,870
How did it go?

747
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,390
I saw you and Xiao Shangqi

748
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,270
were being so close at the door.

749
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,830
It's all solved?

750
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,630
I think you were right.

751
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,190
Chen Fei'er did it on purpose.

752
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,270
Well,

753
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,150
let me tell you.

754
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,910
Do you know what?

755
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:52,950
There was once

756
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,390
Xiao Shangqi was drunk.

757
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,670
She sent me a text on purpose

758
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,550
to tell me

759
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,110
that

760
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,830
it's because someone in the meeting

761
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,430
mentioned their past.

762
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,230
She is...

763
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:03,830
I don't understand.

764
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,190
She's getting married soon.

765
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,550
Why is she

766
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,630
doing all these?

767
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,350
Some people

768
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,870
like to find their sense of presence

769
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,350
in others' lives.

770
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,990
Just get used to it.

771
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,030
Just take whatever may come.

772
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,950
After all,

773
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,870
when the wedding is over,

774
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,990
Xiao Shangqi and I will go back to Wusu.

775
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,470
We'll not be troubled
as long as we don't see it.

776
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,750
What about you?

777
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,590
What kind of trouble you have

778
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,790
that you need to come to Hupu
to solve it?

779
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,790
Nothing.

780
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,870
Are you still thinking about

781
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,150
Tang Yan?

782
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,990
I've let it go.

783
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,070
It's just that

784
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,070
I can't play guitar anymore.

785
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,790
What do you mean?

786
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,230
Whenever I touch the guitar,

787
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,350
I'd feel awful.

788
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,190
Maybe I was playing guitar

789
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,350
too often with Tang Yan.

790
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,230
I can just stop playing.

791
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,310
I don't need to play to earn a living.

792
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,910
It's okay.

793
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,669
You can use this time

794
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,390
to find

795
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,030
a new hobby.

796
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,510
I can teach you Taekwondo.

797
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:16,430
I think it's a great idea.

798
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:18,750
Get Sui Mingwei here to train with me.

799
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,109
Sure.

800
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,790
I've never learned Taekwondo before.

801
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,669
I want to learn.

802
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,629
Treat him as the sandbag.

803
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,550
Let's start tomorrow.

804
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,470
Beat the terrible guy with bare hands.

805
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,870
I'll give him a body slam.

806
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,189
I'm happy that you're here in Hupu.

807
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,470
I'm happy to see you, too.

808
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,109
I've read your proposal.

809
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,149
Your perspective is unique.

810
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,189
The analysis is clear.

811
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,270
I like it.

812
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,230
Did you ask me here

813
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,150
just to tell me

814
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,350
you're satisfied with it?

815
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,430
You can collaborate

816
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,150
with me,

817
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,230
but I want you

818
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,830
to run the business in Hupu.

819
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,670
Executing the plan

820
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,270
takes a team,

821
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,990
not just a man.

822
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,750
We Yunlan will surely select

823
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,150
the best talents.

824
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,710
That's for sure,

825
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,030
but the most excellent

826
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,230
person in charge of the team

827
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,710
has to be you.

828
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,270
The plan is just some mere talk.

829
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,190
Can Yunlan execute it well?

830
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,230
To be honest,

831
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,230
I'm just gambling.

832
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,990
It's not easy to find a client
and close a deal,

833
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,750
but keeping the client is the hardest.

834
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,830
I know

835
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,390
what's your purpose of
approaching Zhisheng.

836
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,070
Let me remind you.

837
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,390
It's not easy

838
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,990
to get rid of Deju.

839
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,270
This is something even the three of you

840
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,390
from Xiao family might not be able to do

841
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,030
even if you're trying your best.

842
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,870
If you're not on the frontline

843
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,150
and giving it your all,

844
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,790
how can you succeed?

845
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,430
You've underestimated Zhao Mingxuan

846
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,870
or you've

847
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,030
underestimated Zhisheng's business?

848
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,270
Mr. Gao,

849
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,430
give me some time.

850
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,670
Okay.

851
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,230
I heard that Yunlan

852
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,910
is approaching Zhisheng's Mr. Gao.

853
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,830
It seems like Xiao Shangqi
is planning to expand

854
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,550
Yunlan in Hupu.

855
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,950
He's trying to get

856
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,430
Deju's market share.

857
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,990
Mr. Zhao, Miss Chen is here.

858
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,270
Let her come in.

859
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,430
Continue.

860
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,910
I heard that

861
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,230
they're talking to different ones

862
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,790
when they were sending
the invitation cards.

863
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,550
No wonder

864
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,710
he took the initiative
to run the errands.

865
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,270
His method

866
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,910
is totally different

867
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,790
from his family.

868
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,030
What's Xiao Zhenyun doing?

869
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,070
Lately,

870
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,910
he's suddenly supporting

871
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,350
Xiao Shangqi in all the social events.

872
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,470
He's trying to tell others

873
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,910
that his relationship with his son
is fine

874
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,470
and planning the road ahead
for his son's development.

875
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,390
He's really cunning.

876
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,110
I want to change them all,

877
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:15,710
but I don't want them

878
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,910
to go ahead of me.

879
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,510
Make an appointment
with Mr. Gao for me immediately.

880
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,590
I want to meet him.

881
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,670
Okay.

882
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,470
This hairstyle looks the best.

883
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,710
Set it for Miss He as well.

884
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,230
No need.

885
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,830
You're getting married.

886
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,470
It's okay that you look pretty.

887
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,310
There are some

888
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,390
new hair accessories.

889
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,190
Take them here.

890
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,230
We'll choose together.

891
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:46,750
Okay.

892
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,310
Was Xiao Shangqi okay

893
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,230
after going back that night?

894
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,710
The people in our circle

895
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,030
like to joke around.

896
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,190
Don't mind it.

897
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,070
Now, we're seeing

898
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,590
someone we love.

899
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,590
Look,

900
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,950
you were in love with Xiao Shangqi
for so long,

901
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,270
yet nothing happened back then.

902
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,350
After so many years,

903
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,750
you two are being together.

904
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,550
In Xiao Shangqi's heart,

905
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,750
he and I are not getting together.

906
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,510
Could it be

907
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,110
an unknown for the future?

908
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,750
Chen Fei'er,

909
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,830
can you just behave

910
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,630
and get married?

911
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,110
Stop teasing me, okay?

912
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,910
I know some people

913
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,510
might have gamophobia.

914
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,190
I don't care if you have it or not,

915
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,110
it's not going to benefit you

916
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,670
if we broke up.

917
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,270
I...

918
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,150
Okay.

919
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,070
Get your hair done.

920
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:46,910
You took three hours

921
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,190
to set your hair.

922
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,670
Be nice.

923
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,110
You don't need me to send you?

924
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,750
No need.

925
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,190
I'll look for Xiao Shangqi.

926
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,830
It's different direction.

927
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,990
You're clingy.

928
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,830
How can you take

929
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,750
the long-distance relationship
in the future?

930
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,950
What long-distance relationship?

931
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,470
Didn't Shangqi tell you that

932
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,630
he's staying in Hupu?

933
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,870
I'm following Zhao Mingxuan.

934
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,390
I roughly know

935
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,750
how big the platform here is.

936
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,670
Xiao family is waiting for him

937
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,230
to run the show.

938
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,030
I'm sure you won't stop him.

939
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,910
It's none of your business

940
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,950
how our relationship is going to be.

941
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:27,950
Let's go.

942
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,830
He's so persistent?

943
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,550
Fine.

944
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,030
Get a good reason

945
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,670
and reject him.

946
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,750
Don't offend Mr. Gao.

947
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,550
I thought you'll ask me to stay.

948
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,670
It's your own choice
where you want to go.

949
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,390
It's been so many years.

950
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,550
For your brother

951
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,310
and me,

952
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,870
you've done a lot.

953
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,190
Maybe

954
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,030
talking about this now is
a bit too late,

955
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,870
but you've

956
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,990
made your own decision.

957
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,150
I support you.

958
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,470
As for Yunlan,

959
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,870
we don't have to rush it.

960
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:26,750
Take it slow.

961
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,630
Well,

962
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,030
your room is tidied up.

963
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,630
When you're in Hupu,

964
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,830
try to stay at home.

965
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,230
Got it.

966
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,070
I'm leaving now.

967
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,150
Mr. Xiao,

968
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,230
you're here to see us

969
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,950
despite your busy schedule.

970
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,230
Are you okay with that?

971
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,590
It's my bad

972
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,910
for not being able to host you well.

973
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,950
It's my problem.

974
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,070
We're afraid of that

975
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,390
so we asked you to come here.

976
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,910
They went to the night market

977
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,990
and bought many foods.

978
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,830
They asked us to come

979
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,710
and help them eat.

980
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,550
Why are you eyes

981
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,190
looking so tired?

982
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,590
I didn't notice just now.

983
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:51,670
Really?

984
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,470
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night.

985
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,670
So many dishes here.

986
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,990
Can we stop adding more?

987
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,430
What dishes are we adding?

988
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,070
Sweet.

989
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:06,950
Let's be serious.

990
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,150
Didn't we say we wanted

991
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,950
to stay overnight

992
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,070
at the scenic spot

993
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,390
on our way back?

994
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,430
Xiaoran and I have chosen

995
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,390
a homestay.

996
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,550
The homestay is nice.

997
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,670
It's hard to book it.

998
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,870
But after booking it,

999
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,750
it's hard to cancel it.

1000
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,550
So, shall we

1001
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,190
discuss about

1002
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,030
the date to go back

1003
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,830
and decide it?

1004
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,310
What do you think?

1005
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,390
Can you go back with us

1006
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,910
after the wedding?

1007
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,470
I think so.

1008
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,590
You think so?

1009
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:40,590
Can we

1010
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,550
or can't we?

1011
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,870
Tell us the exact answer.

1012
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,510
Well,

1013
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,750
I'll book the rooms,

1014
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:53,910
okay?
