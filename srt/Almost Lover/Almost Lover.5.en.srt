No.

Come on. What's the mission?

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,730
What mission?

22
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,450
Buy some snacks.

Talk to the owner.

25
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,410
He Xiaoran,

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,290
you like to bear grudges.

27
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,890
No, I just got to know

28
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,970
you didn't do that

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,530
just to

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,610
prank me.

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,090
I've been following you a few days

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,370
to amend the advertisement proposal

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,770
and try out new dishes.

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,010
Looking at how you've improved Jifeng

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,810
day by day,

36
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,170
I really admire you.

37
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,609
So, when you asked me about

38
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,450
the night market

39
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:16,329
that I frequent,

40
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,130
I knew

41
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,890
you must be doing

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,650
some market research again.

43
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,610
No.

44
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,370
I just want to eat something with you.

45
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,650
Here?

46
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,890
Didn't you think

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,970
snacks are not healthy?

48
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,050
Since I want to stay in

49
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,130
Wusu for good,

50
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,650
I need to know more about this city

51
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,250
and be part of this life.

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,050
You

53
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,170
are my only friend

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,970
here.

55
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,970
So,

56
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,730
I want to be part

57
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,690
of your life first,

58
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,690
is that okay?

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,250
Be part of my life?

60
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,530
Let's go.

61
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,730
Hurry.

62
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:00,721
(Tanghulu)

63
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,490
Your grilled fish belly.

64
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,490
I can eat

65
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,530
20 skewers on my own, try it.

66
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,810
Forget it. I...

67
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,210
Try it.

68
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,490
Forget it. I can't eat this.

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,210
I can't eat this.

70
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,330
Try it.

71
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,810
No, I can't eat this.

72
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,290
Try it.

73
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,450
What's wrong?

74
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,690
You're an adult.

75
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,810
How can you tear your pants?

76
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,410
There's a stall selling clothes there.

77
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,570
Go buy a new pair of pants.

78
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,050
No need.

79
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,810
This is okay.

80
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,050
Really?

81
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,610
This is Turkish style.

82
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,010
Do you like red-crowned crane?

83
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,690
I don't like red-crowned crane.

84
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,370
Black and white is trendy.

85
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,410
Xiaoran,

86
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,450
why do I feel like you're

87
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,369
teasing me?

88
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,530
Am I?

89
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,050
What about this?

90
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,050
I have no other choice?

91
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,090
No more.

92
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,090
There's a washroom there.

93
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,850
Go try.

94
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,770
I'll wait for you here.

95
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,330
Okay.

96
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,090
What?

97
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,410
It's ugly?

98
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,890
No.

99
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,290
This color

100
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,530
matches our

101
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,650
high school uniform.

102
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,250
It seems so.

103
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,170
Here. Thank you.

104
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,810
Xiaoran.

105
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,930
Hello, Sui.

106
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,770
You didn't bring your keys?

107
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,370
Hello.

108
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,450
Okay.

109
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,330
Okay.

110
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,210
Where did he go?

111
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,130
You've made the call?

112
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,650
Here. I bought two bottles of water.

113
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,810
What's wrong?

114
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,130
Sui forgot his keys again.

115
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm leaving now.

116
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,170
Xiaoran.

117
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,010
You left

118
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,490
Xiao Shangqi behind

119
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,210
alone

120
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,450
in his old-school uniform?

121
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,410
You're something else.

122
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,050
I don't know why.

123
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,810
When I saw him in that shirt,

124
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,650
opening up the bottle

125
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,810
and the soda bursting out,

126
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,450
I felt like

127
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,650
there was an explosion in my head.

128
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,090
It's like something

129
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,930
has exploded.

130
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,570
So dramatic?

131
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,970
So many years have passed.

132
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,170
You still can't handle him.

133
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,530
It shows that the problem is serious.

134
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,810
Right?

135
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,530
But he has mentioned that

136
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,450
I'm his only friend

137
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,370
in Wusu. A friend.

138
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,210
It's my own fault.

139
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,170
It's not.

140
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,530
Xiao Shangqi keeps asking you out

141
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,810
for work and personal reasons.

142
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,410
Frequently meeting each other

143
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,210
can create the illusion
of falling for each other.

144
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,290
Yes.

145
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,370
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,890
You meet Sui every day.

147
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,330
I don't see you
falling in love with him.

148
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,610
Sui is different.

149
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,010
He's my brother from other parents.

150
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,210
Coming!

151
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,530
Hello.

152
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,490
I'm the engineer from Jifeng Hotel.

153
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,850
Hello, please come in.

154
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,010
It's done.

155
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,370
What are you doing?

156
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:41,170
Sui Mingwei,

157
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,210
you can finally throw away

158
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,250
your house keys.

159
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,970
Why? The lock has been changed?

160
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,009
Mr. Xiao asked someone to send it here.

161
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,170
Exclusive from the hotel.

162
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,250
Besides password,

163
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,330
it can be monitored remotely

164
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,650
and it can open up the lock.

165
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,650
It's much better than

166
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,770
your keys.

167
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,690
Can the door lock

168
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,850
be changed as you like?

169
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,650
Is this safe?

170
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,890
You just agreed to that?

171
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,490
What if

172
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,930
he just moves in next?

173
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,410
Xiaoran,

174
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,410
do you think this gift is thoughtful

175
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,410
or it's used to express
his dissatisfaction

176
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,290
for being abandoned on the street?

177
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,145
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

178
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,250
How do you feel about

179
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,450
the two new dishes?

180
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,850
Not bad.

181
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,250
Actually, I'm not a professional.

182
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,050
I'm not sure

183
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,010
if my opinions on the new dishes

184
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,210
are useful or not.

185
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,730
Well,

186
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,890
thank you for the new lock.

187
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,210
But, three of us are living together.

188
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,370
Sui said it's better that

189
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,210
we split the bill.

190
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,610
As for the money I've transferred,

191
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,850
just take it.

192
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,290
Sui Mingwei?

193
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,810
You left in a hurry that night

194
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,930
because of him.

195
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,770
You care a lot about him.

196
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,490
He's my friend.

197
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,290
You left an old friend

198
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,330
who is not familiar

199
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,410
with the place

200
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,530
for a new local friend.

201
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,850
You're so mean.

202
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,050
No.

203
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,530
It's because...

204
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,650
Because of what?

205
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,810
Look.

206
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,450
That's the staff dormitory.

207
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,290
I'll take a look.

208
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,410
It's Morse code.

209
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,130
We played this in university.

210
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,490
Do you remember how to decode it?

211
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,930

Who are you looking for?

243
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,130
Who are you?

244
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,930
I'm Taiyang.

245
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,770
Did you use the torchlight

246
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,970
to send signal?

247
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,690
I was saying good night to father.

248
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,450
Father?

249
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,850
Don't you say "good night"
and "I love you"

250
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,210
to your father before you go to bed?

251
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,010
Look.

252
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,450
He's my father.

253
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,450
His work is busy every day.

254
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,490
He comes home late.

255
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,410
Really?

256
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,650
Do you stay here alone

257
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,450
every day waiting for him?

258
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,410
A lady from the hotel
is taking care of me.

259
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,130
She is busy today, so she didn't come.

260
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,650
Okay.

261
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,010
We're here just to make sure

262
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,090
you're safe.

263
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,610
Let's go, Xiaoran.

264
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,290
Please wait.

265
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,090
Can you stay and hang out with me?

266
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,890
I don't want to sleep.

267
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,090
Why does it sound so familiar?

268
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,530
Sui,

269
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,490
you used to be very straightforward

270
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,370
in pursuing girls.

271
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,690
Why are you so passive this time?

272
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,730
Let me make this clear.

273
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,050
My florist shop will support you fully.

274
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,090
You're the man.

275
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,610
Sui,

276
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,530
go to my place.

277
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,050
I've matched up many couples.

278
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,090
Yes.

279
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,370
The fengshui at your place is not bad.

280
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,010
But some people

281
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,850
might look okay

282
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,010
on the outside,

283
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,130
but why is she

284
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,250
eating for free here?

285
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,930
I hope you'll give up sooner.

286
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,690
The double arrows are so obvious,

287
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,890
but you didn't see them.

288
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,370
Stop eating if you want
to keep teasing me.

289
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,410
Sui,

290
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,090
let me give you an idea.

291
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,810
At work, you're colleagues,

292
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,570
right?

293
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,370
At home, you're housemates.

294
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,130
You see her day and night.

295
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,170
What are you afraid of?

296
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,170
Just do to her

297
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,490
what she did to you.

298
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,530
I won!

299
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,650
Hurry!

300
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,130
One point.

301
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,770
Two points.

302
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,250
Taiyang.

303
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,130
Father!

304
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,490
Mr. Xiao?

305
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,930
I'm leaving now.

306
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,850
I didn't know you're a single father.

307
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,610
Yes.

308
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,050
This is not something that

309
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,530
I need to report to my superior.

310
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,050
Also, you've been asking Miss He

311
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,490
to go out

312
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,530
for work purpose

313
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,490
which is not necessary.

314
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,210
I didn't ask about that.

315
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,530
(Xiao Shangqi,)

316
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,530

317
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,730

00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,480

319
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,090
He Xiaoran,

320
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,170
calm down.

321
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,410
We must have met each other

322
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,010
too frequently

323
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,770
that I'm having

324
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,010
this illusion.

325
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,050
Yes,

326
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,690
it's illusion.

327
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,330
It's illusion.

328
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,170
Be nice.

329
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
(Good night, I love you.)

330
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,490
Miss Zhou and I are thinking

331
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:21,530
to bring this to the next level.

332
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,010
I'm thinking that we can arrange

333
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,610
a trending topic

334
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,770
for every episode of the program

335
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,050
that people will discuss.

336
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,330
Gather the related content

337
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,090
for this topic

338
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,730
and express our attitude.

339
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,530
Can we invite some guests?

340
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,650
Sure.

341
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,930
Or

342
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,530
a lucky draw.

343
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,490
It can attract more audiences.

344
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,690
Sui Mingwei,

345
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,010
stop pretending.

346
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,610
Tell us about your ideas.

347
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,706

348

349
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,490

353
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,490
(I still have some works to do.
Maybe next time.)

354
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,480
(Xiao Shangqi After the program,
do you want to eat supper with me?)

355
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,800
(He Xiaoran I still have some works to do.
Maybe next time.)

356
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,690
Here, Lin's buns are ready to serve.

357
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,770
Come and eat some buns.

358
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,050
The filling is beef and scallions.

359
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,570
Just for sake of the buns
prepared by Mr. Lin

360
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,930
on every Friday,

361
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,490
I'm willing to work in Jifeng
for my entire life.

362
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,850
Stop it.

363
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,650
Well, Lin's buns are tasty.

364
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,810
Well, Mr. Lin,

365
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,850
we're not selling our hotel, right?

366
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,730
I can tell our guests

367
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,850
are increasing.

368
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,850
We're not selling.

369
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,690
Just work diligently.

370
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,730
The year end bonus

371
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,290
will be higher than last year's.

372
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,330
Finish the first one first.

373
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,970
Look.

374
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,810
Isn't that Miss He?

375
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,410
Mr. Xiao.

376
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,770
Mr. Xiao, why are you here?

377
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,690
All the staff on night shift

378
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,090
are up here.

379
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,850
Night shifts are tiring.

380
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,970
We're hungry

381
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,370
at this hour.

382
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,450
Mr. Lin's buns

383
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,330
are really tasty.

384
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,050
Do you want to try it?

385
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,690
(Hello, everyone.)

386
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,650
(This is the first livestream)

387
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,090
(of Dajiabang.)

388
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,530
(We just ended our program.)

389
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,610
(Were you guys listening?)

390
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,010
(You can interact with us)

391
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,090
(here.)

392
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,370
(By my side)

393
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,570
(is my colleague, Wei.)

394
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,730
(He'll tell you)

395
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,730
(some of our behind-the-scenes.)

396
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,210
(Hello, I'm Wei.)

397
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,810
(Do you want to know)

398
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,650
(some interesting matters)

399
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,730
(happened in the station?)

400
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,090
(I'll tell you.)

401
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,090
- So...
- So...

402
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,610
- To become a host...
- To become a...

403
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,010
Seems like we need to

404
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,170
practice more,

405
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,170
we've interrupted each other twice

406
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,570
within a minute.

407
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,410
Is there anything else that can

408
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,450
create more chemistry than this?

409
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,210
You can't say that.

410
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,290
I think

411
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,770
we work along well.

412
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,490
If we didn't work together,

413
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,330
I wouldn't have known

414
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,250
I can be so in sync

415
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,530
with a girl.

416
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,570
Stop it.

417
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,810
Even tango takes

418
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,650
two to dance.

419
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,410
Why not we discuss

420
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,530
before we talk next time?

421
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,970
Let's raise hand before we talk.

422
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,290
Or a hand sign.

423
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,170
No, it's too troublesome.

424
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,410
Why not like this?

425
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,130
If I interrupt you again,

426
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,570
I'll buy you a meal.

427
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,690
Audiences,

428
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,210
do I need someone to buy me a meal?

429
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,890
I need a job, okay?

430
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,090
They're so funny.

431
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,770
There's no chemistry at all.

432
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,050
Radio station hosts

433
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,490
should stay mysterious.

434
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,050
Right, Mr. Lin?

435
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,690
Yes.

436
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,970
But, Dajiabang

437
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,210
should be doing livestream

438
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,370
as the mission for the radio station.

439
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,050
Why not I ask Mr. Ma tomorrow?

440
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,730
Why are you so free?

441
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,890
Go back once you're done eating.

442
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,570
Not bad.

443
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,410
Both of them

444
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,650
have created the chemistry.

445
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,770
I didn't expect so many comments.

446
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,010
Let me read it out.

447
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,330
Before sleeping tonight,

448
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,770
I saw this livestream.

449
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,410
I was attracted

450
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,450
by this new weird couple.

451
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,530
There's more.

452
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,770
The daily teasing between them

453
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,610
is too funny. I love it.

454
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,770
I hope you two

455
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,490
will share more about your daily life

456
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,650
online.

457
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,130
I wish to see

458
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,730
Weihe Couple's livestream tomorrow.

459
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,810
Weihe Couple?

460
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,570
Not many people talked

461
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,850
about our show.

462
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,930
Mr. He,

463
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,250
you don't understand.

464
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,450
The netizens now

465
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,850
like to see couples.

466
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,490
It's happier than actual dating.

467
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,410
Why?

468
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,370
Low risk, low cost,

469
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,650
and no need to get involved

470
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,170
in the dating.

471
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,690
This kind of fans

472
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,330
are called couple fans.

473
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,490
Couple fans.

474
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,650
Xiaoran, what do you think?

475
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,490
Showing off.

476
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:39,468
(A full frame of pink bubbles.)
(Looks good! Are they new partners?)

477
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,609
(Are they a couple?)

478
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,050
(There's always a new couple.)

479
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,570
(They're a match made in heaven.)

480
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,570
(A full frame of)

481
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,290
(pink bubbles)

482
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,810
(is overflowing.)

483
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,410
Hello, everyone.

484
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,930
This is the pantry

485
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,690
in our station.

486
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,650
Normally, we'll be here

487
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,850
to talk and bluff.

488
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,410
We tease our boss here, right?

489
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,170
I've never done that.

490
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,770
Actually, I'd like to

491
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,970
introduce the food in our station

492
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,850
- (Even having a meal and)
- to all of you today.

493
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,530
- (a milk tea is same style.)
- Today,

494
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,290
this is the lunch in our canteen.

495
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,810
(Do they really need to be)

496
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,650
(so in sync?)

497
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,530
(It's egg custard in the middle.)

498
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,290
(There's also egg dumpling.)

499
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,650
(Strongly recommend the two hosts)

500
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,290
(to share more on their daily lives.)

501
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,370
(The rice in our station)

502
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,290
(is the best.)

503
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,170
(It's sticky, sweet and fragrant.)

504
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,010
(If you're free,)

505
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,050
(you can come and try it out.)

506
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,690
Sui, hurry.

507
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,850
Why are you here?

508
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,370
It's not easy to meet you,

509
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,530
Miss He.

510
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,850
We've been doing livestream lately.

511
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,690
I'm rather busy.

512
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,050
I watched it.

513
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,450
Did you?

514
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,890
What do you think?

515
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,050
Our audiences are engaged

516
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,930
with our discussion.

517
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,970
Do you want to join us?

518
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,370
Let's go to another place to talk.

519
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,170
Today, I have...

520
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,050
Today, she has something on.

521
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,210
It's about work.

522
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,210
Well, it speaks the same for us.

523
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,570
We're going to do livestream

524
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,250
at the forest park.

525
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,090
Yes, it's requested by the audiences.

526
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,210
The team leader asked us to

527
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,970
keep the momentum
and increase the exposure.

528
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,610
I'll go with you.

529
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,650
Let's rent a bicycle.

530
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,130
A bicycle?

531
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,810
It's a huge place.

532
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,770
Riding a bicycle

533
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,370
is faster.

534
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,170
I'm not in a hurry.

535
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,450
You don't know how to cycle?

536
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,370
Come on.

537
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,570
I know how to handle any of the wheels.

538
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:34,650
Sir,

539
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,090
we'd like to rent three bicycles.

540
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,410
I'm sorry, miss.

541
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,050
We only have

542
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,130
one left.

543
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,730
The rest has been booked

544
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,770
by a company.

545
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,130
That's unfortunate.

546
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,050
I think we can just walk.

547
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,930
It's the same.

548
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,210
I'm familiar with this place.

549
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,610
I can find the best view.

550
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,370
We have other vehicles.

551
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,570
Why not we play rock paper scissors?

552
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,810
The winner will cycle alone.

553
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,810
I can't ride this well.

554
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,170
Why not you ride with me?

555
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,210
We can nurture

556
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,370
our mutual understanding.

557
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,410
I don't need to cycle alone.

558
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,970
I'm too good at it.

559
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,650
You might not be able
to catch up with me.

560
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,250
So, you both don't want to

561
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,530
cycle on your own, right?

562
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,690
Great.

563
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,570
I'll take it.

564
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,570
Bye. Let's go.

565
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,690
He Xiaoran!

566
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,530
You like her?

567
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,730
Surprised?

568
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,010
Didn't you stay here

569
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,330
for her?

570
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,210
But, you're late.

571
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,530
Not too late.

572
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,130
Enough.

573
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,970
I know you two were classmates
in high school.

574
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,450
You were together for six, seven years.

575
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,410
Where have you been?

576
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,370
No one will stay and wait for you.

577
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,970
I'll pursue her.

578
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,690
Fine.

579
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,330
Let's see who is more capable.

580
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,770
Can you ride harder?

581
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,570
Are you even a man?

582
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,690
You can't even hold the handle!

583
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,290
I don't need you to teach me!

584
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,250
Slow down!

585
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,090
Slow down!

586
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,370
Can you be more stable?

587
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,370
He Xiaoran,

588
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,530
don't ride so fast!

589
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,930
Wait for us!

590
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,450
Hurry up, both of you.

591
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,090
I'll speed up.

592
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,450
Wait for you there.

593
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,210
Come on.

594
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,010
Don't let her look down on us.

595
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,850
Hurry.

596
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,330
Slow down.

597
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,090
Slow down a little.

598
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,650
You can't take the speed?

599
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,570
Do you know I...

600
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,170
Watch out!

601
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,850
I told you to slow down.

602
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,610
Be gentle.

603
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,610
Don't you know how to cycle?

604
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,090
I wouldn't have fallen

605
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,090
if it's not for the two people.

606
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,370
Yes, it's all others' fault.

607
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,370
You'll never fall on your own.

608
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,050
You were shaking at the back.

609
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,410
That's why we fell badly.

610
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,090
Yes, it's my bad.

611
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,090
Enough.

612
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,890
You two fell down

613
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,210
and you're still arguing.

614
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,450
Be careful.

615
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,730
Don't touch water today.

616
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,410
Won't you help me?

617
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,570
Turn around.

618
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,050
Turn around.

619
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,050
It hurts.

620
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,890
It hurts?

621
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,450
It hurts?

622
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,450
Paste this.

623
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,770
It's done.

624
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,770
Otherwise, the wound is healed.

625
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,890
Quite accurately pasted.

626
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,530
Is that okay?

627
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,450
Come over a bit more.

628
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,170
This background is not nice.

629
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,450
Come to this side.

630
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,210
- Come.
- This side.

631
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,410
- Come to this side.
- Here?

632
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,050
Here?

633
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,090
Stay away from her.

634
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,570
Otherwise, the structure is weird.

635
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,610
No one is asking you to take the video.

636
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,250
Just putting it here will do.

637
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,050
Livestream is about the content.

638
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,290
Audiences don't care about others.

639
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,850
I care.

640
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,370
Xiaoran, come here.

641
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,730
I have something to tell you.

642
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,450
The sky is going darker.

643
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,010
We'll talk after the livestream, okay?

644
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,610
He Xiaoran,

645
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,330
do you know what you're doing?

646
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,490
Have you read

647
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,570
all the comments on the platform?

648
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,570
Is this the work matter

649
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,490
that you wanted to speak to me?

650
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,530
I know.

651
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,730
Many of the comments

652
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,930
are about us as a couple,

653
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,330
but there are many audiences

654
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,850
who like our show, too.

655
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,450
They're interacting with us

656
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,170
and they've provided a lot

657
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,530
of materials and topics for us.

658
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,450
I think it's great.

659
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,730
I don't care about other things.

660
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,210
I do.

661
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,770
What are you trying to say?

662
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,650
Okay, Xiaoran, leave him alone.

663
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:37,730
We'll start the livestream.

664
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,610
Sui Mingwei!

665
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,250
You made her think that

666
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,730
your livestream is popular

667
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,890
and that you're busy for a good reason.

668
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,450
Is this all you got?

669
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,610
What do you mean?

670
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,810
I've asked someone to analyze

671
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,770
the users.

672
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,250
Actually, the comments are

673
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,850
not that many.

674
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,610
The users changed their IDs
and usernames frequently

675
00:29:59,210 --> 00:29:59,890
to pretend like there are many of them.

676
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,970
It's fake.

677
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,410
Why did they do that?

678
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,330
Ask him.

679
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,770
I did it.

680
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,930
The comments were all

681
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,130
made by my friends.

682
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,050
Xiao Shangqi,

683
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,410
so you've been waiting for this?

684
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,970
Since then,

685
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,130
I'll be frank.

686
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,450
Xiaoran.

687
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,410
Let's go back first.

688
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,250
Xiaoran.

689
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,450
Xiao Shangqi, I'm sorry.

690
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,170
This is the internal matter

691
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,090
of Dajiabang.

692
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,690
I'll get to the bottom of the matter

693
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,690
and get back to you.

694
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,090
Listen, I don't need your

695
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,370
explanation.

696
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,330
You have to

697
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,490
because it's related to

698
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,450
our show

699
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,490
and the audiences' reputation.

700
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,810
Let's go.

701
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,490
Xiaoran!

702
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,330
Give it to me.

703
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,170
In our recent programs,

704
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,370
there were 100 over comments.

705
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,650
How many of them were
made by your friends?

706
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,370
Eight or nine of them.

707
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,850
Each one of them
made around 10 comments.

708
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,610
Some were made by

709
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,490
their friends.

710
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,250
It means our program

711
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,530
didn't get much attention.

712
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,930
Why did you do that?

713
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,050
I wanted to wear couple shirts with you.

714
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,930
I'm talking nicely to you.

715
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,970
We have to hype things up first.

716
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,410
Why not we

717
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,490
just start dating?

718
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,490
After all, we're happy

719
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,570
going out together.

720
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,570
Let's stop the livestream.

721
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,370
We didn't get much attention after all.

722
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,490
It's meaningless.

723
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,090
You were thinking about this?

724
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,770
Enough, I know you're doing this

725
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,370
for Dajiabang.

726
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,330
I won't tell others about this.

727
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,690
I'll just say

728
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,010
I don't want to use this method

729
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,290
to increase the viewership.

730
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:24,370
(Wusu Radio & TV Group)

731
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,130
Have you heard of

732
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,370
He Xiaoran and Jifeng's

733
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,210
Mr. Xiao's relationship?

734
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,370
Of course.

735
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,730
Dajiabang was stopped

736
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,210
because Mr. Xiao was not happy about it.

737
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,410
Also, the livestream at the forest park

738
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,050
few days back

739
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,490
was cancelled

740
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,010
because Mr. Xiao went there.

741
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,850
No wonder they got such a huge discount

742
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,050
for the open tendering.

743
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,930
He Xiaoran is something else.

744
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,050
I also heard that a fan

745
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,330
wanted to jump off the bridge

746
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,410
and Mr. Xiao sent him

747
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,810
away from Wusu.

748
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:50,730
I've recorded

749
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,010
what you said.

750
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:52,850
Defamation

751
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,290
is a crime.

752
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,570
What?

753
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,890
You dare not admit it?

754
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,930
What do you mean?

755
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,570
Forget it.

756
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,170
What do you mean what I mean?

757
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,730
Let's go.

758
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,770
Did you hear that?

759
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,130
Or did you see that?

760
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,410
Why are you doing this?

761
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,650
Enough.

762
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,890
Just let her say what she wants.

763
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,010
I don't care.

764
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,810
You don't care?

765
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,770
Why are you avoiding Xiao Shangqi

766
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,530
then?

767
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,890
He came here twice

768
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,650
and you gave excuses to leave.

769
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,170
Everyone can tell that.

770
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,970
I...

771
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,250
I'm...

772
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,490
What?

773
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,970
I'm guilty.

774
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,170
If that time

775
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,730
the way he was wearing
the sports attire

776
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,810
made me feel like

777
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,010
I'm in love again,

778
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,570
after so many days,

779
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,970
I should be fine by now,

780
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,730
but why am I

781
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,970
still feeling the same?

782
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,370
He Xiaoran,

783
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,010
you're so not He Xiaoran.

784
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,850
I've told you about

785
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,370
what happened to us.

786
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,490
Actually, for us to have met again,

787
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,250
although it's torturing,

788
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,170
I really treasure

789
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,210
this lost and found friendship.

790
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,250
But, no matter how much
you treasure the friendship,

791
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,690
it's not an excuse for you to

792
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,770
deny that you love him.

793
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,009
I think

794
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,009
since you haven't met him
for many years,

795
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,049
this guy who made you fall in love again

796
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,690
is a brand new guy.

797
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,009
Also, before him,

798
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,250
you're not the same.

799
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,250
Why do you think

800
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,770
it's the same as before?

801
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,370
I don't know.

802
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:42,210
During that eight years' time
of loving him,

803
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:43,770
I

804
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,049
dared not speak or ask.

805
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,890
I used "friends" as an excuse

806
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,930
to numb and hide myself,

807
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:52,569
but I know

808
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,890
real friends are

809
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,890
like you and Sui.

810
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,970
There's nothing you can't say.

811
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,370
There's nothing you can't ask.

812
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,610
Do you want to live the next eight years

813
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,330
not knowing what to do?

(I'm waiting for you downstairs.)

816
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,490
We need to interfere.

817
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,930
I hate this.

818
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,290
It affects my work.

819
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,810
Yes.

820
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,450
It's not comfortable

821
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,650
for anyone.

822
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,890
I can understand.

823
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,970
Mr. Xiao, I'll go over now.

824
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:38,970
Okay.

825
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,250
Xiaoran.

826
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,330
Mr. Ma.

827
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,850
Don't care about the rumors.

828
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,610
I'll handle it.

829
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,570
Thank you.

830
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:03,970
Where are you going?

831
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,090
I'm going home.

832
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,410
Xiaoran!

833
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,850
What's going on with you?

834
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,090
Why do you keep avoiding me?

835
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:20,970
Xiao Shangqi,

836
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,370
if you hate those rumors

837
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,130
and hate having anything to do with me,

838
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,490
please mind your own

839
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,290
manner and

840
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,530
keep a distance from me.

841
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,130
I'm sorry to have

842
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,370
caused you trouble,

843
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,530
but your action,

844
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,810
your care for me,

845
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,770
and you said you want
to be part of my life.

846
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,490
Don't you think what you did

847
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,490
is going to

848
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,610
cause misunderstanding?

849
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,370
It's not misunderstanding.

850
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,650
What's it then?

851
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,170
I hate those rumors

852
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,570
because our relationship

853
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,050
is not complicated.

854

855
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,370
I love you.

Hello, please come in.

857

You're back.

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,210
Today, Hao gave me

859
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,050
a few bottles of good beer.

We'll have hot pot tonight.

What's going on?

You came home with that face.

866
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,290
Have you made it clear to him?

867
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,250
I didn't get to speak

868
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,850
and I heard him say

869
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,570
he hates the rumor about he and I.

870
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,490
No, if he hates it, don't come back.

871
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,770
Don't be friends with me.

872
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,690
I'm upset with myself.

873
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,370
He wanted to be his good friend,

874
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,010
but I fell in love with him.

875
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,730
I thought it's over,

876
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,890
but it's not.

877
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,130
It's still the same.

878
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,330
What do you plan to do now?

879
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,130
Stop loss and retreat.

880
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,530
I'll just kill the spark of love

881
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,090
again.

882
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,250
I'm experienced.

883
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:01,078
(He Xiaoran)

884
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,570
If you hate those rumors

885
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,330
and hate having anything to do with me,

886
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,730
please mind your own

887
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,410
manner and

888
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,650
keep a distance from me.

889
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,170
(I confessed but she didn't respond.)

890
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,250
(What's going on?)

891
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,960
(There is no response after confessed.)

892
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,330
(A few possibilities.)

893
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,370
(First, think twice.)

894
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,170
(Think about)

895
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,370
(her response towards you.)

896
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,930
(If it's cold,)

897
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,410
(maybe she's looking for a chance)

898
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,250
(to reject you in a nice way.)

899
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,330
You're up?

900
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,770
Sit down.

901
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,370
The apology meal.

902
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,290
Well,

903
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,450
I was wrong for

904
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,170
making up the couple match-up.

905
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,530
I'll make it up to you from now on.

906
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,610
Thank you.

907
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,650
What happened to your throat?

908
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,050
I'm not feeling well.

909
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,010
We have to go on air tonight.

910
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,850
I'm sincere, but you're not blessed.

911
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,890
Well, you...

912
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,690
You eat something plain.

913
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,610
Eat something plain.

914
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,570
Where's Li Hui?

915
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,290
She's working.

916
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,570
Let's leave together later.

917
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,290
Motorcycle makes me dizzy.
Let's take a bus.

918
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,890
Are you saying my speedy,

919
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,170
stable motorcycle is making you dizzy?

920
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,530
It's time to change it.

921
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,890
I feel that it's making me dizzy, too.

922
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,370
Drink more.

923
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,410
Drinking more will do.

924
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,290
(What do I do)

925
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,690
(if she rejects my confession?)

926
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,410
(Trying to test her response)

927
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,010
(is easy.)

928
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,170
(Is she interacting with you)

929
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:52,930
(on your Moment?)

930
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,610
(If not,)

931
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,330
(think about whether your content)

932
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,530
(is hard to be engaged with or not.)

933
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,210
(Instead of keeping pursing her,)

934
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,970
(post something interesting on
your Moment)

935
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,730
(and try to have a common topic.)

936
00:42:12,342 --> 00:42:13,959
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Has everyone taken breakfast?)

937
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,730
Sui told me that

938
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,410
your throat is not well.

939
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,730
I didn't know

940
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,170
Baidu and my rumors

941
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,330
make him so happy.

942
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,850
A guy who never posted on Moment

943
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,530
posted twice in the morning.

944
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,850
Mo.

945
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,970
Did you see my Moment?

946
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,370
Let me check now.

947
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,450
You're talking about this?

948
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,610
I saw it in the morning.

949
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,330
Why didn't you click like?

950
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,660
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Has everyone taken breakfast?)

951
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,570
Are you collecting likes now?

952
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:53,730
You have to tell me.

953
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,650
Otherwise, we won't know.

954
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,650
What collecting likes?

955
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:57,610
Are you not?

956
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,650
You're quite smart.

957
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,450
Don't use your phone at work.
