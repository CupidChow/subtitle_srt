17
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:42,554
Just take this as a work trip,

18
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:43,514
okay?

19
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:44,634
Come back and help us

20
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:45,714
to share the burden.

21
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:46,714
Also, think about it.

22
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,514
Maybe once you show yourself,

23
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:49,514
the rumor

24
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:50,754
will end by itself,

25
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:52,994
right?

26
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:23,714
Are you doing a photo wall?

27
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:24,834
Yes.

28
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:27,674
Didn't you say the wall seemed empty?

29
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,794
So I want to give you a present.

30
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:30,754
I've printed the photos

31
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:31,674
in the phone.

32
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,034
This was

33
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:41,874
taken in the woods of Linglong Mountain,

34
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:42,634
right?

35
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:43,194
Right.

36
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:45,394
It looks great.

37
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,314
You look great.

38
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:48,274
So it looks great.

39
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:51,914
This is the homestay.

40
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:53,754
Yes, it's the homestay.

41
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:57,914
Don't just admire them.

42
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,274
Come on, help me to stick

43
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:00,314
these two.

44
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:00,634
Okay.

45
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,434
Why are you smiling?

46
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:08,634
Nothing.

47
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,114
I just think the both of us

48
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,514
think alike.

49
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:15,954
Although we've

50
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:16,994
just got together,

51
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:17,714
we already

52
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:18,954
have so many memories.

53
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,154
There will be more.

54
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:24,874
Well...

55
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:25,634
- Next week...
- Next week...

56
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:28,954
You go ahead first.

57
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:31,954
Xiaoran.

58
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:34,354
Next week, I might need
to go back to Hupu

59
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:35,354
with my brother.

60
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:48,114
We run out of photos.

61
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,034
Forget it, that's it.

62
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,514
I'm going back to Hupu next week.

63
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:56,834
Aren't you asking me

64
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:57,634
why I'm going there

65
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:58,754
and where I'm coming back?

66
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,114
Hupu is not far.

67
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:02,234
How long can you be gone?

68
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,794
Do you have to pack up?

69
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,594
Do you need a big luggage

70
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:06,914
or a small one?

71
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,754
I'll check the weather for you.

72
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:10,794
Do you need to buy

73
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,314
Wusu specialities and bring them back?

74
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,034
It's okay, I'll help you to pack up.

75
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,874
I'll get a small luggage for you.

76
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,914
When the things run out,

77
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:36,834
it'll remind you

78
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:37,994
that it's time to come back,

79
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:39,034
understand?

80
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,274
Hupu has everything.

81
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,754
You can just buy anything.

82
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:00,674
Before the battery runs out,

83
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:01,714
you should be back.

84
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,034
I don't think you need a charger.

85
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:10,834
What's he keeping in here?

86
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:50,234
970331.

87
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:04,394
He Xiaoran,

88
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:05,514
what are you doing?

89
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,874
These projects

90
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,754
are the key projects.

91
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:37,714
Just decide on your own.

92
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,754
Also, the contact with the major clients

93
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:40,954
should not stop.

94
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,114
We'll have a meeting tonight.

95
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:43,914
Wait.

96
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:45,114
You've told me

97
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,114
everything clearly.

98
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,434
Don't just waste your time

99
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:48,314
with us tonight.

100
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,794
Go back and accompany your girlfriend.

101
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:52,714
I want to arrange

102
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,554
the assessment for Jifeng
in the next quarter.

103
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:55,114
Mr. Xiao.

104
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,554
You'll be back in the next quarter.

105
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,074
You don't have to plan it so early.

106
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:07,154
Xiaoran has something on tonight.

107
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:08,954
She's having a meal with Dajiabang

108
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:10,834
at the attic.

109
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,874
So you'll be alone then.

110
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:16,714
Don't you think

111
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:17,714
she's strange?

112
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,194
She's strange? What do you mean?

113
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:21,074
Tell me.

114
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,434
If not, I'll go now.

115
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:28,874
I'm about to go back to Hupu,

116
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,234
but she's not responding at all.

117
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:31,634
She's not asking about it either.

118
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,114
How should she react?

119
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:35,874
Should she throw a tantrum?

120
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:38,314
We just got together.

121
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:39,434
It's normal

122
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:40,834
to feel reluctant to part
with each other, right?

123
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:44,034
She didn't do anything at all?

124
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:45,074
Do anything?

125
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:48,514
She insisted on packing my luggage,

126
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:51,714
checking the weather and buying
specialities. Do these count?

127
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,154
This is indeed strange.

128
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:56,714
Love bubble shouldn't

129
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,114
end so quickly.

130
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:00,594
You know what?

131
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,034
Don't think too much.

132
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,314
Think

133
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:03,874
from the bright side.

134
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:05,914
She's understanding.

135
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,314
It's a rare virtue.

136
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:10,954
If I were you, I'd have
picked her up soon

137
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:12,554
instead of wasting time.

138
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:14,514
I'm going.

139
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:19,074
To be honest,

140
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,234
if you bump into your
ex-girlfriend at a reunion,

141
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,274
would you be tempted?

142
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:26,354
Yes!

143
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:27,834
You're a bad boy. Drink.

144
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:31,914
I pick Dare, didn't I?

145
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:34,834
I'll drink with you.

146
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:40,594
He!

147
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:44,154
Have you ever contacted

148
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,834
another woman you love
behind your wife's back?

149
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,594
Come on,

150
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,074
this is not right.

151
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:51,994
Do you expect me

152
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:53,434
to make a mistake?

153
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:54,354
That means

154
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:54,954
you have another woman you love.

155
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,434
You're cheating on her
psychologically, you know?

156
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:57,034
Drink.

157
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:58,074
Don't ever think about her again.

158
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:00,834
What do you mean?

159
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,554
Tell me. Would
someone you fail to attain

160
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:05,514
remain unforgettable?

161
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,434
Is it true?

162
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,234
I'll just drink with you.

163
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:19,154
What are you up to?

164
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:21,354
Are you punishing the bad boys?

165
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,074
Did I talk to you

166
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:25,234
for nothing two days ago?

167
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:40,394
What is this?

168
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:46,314
I found this in his luggage

169
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:48,314
when I was packing up for him.

170
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,834
Is this Chen Fei'er's bracelet?

171
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:56,634
It's his own.

172
00:10:58,514 --> 00:10:59,714
It's given to him by Chen Fei'er.

173
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:02,234
Is Xiao Shangqi still keeping

174
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,554
Chen Fei'er's gift for him?

175
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:06,754
Chen Fei'er

176
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,074
had also given me one.

177
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,034
I still keep it, too.

178
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:11,754
Back then, the three of us

179
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:13,594
were known collectively

180
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:15,634
as the Iron Triangle.

181
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,074
Stupid girl.

182
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,274
You ran here to play.

183
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:27,594
What did I tell you?

184
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,034
I told you to look after your brother.

185
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,114
I told you to do so.

186
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,634
Your brother broke his leg.

187
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:32,554
How are you going to explain yourself?

188
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,554
You're unhappy

189
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:35,754
when I call you a
"money-losing product".

190
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,314
That's what you are.

191
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,394
You only play mahjong

192
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:40,674
and leave him to me all the time.

193
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,314
He's not my son, okay?

194
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:45,514
How dare you talk back
in front of the outsiders.

195
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:46,834
I'll hit you.

196
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:49,554
Let's go.

197
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:51,874
Brats!

198
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:52,954
Can you three

199
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:53,794
stick together forever?

200
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,434
Don't ever come home!

201
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,314
Your parents treat you badly.

202
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:16,314
What can I do

203
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:16,994
to help you?

204
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,114
You can't help me.

205
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:23,274
I can only rely on myself.

206
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,354
What about Xiao Shangqi?

207
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:30,554
Xiao Shangqi?

208
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:33,874
Wait until

209
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,594
he becomes a reliable and strong man.

210
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:37,634
Then perhaps he can do something.

211
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:38,954
Let's not talk about this.

212
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:40,834
You know what?

213
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,474
The three of us have a nickname.

214
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:43,714
What is it?

215
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,674
The Iron Triangle.

216
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,594
Isn't it interesting?

217
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,114
A triangle

218
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,634
is the strongest shape.

219
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,874
Xiao Shangqi is considered

220
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,794
a reliable and strong man now, isn't he?

221
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,794
Isn't he reliable and strong?

222
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,354
He is.

223
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,794
However, this strong and reliable man

224
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,514
is returning to Hupu.

225
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:30,914
He's going on a business trip.

226
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,114
I don't know when he's coming back.

227
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:40,794
If you can't bear to part with him,

228
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:42,914
just tell him.

229
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:46,594
Come on, stop drinking. Go home.

230
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:50,554
I just don't know

231
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:52,394
what's wrong.

232
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:55,394
I just

233
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,074
don't know

234
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,634
how it ended up that way.

235
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:02,674
That day, I almost

236
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,034
checked his phone.

237
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:06,994
It's unlike me, right?

238
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,234
I usually don't do that.

239
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:13,234
However, you know what?

240
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:19,594
When I think about how
he's going back to Hupu,

241
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,354
I have this bad feeling.

242
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:39,154
Could Xiao Shangqi be

243
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:41,994
the 99% of men?

244
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,634
He can't forget about

245
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,114
the love he can't own,

246
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,394
so he treasures it?

247
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,860
(Xiao Shangqi)

248
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:31,674
Coming.

249
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,714
Are you on a rocket?
You arrived so soon.

250
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:38,354
Come on.

251
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:39,394
Why is she so drunk?

252
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,354
She drank with three people.

253
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,554
She drank the three guys

254
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:43,634
under the table.

255
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:44,754
Thanks.

256
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:46,954
Wait.

257
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:51,714
Sometimes, when a girl
doesn't mean what she says,

258
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,314
that means she cares about you.

259
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:54,674
Do you understand?

260
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,194
So you should give her

261
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:56,874
a sense of security.

262
00:15:58,714 --> 00:15:59,114
Okay.

263
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:03,034
Okay. Slow down.

264
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:08,634
Why are you so drunk?

265
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:14,474
Where are we going?

266
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:15,474
Home.

267
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,154
No, I don't want to go home.

268
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,554
I want to take a walk.

269
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:20,754
What?

270
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:21,794
You can't even stand straight.

271
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:22,434
How can you take a walk?

272
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:23,634
I can stand straight!

273
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:25,594
I can walk on my own.

274
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:29,994
He Xiaoran.

275
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:33,274
Sober up.

276
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,074
I want to take a walk!

277
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,914
Seriously, how did you get so drunk?

278
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:43,954
Stand straight!

279
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,674
Stand straight and walk properly.

280
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,674
I'm walking.

281
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:48,714
You bump into someone.

282
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,034
I'm walking.

283
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:50,394
Okay.

284
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:51,434
I know.

285
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:52,434
Slow down.

286
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,434
Walk a straight line, okay?

287
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:54,754
Walk a straight line.

288
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,314
Come on, go forward.

289
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:58,434
Okay.

290
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:01,394
Hello.

291
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,114
He's Xiao Shangqi. He's handsome, right?

292
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:06,594
Slow down.

293
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:11,433
Xiaoran.

294
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:12,354
Xiao Shangqi!

295
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:28,154
Slow down.

296
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:29,274
Don't move.

297
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:30,714
I'm not moving.

298
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:34,754
Don't move. Don't you dare to move!

299
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:35,914
I'm not moving.

300
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,554
I want to take a photo.

301
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,474
It's beautiful here.

302
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:42,074
I want to take more photos.

303
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:45,234
Stand straight! Don't fall down.

304
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,874
I'm standing straight.

305
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:49,554
Strike a pose.

306
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,634
Strike a flower pose.

307
00:17:58,154 --> 00:17:58,514
Is it okay?

308
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:04,354
Is it okay?

309
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,634
Do another one. The heart.

310
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:16,234
Slow down.

311
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:17,194
Where's Xiao Shangqi?

312
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,034
Xiao Shangqi is missing.

313
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:22,914
You don't know how to strike a pose.

314
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:25,434
Even the camera is ignoring you.

315
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,834
Aren't you taking photos?

316
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:30,834
I'll teach you. You should...

317
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:33,954
He Xiaoran.

318
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,354
Why did you get so drunk?

319
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:38,234
I was happy.

320
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,194
I'm a reporter now.

321
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,274
We're so close.

322
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:45,634
You know what?

323
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,714
A reporter exposes

324
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,554
all the bad

325
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,914
and unfair things in the world.

326
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:55,874
Report the news.

327
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,274
After you go to Hupu,

328
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,874
if you ignore

329
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,754
or mistreat me,

330
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:05,274
I'll expose you.

331
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:07,714
You'll make the headlines.
Aren't you scared?

332
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:09,274
Fine.

333
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,274
Feel free to expose it.

334
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,194
So you care so much about me.

335
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:26,554
What are you doing?
I'm not done taking photos.

336
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:27,474
What are you taking?

337
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:28,194
Take...

338
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:28,834
Follow me home.

339
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:30,114
You can do whatever you want at home.

340
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:31,914
I'm not done yet.

341
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,194
Stop it. Come here next time.

342
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,474
(You're the world!)
Next time? When?

343
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:37,638
(You're the world!)

344
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:39,434
Will I still have a chance?

345
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,794
Yes, you'll have plenty of chances.

346
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:42,674
Of course not.

347
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:49,834
Tell me.

348
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:51,754
You drink so much every time.

349
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:53,194
Don't you know

350
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:54,194
how much you can drink?

351
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:58,314
Xiao Shangqi.

352
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,394
Can you not go?

353
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:37,234
It's past 11 am.

354
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,434
I knew he's leaving today,

355
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:08,154
yet I drank so much yesterday.

356
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:14,834
I've kept you two for nothing.

357
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:16,594
You didn't even tell me he's leaving.

358
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:17,514
You should've stopped him.

359
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,354
Even if you couldn't stop him,

360
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:19,474
you should've at least made a sound

361
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:20,354
and woken me up.

362
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,194
You're even laughing.

363
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,554
How can you laugh?

364
00:22:30,994 --> 00:22:32,354
I claimed that I didn't mind,

365
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:33,714
but how could he leave

366
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:34,634
without telling me?

367
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:36,274
He didn't even leave a note

368
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:37,394
nor a message.

369
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:40,594
What?

370
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:43,314
Are you blaming me for getting drunk

371
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:44,274
and not giving him a chance?

372
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:45,314
He should've at least told me

373
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:46,754
when he's coming back.

374
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,434
What do you think?

375
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:50,994
He claimed that he liked Wusu

376
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:52,754
and it felt like home.

377
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,114
However, when his brother asked him,

378
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:56,034
he left without hesitation.

379
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:57,634
He should've at least told me

380
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,834
when he's coming back.

381
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:00,794
What do you think?

382
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:02,034
I don't care!

383
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:04,314
Find him for me.

384
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,834
Find him for me.

385
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:06,554
Go.

386
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:07,114
Go.

387
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:09,394
Find him for me now.

388
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:33,634
You're sober, weren't you?

389
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,994
Come on, have some plain food.

390
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:39,234
Didn't you leave?

391
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:40,914
If I did, the pig

392
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:42,034
would've been dead.

393
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,954
So the pig is more important than me.

394
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,594
You stayed because of it.

395
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,794
I stayed for another pig,

396
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:51,674
you.

397
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,460
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

398
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:07,074
Go back. I'll go on
the day after tomorrow.

399
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:11,674
What are you up to this time?

400
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:13,514
I won't stand you up.

401
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,674
Fine, whatever.

402
00:24:19,994 --> 00:24:20,634
Just make sure

403
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,034
I can answer to father.

404
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,040
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

405
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,313
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

406
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:34,834
Do you think

407
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:37,754
I'm petty and pretentious?

408
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:40,594
I messed up when I was drunk.

409
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:41,514
I'll never drink again.

410
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:42,794
Again?

411
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:47,234
However, alcohol

412
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:48,074
was not the problem.

413
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,074
I didn't say it clearly.

414
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:54,634
My father asked me to go back,

415
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:56,714
as there's a new six-star hotel

416
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,154
in Hupu.

417
00:24:58,674 --> 00:24:59,474
As a hotel management company,

418
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:00,994
our family

419
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,514
cares a lot about this project.

420
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,474
I returned to China

421
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:05,954
as my father hoped

422
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,194
that I could assist him in Yunlan.

423
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:11,594
Rest assured.

424
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:13,874
I've long decided

425
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:14,634
to stay in Wusu.

426
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:16,714
The opening ceremony is a big deal.

427
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:18,394
I need to go back and help out.

428
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,274
As for how long it'll take,

429
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:21,354
I'm not sure yet.

430
00:25:22,674 --> 00:25:23,514
I promise you

431
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:25,154
I'll be back as soon as possible.

432
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:28,714
All right.

433
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:31,434
I've told you about the business trip.

434
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:33,874
Let's talk

435
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:35,274
about other stuff.

436
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:37,874
Other stuff?

437
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:47,514
This bracelet is mine.

438
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:49,474
Where did you find it?

439
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:55,754
It's in the luggage.

440
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:58,474
Actually, there's

441
00:25:58,634 --> 00:25:59,514
nothing to explain about this.

442
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:01,634
I indeed didn't throw it away.

443
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:04,074
I don't think you've
thrown yours away, too.

444
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:07,434
However, I didn't remember

445
00:26:07,754 --> 00:26:08,954
where I'd put it.

446
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,554
To me, it's

447
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,034
a gift

448
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:14,234
from a friend.

449
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:16,714
Similarly, to me, Chen Fei'er

450
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:18,754
is a friend

451
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,394
I have not contacted for long.

452
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,434
You're straightforward.

453
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,114
Throughout the years,

454
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:29,994
we've never mentioned

455
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:30,914
the past,

456
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:33,274
as I think it's not important.

457
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:35,434
I admit

458
00:26:36,314 --> 00:26:37,354
I once had a crush on her.

459
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:40,194
It's one-sided love

460
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:41,914
in our adolescence.

461
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:45,994
The both of us are together now.

462
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:48,674
We stay together and interact daily.

463
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:50,634
That's the real life.

464
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:54,354
Do you think I'm in the mood

465
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:55,274
to think about her?

466
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:59,274
How did you know I felt that way?

467
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:00,754
Are you the omniscient narrator?

468
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:02,234
Why do you know everything?

469
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:03,994
I even know

470
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:05,474
you wanted to surprise me.

471
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,834
So I went out

472
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:07,914
and bought many things

473
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:08,834
needed for the trip.

474
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,234
I also know you've been

475
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:12,634
wanting to complete the home.

476
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:16,034
There're many unchecked items

477
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:18,034
on your list.

478
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:26,874
Xiao Shangqi.

479
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:29,194
If you know too much,
you'll be silenced.

480
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:32,434
Before you silence me,

481
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:34,234
let's have fun for a day

482
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:36,234
and fulfil

483
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,994
all our wishes.

484
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:45,274
Let's have breakfast first.

485
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:46,314
Yes, let's have breakfast first.

486
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:49,794
Come on.

488
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:06,434
Are you following

489
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:07,554
the time in the U.S.?

490
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:08,714
When you're here,

491
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,114
you're up in odd hours.

492
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,394
Are you giving up your health?

493
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,554
Many experts create works

494
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:15,954
in midnight.

495
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,594
When one's senses are not working well,

496
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:21,314
that's when one's mind becomes sharp.

497
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:37,314
Are you sharp now?

498
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:50,794
If the time can't make me sharp,

499
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:54,674
it must be the wrong place and person.

501
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,114
I think of a place.

502
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:02,074
Go with me.

503
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:03,434
We'll go now.

504
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:05,514
Come on.

520
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:37,954
available throughout the month?

521
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,034
It is,

522
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:40,354
but the fruit slices

523
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:41,714
for this cake

524
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:43,274
is out of supply

525
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:44,034
due to an issue with
the company's cold chain.

526
00:29:44,954 --> 00:29:46,594
When will it be available?

527
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:47,674
You might have to wait for two days,

528
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:48,634
but you can surely have it

529
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:49,634
before the month ends.

530
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:50,674
Would you

531
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:51,594
want another slice of cake instead?

532
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:54,874
I don't know whether we can
make it before the month ends.

533
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,434
Let's order this instead.

534
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:02,194
A slice of this, please.

535
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,314
Okay, I'll pack it.

536
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:03,754
Okay.

537
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,994
I feel like having the strawberry one.

538
00:30:08,714 --> 00:30:09,434
We'll have it next time.

539
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:10,794
Why isn't there anyone else?

540
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,314
It's stated online that the movie

541
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:22,594
was cancelled suddenly.

542
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:31,314
Why aren't you answering it?

543
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:32,354
Those at Hupu are urging you, right?

544
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:33,354
It's okay, answer it.

545
00:30:34,554 --> 00:30:35,914
It's a salesperson.

546
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:44,114
What's wrong?

547
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:48,794
The closed art museum,

548
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,474
the missed limited cake,

549
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:52,434
and now, the cancelled movie.

550
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:54,794
I feel like everything is

551
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:56,394
so inauspicious.

552
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,754
Why are you so superstitious now?

553
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:02,354
Well,

554
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:03,674
I'll tell them that

555
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:04,794
I'll only go back two days later.

556
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:05,594
No.

557
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:07,354
You should go back.

558
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:08,794
Instead of delaying it,

559
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:09,834
you should go back soon.

560
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:10,874
Then you'll come back sooner.

561
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:14,714
However, I think

562
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:15,794
it's meaningful today.

563
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,714
With unfulfilled wishes, there's
anticipation and motivation.

564
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:20,914
After I go back,

565
00:31:21,274 --> 00:31:22,154
I'll be more driven to work

566
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,634
and come back soon.

567
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:24,874
I'll be back

568
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:26,074
to go for the exhibition, movie

569
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:26,714
and cake with you.

570
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:31,634
Xiao Shangqi.

571
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:33,914
Wusu is not just

572
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:35,874
a temporary place
for you to rest, right?

573
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:39,354
Of course not.

574
00:31:40,754 --> 00:31:43,114
To me, thanks to you,

575
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:45,514
Wusu is my real home.

576
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:53,114
Come on, let's have the cake.

577
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:14,474
Do you remember this place?

578
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:17,554
You were singing

579
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,194
"Yes" here

580
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:18,714
for me.

581
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:20,914
It's the same season

582
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,754
and weather.

583
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:24,234
Everything changes,

584
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:28,514
but the girl before me

585
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,474
makes me feel like staying

586
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:32,554
in her own little world.

587
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:36,514
This place is meaningful to us.

588
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,994
I'm sure there will be the inspiration.

589
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:46,154
Can you not talk about that song?

590
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:49,914
Are you still mad?

591
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:52,674
Do you know "Yes"

592
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:54,034
is a hit song now?

593
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:55,994
Many people want this song from me.

594
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,114
Do you know

595
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:00,794
you're kind of crazy now?

596
00:33:02,074 --> 00:33:02,514
Didn't you dream

597
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,514
of standing on a stage?

598
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:05,514
How long has it been

599
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:07,234
since you last performed?

600
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:08,074
Hui.

601
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:10,394
You know

602
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:12,034
I'm in need of a new song

603
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:13,194
to stimulate me now.

604
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:22,274
I'll buy two bottles of water.

605
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:35,874
Feelings.

606
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,234
Come to me soon.

607
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:45,274
Come to me soon.

608
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:57,274
Tang Yan!

609
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:05,354
(Come on.)

610
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,313
Tang Yan.

611
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:31,594
Keep quiet.

612
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,714
I just got inspiration.

613
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,234
Why aren't you with Li Hui?

614
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:40,434
I'm asking you. Where's Li Hui?

615
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:44,714
I'm asking you!

616
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:46,954
She's at Riverside Park.

617
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:17,114
How did you know I was here?

618
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:19,154
Hop on.

619
00:35:22,274 --> 00:35:24,394
Did you see Tang Yan?

620
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:27,074
He acts like an artist.

621
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,314
He only cares about making music.

622
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:29,034
When he has inspiration,

623
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,594
he drops everything.

624
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:32,714
I know.

625
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:34,794
It's not his first time doing this.

626
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:35,394
Hop on.

627
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,474
You're the reliable one.

628
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:55,874
Come on.

629
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,710
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

630
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,297
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

631
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:20,963
(News interview)

632
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:26,714
I'll help you.

633
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,274
(There's a beautiful courtyard.)

634
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:42,994
(We'll invite our friends
over when we're bored,)

635
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:45,194
(except Sui Mingwei.)

636
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,394
(Don't ever let)

637
00:36:50,394 --> 00:36:51,594
(another man in when I'm away.)

638
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:00,514
(Eat well.)

639
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,994
(I'll be back by the time
you finish this.)

640
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:11,074
(Do you want to drink this?)

641
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:23,674
There'll be media at
the opening ceremony.

642
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:24,474
So Mr. Xiao wants you

643
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:25,754
to check the name list.

644
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,154
How's the recruitment going?

645
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:28,234
We must fill

646
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,794
the vacancies by this week.

647
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,034
I'm already rushing Human Resources.

648
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:32,714
It's just that the candidate
of General Manager

649
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:33,874
is not confirmed yet.

650
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:36,234
Qi, why are you here?

651
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:37,314
Mr. Zhao.

652
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:39,114
What are you doing here?

653
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:41,074
I'm sending a document.

654
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:44,074
Do you have any plans later?

655
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:45,274
I'll go home.

656
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,874
I happen to be going to the clubhouse.

657
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:48,834
It's on the way.

658
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:51,994
You don't have to
arrange transport later.

659
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:52,834
Okay.

660
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:55,554
Give me a lift.

661
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:57,274
No problem.

662
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:00,074
Remember,

663
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:02,114
settle

664
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,474
the vacancies.

665
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:04,154
Sure.

666
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:06,234
Come on.

667
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:10,954
How is it?

668
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:12,674
It's great.

669
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:15,394
Why do you think

670
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:16,514
Mr. Zhao is so close

671
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:17,594
to his brother?

672
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:19,914
Are you sure? Regardless of occasion,

673
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:22,194
he always addresses him by his name,

674
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:23,514
Qi.

675
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:25,354
It's as if he's reminding him

676
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:27,594
that no matter what he achieves,

677
00:38:27,794 --> 00:38:29,434
he remains his follower,

678
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,394
understand?

679
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:40,274
Li Hui, where are you going?

680
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:41,394
I wanted to have coffee with you.

681
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:42,594
I couldn't find you.

682
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:43,314
Where were you?

683
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:44,274
I had to interview two people.

684
00:38:44,514 --> 00:38:45,194
I'm just done.

685
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:46,794
Not bad.

686
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:48,914
I thought you needed to be comforted.

687
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:49,754
You're doing

688
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,834
so well now.

689
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,754
You're not affected by
the long-distance relationship.

690
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:54,474
He and I are busy.

691
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:55,674
I'm content

692
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:56,314
as long as he makes time

693
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:57,194
to call me.

694
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:58,274
We're unlike you and Tang Yan,

695
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,314
who stick together everyday.

696
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:01,874
It's as if the two of us

697
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,674
are living in different time zones.

698
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,034
He can't pen a song now.

699
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:06,594
He's breaking down.

700
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,114
We don't seem to be living
in the same time zone.

701
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:12,514
Come on, let's have coffee.

702
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:22,434
What's the matter?

703
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:37,314
(Hello.)

704
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:39,594
(The phone of the number
you're dialling is turned off.)

705
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:40,434
(Sorry.)

706
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,234
It's a prank, right?

707
00:39:42,954 --> 00:39:44,594
Many girls are after Tang Yan.

708
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:45,314
He's

709
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:45,794
only interested in music

710
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:47,074
instead of this.

711
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,474
Come on, let's have coffee.

712
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:56,154
I

713
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:57,914
want to go to Jifeng.

714
00:39:59,234 --> 00:39:59,674
I'll accompany you.

715
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:02,954
Wait for me at the lobby.

716
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:03,794
Okay.

717
00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:10,874
I have the room key.

718
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:12,274
He'd be a fool

719
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:13,114
to do this

720
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:14,434
in broad daylight.

721
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:16,554
Come on.

722
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:07,074
Did you stay up again?

723
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:10,714
You're here.

724
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:14,874
I'm thirsty. Get water for me.

725
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:30,194
Here.

726
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:31,834
Thanks.

727
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:51,634
Hui.

728
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:55,154
I'm hungry.

729
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:56,634
Let's have something.

730
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:58,154
Did you sleep with Susan?

731
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:03,434
I bumped into her.

732
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:06,034
Hui!

733
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:07,794
Don't touch me.

734
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:09,554
Listen to me.

735
00:42:09,714 --> 00:42:10,514
I'm telling you.

736
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:11,554
She and I...

737
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:12,994
There's nothing between us.

738
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:13,874
I just...

739
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:15,074
You know

740
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:16,154
I only love you.

741
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:18,354
I just wanted to get inspiration.

742
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:19,834
I just wanted to get...

743
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:23,474
Tang Yan.

744
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:24,994
It's over between us.

745
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:28,434
Li Hui!

746
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:30,194
Li Hui!

747
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,314
Li Hui!

748
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:42,954
Li Hui!

749
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,234
Li Hui!

750
00:42:51,074 --> 00:42:51,474
Li Hui!

751
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,279
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

752
00:42:53,394 --> 00:42:55,274
