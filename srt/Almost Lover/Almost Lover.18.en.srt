What's wrong?

18
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,100
Are you feeling low?

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,900
I just feel that

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,180
we're from different worlds.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,740
Mr. Wang.

22
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,340
It's been a while.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,540
Hello, you are...

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,180
We met on the yacht party before.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,100
The yacht party?

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,220
I wasn't there.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,980
Apologies.

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,780
Why do I feel like these people

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,460
are so fake?

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,340
Will you be accompanying

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,420
him to do such things?

32
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,220
Why are you so clumsy?

33
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,980
Be careful.

34
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:09,500
Sorry.

35
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,260
It's fine.

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,420
Let's go.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,780
Mr. Zhao, congratulations.

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,460
Yunlan and I were

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,580
in charge of

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,420
arranging all these

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,860
along with the decorations.

42
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,300
It seems like they have reached

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,140
an agreement with Mr. Gao.

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,220
Not just Mr. Gao.

45
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,300
There's Mr. Lan from Chengsen, too.

46
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,380
These top suppliers of ours

47
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,100
and

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,540
our competitors

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,900
are using this wedding

50
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,060
to get close to him.

51
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,260
Also?

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,900
Other than Mr. Gao's Zhisheng,

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,300
a few other companies

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,580
have already

55
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,700
reached an agreement.

56
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,220
They're just waiting to

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,660
sign contracts after this wedding
in Yunduan.

58
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,060
Li.

59
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,540
Do you hate him?

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,180
I know when you fired me,

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,500
it was just a facade.

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,780
Working for you privately

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,700
like this

64
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,300
makes a lot of things easier.

65
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:22,900
All right.

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,500
Your main task now

67
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,260
is to keep a close eye on him.

68
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,580
I want to see

69
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,380
what kind of wave he will cause.

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,060
Aren't there a few more minutes to go?

71
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,820
How did you get in?

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
My daughter is getting married.

73
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,500
As a father,

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm here to attend the wedding dinner.

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,780
Are you crazy?

76
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,140
Who asked you to come?

77
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,100
I'm telling you.

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,740
You better leave

79
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,700
or I'm calling security.

80
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,420
Fine.

81
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,900
Go ahead.

82
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,340
It's best to summon everyone here.

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,980
Let them assess.

84
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,379
My daughter is getting married.

85
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,340
How can you not allow
your father to come in?

86
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,100
Does it

87
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,140
even make sense?

88
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,780
That's right.

89
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:21,460
Does it?

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,740
Fei'er,

91
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,220
you've made it now.

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,380
You're ashamed of us.

93
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,100
You don't want us to embarrass you.

94
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,900
That's fine. It's all right.

95
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,820
For your happiness,

96
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,620
your parents will take it,

97
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
but you can't be heartless.

98
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You can't toy around

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,220
with your parents.

100
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,380
Look.

101
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,220
There's no money in here.

102
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,380
Take a look.

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,740
Take a look.

104
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,100
That can't be.

105
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,940
All the money I have

106
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,180
is in this card.

107
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,780
Enough of your nonsense.

108
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,180
Give us cash.

109
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,460
We'll leave immediately.

110
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,820
Where do you think

111
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,540
I'll get cash from now?

112
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,540
I don't care.

113
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,660
I'm telling you.

114
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,780
It's not just RMB 300,000.

115
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,140
It's RMB 500,000.

116
00:04:59,460 --> 00:04:59,740
You...

117
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,220
Enough.

118
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,620
Stop acting here.

119
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,700
We know what's going on.

120
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm afraid if you don't give us
money now,

121
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
we won't be able to find you

122
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,980
anymore.

123
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,140
We saw you

124
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,700
accepting

125
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,180
cash gifts outside.

126
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,540
Don't keep too much of that.

127
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,180
Look at this.

128
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,660
And your earrings.

129
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,260
You don't have money?

130
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,780
Who are lying to?

131
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,540
That's right.

132
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Are you asking me to
open the cash gifts

133
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,540
to give you money?

134
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,900
There are clear records

135
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,300
for those gifts.

136
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,420
Do you think I can touch that?

137
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,460
Why not?

138
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,140
What have you given me

139
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,060
as my parents?

140
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,700
You even want to ruin

141
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,140
what I worked hard for?

142
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,740
Fine, let me tell you.

143
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,660
There's no money for you.

144
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,780
If you force me to the corner,

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,900
we'll die together.

146
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
Die together?

147
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,660
Tell me.

148
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,500
How do you plan

149
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,060
to do that?

150
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,420
Fei'er.

151
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,100
I'll see how you do it.

152
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,940
It's about time.

153
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,820
Can we go now?

154
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,900
What are you waiters doing here?

155
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,940
The wedding is starting soon.

156
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,140
Get busy.

157
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,540
Who are you?

158
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,820
(Father)
I'm her father.

159
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,580
Dear,

160
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,820
no wonder our son

161
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,860
didn't let us attend the wedding.

162
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,460
He is right.

163
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,500
Next time,

164
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,900
we're out of the picture.

165
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,740
You're her father?

166
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,140
What?

167
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,220
I'm your grandfather!

168
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,420
Stop it!

169
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,780
How dare you hit me!

170
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,300
What are you doing?

171
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,220
How dare you hit my husband?

172
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,180
How dare you hit my husband?

173
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,980
Hit him!

174
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,900
Stop it!

175
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,820
You're an imposter!

176
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,500
How dare you hit my husband?

177
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,260
Fake! Imposter!

178
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,020
Imposter!

179
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,460
Firstly, thank you

180
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,820
for coming here happily

181
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,020
to witness this wedding.

182
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,020
I'm your emcee for today, Zhang.

183
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,420
I'll lead everyone to

184
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,380
witness this happiness.

185
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,660
May the ceremony begin.

186
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,780
What's going on?

187
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Where's the bride?

188
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,460
I don't know.

189
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,740
She should be walking out now.

190
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,980
Yes. Why is she not here?

191
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,300
Is this deliberate?

192
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,140
Call the police. I'm calling the police.

193
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,540
Did you think I would be scared of you?

194
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,420
I'll call someone now

195
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,100
to tend to the injuries.

196
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,100
When the wedding is over,

197
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
I'll compensate you.

198
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,100
How can I enter the hall like this?

199
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,820
The hall?

200
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,740
So?

201
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,380
Give me the money.

202
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,460
Otherwise, your mother and I

203
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,580
will walk you down the aisle.

204
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
That's a good idea. We'll do that.

205
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,220
Fine, let's go.

206
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,260
Let's go.

207
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:24,780
What are you doing?

208
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,460
We'll go out now

209
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,100
and let everyone know

210
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,540
you're my biological parents.

211
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,180
We'll let everyone know

212
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,620
my background

213
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,260
and the type of family I have.

214
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,700
Do you think this wedding will go on?

215
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,460
What good

216
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,620
will you get out of that?

217
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,580
You...

218
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,900
Don't you threaten us.

219
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,820
Yes.

220
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,180
Fei'er, can we

221
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,500
talk this out properly?

222
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,900
What are you doing?

223
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,220
What are you doing?

224
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,780
Shangqi.

225
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,500
Why is she not coming out?

226
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,500
It's been so long.

227
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,340
Are they getting married?

228
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
Why isn't it starting?

229
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,380
It's been more than 10 minutes.

230
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,180
They're all like that.

231
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,100
Just wait.

232
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,580
Why don't we get someone to check?

233
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,180
It's starting.

234
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,140
She's here.

235
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,780
Who's beside the bride?

236
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,660
Yes.

237
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,140
How nice.

238
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,100
Who is this?

239
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,860
I can't see clearly.

240
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,780
Romance in school

241
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,580
is always true and simple.

242
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,900
Among the crowd,

243
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,980
the best friend who has

244
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,620
always been supporting you

245
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,420
now walks you

246
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,140
down the aisle toward happiness.

247
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
This is such a heart-warming

248
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,660
start.

249
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,660
Isn't that Xiao Shangqi?

250
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,540
The bride is so beautiful.

251
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,820
Where's the bride's father?

252
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,260
Why is Yunduan's Xiao Shangqi

253
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,020
walking her down the aisle?

254
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,700
That's right.

255
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,580
Why do they look like a perfect match?

256
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,260
Yes.

257
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,340
Now, the groom

258
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,180
is taking the bride's hand,

259
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,340
hereby giving her
a lifetime of happiness,

260
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
support and company.

261
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,020
All right.

262
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,500
Let us now witness

263
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,540
the couple's

264
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,500
romantic love story.

265
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,860
Everything started from

266
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,700
an encounter in a foreign country.

267
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,100
(Who are you lying to?)

268
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,620
(What is this?)

269
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,100
(That's right.)

270
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,220
(Are you asking me to
open the cash gifts)

271
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,780
(to give you money?)

272
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,900
(There are clear records)

273
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,700
(for those gifts.)

274
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
(Do you think I can touch that?)

275
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,220
(Why not?)

276
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:50,820
(That's right.)

277
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,260
(What have you given me)

278
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,100
(as my parents?)

279
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,020
What's going on?

280
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,860
I don't know.

281
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,900
(Fine, let me tell you.)

282
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,420
(There's no money for you.)

283
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,140
(If you force me to the corner,)

284
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,420
(we'll die together.)

285
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,660
(Die together?)

286
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,460
What's going on?

287
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,580
(Right. I'll see how you do it.)

288
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,220
(Fei'er.)

289
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,940
(It's about time.)

290
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,700
(Can we go now?)

291
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,780
(Who are you?)

292
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,900
(I'm her father.)

293
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,900
(Dear,)

294
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,380
(she won't let us attend the wedding.)

295
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,620
(That's right.)

296
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,460
Mr. Zhao,

297
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,300
may I ask where did

298
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:32,940
the bride's father go?

299
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,500
How do you explain

300
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,220
this footage?

301
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,100
Did you hire actors

302
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,580
to act as

303
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,260
the bride's parents?

304
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:36,940
What are you

305
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,620
trying to hide?

306
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,740
If the bride's background is fake,

307
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,740
then what is

308
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,300
the truth?

309
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
Please give me an explanation,

310
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,780
all right?

311
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,660
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

312
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,340
Answer

313
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,100
the questions.

314
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,780
Mr. Zhao,

315
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,580
is the footage real?

316
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,380
If it is,

317
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,020
then what are you

318
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,860
trying to hide?

319
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,380
Qi.

320
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,820
She's your classmate.

321
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,220
Our families have

322
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,620
also worked together for so many years.

323
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,860
I always treated you

324
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,660
as my own brother.

325
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
How could you do this to me?

326
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,300
What are you talking about?

327
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,220
Mr. Zhao,

328
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,980
are you unaware

329
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,420
of Miss Chen's real identity?

330
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,180
Today was supposed to be
the most important day

331
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,500
in my life.

332
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,540
I never thought that

333
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,100
today became a scam.

334
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,260
A scam?

335
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,940
What does he mean?

336
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,420
I don't know.

337
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,580
I never knew that

338
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,940
the woman that I love

339
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,020
is a swindler

340
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,500
who hid her identity

341
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,580
and approached me for a purpose.

342
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,780
However, what breaks my heart the most

343
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
is that my good brother

344
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,940
was lying to me together with her.

345
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,140
Their relationship isn't simple.

346
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,740
What's their relationship?

347
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes.

348
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,340
Zhao Mingxuan.

349
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,220
Qi.

350
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,300
You introduced her to me.

351
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,580
I don't believe you

352
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,260
didn't know her real identity,

353
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,460
but why didn't you tell me?

354
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,620
Are you saying

355
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,060
did you purposely

356
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,340
plant her by my side?

357
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,980
Could it be that she's Yunlan's pawn?

358
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,060
What's Yunlan

359
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,140
trying to do?

360
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,540
Yes.

361
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,900
This is a lie inside and out.

362
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,980
That's right.

363
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,980
Yes. I think so, too.

364
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,860
You're despicable!

365
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,140
Xiao Shangqi!

366
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,220
It's dangerous.

367
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,060
Miss Chen,

368
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,700
what's your identity?

369
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,300
Miss Chen,

370
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,340
are you really

371
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,940
Mr. Xiao's pawn?

372
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,500
Miss Chen,

373
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,460
please answer our question.

374
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,020
All right?

375
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,820
Zhao Mingxuan,

376
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,180
you set this whole thing up.

377
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,780
Is that why you got angry

378
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,500
and hit him?

379
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,740
Is there anything else you want to add?

380
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,540
Please answer

381
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,260
our questions.

382
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,900
Hello.

383
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,180
Please answer our question.

384
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,220
Move aside.

385
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,660
Regarding the footage...

386
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,460
Please answer

387
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,060
our question.

388
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,140
Mr. Xiao.

389
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,100
Please answer us.

390
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,420
Hello.

391
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,100
Please answer us.

392
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,420
Fei'er.

393
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,140
Are you all right? Come on.

394
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,180
Let me do it.

395
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,420
You'll drive. I'll take care of her.

396
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,100
- Xiaoran.
- Let's go to the hospital first.

397
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,300
What do we do now?

398
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,500
I think they both are

399
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,500
taking it as a responsibility

400
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,060
to help Chen Fei'er.

401
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,900
I asked someone to let you in

402
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,140
to get the money.

403
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,060
Who asked you to mess up the wedding?

404
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,260
Look at this mess.

405
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,940
Are you happy now?

406
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,660
No.

407
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,820
You little brat.

408
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,660
How dare you reprimand your father?

409
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,540
If you didn't steal the money

410
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,260
to pay your debts

411
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,460
and lied to your mother and I,

412
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,980
would this happen?

413
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,620
I'll beat you to death.

414
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,580
What are you doing?

415
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,020
You alcoholic! Hooligan!

416
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,420
There's nothing you won't mess up!

417
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm telling you!

418
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,260
Other than fighting,

419
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,180
what else can you do?

420
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,140
What are you doing?

421
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,940
Even if you beat him to death,

422
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,140
it's useless.

423
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,380
I'm telling you.

424
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,180
I have something with me

425
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,020
as evidence.

426
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,580
As long as I use it,

427
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,620
be it her or Zhao Mingxuan,

428
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,100
they will definitely pay me.

429
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,420
I just went down for smoking.

430
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,460
Why are you panicking?

431
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,260
Don't run.

432
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Mingxuan.

433
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,180
Mingxuan.

434
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,540
What evidence is this?

435
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,340
I...

436
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,780
I...

437
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,260
What?

438
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,700
Take it out.

439
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,900
Let me see if I should let this slide.

440
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,380
(Today my wedding is a lie.)

441
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,340
(Lies!)

442
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
(Could it be that the woman I love)

443
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,700
(Yunlan's pawn?)

444
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,460
(Mr. Zhao.)

445
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,940
(Liar who approached me for a purpose.)

446
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,100
(How do you explain about the video?)

447
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,020
(Are the bride's parents)

448
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,180
(some actors that you hired?)

449
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,620
(Why are you trying to hide?)

450
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
(If the bride's background is fake,)

451
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,700
(what's)

452
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,580
(the truth?)

453
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,140
Why did it turn out this way?

454
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,140
Why were my parents there?

455
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,450
Why did someone put the camera

456
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,620
in the dressing room?

457
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,500
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,170
We, Yunlan,

459
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,860
didn't do a good job.

460
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,900
I didn't blame you.

461
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,900
How can I blame you?

462
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,540
What should I do now?

463
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,420
Shangqi,

464
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,060
I've lost everything now.

465
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,980
Other than you, no one else

466
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,660
would care about me.

467
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,620
I really hate them.

468
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,620
Can't I just have

469
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,580
a little bit of happiness?

470
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,100
Can you be sober?

471
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,660
Zhao Mingxuan said that

472
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,060
in a few minutes.

473
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,500
He said you cheated his feelings.

474
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,740
You're a ruthless woman who tried to

475
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,980
marry into Zhao Family.

476
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,300
He'll surely

477
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,020
use you as his black sheep.

478
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,060
Do you dare count yourself on him

479
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,820
for the rest of your life?

480
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,180
Is that happiness?

481
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,700
Can you give Xiao Shangqi

482
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,580
to me?

483
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,340
Ever since I was young,

484
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
nobody has been kind to me.

485
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,940
I don't know what happiness is.

486
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,060
Xiaoran,

487
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,300
can you share him with me?

488
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,620
You have it all.

489
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,540
You got everything

490
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,180
so easily.

491
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,900
Fei'er!

492
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,980
Please share it with me, okay?

493
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,660
I beg you!

494
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
I've done everything I can

495
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,580
for you.

496
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,540
Someone shared a clip

497
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,820
of you both holding hands online.

498
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,380
(I regret it.)

499
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,380
(I don't want to get married.)

500
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,060
(You said)

501
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,820
(you would protect me)

502
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,580
(no matter when it is.)

503
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,580
Shangqi,

504
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,260
who filmed us?

505
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,460
Xiaoran.

506
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,780
Shangqi.

507
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,580
That's not what happened.

508
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,460
Shangqi.

509
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,020
Xiaoran.

510
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,580
He Xiaoran!

511
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,980
Xiaoran.

512
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,060
He Xiaoran.

513
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,060
Hear me out.

514
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,260
That wasn't what happened.

515
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,820
They edited the footage.

516
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,500
I trust you.

517
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
I just want to ask you something.

518
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,500
When will you stop caring

519
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,540
about Chen Fei'er's matters?

520
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,220
I'm in charge of the wedding.

521
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,380
Now that this has happened to Fei'er,

522
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,220
I am responsible.

523
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,940
I've already tolerated.

524
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,140
Be it the time capsule,

525
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,540
you getting Shen Meng

526
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,620
to change the piece,

527
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,540
or you walking her

528
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,620
down the aisle as her father,

529
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,100
or beating Zhao Mingxuan.

530
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,300
I can explain all these.

531
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,220
I don't need your explanation.

532
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,060
I want to go back to Wusu.

533
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,340
I've long forgotten

534
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,260
about the time capsule.

535
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,300
I changed the song so

536
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,620
the wedding

537
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,740
would go smoothly.

538
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,820
Including that footage,

539
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,100
someone edited it.

540
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,580
That's enough.

541
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,420
Last time,

542
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
we broke up for many years

543
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,140
because of a misunderstanding.

544
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
We wasted so much time.

545
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,860
I'm leaving this time

546
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,220
not because I'm running away.

547
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,780
I trust your feelings for me,

548
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,180
but I've thought it through.

549
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,660
As long as we stay here,

550
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,660
we would always have to

551
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,540
stand in to help her.

552
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,140
This has become our second nature,

553
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,340
or even like a mission.

554
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,060
Xiaoran.

555
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,060
I want to go back to Wusu.

556
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,700
I want to go back.

557
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,500
I don't care if

558
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,740
it's heaven

559
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,900
or a mirage there.

560
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,060
I just want to go back

561
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,380
to our peaceful lives.

562
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,220
Did you know

563
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,300
I've been thinking lately?

564
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,700
Relay race.

565
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
(For so many years,)

566
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
(I've been chasing after you)

567
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,020
(and you've been chasing after her.)

568
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,300
I'm sick of it.

569
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,260
I'll be selfish for this time.

570
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,860
Xiao Shangqi.

571
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,900
Will you give up

572
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,860
everything here

573
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,740
and go back with me?

574
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,300
Of course.

575
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,820
I must first

576
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,140
sort out this current mess.

577
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,020
Xiaoran.

578
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,660
Can you give me some time?

579
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,060
How long?

580
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,300
Seven days.

581
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,140
Fine, I'll wait for you.

582
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,340
This doesn't suit me.

583
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,420
We haven't thought of a solution

584
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,620
and Deju has already

585
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,140
released a statement.

586
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,300
Now, Yunlan is

587
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,460
taking all the blame.

588
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,260
We're too passive.

589
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,020
Xiao Shangqi is too careless.

590
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,460
He met the bride secretly

591
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,220
and was caught on film.

592
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,100
This is not just me.

593
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,420
Deju has already asked to terminate

594
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,140
all the contracts with Yunduan Hotel.

595
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
All higher management will be fired.

596
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,620
Yunlan is partially

597
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,740
to blame.

598
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,620
We can't push this to anyone.

599
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
Let's just stick to the contract.

600
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,140
Father, I've looked into it.

601
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,580
It's the waiter that was

602
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,740
ridiculed by Zhao Mingxuan

603
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,460
in the executive lounge.

604
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,980
Chen Fei'er's brother bribed him

605
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,580
so he let them in.

606
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,260
This guy

607
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,180
also did something himself.

608
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,660
He planted a camera in the

609
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,780
flower basket in the room.

610
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,540
That's how he

611
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,300
got that footage.

612
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,260
He brought it upon himself.

613
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,060
It seems Qi is right.

614
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,460
Deju

615
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,300
will only

616
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,420
hinder us.

617
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,420
It's time for us to
stop leaning on them.

618
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,380
Xiaoran,

619
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,900
why aren't you picking up our calls?

620
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,100
My phone ran out of battery.

621
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,260
Are you hungry?

622
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,460
Let's go eat.

623
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,820
(I want to go back to Wusu.)

624
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,380
(I want to go back.)

625
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,980
(I don't care if)

626
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,300
(it's heaven)

627
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,340
(or a mirage.)

628
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,460
(I just want to go back)

629
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,860
(to our peaceful lives.)

630
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,780
Let me be selfish just this once.

631
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,300
Xiao Shangqi,

632
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,580
will you give up

633
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,500
everything here

634
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,180
and go back with me?

635
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,180
Are you feeling better?

636
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,180
I'm fine.

637
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,780
- Thank you.
- Here.

638
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,260
They're all your favorite.

639
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,900
Although it can't compare to

640
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,740
Hao's secret recipe,

641
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,900
it tastes pretty good.

642
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,460
Xiaoran,

643
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,620
can he not forget

644
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,740
about Chen Fei'er?

645
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,820
What?

646
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,260
Why can't I ask?

647
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,980
How can he bully you like that?

648
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
We can't

649
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,060
let this slide.

650
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,020
The clip uploaded online

651
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,660
must have been edited by

652
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,580
Zhao Mingxuan's men.

653
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,940
Fine. Even if it's edited,

654
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,580
it also proves that Chen Fei'er

655
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,180
wants to go to him.

656
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,220
Look, the wedding is gone.

657
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,300
Would she not latch onto Xiao Shangqi?

658
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,500
Sui is right.

659
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,620
Xiao Shangqi is

660
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,780
her last

661
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,740
saving grace.

662
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,940
It'll be hard to get rid of her.

663
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,700
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

664
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,260
We've told Mr. He.

665
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,380
We'll stay back to be with you.

666
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,980
We'll go back
when things are settled down.

667
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,860
No need.

668
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,380
I'll go home and pack.

669
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,460
I'll go back with you tomorrow.

670
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,620
What do you mean?

671
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,780
I'll go look for him.

672
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,620
Sui.

673
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,060
What?

674
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,660
I'm not going back alone.

675
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,460
Xiao Shangqi has promised me.

676
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,060
He would look for me in Wusu

677
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,220
when he's done with things here.

678
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,980
Then, we can

679
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,180
live peacefully.

680
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,980
We won't care about

681
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,860
what happens here.

682
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,140
Did he really say that?

683
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,380
Can he give up his career here?

684
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,780
Fine, that's good.

685
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
I saw it in you.

686
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,460
You wanted to go back,

687
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:35,940
right?

688
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,660
Yes. Come back to Wusu.

689
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,340
You have a job, two of us,

690
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,300
and Dajiabang.

691
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,540
When you're back in home ground,

692
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,180
nobody would dare bully you.

693
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:46,980
That's right.

694
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,660
All right. Goodbye.

695
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,700
Mr. Xiao.

696
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,740
Shouldn't we

697
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,060
discuss

698
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,700
certain things?

699
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,780
You've spoken to the press.

700
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,940
What's there to discuss?

701
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,300
It's nearly been a day.

702
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,940
I have not heard

703
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,340
from you guys.

704
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,620
Are you talking about the wedding?

705
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,580
In terms of management

706
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,740
and security,

707
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,060
Yunlan made grave mistakes.

708
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,820
We apologise.

709
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,340
Mr. Xiao,

710
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,380
did you really

711
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,380
not understand me?

712
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,900
I'm talking about Xiao Shangqi,

713
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,340
your second son who

714
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,780
hit me at the wedding

715
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,540
and he even snatched my bride.

716
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,900
What should we do about that?

717
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,980
You were talking about that?

718
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,980
I was waiting for him to come home

719
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,700
to tell him personally

720
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
that he did well.

721
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,300
What did you say?

722
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,340
Mingxuan,

723
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,980
you chose the woman yourself.

724
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,300
You set up her character.

725
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
You reaped

726
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,420
the fruits yourself.

727
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,580
Isn't this tactic of sacrificing
the guard for the marshall

728
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,260
a little too brutal?

729
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,900
Xiao Zhenyun,

730
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,300
do you really think you're qualified

731
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,140
to lecture me?

732
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm here to tell you this.

733
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,500
If Xiao Shangqi

734
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,260
doesn't kneel down

735
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,740
before me and apologize to me,

736
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,820
then there'll be more than
one hotel that will

737
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,220
end the collaboration with you
besides Yunduan.

738
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,300
Mingxuan.

739
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,900
All these years,

740
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,420
you've been chasing fame and fortune

741
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,380
in the business arena.

742
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,380
I feel like I'm walking along a cliff

743
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,340
when I work with you.

744
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,380
Look, your father and I

745
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,060
have known each other for many years.

746
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,420
So, I'm here to advise you to

747
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
take a step back.

748
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,460
Don't get sucked in too deep.

749
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,220
What do you mean?

750
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,500
Qi is rash,

751
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,940
but at least he's magnanimous.

752
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,620
I believe with time,

753
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,180
Yunlan will

754
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,300
overtake Deju.

755
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,660
Fine.

756
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,620
Just wait for your

757
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,260
contracts to be terminated.

758
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:10,190
(Emergency)

759
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,940
(Hupu Huayang Hospital)

760
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,620
(Operating room)

761
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
He's been inside for a while.

762
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,220
(Mingxuan.)

763
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,460
(All these years,)

764
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,980
(you've been chasing fame and fortune)

765
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,940
(in the business arena.)

766
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,940
(I feel like I'm walking along a cliff)

767
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,900
(when I work with you.)

768
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,620
(So, I'm here to advise you to)

769
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,060
(take a step back.)

770
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
(Don't get sucked in too deep.)

771
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,540
Mr. Zhao.

772
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,820
I heard something
happened to Xiao Zhenyun.

773
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,620
He's out of the woods now.

774
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,740
He needs to be hospitalized

775
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,300
for another two days.

776
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,620
We can't

777
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,180
trigger him.

778
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,860
All right.

779
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,660
Thank you.

780
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,700
It's all now

781
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,740
a mess outside.

782
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,340
Let's not

783
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,260
just stand around here.

784
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,780
Let's think about

785
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,780
what to do next.

786
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,060
Stay here and take care of father.

787
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,260
I'll deal with the issue.

788
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,020
Qi.

789
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:19,900
Do you know how big is

790
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,420
the mess you created?

791
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,540
Which matter do you think

792
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
you can handle?

793
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,460
I caused father to be so upset.

794
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,780
I don't think he wants to

795
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,780
see me when he wakes up.

796
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Staying here will not

797
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,940
help him recover.

798
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,820
How could you think that?

799
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,980
Even if father is mad,

800
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,380
he's mad at Zhao Mingxuan.

801
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,420
Ever since you came home,

802
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,980
you can tell, right?

803
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:50,940
He's so happy.

804
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,780
He even said he feels sorry

805
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,780
for you all these years.

806
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,020
He kept you overseas

807
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,740
and hid your light.

808
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,900
Anyway, he has

809
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,860
very high hopes in you.

810
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,980
As for Chen Fei'er,

811
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,260
you should really take care of her.

812
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,780
The journalists are looking

813
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,820
for her everywhere.

814
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,900
She faced such a big blow.

815
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,170
Is she all right?

816
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,980
Nothing else should happen anymore.

817
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,580
Really.

818
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,580
Also, what are your plans?

819
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,100
You and her...

820
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,650
There's nothing between us.

821
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,020
Mother,

822
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,380
isn't this too much?

823
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,260
I can't finish it. That's enough.

824
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,380
Why not?

825
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,500
If you can't finish it,

826
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,610
share it with your friends.

827
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,060
Also,

828
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,020
I've categorized all this for you.

829
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,900
When you go,

830
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,980
put it in the freezer.

831
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,100
When you want to eat it,

832
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,060
just take one out.

833
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,940
Mother. Father.

834
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,020
I'm sorry.

835
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,380
Ranran.

836
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,860
You were like this three years ago.

837
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,820
You said you didn't want to stay at Hupu

838
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,740
and wanted to go back to Wusu.

839
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,140
Your father and I

840
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,980
are not trying to stop you.

841
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,540
We're just worried.

842
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,020
I know.

843
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
I told you both

844
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,340
about Xiao Shangqi and I.

845
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,940
Three years ago, I was sad.

846
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,660
But, it's different this time.

847
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,220
I have my job

848
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,620
and my friends there.

849
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,140
I really want to go back there.

850
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,260
You're not lying to us?

851
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,540
Really.

852
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,820
I just feel unfilial for

853
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,420
not staying back with you.

854
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,540
I said I want to stay in Hupu

855
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,300
and now I made you both

856
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,540
happy for nothing.

857
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,900
No worries.

858
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,540
Silly girl.

859
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,260
Did you think we would be happy

860
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,740
if you stayed beside us,

861
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,340
but you're frowning all day?

862
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,380
That's right.

863
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,060
Wusu isn't far.

864
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,860
If you really like it there,

865
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,340
when I retire,

866
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,180
your mother and I

867
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,420
will sell this house

868
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,740
and move there.

869
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,340
That's possible.

870
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,340
Yes.

871
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,420
As long as you're healthy and happy,

872
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,900
I'll support you.

873
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,380
Thank you, Mr. He.

874
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,820
Thank you, Mother.

875
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,300
Thank you.

876
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,940
You can stay here for now.

877
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
I've transferred some money to you.

878
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,420
Use that first.

879
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,980
I'll get someone to send

880
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,540
your ID and belongings.

881
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,220
This hotel

882
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,700
is not managed by Yunlan.

883
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,020
It's not related to
Zhao Mingxuan's family either.

884
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:08,940
Don't worry.

885
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,220
Are you planning

886
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,180
to abandon me from now on?

887
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,980
Or are you blaming me?

888
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,740
Do you think I'm a burden?

889
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,940
I know

890
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,980
your father was hospitalized.

891
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,380
We're now

892
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,260
in the same pickle.

893
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,540
We can't be separated.

894
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,660
I know what I did.

895
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,260
Shangqi,

896
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,660
I thought about it the whole night.

897
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
For you and Yunlan,
I'm willing to stand out

898
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,860
and clarify all that happened.

899
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,540
Even if people scold me,

900
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,340
even if those people

901
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,900
I was afraid of find out,

902
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,780
even if those dark problems are exposed,

903
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,780
it's fine.

904
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,260
No matter how hard it gets from here,

905
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,820
how you cared for me before this,

906
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,260
I'll pay you back threefold

907
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,700
and fivefold.

908
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,220
I don't need you

909
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,140
to do anything for me.

910
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,100
Stop acting brave.

911
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,180
If it wasn't for me,

912
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,660
you wouldn't have hit Zhao Mingxuan

913
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,220
and your father would've been fine.

914
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,020
This wouldn't have happened

915
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,500
to Yunlan, too.

916
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,660
I know

917
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,900
a lot of people are blaming

918
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,260
and forcing you.

919
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,900
Shangqi.

920
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,900
I'm sorry.

921
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,860
I owe you too much.

922
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,780
Fei'er.

923
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,540
From a professional standpoint,

924
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,500
the mess at the wedding

925
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,820
is my responsibility.

926
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,460
I had to do it right for you.

927
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,020
From a friend's point of view,

928
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,420
you had nowhere to go.

929
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,580
I should also set up

930
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,300
a place for you to stay.

931
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,300
But, Zhao Mingxuan and I

932
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,700
is an ill-fated relationship

933
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,740
between Yunlan and Deju.

934
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,740
It has nothing to do with you.

935
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,740
Are you trying to

936
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,900
draw the line with me?

937
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,420
You can think it that way.

938
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,740
Xiaoran is right.

939
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,820
Zhao Mingxuan can easily

940
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,900
raise you to the sky,

941
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,980
but he can also easily

942
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,220
step on you.

943
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,940
Similarly,

944
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,100
something you get from others

945
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,940
is never really yours.

946
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,420
You can only be manipulated

947
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,060
by others.

948
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,380
You should think carefully

949
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,740
about your future plans.

950
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,500
I'll be leaving in a few days.

951
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:32,860
Take care.

952
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,180
He Xiaoran is right.

953
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,620
Where is she now?

954
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,460
I'll set up navigation downstairs.

955
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,860
Take your time.

956
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,940
Mr. He and Mrs. He,

957
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,740
I'm leaving now.

958
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,860
Thank you.

959
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:56,940
Goodbye.

960
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,380
Drive slowly.

961
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,860
All right.

962
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,620
Goodbye.

963
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,580
Hui,

964
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,340
thank you for taking care of Xiaoran.

965
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,540
No problem.

966
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,380
Be careful on the road.

967
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,780
Let us know when you reach.

968
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Got it.

969
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,580
All right. Go on in.

970
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,740
I'll let you know when I reach.

971
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,980
All right. Let's go.

972
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,220
Go in.

973
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,860
Go in.

974
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,060
Video call me.

975
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,420
Got it.

976
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,380
Bye, Mr. He and Mrs. He.

977
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,100
Bye.

978
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,500
So long-winded.

979
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,980
Go on.

980
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,740
They keep treating me like a child.

981
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,060
Have you told Xiao Shangqi?

982
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,060
(Xiao Shangqi,)

983
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,260
(I'm going back to Wusu first.)

984
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,940
(I'll wait for you there.)

985
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,900
Let's go.

986
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,660
Xiaoran,

987
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,740
you can come down now.

988
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,380
I've set it up.

989
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:48,860
(Xiaoran,)

990
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,300
(have you reached Wusu safely?)

991
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:50,980
(Yes.)

992
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,300
