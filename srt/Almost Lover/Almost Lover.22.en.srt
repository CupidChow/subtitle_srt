I'll transfer the deposit
in the next few days.

19
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:44,588
No problem.

20
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:48,228
Mr. Xiao,

21
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:49,908
the day of discharge

22
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:51,908
was decided by my father.

23
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:52,708
Now, it seems

24
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:54,188
somewhat hasty,

25
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,268
and it's been targeted by a journalist.

26
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,668
Shall we postpone

27
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:58,668
the day of discharge?

28
00:01:59,468 --> 00:01:59,988
Mr. Wang,

29
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:02,348
I'll do whatever it takes

30
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:03,828
to enforce

31
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:05,948
every clause in the contract

32
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,227
that my father talked to you about.

33
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:10,947
Sure.

34
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:14,108
Well,

35
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,708
who is this He Xiaoran?

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,390
(He Xiaoran)
(WMG's news channel journalist)

37
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:24,188
He Xiaoran

38
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:25,348
is certainly known as the journalist

39
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,068
who brings disaster to
the companies in Wusu.

40
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:27,988
She's so hard to deal with.

41
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:30,948
Mr. Xiao, did you have

42
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:32,588
a problem with her?

43
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:34,828
Not really.

44
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:36,268
I just didn't expect

45
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:38,948
to meet her here.

46
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:01,708
Mr. Sui,

47
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,068
these are some of the containers
we've designed

48
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,268
based on the retail line.

49
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:05,388
See which one you prefer.

50
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,788
They look almost the same.

51
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,188
They're very different.

52
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:11,308
I think this is nice.

53
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:12,428
I think this is interesting.

54
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:13,108
Right?

55
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:26,508
Mr. Sui,

56
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:27,908
do you plan

57
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:28,788
to send it

58
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:30,388
to the non-staff assessor?

59
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,388
What non-staff assessor?

60
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,108
Madam Xi.

61
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:34,828
Madam Xi.

62
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:36,348
Good.

63
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:37,548
Go to work.

64
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:39,668
What's the matter?

65
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,108
Wei,

66
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,388
you said you wanted to come back

67
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:45,748
and I agreed to it.

68
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:47,268
You said you wanted to set up

69
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:47,828
a new department

70
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:48,948
and I supported it, too.

71
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:50,868
But, how long do you have to prepare

72
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:52,188
this retail line?

73
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:53,908
You only spend money without
generating income.

74
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,068
Even when I'm your mother,

75
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,388
I can't leave you to this.

76
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:00,588
Stop beating around the bush.

77
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:02,428
Just tell me what you want me to do.

78
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,668
Rascal.

79
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:05,948
Have you damaged my make-up?

80
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:09,028
No. You're a natural beauty.

81
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:10,348
You're sweet.

82
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,028
Let me tell you something serious.

83
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:14,908
Are you especially familiar with

84
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:15,948
Jifeng's owner?

85
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,267
It's a hearsay.

86
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,948
He's said to have acquired

87
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:23,188
a nursing home on Damang Mountain
to turn it into a hotel.

88
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,388
Get the deal

89
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:26,788
for me, okay?

90
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,348
Is Xiao Shangqi back?

91
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:44,428
Sui.

92
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,028
I'm outside.

93
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,428
Let's talk about

94
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:49,748
the bottle design later.

95
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:51,068
Where are you?

96
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:52,708
I'm on Damang Mountain.

97
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:54,228
Wait.

98
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:54,788
Why do you go there

99
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:55,428
in the rain?

100
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:56,948
I had an interview.

101
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,428
Fine, I won't say more about it.

102
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,108
Could it be Qingshan Nursing Home?

103
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:01,348
How did you know?

104
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:02,628
Then...

105
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,028
Wait for me.

106
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:05,388
I'm going to pick you up.

107
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:06,628
Save the trouble.

108
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:07,988
I'm going back by taxi.

109
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:09,348
Let's talk again tonight.

110
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:25,628
What's wrong, sir?

111
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:27,468
The car may have broken down.

112
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:28,708
I'm going down to check.

113
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:50,388
Thank you.

114
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:56,308
How's it going?

115
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:57,268
It can't be repaired,

116
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:59,508
but I've bumped into a kind person.

117
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:00,628
He's going back to the town.

118
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:01,828
He's willing to tow the car.

119
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:03,508
All right.

120
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:41,908
Miss, we're here.

121
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:44,108
Thank you.

122
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:45,548
Well,

123
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:46,548
where's the car owner?

124
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,628
I want to thank him.

125
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:49,548
He left long ago.

126
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:51,988
Thank you.

127
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:52,948
You're welcome.

128
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,028
Have you prepared all the materials?

129
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:16,188
Yes.

130
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:17,988
These are the materials required
for the mortgage.

131
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:22,588
Are you sure

132
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,708
you want to modify the nursing home
with the money

133
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:24,708
by mortgaging Jifeng?

134
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:28,588
I've heard about it.

135
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,868
You fell out with your brother.

136
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:30,588
Xiao Xian took away

137
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:32,068
all the assets of Mr. Xiao

138
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,708
and left only Jifeng to you.

139
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:37,908
There's really a resort project

140
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,348
on Damang Mountain.

141
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,188
Mr. Xiao

142
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,628
might have a plan of acquiring

143
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:42,588
the nursing home in secret,

144
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:44,348
but that area is still
under development.

145
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:45,988
There are many unknown variables.

146
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:47,308
For the worst-case scenario,

147
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:49,948
we may lose everything.

148
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,868
I've made up my mind.

149
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:54,988
You don't need to dissuade me anymore.

150
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:58,348
All right.

151
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,268
I'm with you no matter

152
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,148
what you want to do.

153
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:03,548
Although I'm not your biological brother,

154
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:05,228
I'll stay with you

155
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:06,348
to overcome this difficulty.

156
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:09,868
Thank you.

157
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:13,828
I'm going to prepare the room

158
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:14,868
where you once stayed.

159
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:15,908
Save the trouble.

00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,548
White cabbage. Go and get it.

162
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:29,828
I'm doing it.

163
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:31,068
Hurry up. Serve it.

164
00:08:31,308 --> 00:08:32,388
Stop urging me. It's stuck.

165
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:33,148
Sui, you're back?

166
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,028
You're back.

167
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,747
Is it still raining outside?

168
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:38,588
It's still raining.

169
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:41,828
Xiaoran.

170
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,148
How's the interview on Damang Mountain?

171
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:47,188
Don't mention it.

172
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,268
I realised I'll go out of luck

173
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,428
wherever

174
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,188
I meet him.

00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,348
Xiao Shangqi.

177
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,028
Is he back in Wusu?

178
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,468
Did he go to find you?

179
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:01,228
What for?

180
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:02,868
I received a call reporting about

181
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,588
the close down of a nursing home today.

182
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,268
I went for an interview.

183
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:08,268
I didn't expect to meet him there.

184
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:09,948
Is the rumour about him acquiring
the nursing home

185
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:10,628
true?

186
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:11,788
You know about this?

187
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,468
I don't understand.

188
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,628
He should be busy enough in Hupu.

189
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,548
Why does he want to develop in Wusu?

190
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:18,708
You went to his territory?

191
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:19,348
What did he say?

192
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:19,988
Did he give you a hard time?

193
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:20,788
Take a break.

194
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,428
You're more anxious than
the person concerned.

195
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,628
I want to ask something practical.

196
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:26,948
Were you stirred

197
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,628
when you met your ex-boyfriend?

198
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,348
How will that happen?

199
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:32,308
Jifeng is here.

200
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,228
I'll meet him

201
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:34,908
sooner or later.

202
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:35,708
There's nothing special.

203
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,388
Now, it doesn't seem as simple

204
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:39,828
as a meeting.

205
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:40,908
You're probably going to be tangled up

206
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,268
for a while.

207
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,748
He's just everywhere.

208
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:53,828
Come to your sense.

209
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:56,188
They've just broken up.

210
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:57,508
They aren't dead.

211
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,268
What do you mean by that?

212
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,708
I'll make him understand.

213
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:02,148
He can come back to Wusu,

214
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:03,748
but not the past.

215
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:04,428
I'm leaving.

(Today is the 30th, Friday.)

231
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:41,948
(Wusu has a total of)

232
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,668
(seven private nursing homes.)

233
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:44,548
(None of them seems full)

234

235
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:47,628
(I need to check the price difference)

00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:48,908
(and environmental facilities.)

237
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:51,748
(28th, Wednesday.)

238

(The dog is innocent)

242
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:57,868
(in a personal feud.)

243
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:00,588
(27th, Tuesday.)

244
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,188
(Remember to transfer the rental fee)

245
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:03,188
(to Li Hui today)

246
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:03,908
(and buy electricity.)

(is left with one last can.)

249
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:08,348
(There's a campaign
at the convenience store.)

250
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:09,788
(I can go and buy some.)

251
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,588
(Below is the information prepared)

252
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:12,788
(for the interview at 3 p.m.)

00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:14,308
(1st.)

254
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,788
(A new month has begun.)

255

on water-logged road.)

257
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,868
(Wear rain boots next time
when it rains.)

258
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:24,028
(Today is the fifth day of breaking up)

259
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,508
(with Xiao Shangqi.)

260
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,668
(I slept four hours today.)

261
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:29,388
(It's half an hour longer
than yesterday.)

262
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:31,948
(I'll get better.)

263
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,708
(It's over somehow.)

264
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:35,708
(I should move on.)

265
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:37,988
(Thinking a lot)

266
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,748
(won't make the situation better.)

267
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,228
(Get to work.)

268
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,748
(I mustn't let Lili down.)

269
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,000
(Nursing home is about to close,
what about the tens of elderly?)

270
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:07,508
The direction of the public discussion

271
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:09,388
isn't so good.

272
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:16,788
Prepare a press conference for me.

273
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:17,428
Okay.

274
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:29,428
Xiaoran.

275
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,388
I think the data is good.

276
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:32,668
You may go deeper.

277
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:33,828
Make series of report.

278
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:34,708
Okay.

279
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:35,508
I'll find a few more

280
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,508
industry experts and

281
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:37,268
gather

282
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,268
their views and solutions

283
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:39,828
on the similar events.

284
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,510
(You're invited to the press conference
of Qingshan Nursing Home at Jifeng.)

285
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:44,388
Qingshan Nursing Home

286
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:45,508
wants to hold a press conference.

287
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:46,548
Go and make an interview.

288
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:47,588
Find out what they have to say.

289
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:48,188
Okay.

290
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:51,308
Have you changed your fragrance?

291
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,348
It smells good.

292
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:55,668
It may be the sample

293
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,148
given by my friend.

294
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,468
I'll gift it to you
when it goes on sale.

295
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,028
Sure.

296
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,428
Xiaoran.

297
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:17,548
You haven't come for a long while.

298
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:20,668
Where's Qingshan's press conference?

299
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,988
The ballroom is on the left
after exiting the door.

300

Xiaoran.

302
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:39,308
Can you stay out

303
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:40,308
of this matter?

304
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:44,628
Why?

305
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:45,948
Have I got in your way?

306
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:47,668
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:49,388
Not only do I have to look into this,

308
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,788
I also want to do a series of reports

309
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:51,868
and follow-ups.

310

transforming Qingshan Nursing Home.

Due to the short notice,

316
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:05,988
we aren't in time

317
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,468
to prepare tags for all of you.

318

320
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:22,308
Hello, everyone.

321
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,028
I'm Xiao Shangqi.

322
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,868
I'm the new director

323
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:26,788
of Qingshan Nursing Home.

324
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:30,748
The agreement of transfer
has been signed.

325
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:32,308
Relevant procedures

326
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,588
are in orderly progress.

327
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,268
I'll take charge

328
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,708
of Qingshan's affairs.

329
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,988
You should've read the news.

330
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,628
After the transfer is complete,

331
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:43,188
Qingshan Nursing Home

332
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,108
will be transformed into Qingshan Hotel.

333
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:46,308
Although

334
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:47,428
we serve a different group of people,

335
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:49,588
I still hope

336
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,548
to continue the spirit of Qingshan.

337
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,268
That's to stay away
from hustle and bustle,

338
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:54,148
blend in the nature

339
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:55,348
to heal the body and mind.

340
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:00,028
May I know

341
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:01,308
how you'll rehouse

342
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,228
the 57 elderly people

343
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:04,748
currently staying at
Qingshan Nursing Home

344
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:05,868
and what's the duration?

345
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:07,108
We're also concerned about

346
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:08,668
a proper rehousing
of the elderly people.

347
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:09,708
I'd

348
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,148
further increase the compensation

349
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:12,108
by 30%.

350
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:13,948
For those with difficulty,

351
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,268
I'd offer a temporary stay
in Jifeng Hotel

352
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:16,348
for free

353
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,348
until they find

354
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,508
a suitable place.

355
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,108
Has your latest proposal

356
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:20,868
received

357
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,188
their approval?

358
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:23,428
Or

359
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:25,108
is this merely your self-moving

360
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:26,748
or self-persuasion?

361
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:27,588
That's right.

362
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:28,148
How will you

363
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,108
rehouse the elderly people?

364
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:30,188
Will there be other choices

365
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,428
if they refuse to come to Jifeng?

366
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,708
Time is limited for us.

367
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:37,548
Shall we shorten

368
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:38,788
the questioning session a bit?

369
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:43,188
One will think from

370
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,388
his or her own perspective.

371
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:46,828
What the elderly people think

372
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:48,468
is to live the most comfortable

373
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,148
later life

374
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,508
with the least money

375
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:52,428
but in the steadiest way.

376
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:53,308
But from a more macro

377
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:54,348
perspective,

378
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:57,228
Qingshan Nursing Home is a company.

379
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:58,988
Profit is the essence of business.

380
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:00,108
Qingshan has been in the red

381
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:01,228
for seven quarters.

382
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,068
If it goes on losing,

383
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,708
that will be irresponsible
to the employees

384
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,428
and the community.

385
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:08,108
Closing down in a week

386
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:09,908
may sound rather hasty,

387
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,267
but this is the result of a combination

388
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:12,668
of commercial considerations.

389
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:13,588
I got it.

390
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:15,108
The starting point

391
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,787
of your solution is commercial interest.

392
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:18,828
Everything has to give way
to money, right?

393
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,908
One percent of the quarterly profit

394
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:22,828
made by Qingshan Hotel in the future

395
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,988
will be donated to
nursing homes in the city.

396
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,787
We'll use our best way

397
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,188
to fulfil social obligations

398
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,628
and deliver

399
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,788
greater social benefits to everyone.

400
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:34,788
This measurement

401
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:35,348
sounds good.

402
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:36,188
It's certainly not bad.

403
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,348
It's good to the society.

404
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:41,428
I still have one last question.

405
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,908
Yunlan is based in Hupu.

406
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:44,668
Mr. Xiao,

407
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:45,668
why do you want

408
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,188
to leave the major battlefield alone

409
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,748
and choose to expand
business opportunities in Wusu?

410
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,788
Hupu is the red ocean
of business competition

411
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,268
so I want to be

412
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,308
a forerunner in the blue ocean of Wusu.

413
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,388
I happen to get a chance

414
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:01,708
to take over Qingshan.

415
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:02,908
The wetland on Damang Mountain

416
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:03,948
is exceptionally beautiful.

417
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:05,988
I personally like this place
in particular.

418
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:07,788
In my heart,

419
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:08,748
this

420
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,188
is a Xanadu.

421
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:21,948
Do you still have other questions?

422
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,508
We've prepared refreshment

423
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,068
for the media people.

424
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:28,868
If you need it,

425
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:30,548
please proceed to enjoy it
in the lounge area.

426
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:31,388
Thank you, everyone.

427
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,548
Xiaoran,

428
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:46,788
it's been a long while.

429
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,708
Will you dine here tonight?

430
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:49,628
I'll ask Meng to

431
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:50,548
prepare sweet and sour ribs for you.

432
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:51,628
Save the trouble.

433
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:54,628
I know.

434
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:55,508
You aren't on the same page

435
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,068
as him over this matter,

436
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:57,988
but...

437
00:18:58,228 --> 00:18:59,068
You're He Xiaoran, right?

438
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:01,028
I'm Nuo, the hostess of City News.

439
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,388
I finally meet you in person.

440
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:03,868
I have listeners exposing

441
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,468
some social issues to me lately.

442
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:06,268
I'd like to get your advice

443
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:07,308
on how to deal with it.

444
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,308
Just teach me.

445
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,228
I see.

446
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:18,468
I should talk to you more.

447
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:19,228
Xiaoran,

448
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:20,308
let me make a cup of coffee for you.

449
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:22,108
You don't need to.

450
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:25,148
How do I use this?

451
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:30,228
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

452
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:44,188
Be careful, it's hot.

453
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:49,508
Thank you.

454
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:04,068
It's nice.

455
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:05,708
There're two of us.

456
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,348
Aren't you going to make
another cup for Miss He?

457
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,948
I suppose she can make one for herself.

458
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:10,828
Yes.

459
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:13,068
But I'm sick of drinking it.

460
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:15,548
Miss He,

461
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:17,708
are you satisfied with our solution?

462
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:19,348
Mr. Xiao,

463
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:20,828
is your solution

464
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,068
meant to brush us away

465
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,628
or to solve the problem?

466
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:24,868
You shouldn't ask

467
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:25,508
if I'm satisfied or not.

468
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:26,868
You should ask the elderly people

469
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:27,788
in Qingshan.

470
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,500
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

471
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:51,908
Why are you here?

472
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,068
Hui proposes to dine together.

473
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:54,908
I came to pick you up.

474
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:56,428
I met Lili just now.

475
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:57,668
She said you've come to Jifeng.

476
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,508
Qingshan's press conference.

477
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:01,748
Has the thick-skinned Xiao Shangqi

478
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:02,588
come back to find you?

479
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:05,988
Elderly people of the nursing home

480
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,668
sought help from me.

481
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:08,988
I came to do a follow-up.

482
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,628
You exposed him with a news report.

483
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,228
He struck back with a press conference.

484
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:13,228
When will you stop

485
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:14,428
fighting each other?

486
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,268
We're not fighting.

487
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:20,788
Xiaoran,

488
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:22,948
you have someone to pick you up.

489
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:24,948
Mo.

490
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:26,428
Where's Mr. Xiao?

491
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,308
He's busy.

492
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:29,428
All right.

493
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:30,588
Pass him the message for me.

494
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:31,948
Since he's back,

495
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:33,348
he should focus on his career

496
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:34,348
and stay away from us.

497
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:35,948
Enough.

498
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:38,428
Xiaoran, I'm going back to work.

499
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:42,788
It's just

500
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:44,308
a work crossover.

501
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:45,148
You sounded like

502
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,188
I care about it so much.

503
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,548
It's best if you don't care.

504
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:50,308
He gave you up.

505
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,028
Since he's made a choice,

506
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:53,388
it means many things

507
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:54,468
have changed.

508
00:21:56,628 --> 00:21:57,908
Isn't it just about rehousing
the elderly people?

509
00:21:57,948 --> 00:21:58,788
Tell me how many of them.

510
00:21:58,908 --> 00:21:59,548
I'll figure it out for you.

511
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,108
Stay away from him.

512
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:04,268
You're right.

513
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:05,868
Instead of fighting a war of words,

514
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:06,988
I should do something practical.

515
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:08,508
I should look for

516
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:10,348
an institution that
meets the conditions.

517
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:12,588
Let's go.

518
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:14,508
Let's go for dinner.

519
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:27,000
(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

520
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:37,628
You've finally come.

521
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,028
Everyone's glass is empty.

522
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:41,068
We're waiting for you.

523
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:42,348
Okay, let me.

524
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:44,708
Hello.

525
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:45,308
Let me.

526
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:46,308
No worries. I'm on it.

527
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:47,948
Did I call for you?

528
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:51,588
I love to drink

529
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,148
wine served by Xiao Xian.

530
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:56,908
Mr. Zhao, while you're abroad

531
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:58,188
for two weeks,

532
00:22:58,748 --> 00:22:59,748
were you unable

533
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:00,708
to cope without

534
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:01,988
having Xian to serve a drink?

535
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,748
I don't like what you're saying.

536
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:05,548
Xiao Xian knows how to do

537
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:06,108
a lot of things.

538
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:10,308
By the way,

539
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,788
how's Qi lately?

540
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:16,868
He couldn't close any deal.

541
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:18,508
As promised,

542
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:21,028
he's left Yunlan.

543
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,068
What a waste of effort.

544
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:25,668
At least Xian is sensible.

545
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:26,828
Otherwise,

546
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:27,708
Yunlan

547
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,468
might probably be brought down with him.

548
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,268
Don't you agree?

549
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:33,828
He should've

550
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:35,148
returned to Wusu,

551
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:36,588
hiding in his girlfriend's arms.

552
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:38,148
I reckon he's crying.

553
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:43,468
I heard this from someone.

554
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,468
He mortgaged Jifeng

555
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,028
after returning to Wusu.

556
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:49,188
He's acquired a nursing home

557
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,708
on Damang Mountain.

558
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:53,668
Nursing home on Damang Mountain?

559
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:55,188
Was it the hotel sold by Deju

560
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:56,508
several years ago?

561
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:00,468
I'm surprised

562
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:01,748
that he loves to pick up

563
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:02,788
things unwanted by me.

564
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:03,708
Right.

565
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:05,348
Go to the golf club on my behalf

566
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:06,548
tomorrow.

567
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:07,988
Deliver an agreement to Mr. Gao.

568
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,508
If he wants to play,

569
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,388
you may be his company.

570
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:13,708
But I don't know about golf

571
00:24:13,908 --> 00:24:15,188
and it's not convenient for me.

572
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:16,068
Why not...

573
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:20,988
I've

574
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:23,108
forgotten about this.

575
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:27,828
But after all,

576
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,228
we can't make it easy

577
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,468
for ourselves in business.

578
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:34,108
I have no choice.

579
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:36,468
You Xiao family have complicated Deju.

580
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,508
I shouldn't

581
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,868
make the job given to you too easy.

582
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:40,508
Otherwise,

583
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:43,068
others will take Deju as a pushover,

584
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:44,348
don't you think so?

585
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:49,388
All right, I get it.

586
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:53,868
Come on, Mr. Lan.

587
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:55,708
Give Mr. Lan a toast.

588
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:57,028
No.

589
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:57,828
Toast to Mr. Zhao.

590
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:00,388
Cheers.

591
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,348
The greatest advantage
of Qingshan Nursing Home

592
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,868
is its good value for money.

593
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,268
Although it's rather far from town,

594
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:12,388
the environment is good.

595
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,268
It's hard to find one at this price.

596
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:16,868
It's not a problem.

597
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:18,068
I'll find a few friends

598
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:18,948
to explore the bottom price.

599
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:19,828
Besides,

600
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:21,068
there's definitely a discount

601
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:22,308
for so many new clients.

602
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:24,508
This one.

603
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,788
It's priced according to level of care.

604
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,388
But they have quadruple rooms.

605
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:30,908
Qingshan has double rooms.

606
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:32,228
Should we also check

607
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:32,828
its facilities

608
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:34,108
when the time comes?

609
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:35,348
All right.

610
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:36,308
What about this?

611
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,188
I'll take you

612
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:38,308
to a field trip tomorrow.

613
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:40,268
Do your work.

614
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:40,988
I can go myself.

615
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:43,308
I can go to expand my clientele.

616
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,068
Besides,

617
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:45,868
nursing homes use fragrance, too.

618
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:48,748
Sui Mingwei,

619
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,068
do you have what it takes?

620
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:52,468
You've been counting

621
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:53,708
on He Xiaoran to make

622
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:55,228
and sell your things.

623
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:00,588
Counting on the right person
is an ability.

624
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:21,868
Thank you.

625
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:50,108
You didn't break up well

626
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:50,788
with He Xiaoran, did you?

627
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:54,908
I actually thought

628
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,148
you had a peaceful breakup,

629
00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:58,308
but she hadn't come to Jifeng

630
00:26:58,548 --> 00:26:59,748
after that.

631
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:01,588
Looking at the state

632
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:02,868
of your meeting today,

633
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:05,308
it doesn't seem like a clean break.

634
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:11,828
How's that for a clean break?

635
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:14,028
At least you can

636
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:15,308
greet each other when you meet.

637
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:17,788
You refused to tell me

638
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:18,388
when I asked

639
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:19,308
how you broke up last time.

640
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:25,988
Did she leave you

641
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:27,748
after seeing Yunlan in difficulty?

642
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:30,988
She doesn't know about my family.

643
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,108
Not even Mr. Xiao's

644
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:33,908
death?

645
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:38,228
I never wanted her

646
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:39,268
to be affected.

647
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:42,508
Man proposes, god disposes.

648
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:45,468
She got involved somehow.

649
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,268
Does your return

650
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:49,948
have nothing to do

651
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:51,228
with He Xiaoran?

652
00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:56,468
Be honest.

653
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,148
Do you still want to
get back together with her?

654
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:04,628
I don't have the time
to think about it.

655
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:06,748
It's good that she is well.

656
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:08,988
Even if she's together with Sui Mingwei?

657
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,268
I heard Mo and others

658
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:15,028
gossiping.

659
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,188
After Dajiabang has been dismissed,

660
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,268
Sui Mingwei has returned

661
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:19,428
to his family's fragrance factory.

662
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,428
He's developing a retail line.

663
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:22,948
He's now

664
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:23,628
in a totally different condition.

665
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:26,948
Is that so?

666
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:31,148
I heard He Xiaoran asked for the names
of the elderly people

667
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:32,228
from Mr. Wang.

668
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,748
I think the transformation of Qingshan

669
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:36,508
won't go smoothly.

670
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:39,708
You know it's a tough road ahead,

671
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:42,308
but yet you're determined.

672
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:44,388
Is it for the sake of money?

673
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,388
How much do you know about Qingshan?

674
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,668
Not much.

675
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:52,988
Deju ran two hotels

676
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:54,148
in Wusu.

677
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:55,548
The one on Damang Mountain

678
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:56,508
had high land value,

679
00:28:56,788 --> 00:28:58,108
but it didn't meet
the hotel's specifications.

680
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,228
It's sold after it's built.

681
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:02,548
The one who took it over

682
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:03,628
transformed it

683
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:04,548
into a private nursing home.

684
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:05,668
Yes.

685
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:08,748
It's sold at a loss.

686
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:14,268
No matter who stands in my way,

687
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,548
I want to enforce the agreement

688
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,508
between my father and
Qingshan without failure.

689
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:27,628
He died abruptly.

690
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:29,868
It

691
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:32,188
may have

692
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:33,388
his words not said in time.

(Lizhen Nursing Home)

694
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:46,868
Lizhen

695
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:48,308
mainly receives elderly people

696
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,068
who don't require much medical care.

697
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:51,268
The building just now

698
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:52,348
is the accommodation area.

699
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:53,348
Over here, there're canteen

700
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:54,908
and indoor activity area.

701
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,948
Our outdoor activity area

702
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:58,628
is considered large

703
00:29:58,828 --> 00:29:59,668
among the local nursing homes.

704
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:02,228
There're some paid programs

705
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,308
like calligraphy, piano and drawing.

706
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:05,508
Give me a moment.

707
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:07,308
I'm going to bring you

708
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:07,988
a brochure.

709
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,148
Sure, thank you.

710
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:09,748
You're welcome.

711
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:13,588
I think this place

712
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:14,348
is nice.

713
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:16,388
But it costs RMB 500 more than Qingshan

714
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:17,948
per month.

715
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,348
It isn't much.

716
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:21,868
You're fine with it,

717
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:23,188
but the elderly people in a nursing home

718
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:24,148
basically spend on

719
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:25,188
their lifetime savings

720
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:27,068
or their children and
grandchildren's money.

721
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:28,588
They certainly care.

722
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:32,508
Hello.

723
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:33,908
May I know how you feel

724
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:34,908
about staying here?

725
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:37,548
Are you both

726
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:38,268
here to find a place

727
00:30:38,348 --> 00:30:39,868
for the elders in your family?

728
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:42,468
Young people nowadays

729
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,148
don't want to stay with the elders.

730
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:45,668
Yes,

731
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:46,708
we just got married.

732
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:48,388
We can't mistreat our mother

733
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:50,028
who spent years to raise us up.

734
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:51,388
So, we want to find a good place

735
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,148
for her.

736
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:52,948
Sir,

737
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,188
is there anything uncomfortable

738
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:55,468
while you're staying here?

739
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:56,108
Not bad.

740
00:30:57,028 --> 00:30:57,948
Good food.

741
00:30:58,428 --> 00:30:59,108
Good accommodation.

742
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,508
Nice environment, too.

743

Miss He.

744
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:10,428
You're so casual.

745
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:11,828
You should at least heat it up

746
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:12,668
using the microwave.

747
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:14,668
Will it be different when it goes

748
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:15,148
down to your stomach?

749
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:15,828
It's the same.

753
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:57,828
Thanks for today.

Aren't there two homes

756
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,268
showing interest

757
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:03,428
in my fragrance?

758
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:04,628
I should thank you instead.

759
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:06,868
Anyway,

760
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:10,108
don't worry about the price for now.

761
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,188
I'll offer discount for the fragrance

762
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:13,388
and see if he would

763
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,868
reduce the price by 20%.

764
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:15,668
Don't do that.

765
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:17,588
They're two different matters.

766
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:19,588
Don't act like a stranger.

767
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:21,108
I have a dream of becoming

768
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:21,828
a police officer since I was young.

769
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:23,868
Being an assistant

770
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,308
of an investigative journalist

771
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:26,828
is quite like serving justice.

772
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:28,908
Do you still remember

773
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,228
that time when we made a secret visit

774
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:32,348
to the mysterious pet box?

775
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:34,348
It's more exciting than being
a special police officer.

776
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:37,428
Indeed.

777
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:39,988
In this case,

778
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:41,788
you've really helped me a lot.

779
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,748
You should thank me then.

780
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:45,948
Get two ham sausages.

781
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:47,708

The whole pack is yours.

784
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:09,948
Add as many as you like.

785
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:12,828
So generous.

786
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:16,228
Here.

787
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:17,508
Have some orange juice.

788

You deserve it.

791
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,428
We may start eating.

793

Are you Mr. Luo Xingguo?

I am.

795
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:05,708
Please.

796
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:08,827
How many have come?

797
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:10,148
You're the first one.

798
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:11,308
According to the agreement,

799
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:12,827
the first three who sign the agreement

800
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:13,788
may receive an additional

801
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:15,028
RMB 3,000 compensation.

802
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:16,588
You're wise.

803
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,628
The one who comes later

804
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:19,867
will not receive this money.

805
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:20,867
Go through the agreement.

806
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,468
Can you

807
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:24,827
keep the signing of agreement from them
at the moment?

808
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:26,588
Sure.

809
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:30,588
Here.

Mr. Luo,

811
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:42,148
after signing this,

812
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,548
it's a breach of agreement
if you don't leave Qingshan

813
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:45,508
on the day when it's shut down.

814
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,948
This tactic works really well.

815
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:09,308
One can do

816
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,548
the unexpected with petty money.

817
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:13,428
With a good opening,

818
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,228
the rest will be easy.

What?

00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,268
You'll get money if you sign it early?

Take it easy.

You're using a little benefit
to deal with the elderly people.

830
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:09,268
Impressive.

00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:26,428
such an incentive

836
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:27,228

If not,

do you want to take here as your home?

psychological tactics to chase us out.

Settle down?

00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:18,988
Don't get it wrong.

864
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:20,148
I don't want here

865
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,308
to be transformed.

866
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:22,348
Yes.

867
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:23,468
We won't go anywhere.

868
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:24,468
I don't want to move.

869
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:25,508
If I move,

870
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:26,868
my son can't find me

871
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:28,468
when he comes back.
I don't want to move.

872
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:29,428
- I don't want to move.
- Madam.

873
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:30,548
I don't want to move.

874
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,268
Take it easy.

875
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:31,908
We're figuring out a way.

876
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:32,508
Not moving is never

877
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:33,188
an option.

878
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:35,428
The renovation will start

879
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:37,028
on the day of closing it down.

880
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:39,028
I advise all of you to be wiser.

881
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:40,788
Take the compensation the soonest.

882
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:42,508
Go and find a suitable nursing home.

883
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:44,068
Rascal,

884
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,508
you're young but wicked.

885
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:47,948
You're terrible.

886
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:50,308
Mr. Sun.

887
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:51,708
Be careful.

888
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:53,228
What's going on?

889
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:56,268
Make a call.

890
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:57,068
He's fainted.

891
00:37:57,348 --> 00:37:57,828
Make the call now.

892
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:58,348
Do it.

893
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:00,948
I'm going to make a call.

894
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,788
Hello, is this 120?

895
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:03,628
Hurry up! Phone!

896
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:04,400
Hurry up!

897
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,588
(Emergency)
Hurry up!

898
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:07,000
(Emergency)

899
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:12,508
You're quite steady.

900
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,228
You'll be held accountable

901
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:15,308
if anything happens to Mr. Sun.

902
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:18,308
Mr. Sun.

903
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:18,868
How are you?

904
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:20,388
Hurry up!

905
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:21,948
Mr. Sun.

906
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:22,828
I feel bad.

907
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:23,828
Mr. Sun.

908
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:26,988
You said you've explored
some nursing homes.

909
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:28,508
Are you helping me to rehouse them?

910
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,228
Don't flatter yourself.

911
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:31,748
I just want to make good use
of the time

912
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:32,668
by doing something practical.

913
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:38,828
Can you postpone

914
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,148
the day of closing down by a month?

915
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:42,188
It takes a day

916
00:38:42,348 --> 00:38:43,188
for two young people

917
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,068
to visit five nursing homes.

918
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:45,548
They all are aged.

919
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:47,108
How will they possibly settle down

920
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:48,308
in three days?

921
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,348
Two of you?

922
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:51,908
You and Sui Mingwei?

923
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:53,388
Is there a problem?

924
00:38:56,228 --> 00:38:56,628
Thank you

925
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:57,708
for working so hard to help me,

926
00:38:58,388 --> 00:38:58,868
but can you

927
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:00,148
stay out of this?

928
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:01,268
I have my own arrangement.

929
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,468
Don't flatter yourself.

930
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:03,868
It's not you whom I care.

931
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:08,348
Doctor.

932
00:39:08,548 --> 00:39:09,268
What's his condition?

933
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:10,588
He has some chronic diseases,

934
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:12,548
but they aren't the causes
of this fainting.

935
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:14,148
His ECG is quite normal.

936
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:15,148
Do you want to

937
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:16,308
put him under observation

938
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,708
or take him home to rest?

939
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:19,348
Rascal,

940
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:20,748
I want some fruits!

941
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:22,788
He has good spirit and appetite.

942
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:23,908
Advise him

943
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:24,908
to go home early and rest.

944
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:25,428
Thank you, doctor.

945
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:25,988
You're welcome.

946
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:26,748
Thank you.

947
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:30,108
Mr. Xiao.

948
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:31,268
We're lucky this time.

949
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:32,068
It's a close call.

950
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:33,308
You should know

951
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:34,148
you're facing a group of

952
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:35,908
elderly people in their 70s or 80s.

953
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,748
I understand that
you want to do business

954
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:38,708
and make money,

955
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:40,428
but the elderly people

956
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,308
have limited physical

957
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:42,228
and mental capacity.

958
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:43,068
Some of them may really collapse

959
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,308
one day.

960
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:48,548
What attitude is that?

961
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:49,748
Behave yourself.

962
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:04,340
(Wusu Shenghe Hospital)

963
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:07,308
Mr. Xiao.

964
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,668
Mr. Xiao.

965
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:10,108
I'm going to deliver

966
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:11,148
fruits to Mr. Sun.

967
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:11,988
Go ahead.

968
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:12,948
Okay.

969
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:16,108
Mr. Sun turns out

970
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:16,988
to feign an illness.

971
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:18,268
He's hospitalised for a day.

972
00:40:18,508 --> 00:40:19,828
What a trick.

973
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,508
He wants to draw attention.

974
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:22,828
Let him be.

975
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:23,908
If you asked me,

976
00:40:24,148 --> 00:40:25,108
he's the opinion leader

977
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:26,028
in the group.

978
00:40:26,228 --> 00:40:26,868
He's the hardest to deal with.

979
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:29,428
If we can make him move out,

980
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:30,468
the rest will move out

981
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,148
very quickly.

982
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:34,708
Shall we approach his family
to figure out a way?

983
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,308
He has no children, right?

984
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:38,748
He has no children,

985
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,188
but he has a nephew.

986
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:41,828
He'd come to visit him on holidays.

987
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:42,828
Mr. Sun

988
00:40:42,868 --> 00:40:43,708
seems indifferent,

989
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:44,908
but he's nice to his nephew.

990
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:46,028
He treats his nephew like his own son.

991
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:47,108
It's fine.

992
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:50,228
We should still begin with compensation.

993
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:51,628
Take him

994
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,028
to visit a few more nursing homes

995
00:40:53,588 --> 00:40:54,540
until he likes one of them.

996
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,868
We should hit where it hurts.

997
00:40:58,028 --> 00:40:59,228
Don't do anything useless.

998
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:00,668
Give his nephew some benefits.

999
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:01,948
It can be settled at once.

1000
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:03,428
It's not honourable

1001
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:04,628
to use money already.

1002
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:06,668
There's no need to
make use of gratitude.

1003
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:08,468
Mr. Xiao.

1004
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:10,508
I can't figure you out

1005
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,508
sometimes.

1006
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,348
A while ago, you seemed
to be a businessman

1007
00:41:13,548 --> 00:41:14,628
who only recognises money and agreement.

1008
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:16,188
After that, you show a bit of humanity.

1009
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:18,308
I'm going up

1010
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:19,268

1011

00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:28,068
Thank you, Hao.

1036
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:30,468
Hui,

1037
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:31,868
do you really want

1038
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:32,748
to sing here

1039
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:33,708
forever?

1040
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:34,708
Is it meaningful to make petty money

1041
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:36,028
as a part-timer?

1042
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:37,548
Are you sick of my singing,

1043
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:38,268
so you want to replace me?

1044
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,388
No, don't overthink it.

1045
00:42:39,388 --> 00:42:40,188
It's surely not.

1046
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,188
I think

1047
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:43,748
you're quite talented.

1048
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,668
It's a waste of talent
singing at my place.

1049
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:47,148
Is it a waste of talent

1050
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,348
singing at your place?

1051
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:49,148
What a joke.

1052
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:49,868
No.

1053
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:50,668
Give it a good thought.

1054
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:51,588
I mean it.

1055
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:53,508
See you, Hao.

1056
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:57,588
Well,

1057
00:42:58,148 --> 00:42:59,668
Hao is right.

1058
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:01,628
How long do you want

1059
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,108
to work as a part-timer here?
