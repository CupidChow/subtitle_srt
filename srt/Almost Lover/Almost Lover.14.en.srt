17
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:41,704
Yunlan will be yours for sure.

18
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:43,704
Don't forget

19
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,104
that I've helped you today

20
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:46,784
by that time.

21
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:48,864
We're leaving.

22
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,064
Take care.

23
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:22,904
I've tried to invite Mr. Lan
for many years

24
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:23,584
in Yunlan,

25
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:24,544
but I've never made it.

26
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:25,864
I didn't know you could

27
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:26,744
just ask him out just like that.

28
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,504
It was because of the invitation letter.

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,224
When you said you wanted
to try other ways,

30
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,664
I thought you were joking.

31
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:35,864
I didn't know you've done something

32
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,784
so soon.

33
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:39,344
After all these years,

34
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:40,904
you've certainly improved a lot.

35
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:43,704
I remember

36
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:45,584
the time when I was
still able to play basketball,

37
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,424
my position was guard.

38
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,744
I liked that feeling

39
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,584
of controlling the entire floor.

40
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,424
Then, I can't play anymore.

41
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,544
But, in the business arena,

42
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,304
I felt like I've found

43
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:00,064
that feeling again.

44
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:01,944
It's good.

45
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:02,984
Xian,

46
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,744
just tell me what you want to say.

47
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:11,064
Let me follow up on

48
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:12,584
Mr. Lan's business deal.

49
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:14,384
Can I?

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,504
Miss Chen,

51
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,664
the bridesmaid is not here yet.

52
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:36,584
I want it to end at 9 p.m.

53
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:37,584
yet she didn't come early.

54
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,184
Let's wait for a while.

55
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,344
It's raining today.

56
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:42,544
The traffic is bad.

57
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:44,304
Got it.

58
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,264
(Today, the city is
in a rare traffic congestion.)

59
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:55,944
(The congestion index)

60
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,904
(is at its new high this year.)

61
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:58,984
(A concert)

62
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:00,144
(has stopped a city.)

63
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:01,504
(And it's raining.)

64
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,704
(If you're at home)

65
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:03,544
(now,)

66
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,464
(don't go out.)

67
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:05,624
It's raining again.

68
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:06,824
Sir.

69
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,144
Why are you here?

70
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,224
You were sleeping like a baby.

71
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:15,544
You won't know what happened.

72
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,624
Why are you here?

73
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:21,303
The driver said the car is broken.

74
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:22,104
That's why I came here.

75
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:23,784
He's asking for help now.

76
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:29,544
Fei'er is still waiting for me.

77
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:31,464
I've told her that

78
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:32,304
you're not going.

79
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:34,304
What did she say?

80
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:36,704
What else can she say?

81
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:37,824
It's not easy for you

82
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:39,344
to come back to Hupu.

83
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:40,624
Besides training, you've given

84
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:41,984
all your time to others.

85
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,584
I've just met you twice.

86
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:44,584
I feel sad.

87
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,224
I'm quite happy.

88
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:52,544
Do you want to eat something?

89
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:54,224
After the meal,

90
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,944
I'll send you home and
you can take a good rest.

91
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,024
The rain is heavy.

92
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:03,664
I know where to go.

93
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:05,024
Let's go.

94
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:06,864
Where are we going?

95
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:09,104
It's raining.

96
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:10,824
Come on.

97
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:12,024
It's raining.

98
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:14,144

This is where you stay?

118
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,304
It's distributed by
the training program.

119
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:33,504
That room is mine.

120
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,144
There are some snacks in there.

121
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:36,064
I'm quite busy these few days.

122
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:37,064
So, I didn't go home.

123
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:37,704
I'm staying here.

124
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,504
It's near the training program.

125
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:42,584
Don't misunderstand.

126
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:43,944
I just think that

127
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,424
it's too congesting out there.

128
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:47,504
Since we get to be

129
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:48,184
together,

130
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,544
I don't want to waste time.

131
00:06:59,424 --> 00:06:59,984
I'm so tired.

132
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:01,984
Is your homework done?

133
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,784
You made it look like it's a crime.

134
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:10,944
We'll be misunderstood for sure.

135
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:13,624
I don't want others to gossip about it.

136
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,104
The sensor is old.

137
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:50,624
What are you doing?

138
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,304
Do you want to take a shower first?

139
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:02,344
I mean

140
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:03,224
you have got no time

141
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:04,944
to get sick.

142
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:29,744
Why are you in a mess?

143
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:32,104
It's raining out there.

144
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,583
The traffic at the street

145
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:35,304
was like an hour or so.

146
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:36,744
I got down from the car and walked home.

147
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:39,063
Fei'er,

148
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:41,784
Madam Wang's tea to dispel alcohol

149
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:43,184
is so much worse

150
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:44,624
than the one you made.

151
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:47,144
I'm just following the recipe,

152
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:48,264
but...

153
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:48,904
Madam Wang,

154
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:50,824
go back and rest.

155
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:51,704
I'll do it.

156
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,224
I'll cook another pot for you.

157
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:00,744
I'll also prepare some fruits.

158
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:04,864
Still, you know me well.

159
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,624
Tomorrow, I'll get
the public relation department

160
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:24,024
to arrange a photoshoot

161
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:26,144
of your charity donation.

162
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:28,264
I've spent so much effort

163
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,784
to shape your image.

164
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,504
You look nothing

165
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,864
like the wife

166
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:39,264
of Deju's CEO.

167
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:41,624
Okay.

168
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:42,904
I got it.

169
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,584
I'll go get changed.

170
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
(Ruijia Orphanage)

171
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,024
What did you do last night?

172
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:06,664
Being your bridesmaid

173
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:07,304
is tiring.

174
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:08,224
I slept on the way here.

175
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:10,824
You've rested

176
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:11,864
and you're not tired anymore.

177
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:22,424
Run now!

178
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:23,344
Run now!

179
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:24,264
Go get the gifts! Hurry!

180
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:26,384
Okay.

181
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,384
Okay, go have fun.

182
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:31,184
Miss Chen,

183
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:32,504
the photos are not good.

184
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:33,984
Why not we take some photos

185
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,344
of you teaching

186
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:35,904
the kids piano?

187
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:38,944
Xiaoran,

188
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,344
go get the photographer some water.

189
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:42,264
It's not easy for him.

190
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:43,144
Okay.

191
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:43,944
I'm tired watching him.

192
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:45,504
Here, sir.

193
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:46,504
Thank you.

194
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:48,104
Kids.

195
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:48,944
Kids.

196
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:49,904
Let's take some more photos,

197
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:50,264
okay?

198
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:51,824
Let me teach you Twinkle Little Star,

199
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,344
okay?

200
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:53,544
I don't want!

201
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:55,424
I don't want!

202
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,224
Why not you squat down

203
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,504
and look at them at their eye level?

204
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,744
You're quite experienced.

205
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,864
Do you have a kid?

206
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,304
A five-year-old boy

207
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:06,264
is my best friend.

208
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:07,504
Taiyang will be happy

209
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:08,704
if he knows you think about him

210
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:09,744
wherever you go.

211
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:11,624
Shangqi.

212
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:13,744
This is my wedding planner

213
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:15,064
and my best friend, Xiao Shangqi.

214
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:16,424
I've heard of him.

215
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:17,024
Hello.

216
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:17,424
Hello.

217
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:18,424
I was not far away from here,

218
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:19,624
so I dropped by.

219
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,384
Who are you to her?

220
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,784
I'm her boyfriend.

221
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,624
Boyfriend.

222
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,224
How could it be?

223
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:32,744
No way.

224
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:38,904
Be serious.

225
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,064
One, two, three, we are all wooden men!

226
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:42,064
Look here.

227
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:43,064
You moved, go back!

228
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:43,664
You moved!

229
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:44,824
Let's play for a while, okay?

230
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,424
I want to play with them.

231
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,704
One, two, three, we are all wooden men!

232
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:54,464
One, two, three, we are all wooden men!

233
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:56,784
You moved!

234
00:11:58,464 --> 00:11:59,264
No!

235
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:01,664
No!

236
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:02,984
You moved!

237
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:12,704
He Xiaoran?

238
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:14,624
It's really you.

239
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:15,384
Diao?

240
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:16,904
We haven't met

241
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,464
after graduation.

242
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:19,864
Why are you?

243
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,224
Go.

244
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:21,904
Go have fun there.

245
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:22,944
Is your body getting better?

246
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:24,024
Go.

247
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:25,584
I'm okay.

248
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:27,344
Xiao Shangqi?

249
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:28,664
You two...

250
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:29,904
Yes.

251
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:32,224
My goodness.

252
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:34,504
You're being together.

253
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:37,264
Then

254
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,064
the rumor in the group is fake.

255
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:41,144
Group?

256
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:42,424
What rumor?

257
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:45,464
They said you have depression.

258
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:48,024
You and your parents have
gone to other places for treatment.

259
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:51,304
Also, they said Xiao Shangqi
and Chen Fei'er

260
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,584
have gone overseas together

261
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,224
and you committed suicide for that.

262
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:55,344
What?

263
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,104
They're being ridiculous.

264
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,224
Is it a chat group for the classmates?

265
00:12:59,584 --> 00:12:59,904
Here.

266
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:01,024
Add me into the group.

267
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:01,464
Okay.

268
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:10,304
Okay.

269
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,024
Don't argue with them.

270
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,744
You're being shortchanged because of me.

271
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:17,544
I'll never let anyone

272
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:18,744
spread any rumor about you anymore.

273
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:24,544
Fei'er?

274
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:26,304
I didn't know after so many years,

275
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:27,784
you're still each other's best friends.

276
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:29,624
Goddess, let me add you to the group.

277
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:31,784
Maybe next time.

278
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,504
I'm charging my phone in the car.

279
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:36,984
Look.

280
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,824
Everyone is blessing us.

281
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,424
(You're being together.)

282
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,424
(So happy.)

283
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:43,384
(Congratulations.)

284
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:44,584
(I knew it though.)

285
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,944
(I knew you'll get together.)

286
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:58,224
Shangqi,

287
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,544
any hotel recommendation
for my honeymoon?

288
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,024
The previous hotel's

289
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:03,424
pillows are not comfortable.

290
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:05,864
As for hotels,

291
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:07,464
Mingxuan is quite picky about it.

292
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:08,664
Just let him choose for you.

293
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:11,464
Here we go.

294
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:13,304
Here we go.

295
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,784
Here, fried seafood

296
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,384
and grilled fish belly.

297
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:19,584
Thank you.

298
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:20,264
Enjoy.

299
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,264
Okay. Thank you, sir.

300
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:21,624
Okay.

301
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,384
Let's try this first.

302
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:27,504
Well, Fei'er,

303
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:29,424
I've hired an assistant for you.

304
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,384
From tomorrow onwards,

305
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,784
just look for her.

306
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:35,064
Xiaoran has come to Hupu this time

307
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:36,144
for training.

308
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:37,384
Doing two things at the same time

309
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:38,904
is too much for her.

310
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:40,904
It's my fault.

311
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,584
I didn't think of it.

312
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:44,024
I didn't know you have so many

313
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:44,824
things to do.

314
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,024
Xiaoran,

315
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:47,744
are you not feeling well?

316
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,784
I've been feeling dizzy lately.

317
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:57,224
Since Shangqi has said so,

318
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:58,304
I'll listen to him.

319
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,024
Eat this fish belly.

320
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:08,264
It's tasty.

321
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:09,064
It's tasty?

322
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,624
Do you even eat inner organs?

323
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:18,464
Wusu's grilled fish belly

324
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:19,384
has changed him.

325
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:25,944
Sir,

326
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,384
five more grilled fish belly.

327
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:29,424
I'm so sorry.

328
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:30,744
It's sold out.

329
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:34,984
Here's another one for you.

330
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:40,664
It's tasty.

331
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:43,704
Eat some.

332
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:48,464
What sound is that?

333
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,064
Sir,

334
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,264
what song is that?

335
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:53,304
It's a hit song.

336
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,584
It's called "Yes".

337
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:57,784
"Yes"?

338
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,480
("Yes" demo by Susan)

339
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:03,064
Stop playing it.

340
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,290
(Her voice is amazing.)

341
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:08,744
(Her voice is amazing.)
Hui,

342
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,184
(Her voice is amazing.)
didn't you write this song

343
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:10,904
(Her voice is amazing.)
for Tang Yan?

344
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,344
Why did she publish it in her album?

345
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:17,064
Is Li Hui okay?

346
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,224
She's venting her anger now.

347
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:21,984
I'll go look for

348
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:22,824
that rascal.

349
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:23,464
How could Tang Yan

350
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:24,584
do this after they broke up?

351
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,144
You

352
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,464
should think about
how to comfort Li Hui.

353
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:07,704
What?

354
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:08,944
You have no appetite?

355
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:14,743
I just feel like

356
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,223
so many foods

357
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,064
taste better when we fight for it

358
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:18,944
like when we were young.

359
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:25,464
Fei'er.

360
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:27,983
You don't have to go back

361
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:29,504
to your old life

362
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,104
and fight for food with others.

363
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:46,024
No need to wait for me tonight.

364
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:47,704
I need to go out.

365
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:07,984
You're here.

366
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:12,504
Xiaoran,

367
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,704
isn't your training taking
only half a day?

368
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:15,744
What took you so long?

369
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,584
Shangqi and I have been waiting for you.

370
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,024
You...

371
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:22,384
Let's go.

372
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:23,464
If we're late,

373
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:24,664
the lighting will not be nice.

374
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:26,344
Where are we going?

375
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:30,144
Don't tell her. Give her a surprise.

376
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:33,904
Okay.

377
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:34,464
Okay.

378
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:44,824
Look at the camera.

379
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,104
Three, two, one.

380
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:47,584
Great. Come on.

381
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:48,544
Get closer.

382
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:50,144
Look at the camera. Come on.

383
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:51,144
Come on. Smile.

384
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:51,864
Be happy.

385
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,304
Come on. Three, two, one.

386
00:18:59,024 --> 00:18:59,704
You seem to be good at playing this.

387
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:00,744
I'm not going to take it with me.

388
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:01,544
Here you go.

389
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:03,224
I have been loving you for so long

390
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,024
willingly.

391
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:05,984
He Xiaoran,

392
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,504
your open confession

393
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,264
is better than the song dedication.

394
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:10,184
Xiao Shangqi has been frightened by you

395
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,184
and fled overseas overnight.

396
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,064
This is not bad.

397
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:14,784
Why not we take a break?

398
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:15,624
Mr. Xiao.

399
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:16,624
Take a look.

400
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:17,144
Okay.

401
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:19,344
Take a look.

402
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:21,344
Okay.

403
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:22,104
Hold this for me.

404
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:23,464
Thank you.

405
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:25,744
This is not bad.

406
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:26,504
Not bad.

407
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:28,544
Are you surprised?

408
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:30,464
We went back in time.

409
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,624
We need some photos in the wedding.

410
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:34,504
You know.

411
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,264
We left the country in a hurry.

412
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:37,944
We weren't in time to
take the graduation photos.

413
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:39,264
I wanted to find a photography studio

414
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:40,464
to simply take one,

415
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,264
but the feeling is not right.

416
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:43,584
After I discussed with Shangqi,

417
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,384
we just asked you to come back to school
and take the photo.

418
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:47,504
It's just a

419
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,344
simple photo.

420
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,744
You're really looking into the details.

421
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:52,024
Shangqi is detailed.

422
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:56,384
Xiaoran,

423
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:58,304
if nothing happened

424
00:19:58,544 --> 00:19:59,864
back then,

425
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:01,024
we would've

426
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,024
graduated like this.

427
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:03,624
What would've happened to us?

428
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:05,904
I don't know.

429
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:10,384
What do you think?

430
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:12,784
Shangqi has become a gentle man

431
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:13,904
from

432
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:14,864
a young boy.

433
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:18,024
Don't you think I contributed to it?

434
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,984
Although I didn't accept him,

435
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:21,144
if he didn't

436
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,904
keep pursuing me,

437
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:24,824
will he be able to love

438
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,144
a girl now?

439
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:29,384
I remember that was a weekend

440
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:30,424
when I was in university.

441
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,944
I was locked outside the door.

442
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,504
He was pulling me at night,

443
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:34,624
looking everywhere for

444
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,104
the noodles that I wanted to eat.

445
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:37,904
Eventually, we found the restaurant.

446
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:38,864
They were not willing to cook.

447
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:40,264
So, he went to the kitchen

448
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:41,264
and cooked for me.

449
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,304
Honestly,

450
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:43,264
the taste was awful.

451
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:44,464
Fei'er, I need to use the washroom.

452
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:14,344
Are you tired from the photoshooting?

453
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:19,544
You seem quite happy.

454
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:26,704
I thought Fei'er

455
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:28,264
was a little too much doing that,

456
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:30,624
but after going back to school,

457
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:32,064
it was not bad.

458
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,144
It reminded me of many things.

459
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:41,584
Do the dishes

460
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,064
suit your taste?

461
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:47,424
The meat is overcooked
and the vegetable is a bit salty.

462
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,104
The rest is sweet.

463
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,104
It's not as good as Jifeng.

464
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:55,744
You've only been here for a few days

465
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,384
and you missed the dishes
in Wusu already.

466
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:01,664
Wait for me.

467
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:02,664
I'll be right back.

468
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:16,984
Here.

469
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:18,544
Here.

470
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,264
How can my girlfriend

471
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:21,744
be starving?

472
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:24,104
Try what your boyfriend cooked.

473
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,064
This is Jifeng's signature
Yang Chun Noodles.

474
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:31,464
(Although I didn't accept him,)

475
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:32,584
(if he didn't)

476
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:34,224
keep pursuing me,

477
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:36,024
will he be able to love

478
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:38,144
a girl now?

479
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:42,864
Actually, I don't feel
like eating noodles.

480
00:22:46,504 --> 00:22:47,264
What would you like to eat?

481
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:47,944
I'll order it.

482
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:49,344
No need.

483
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,704
Actually, I'm not too hungry.

484
00:22:52,144 --> 00:22:53,424
I'm tired. I want to go home.

485
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:55,864
Okay.

486
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:57,984
Let's go. I'll send you home.

487
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:04,784
Take your belongings.

488
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:29,264
Why are you here?

489
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:30,664
For breakfast.

490
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:35,144
I just did my exercise.

491
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:36,304
I can't help

492
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:37,704
but to eat something.

493
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:42,784
Go to the restaurant.

494
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:44,744
Go to the restaurant?

495
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,584
I can only order black coffee
and salads.

496
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:48,784
The wedding is around the corner.

497
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:51,184
Everyone wants me to
control my weight.

498
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:53,144
I can only indulge myself here.

499
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
You must keep it a secret for me.

500
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,224
Well,

501
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:58,424
Yunduan's sandwich and croissant

502
00:23:58,584 --> 00:23:59,224
are not bad.

503
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:00,024
Have you tried it before?

504
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:03,224
You're going out?

505
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,064
Are you afraid that Xiaoran
will misunderstand us?

506
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,104
If your girlfriend was someone else,

507
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,224
I might be concerned.

508
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:16,144
But I'm fine if it's Xiaoran.

509
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:18,304
The three of us are best friends.

510
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:19,904
Xiaoran is well aware of that.

511
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:21,504
If you and I are up to something,

512
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:22,624
it could've happened long ago.

513
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:24,904
Fei'er,

514
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:29,584
if you still treat Xiaoran
as your friend,

515
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:31,664
please keep the boundary.

516
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:33,664
This is respect.

517
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,860
(Remember to eat one every day)

518
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:15,864
(He Xiaoran)
(Xiaoran,)

519
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:17,984
(come with me to a place
in the afternoon.)

520
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,290
(Remember to eat one every day)

521
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,144
Why did you think of
digging this suddenly?

522
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:32,864
It's long passed the set time.

523
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,904
I should've asked Shangqi
to come together.

524
00:25:35,264 --> 00:25:37,504
But he's too busy.

525
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:38,144
Well,

526
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:39,184
where is yours?

527
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:42,864
I've dug it out.

528
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:46,464
Didn't we agree

529
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:47,744
to share it

530
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:49,184
when we dig it out on the same day?

531
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:03,824
To 25-year-old Chen Fei'er,

532
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:05,784
I only have two wishes.

533
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,784
First,

534
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:08,624
I want to find myself a warm home.

535
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:12,384
Second,

536
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:14,824
Triangle will stay together forever.

537
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:19,264
It looks like I'm the winner in life.

538
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:21,504
Both my wishes have come true.

539
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:44,344
Look at Shangqi's.

540
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:45,664
Let him...

541
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:54,624
(I wish I can stay)

542
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,944
(by Fei'er's side to protect her.)

543
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:57,624
(I wish Xiaoran's dream)

544
00:26:58,064 --> 00:26:58,704
(of becoming the war correspondent)

545
00:26:58,704 --> 00:26:59,864
(will come true soon.)

546
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:35,024
What if

547
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:35,904
your wishes don't come true

548
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:36,704
seven years later?

549
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:38,384
No way.

550
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,664
It will surely come true.

551
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:42,904
What about you?

552
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:44,704
Even if seven years are not enough,

553
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:45,664
I have a lifetime to realize it.

554
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:00,944
Xiaoran,

555
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:02,064
I'm sorry.

556
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,304
I should've thought of it earlier.

557
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:07,104
No worries.

558
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,144
It's all in the past now

559
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:10,264
and it's not a secret.

560
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:18,704
Xiaoran,

561
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:20,184
have you try Yunduan's

562
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:21,064
pretzel?

563
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:22,544
Try it if you have time.

564
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,464
It's not bad.

565
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:31,584
Xiaoran,

566
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,304
you might need to

567
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:33,944
wait for me.

568
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,704
Go ahead. No need to worry about me.

569
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:37,304
Well,

570
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:39,824
there's a high tea buffet.

571
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:40,864
Go and eat something.

572
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:41,624
It's free.

573
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,104
They know you.

574
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:44,944
I'm hanging up now.

575
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:57,064
Hello, Miss He.

576
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,984
Are you looking for pretzel?

577
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:00,184
The pretzel you ordered

578
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:01,104
in Mr. Xiao's room

579
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:01,944
yesterday morning

580
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:02,584
is there.

581
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:04,864
I didn't order that.

582
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,064
Sorry, I made a mistake.

583
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:08,224
Please choose for yourself.

584
00:29:13,264 --> 00:29:13,864
Have you tried Yunduan's

585
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:14,864
pretzel?

586
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,344
Try it if you have time.

587
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,224
It's not bad.

588
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:25,384
(Xiaoran,)

589
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:26,664
(something urgent happened.)

590
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:27,784
(I can't make it.)

591
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,024
(Come to this address)

592
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:29,464
(to look for me.)

593
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:33,104
Yes.

594
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:34,504
One layer of cherry and

595
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:35,544
one layer of rock candy

596
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:36,544
spread in layers.

597
00:29:38,464 --> 00:29:39,064
Generally, how long does it take to

598
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:40,584
brew the fruit wine?

599
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:41,624
Generally speaking,

600
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:42,344
the color is attractive enough

601
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:44,144
after three months.

602
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:45,344
However,

603
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:46,824
it takes at least one year

604
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,584
to brew a nice bottle of wine.

605
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:51,024
Of course, many things

606
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,704
could've changed

607
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:53,784
in a year.

608
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:54,664
Only time can tell

609
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,344
whether the wine will turn out sweet

610
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:59,104
or bitter.

611
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:07,784
Xiaoran,

612
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:09,544
why do I think that

613
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:10,464
you're beside yourself?

614
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:14,384
No.

615
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:17,424
Yunduan is getting fruit supply

616
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:19,224
from this orchard.

617
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:20,664
This season is

618
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:21,784
the most suitable to brew fruit wine.

619
00:30:24,384 --> 00:30:25,464
I came here today

620
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:26,584
for a business deal,

621
00:30:26,904 --> 00:30:27,904
so I was delayed.

622
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:30,544
So, I thought of asking you here

623
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,624
for a walk.

624
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:33,584
How's it?

625
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:35,824
Is the recent training tiring?

626
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:38,504
It's about to end soon.

627
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:39,504
I have a lot of homeworks.

628
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:40,264
Really?

629
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:47,584
The waitress in the hotel lobby

630
00:30:48,784 --> 00:30:50,264
told me that...

631
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,144
Excuse me.

632
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:53,944
Pick it up first.

633
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:01,064
Hello, Fei'er.

634
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:03,544
I'm outside.

635
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:05,584
We can talk at night
if there's anything.

636
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:06,104
Many young couples

637
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:07,264
would come here

638
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:08,504
to brew fruit wine.

639
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,144
It's considered

640
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:10,864
the extension of promise.

641
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:12,584
By this time next year,

642
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:14,344
you two will come back here again

643
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:16,024
to open the wine

644
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:17,224
and taste it.

645
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:18,064
It will become

646
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:19,464
very meaningful.

647
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:23,064
I have a small piece of card here.

648
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:23,944
You can write something

649
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:25,104
on it.

650
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,224
Open and show it next year.

651
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,344
One year is too long.

652
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:32,064
Who knows what will happen

653
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:32,944
in a year?

654
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:41,344
I'll get the car first.

655
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,024
Xiao Shangqi,

656
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:44,984
why are you in a hurry?

657
00:31:45,544 --> 00:31:46,304
If you're so eager to

658
00:31:46,544 --> 00:31:47,864
meet someone,

659
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:48,904
you could've said it just now.

660
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:50,224
I can get a taxi home.

661
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:53,984
Xiaoran,

662
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:57,024
what are you thinking lately?

663
00:31:58,784 --> 00:31:59,464
Nothing.

664
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:01,064
Nothing?

665
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:02,104
Then why are you

666
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,144
behaving so strangely lately?

667
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:04,424
I called you at night

668
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,024
and you just hung up
after saying a few words.

669
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,224
Yes,

670
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,224
I'm in a hurry.

671
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:09,784
I cancelled three meetings
in the afternoon

672
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:10,824
so that I can spend more time

673
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:11,584
with you.

674
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:12,384
What about you?

675
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,224
But, you're just forcing yourself

676
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:14,664
to keep me company.

677
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:15,664
You're complaining about me
in your heart

678
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:16,504
that I've used up your time,

679
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:17,064
aren't you?

680
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:17,984
Do you know after you picked up

681
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:18,824
Chen Fei'er's call,

682
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,344
you've become so beside yourself?

683
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:22,984
I'm beside myself?

684
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,224
I'm angry because

685
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:24,784
you said you don't know

686
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,744
what will happen a year later.

687
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:27,944
Then what's the purpose of us

688
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:28,664
getting together?

689
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:30,344
Enjoy the moment?

690
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:33,784
So, you treat me like this now

691
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:35,304
because you're bored of me?

692
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:37,584
Don't you try to

693
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:38,424
change the subject.

694
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:41,104
Didn't she go to your room?

695
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:46,304
Xiao Shangqi,

696
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:48,624
if you chose me

697
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:50,384
because I'm the second best choice,

698
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:51,344
then I'd rather just want

699
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:52,384
unrequited love

700
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:54,144
than being in a relationship

701
00:32:54,544 --> 00:32:55,544
covered

702
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:56,224
by your first love

703
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:57,384
like now.

704
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:03,584
Xiaoran,

705
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:04,904
I thought we've been together

706
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:06,264
for such a long time,

707
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:08,744
we should at least have some
mutual understanding and trust.

708
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,144
I think I trusted you too much.

709
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:16,304
Xiaoran.

710
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:33,664
Mingxuan.

711
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:34,144
Here.

712
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:35,504
You're here, Qi.

713
00:33:36,024 --> 00:33:36,784
You're late.

714
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:37,784
Drink the wine.

715
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:38,544
Okay.

716
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,664
You're good at drinking.

717
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:45,304
This must be Mr. Xiao Shangqi
from Yunlan.

718
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:46,384
Not bad.

719
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:48,544
Qi

720
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:49,384
grew up on my watch

721
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:50,704
since young.

722
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:52,664
He always called me Mingxuan

723
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,624
and picked up balls for me.

724
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:54,584
Isn't that right?

725
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:57,304
Jifeng Hotel in Wusu

726
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:58,144
is managed by you, right?

727
00:33:58,384 --> 00:33:58,624
Yes.

728
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:01,064
You've done quite a few things there.

729
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:01,984
Thank you.

730
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:02,704
Mr. Zhao,

731
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:04,744
you asked him to plan
the wedding for you.

732
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:06,144
Isn't that wasting his time and talents?

733
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:08,824
Qi

734
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,904
was Fei'er's high school classmate.

735
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:12,984
When he started to grow up,

736
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,344
he even pursued Fei'er before.

737
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:15,264
Really?

738
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:16,063
He knows her well.

739
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,623
Why are you talking about this?

740
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:23,904
It's in the past.

741
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:24,984
Now,

742
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,143
I have a girlfriend.

743
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,824
What a shame.

744
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:31,384
Qi looks smart.

745
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:32,504
I have a niece.

746
00:34:32,744 --> 00:34:33,623
She's single.

747
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,944
Li has seen her before,

748
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:35,424
right?

749
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:38,103
Mr. Xiao Shangqi,
you can think about it.

750
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,583
Her family background

751
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:41,944
is much better than
your current girlfriend.

752
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:44,704
Why do you need to shortchange yourself?

753
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:49,224
Mingxuan,

754
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,583
has your secretary

755
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:53,464
followed you for too long

756
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:56,583
that he has forgotten his place?

757
00:34:58,704 --> 00:34:59,464
Why not

758
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:01,424
you just fire him?

759
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,144
I'll get someone better.

760
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:04,624
Qi,

761
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:05,624
no need.

762
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:07,184
Mingxuan,

763
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:09,304
you always tell others that

764
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:10,824
I'm just like your biological brother.

765
00:35:11,064 --> 00:35:11,984
Since I'm like your biological brother,

766
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,344
you should take care of me.

767
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:16,064
Otherwise,

768
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:17,704
I'll clear the score with you.

769
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:25,504
Jifeng Hotel's fake video

770
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:26,384
was arranged by you, right?

771
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:29,784
And that head chef.

772
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,224
I heard you paid him to do that.

773
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:33,944
Mr. Zhao.

774
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:34,664
Li,

775
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:37,224
go to the human resources department

776
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:38,824
to proceed with the resignation.

777
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:41,064
You're messing up with Qi.

778
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:42,504
It means you're messing up with me.

779
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:45,184
Thank you, Mingxuan.

780
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,664
Come on.

781
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:55,544
Come on. Let's drink.

782
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:56,144
Come on.

783
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,904
You came home early lately.

784
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,744
You even have time to
take a walk with me.

785
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:12,824
You're not going for a date?

786
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:17,784
Mother.

787
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,664
I want to ask you a question.

788
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:26,224
Before you and father got married,

789
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:29,264
was he in love with others?

790
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:33,104
Why are you asking this?

791
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:36,584
I don't know why either.

792
00:36:36,824 --> 00:36:39,104
I can't help but to be mindful

793
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:40,264
about him

794
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:41,904
falling in love with others in the past.

795
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:45,344
I can't help but to compare about it.

796
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,464
Did he do

797
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:48,784
what he's doing for me

798
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,344
for someone else before?

799
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,224
Does he really love me

800
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:53,264
or

801
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,744
he's just used to me being around him?

802
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,464
Xiaoran,

803
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,824
you've all grown up.

804
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:06,144
You're troubled by relationship issue now.

805
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:08,344
Mother.

806
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,904
Actually, to me,

807
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:12,024
you and Qi have known

808
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:12,824
each other for many years.

809
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,704
Sometimes,

810
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:14,944
you're good friends.

811
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:16,464
Sometimes, you're dating.

812
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:17,704
I don't know

813
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:18,464
what you young people

814
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:19,944
are thinking.

815
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:22,184
Actually,

816
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:23,544
to be honest, I was

817
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,544
quite worried about you.

818
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:26,704
Lately,

819
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:28,224
I'm not worried anymore.

820
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:30,144
You've changed so much.

821
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:30,984
Do you know that?

822
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:33,064
Really?

823
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:36,264
A good relationship

824
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,424
will make you shine.

825
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:39,944
Look at you now.

826
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,584
I can tell my daughter

827
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,864
is loved and cared by someone.

828
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:48,904
However,

829
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:50,144
I'm telling you,

830
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:51,744
the most important thing

831
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:52,944
in a relationship is that

832
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,544
you need to trust each other.

833
00:37:57,384 --> 00:37:58,344
No matter what happened,

834
00:37:58,464 --> 00:37:59,824
and we just trust blindly?

835
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,664
How can you just trust
each other blindly?

836
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,304
You need to communicate,

837
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:04,144
right?

838
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,664
If you have something on mind

839
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,024
or something is troubling you,

840
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,064
you need to tell him

841
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:09,064
in time.

842
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:09,704
Think about it.

843
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:11,064
If you keep it to yourself

844
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,504
and he can't guess what
you're thinking,

845
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:14,184
a trivial matter

846
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:14,904
will then

847
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:16,224
become a huge misunderstanding.

848
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:17,984
Then you two won't be happy.

849
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:19,024
Or you might argue.

850
00:38:19,224 --> 00:38:20,144
Do you think it's worth it?

851
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:29,864
(Xiao Shangqi)
(Can you come and pick me up?)

852
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:36,424
Is it Qi?

853
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:39,944
Go ahead.

854
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,064
Talk to him nicely.

855
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:44,344
Just resolve the misunderstanding.

856
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:45,464
Don't think too much.

857
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:04,624
Chen Fei'er's exclusive fruit tea
to dispel alcohol.

858
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:09,344
No need.

859
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:10,664
Thank you.

860
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:13,304
Shangqi,

861
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,744
what's wrong with you today?

862
00:39:14,984 --> 00:39:16,984
Li has worked for Zhao Mingxuan
for so long.

863
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:17,664
Normally, you won't

864
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:18,904
be so harsh to others.

865
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,344
Tell Mingxuan that

866
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:26,424
I'm drunk.

867
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:27,464
I need to leave first.

868
00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:42,984
I see.

869
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
You're waiting for her concern.

870
00:39:50,744 --> 00:39:51,864
Why did you drink so much?

871
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:56,584
Let's go.

872
00:39:57,224 --> 00:39:57,624
Come on.

873
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:00,624
Be careful.

874
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:02,984
I can walk.

875
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,104
Be careful.

876
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:11,304
Come here.

877
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:34,064
(Someone talked about)

878
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,944
(how he was in love with me in school.)

879
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:37,624
(Maybe that's why he's upset.)

880
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:38,864
(So, he drank a lot of wine.)

881
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:39,984
(Please take care of him.)

882
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:02,744
What are you doing?

883
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:03,984
What are you doing?

884
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:07,504
What are you upset about?

885
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:08,864
Beat me up.

886
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:10,464
Why are you talking like that?
Go away.

887
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:11,264
Go away.

888
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,144
When you were in school,

889
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:17,224
you'd go for boxing when you're upset.

890
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:19,464
Look at you now.

891
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:21,944
You don't talk.

892
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:24,064
You keep wanting me to guess.

893
00:41:26,424 --> 00:41:27,344
I don't want to guess anymore.

894
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:29,104
Beat me up.

895
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:32,304
Okay, you said so.

896
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:41,504
Xiaoran.

897
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,304
I only realized when I went
to the school that

898
00:41:47,144 --> 00:41:48,864
the maenianum that you were waiting
for me while I was playing football

899
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:51,064
was so hot.

900
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:55,464
Also, you woke up so early

901
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:56,264
to reserve the seat

902
00:41:56,424 --> 00:41:57,584
near the window

903
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:00,224
for me

904
00:42:00,344 --> 00:42:00,944
in the library.

905
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:05,744
That's what you thought of

906
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:06,824
when we were in the school?

907
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:09,344
What else could it be?

908
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:13,984
If only I had noticed

909
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:16,624
a little earlier

910
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,184
about what I really want.

911
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:23,224
You have no conscience.

912
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:26,184
I've never treated a relationship

913
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:28,584
so seriously before.

914
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:31,744
Forget it.

915
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:35,144
Since you've loved me for so long,

916
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:38,064
I'll return it all to you.

917
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:42,144
How are you going to return it?
