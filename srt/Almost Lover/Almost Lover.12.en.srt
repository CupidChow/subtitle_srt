(Yunlan Jifeng Hotel)

Li Hui! Li Hui!

22
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:46,354
How's it?

23
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,114
Are you used to the life back here?

24
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,834
It's two different worlds
compared to Wusu.

25
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:53,754
There are many things
and the pace is fast.

26
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,234
Still, Jifeng suits me better.

27
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:56,874
We haven't met for a few months.

28
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:58,074
You've become humble.

29
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:00,914
Have they told you?

30
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:02,994
I want to give the first project

31
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:03,954
after Yunduan's opening

32
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:04,954
to you.

33
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:07,914
Do you know that this is the first

34
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:08,754
six-star hotel in Deju?

35
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:09,754
So many people are
paying attention to it

36
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:11,514
here in Hupu.

37
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,714
This is a high-profile,

38
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,514
and highly-visible project.

39
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,154
You'll become famous

40
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:18,514
if you can get it done well.

41
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:20,514
What project is it?

42
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,914
My wedding with Fei'er.

43
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:24,554
Qi.

44
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:25,834
Do you know what?

45
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:27,554
This is

46
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,394
the true reason that I asked you
to come back.

47
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:17,713
What are you looking at?

48
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:32,634
Okay.

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,000
(Susan:
Tang Yan and I are together now.)

50
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,634
I know you're here to laugh at me.

51
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:39,114
Tang Yan cheated on me.

52
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:41,514
I almost caught them on the bed.

53
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:42,914
The girl is Susan.

54
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:44,194
They're showing off their romance

55
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:45,034
on Weibo.

56
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,194
Okay, you got to know, right?

57
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:47,034
Are you happy now?

58
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,194
Oh, come on.

59
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:05,794
You're just falling out of love.

60
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,154
Why not I lend you my shoulder

61
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:10,474
to cry on?

62
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:15,074
Don't use the trick

63
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,514
that you used on other girls

64
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,154
on me, okay?

65
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:28,834
Okay.

66
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:30,874
Let me show you

67
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:31,714
something different

68
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:32,914
and fresh.

69
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:34,994
Here you go.

70
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:38,394
Stop acting like that.

71
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,674
Just cry and do whatever you want.

72
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:41,794
This matter won't pass
if you hold it in.

73
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,754
You're just afraid of being shameful.

74
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:44,914
I've told Hao.

75
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:45,994
I've booked the whole place here.

76
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:49,274
Just cry as much as you want.
No one will see it.

77
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:51,194
Otherwise,

78
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:52,834
I'll cry together with you.

79
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:54,714
It's not shameful.

80
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,074
It's spicy.

81
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:44,794
You're just falling out of love.

82
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,434
It's not a big deal.

83
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,274
I'm so sad.

84
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:53,274
Sui Mingwei.

85
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:54,274
All right.

86
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,514
Am I that bad?

87
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:57,874
You're not bad.

88
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,274
All right.

89
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:17,954
Qi hasn't come home for a meal

90
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,634
for years.

91
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:20,754
I wonder if his taste

92
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:21,994
has changed.

93
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,554
No need to bother him.
He won't mind.

94
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:26,754
Do I need to tidy up his room?

95
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:27,834
No need.

96
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:31,474
Qi has yet to come home?

97
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:33,514
Take a seat.

98
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,274
Madam Zhang.

99
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:43,434
What's this?

100
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:44,994
Why does it have the herbal smell?

101
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,434
This is for you.

102
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:48,314
Your father

103
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,554
found a great doctor to prescribe this.

104
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,514
I've stewed it for a day.

105
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:54,274
Okay.

106
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:55,874
Father.

107
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,114
Don't get this for me anymore.

108
00:07:58,674 --> 00:07:59,394
I really don't like it.

109
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:01,314
Drink it even though you don't like it.

110
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:04,154
It's been raining lately.

111
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:05,474
Your leg must hurt again.

112
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,354
I'm telling you.

113
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:09,914
This old physician

114
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,514
is the third generation
of the doctor family.

115
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,394
He prescribed it based on

116
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:15,634
your physical features.

117
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,394
It gets rid of the damp
and replenishes your qi.

118
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,594
It's good for your body.

119
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,234
I smell like medicine every day.

120
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:22,914
No matter what we do,

121
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:24,274
I'm still lame.

122
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:30,394
Look at you.

123
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:32,074
Why are you so obtrusive?

124
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:32,673
Look.

125
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,114
Madam Zhang has cooked

126
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:34,793
many dishes for you.

127
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:35,314
Come and eat.

128
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:35,793
Take a seat.

129
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:37,234
Father.

130
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,994
You knew about this earlier?

131
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,114
Hold on.

132
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:45,274
What are you talking

133
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,034
about here?

134
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,594
Zhao Mingxuan's wedding.

135
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:49,394
He told you this?

136
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:50,954
Let's not talk about this.

137
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,074
Let's have dinner first, okay?

138
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:54,314
I said this before.

139
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,794
I want to play chess by myself.

140
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,994
Stop taking me as a pawn.

141
00:08:58,114 --> 00:08:59,154
No one is taking you as a pawn!

142
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,074
Why didn't you tell me

143
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,074
when we were in Wusu?

144
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:03,554
Qi.

145
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:05,474
They did this

146
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:08,554
because he's worried and scared of you.

147
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,514
The more he's scared of you,

148
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,794
the more stable
Yunlan's position will be.

149
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:14,834
Stable?

150
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:17,594
Zhao Mingxuan

151
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:18,914
wants Xiao family to

152
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,114
earn money by kneeling down.

153
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:24,914
Maybe you're used to it,

154
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:27,074
but I'm not.

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,234
Enough.

156
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:30,194
Father,

157
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:31,954
this is not his fault.

158
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:33,914
Everyone knows

159
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:34,914
what happened to

160
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,074
him and Chen Fei'er.

161
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:36,834
Zhao Mingxuan

162
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,474
is grasping this weakness of his.

163
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,394
What's wrong with me and Chen Fei'er?

164
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:40,914
No.

165
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:41,914
Qi.

166
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,274
We wanted you to come back to Hupu
as soon as possible.

167
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,794
Don't leave anymore since you are back.

168
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,034
After settling the matters
and the wedding,

169
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,714
stay in Yunlan to help your brother.

170
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:54,834
This is my decision.

171
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,034
I'm going back to Wusu tomorrow.

172
00:09:58,274 --> 00:09:59,954
You can't decide everything on your own.

173
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:03,634
Don't forget what you owed your brother.

174
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,314
I knew you'd say this.

175
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:14,994
Ever since I was young,

176
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:16,834
this is like

177
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:17,714
the Band-tightening Spell to me.

178
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,074
Don't worry.

179
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:24,434
I'll pay my brother back slowly

180
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,234
for what I owed him.

181
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:28,674
But you as my father,

182
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:30,714
did you not

183
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:31,714
owe me anything?

184
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,514
I gave birth to you, raised you up,
and nurtured you.

185
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:39,114
What did I owe you?

186
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:52,714
Have a seat, father.

187
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:01,674
I still don't understand.

188
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,594
How did you find out that
they slept together?

189
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,874
Get me some water. I'm thirsty.

190
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:14,514
There's no lipstick mark on the bottle,

191
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,474
but there's lipstick smell.

192
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,914
You women are terrifying.

193
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:30,834
This could be the so-called

194
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:31,914
sixth sense.

195
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:35,514
I asked him and he admitted it all.

196
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:43,874
There's this saying.

197
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,274
The sixth sense

198
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,674
is your subconscious.

199
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,394
You didn't notice something,

200
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:49,794
but your subconscious did.

201
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,714
To protect you from harm,

202
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:52,594
it helped you to do

203
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,914
the most straightforward judgment.

204
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
(Dear member, you have 6,599 points
in your account, expiring in 24h.)

205
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:11,434
You analyzed it rationally.

206
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:13,554
So, is your sixth sense telling you

207
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:15,074
why you didn't get

208
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:16,514
someone's call?

209
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,594
What's going on with him?

210
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,354
The traffic lights in Hupu

211
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:27,234
change faster

212
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:28,794
than the ones here.

213
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:29,714
What do you mean?

214
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:31,594
The pace in the big city is fast.

215
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,114
He can't take care of things
when he's busy.

216
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,394
He can't take care of me.

217
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:41,834
Enough, two of you.

218
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,274
Stop being so depressed.

219
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:44,554
Look at you two.

220
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:47,114
You fell out of love
and you lost contact.

221
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,994
Come back for a meal next week.

222
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,354
I'll boost your morale and
replenish your nutrition.

223
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:53,034
Come on.

224
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:54,234
Come on.

225
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:13,314
The soft opening is coming soon.

226
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,074
The general manager's position

227
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,114
is still vacant.

228
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,514
What is Xiao family doing?

229
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,234
We still have time.

230
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:26,434
We'll go look for one.

231
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:28,674
Before we find someone capable,

232
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:29,994
I can hold the concurrent post.

233
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:31,234
What did you say?

234
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:33,114
Hold the concurrent post?

235
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:36,234
Yunduan is Deju's

236
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:37,474
first luxurious hotel.

237
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:39,034
Do you know

238
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:40,274
how high its standard is?

239
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:46,874
Forget it.

240
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,674
I'll monitor this matter on my own.

241
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:51,194
I've asked the headhunting company

242
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,194
to get in touch with Z Group's
top management.

243
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:54,994
You want to hire the manager
by yourself?

244
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:56,034
Deju has never

245
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:57,474
got involved in the human resources.

246
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,114
Your meeting

247
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,354
is so noisy.

248
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:11,954
That's it, everyone.

249
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,194
Next agenda.

250
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:15,234
Mr. Zhao,

251
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,074
can I have a suggestion?

252
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:19,514
Go ahead.

253
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,474
I heard that you're trying
to headhunt Z Group's

254
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:25,954
Eddie, the store manager from
Hong Kong branch?

255
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:29,674
How did you know?

256
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:32,394
I know him.

257
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,754
Eddie is German.

258
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:35,874
Few years back

259
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,794
when he was working in Beijing,

260
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:38,874
he was forming cliques

261
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:40,434
with the local staff and foreigner staff

262
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:41,834
in the hotel.

263
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,234
They almost got into a fight.

264
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:44,954
The turnover rate of the middle

265
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,154
and top management of this hotel

266
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,754
is as high as 30%.

267
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,194
30%.

268
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:53,714
In my opinion,

269
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,874
we don't have a mature

270
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:56,954
management team

271
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:58,034
in Yunduan.

272
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,754
If we do that,

273
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:01,354
it's a bit risky.

274
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:03,234
He's right.

275
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:03,954
What he said makes sense.

276
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:04,514
It makes sense.

277
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:06,874
It's a bit risky to do that.

278
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:07,314
Yes.

279
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,674
What he said makes sense.

280
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:09,794
Okay.

281
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,034
I will

282
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:14,034
give you a few more days.

283
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,114
But you need to consider

284
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:18,914
all my requirements.

285
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,874
Do you think you should smoke
with your body condition?

286
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:46,194
Aren't you going back to Wusu?

287
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:47,394
When did you

288
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,474
get to know Eddie?

289
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:49,954
I don't know.

290
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:51,394
I just did a simple investigation.

291
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:55,314
Just because Zhao Mingxuan

292
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,434
said something for no reason

293
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:57,474
when having meals?

294
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,554
From how I understand him,

295
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:01,594
he'll never

296
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,754
mention anything for no reason.

297
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,954
No wonder father wants you to stay.

298
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,674
I gave it a thought after being calmed.

299
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,274
Based on Zhao Mingxuan's ways
of doing things,

300
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:17,594
he must have asked you and father

301
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:18,874
to lure me back from Wusu

302
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,074
with some tricks.

303
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:26,794
Yunduan's agreement

304
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,114
has yet to be signed.

305
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,754
Do you think I'm really useless?

306
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,354
Tell Zhao Mingxuan that

307
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,194
I'll plan his wedding.

308
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:44,954
Xiao Shangqi.

309
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:47,074
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,154
I shouldn't have lied to you.

311
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:51,594
It's my fault.

312
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:53,314
But please don't

313
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,114
act like

314
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,474
you're sacrificing yourself

315
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:57,394
to save the day, okay?

316
00:16:58,634 --> 00:16:59,834
This is what's happening.

317
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:00,834
A few hundreds people in Yunlan

318
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:02,314
are walking on thin ice.

319
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:03,834
I don't know

320
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:05,473
how well you can handle this.

321
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,233
Planning a wedding

322
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:08,394
means I have to

323
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:09,874
interact with those who are coming.

324
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:11,314
We'll need

325
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:12,754
Zhao family's abundant resources.

326
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:14,754
It's normally uneasy.

327
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:16,993
Since he wants to make it hard for us,

328
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,193
let's look for another solution.

329
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:23,154
Don't be so surprised.

330
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:25,114
Didn't father say this?

331
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:28,794
I'll pay you back

332
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:30,714
for what I owed you.

333
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:36,234
Smoke less.

I'm busy. I'll call you later.

346
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:59,547
♪Time without you♪

347
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:10,011

348

The missing that has no timeline♪

00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:29,110

350
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,034
I'm going to Hupu TV Station?

351
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:36,034
Our news channel

352
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:36,874
will have a spot every year

353
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,594
for a potential talent

354
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:39,754
to be trained in Hupu TV Station's

355
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:40,554
news channel

356
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:41,874
as exchange for a month.

357
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,114
Since you're new here,

358
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:44,114
and you're not too busy,

359
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,874
just take the chance to
widen your horizon.

360
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:53,074
What? You don't want to go?

361
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:54,074
I remember that

362
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:54,874
you're from Hupu.

363
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:55,794
I want to go.

364
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:57,554
My family is there.

365
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:58,914
Also, my boyfriend is

366
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:00,274
on a business trip in Hupu.

367
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,234
I was thinking why
it's such a coincidence.

368
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:02,994
I'm so happy about it.

369
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:04,954
Well,

370
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:06,434
then I'll need to

371
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:07,674
think about it again.

372
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,754
Will you forsake your work for dating?

373
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,154
I promise I'll learn hard there.

374
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:15,674
I'll not embarrass our news channel.

375
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:17,674
Fine, good luck.

376
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:18,994
Thank you.

377
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:24,114
You're leaving tomorrow?

378
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:25,514
So soon?

379
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:26,914
After all, I have nothing much

380
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:28,034
to hand over.

381
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:29,314
I should just go there earlier.

382
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:30,954
But, it's a shame

383
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,754
that I can't dine with you for a while.

384
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:34,834
Zhou Lili actually

385
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:36,234
gave the much sought-after

386
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:37,114
spot for you,

387
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:38,074
a newcomer.

388
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:39,714
Did you send her presents?

389
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:41,994
Yes, I gave her a slice of meat.

390
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:43,874
Nonsense.

391
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,034
This is the law of attraction,

392
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,114
understand?

393
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,274
Long-distance relationship is not right.

394
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:51,034
If Xiao Shangqi is not able
to come back,

395
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:52,434
it's good that you can go over.

396
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:53,994
Have you told him this?

397
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:55,714
Not yet. He's busy.

398
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,034
I don't want him to come pick me up.

399
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:58,994
I'll go find him tomorrow

400
00:20:59,154 --> 00:20:59,834
and surprise him.

401
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:03,834
Look at you women.

402
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:05,594
I've told you many times.

403
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,394
Don't simply surprise your men.

404
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:09,954
What?

405
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:10,954
There's no more drinks at home.

406
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:11,714
Go down and buy some.

407
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:16,394
You don't even drink.

408
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:22,354
Well, Xiaoran.

409
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,274
We'll not rent out

410
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:26,074
your room.

411
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,314
I'll put something in there.

412
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:29,354
Sure.

413
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,074
If there's anything,

414
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:39,194
ask Sui to keep you company.

415
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:40,274
If not,

416
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,554
just give me a video call.

417
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:44,034
Don't stay here alone, okay?

418
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,754
Are you worried that I'd hurt myself?

419
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:49,714
No.

420
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,954
You're

421
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:53,114
able to let go easily.

422
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:54,514
You're quiet but decisive.

423
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:55,034
That's right.

424
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:55,954
I'm not worried.

425
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:01,114
I'm worried though.

426
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:05,914
Promise me one thing.

427
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:30,514
Not bad. You're still good at it.

428
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:31,954
Thank you.

429
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:33,674
You're still young and strong.

430
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:34,914
I'm not old.

431
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:35,914
My bad.

432
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:38,914
How could you punch and kick
your daughter

433
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:39,874
as soon as she's home?

434
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:41,274
Hurry, put the things down and eat.

435
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:42,034
Let's eat.

436
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:46,154
My daughter,

437
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:47,994
I miss you.

438
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:48,874
Let me see.

439
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:51,354
Not bad.

440
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,674
- Here.
- Welcome home.

441
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,874
Thank you, father, mother.

442
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:00,834
Let's eat.

443
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,154
Mother, you've cooked too much.

444
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:04,234
It's like the celebration of New Year.

445
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:05,874
You suddenly said

446
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:06,714
you're coming home.

447
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:07,994
Your father showed off
his cooking skills.

448
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:08,994
Of course I have to cook as well.

449
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,474
Each of us cooked four dishes.

450
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:11,594
That's why we have
eight dishes in total.

451
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:13,554
How can I lose weight like this?

452
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:14,954
Do it tomorrow.

453
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:17,034
Here, it's all your favorite.

454
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:18,714
You don't get to eat this there.

455
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:19,314
Eat more.

456
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:21,554
Look at your father's braised pork ribs.

457
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:22,834
It's tasty.

458
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:23,954
I even cooked it

459
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:24,594
spicy.

460
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:25,194
Try it.

461
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:27,714
Is it tasty?

462
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:30,834
It's still the same taste.

463
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:32,274
Yes.

464
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:33,354
That's right.

465
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:34,834
Come back more often.

466
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:36,834
I think I can only lose weight

467
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:37,754
next month.

468
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:38,794
No worries. Do it slowly.

469
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,474
(Today, Xiao Shangqi and I)

470
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:50,434
(built a model together.)

471
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:51,994
(He's good at it.)

472
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:54,314
(At 5.30 p.m.,)

473
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:56,074
(we went to the cafeteria together.)

474
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:57,994
(I chose to walk slowly.)

475
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,274
(He smiled and I smiled along.)

476
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:09,954
Hello.

477
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:12,514
You picked up the phone so quickly.

478
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:15,634
It's rare that we who are so busy

479
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:16,434
have free time.

480
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:19,474
Yes,

481
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:21,274
I have something to tell you.

482
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,114
It happens that I have something

483
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:24,954
to tell you, too.

484
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:28,034
My work here

485
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:29,914
might have some changes.

486
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:32,394
What changes?

487
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:33,514
Well,

488
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:36,994
I'll see if I'm free these few days.

489
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:38,434
I'll go back to Wusu.

490
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:39,394
We'll talk face-to-face.

491
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:41,474
What happened?

492
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:43,514
Something serious happened?

493
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:45,234
No, don't think too much.

494
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:47,314
I just miss you.

495
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:49,354
I'm trying to look for a reason
to meet you.

496
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:52,994
What do you want to tell me?

497
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:56,634
Nothing.

498
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:57,754
We can talk about it

499
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,394
when we meet.

500
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:01,074
But, I can feel that

501
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:02,474
we'll meet up very soon.

502
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:03,954
Okay.

503
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:17,994
Li Hui.

504
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:20,514
What's going on?

505
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:21,674
You're not going to the guitar store.

506
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,514
Hao told me that you also quit
the job as the resident performer.

507
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:25,994
I have enough money.

508
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:27,754
I just don't want the trouble.

509
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:29,754
Yes.

510
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:31,474
You're now alone

511
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:32,394
and you can afford your life.

512
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:34,994
Give He Xiaoran's room key

513
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:36,114
to me.

514
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:37,234
I want to move something in.

515
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:40,194
What?

516
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:41,034
Only you can

517
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:42,074
live in a wide space?

518
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,514
That's why I feel like
it's weird lately.

519
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:36,554
Fei'er.

520
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:39,194
It's been a while, my old friend.

521
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,754
I heard that you're planning
the wedding for me.

522
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:42,994
I didn't believe it at first.

523
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:44,674
If you have any questions
or requirements,

524
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,194
just tell me.

525
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,074
We, Yunlan, will try our best.

526
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:49,794
You should know

527
00:26:49,954 --> 00:26:51,034
what I like.

528
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,234
People tend to change.

529
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:56,594
Shangqi,

530
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:58,754
you've changed and
become like a stranger.

531
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:04,834
Just call me Susu.

532
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,114
I've read your resume.

533
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:07,554
Hupu School of Foreign Languages.

534
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:09,794
I graduated there as well,
three batches before you.

535
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:11,474
I'm now the editor
in the news department.

536
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:12,794
Greetings, my senior.

537
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:13,874
Let me take you around.

538
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:14,754
Come on.

539
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,240
(Hupu TV Station)

540
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:33,354
We have the 4K HD engine room

541
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:34,994
for the news editorial.

542
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:35,874
We also have a television studio.

543
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,234
Next to it are the control room

544
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:38,274
and dressing room.

545
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:39,434
Downstairs is the area
to show station history.

546
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:40,274
Also, there are

547
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,474
television studios for
small programs upstairs.

548
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,034
If you're

549
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:43,874
free later on,

550
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:44,354
I can take you

551
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:45,874
to visit every place.

552
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:56,634
This is the meeting room where

553
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:57,914
the staff of the news channel
are meeting

554
00:27:58,114 --> 00:27:59,354
and planning.

555
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,194
The annual recruitment

556
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:01,354
will be done here, too.

557
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:13,594
He Xiaoran,

558
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:14,714
your written test result was not bad.

559
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:15,754
Let's be brief.

560
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:16,474
Here.

561
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,394
Look at this news

562
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:19,554
and tell us your opinions.

563
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:21,394
(The graduation season is coming.)

564
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,354
(While one is planning for the future,)

565
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,954
(when faced with
more difficulties in reality,)

566
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,234
(romance in the campus has
become so fragile.)

567
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:28,594
(Many think that)

568
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:29,954
(a decent breakup is)

569
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,074
(the best future they can give
to each other.)

570
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:35,274
You can start answering.

571
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:36,994
You have one minute.

572
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,500
(Interviewer)

573
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:44,514
In every year's graduation season,

574
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:46,914
many people

575
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,074
have to say goodbye to

576
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,154
someone they love.

577
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:00,194
So, after you graduated,

578
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:01,674
you came to our station for interview?

579
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,554
The passing rate for the second round
is very high.

580
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:05,314
Why did you get panicked?

581
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:06,994
Was there another reason?

582
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,274
I was panicked.

583
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:11,834
But, I'm glad for

584
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:12,914
the training opportunity here.

585
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:14,834
Well, we also provide

586
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,274
accommodation for

587
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:17,154
the people taking the training here.

588
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:18,674
It's a hotel not far away from here.

589
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:20,234
No need. I'll stay at home.

590
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:22,114
Yes, you're from Hupu.

591
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:23,394
However, if it's too late
after working overtime,

592
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:24,434
or you don't want to go home,

593
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:25,194
you just need to register at the counter

594
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:26,674
if the need arises.

595
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:27,434
Okay.

596
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:33,994
Xiaoran,

597
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,914
can you do me a favor?

598
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:37,714
We have an outdoor interview

599
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:38,434
today.

600
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:40,034
They said they need an equipment,

601
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,154
but I'm occupied.

602
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:42,634
Can you help me

603
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:43,554
to send it there?

604
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:44,154
Okay.

605
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:45,954
Give me the address.

606
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:46,914
I'll send it there for you.

607
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:48,034
Thank you.

608
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,114
Let me bring you to get the equipment.

609
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:49,754
Okay.

610
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:53,354
Amend this document

611
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:54,234
based on my opinions.

612
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:55,354
That's it, go ahead.

613
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:55,754
Okay.

614
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:58,554
He Xiaoran?

615
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:01,874
Here.

616
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,714
Thanks for rushing here.

617
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:04,274
No worries.

618
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,194
What program is this?

619
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:06,674
Zhang,

620
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,154
the equipment you need is here.

621
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:11,594
Check it out by then.

622
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:12,714
Wedding dress closet.

623
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:13,634
For the things in the room,

624
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:14,754
I think you should look for

625
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:16,074
the most professional people to do it.

626
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:19,874
I trust you.

627
00:30:20,914 --> 00:30:21,354
Don't worry.

628
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:47,594
Xiaoran, it has been a while.

629
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:49,314
Why are you here?

630
00:30:49,674 --> 00:30:50,434
How are you doing?

631
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,194
It has really been a while.

632
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,514
I have something on. I'm leaving.

633
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:07,874
Fei'er.

634
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:11,674
Xiaoran is now my girlfriend.

635
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:19,594
You two?

636
00:31:26,714 --> 00:31:28,474
Yes, are you surprised?

637
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:31,474
No,

638
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:33,194
I'm happy for you.

639
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,554
But, it's almost time.

640
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:36,954
Shall we go in first?

641
00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:39,354
You're here for...

642
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:41,074
Fei'er is here for
an exclusive interview.

643
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,634
It's to promote Yunduan.

644
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:44,514
An exclusive interview?

645
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:46,914
Then I can be of help.

646
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:47,674
Let's do it together.

647
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:57,154
Be careful.

648
00:31:58,154 --> 00:31:58,714
Are you okay?

649
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:05,314
Luckily you haven't left.

650
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,074
Mr. Xiao.

651
00:32:07,914 --> 00:32:08,674
Miss Chen.

652
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:09,754
You know each other?

653
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:12,994
Yes, let me introduce.

654
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:14,634
This is my girlfriend, He Xiaoran.

655
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:16,314
She has just come to
the station's news channel.

656
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:17,594
Please take care of her.

657
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,274
I got it. She's Susu's junior.

658
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:20,234
Of course I need to take care of her.

659
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:20,874
Xiaoran,

660
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:21,594
you need to sign

661
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:22,554
the equipment receipt for me.

662
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:23,554
No problem.

663
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:24,394
Miss Chen,

664
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:25,434
let's get ready.

665
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:32,514
How did you know

666
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:33,434
I'm in the news channel?

667
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:36,674
Didn't you call me

668
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,474
to tell me this?

669
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:40,674
Don't try to be smart.

670
00:32:58,474 --> 00:32:59,114
Shangqi,

671
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,674
the crew said we'll take
the publicity photos first.

672
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:02,634
They've prepared

673
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,434
two dresses for me.

674
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:05,354
Which one do you think is better?

675
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:07,114
Let the crew decide.

676
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:09,394
I'd like to know your opinion.

677
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,154
I think this is better.

678
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:13,594
It shows off your body curve.

679
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:15,314
I'll pull the zip up for you.

680
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:26,834
She's getting married?

681
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:29,834
She's marrying Zhao Mingxuan.

682
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:31,954
Your brother?

683
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:34,394
So beautiful.

684
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:36,834
It's a shame that you're not an artist.

685
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:39,634
You're photogenic.

686
00:33:47,954 --> 00:33:48,354
Hello.

687
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:49,314
Hello.

688
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,394
Miss Chen,

689
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:51,794
congratulations on your

690
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:52,834
coming wedding.

691
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,354
Can you share with us

692
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:55,314
how you and Mr. Zhao

693
00:33:55,474 --> 00:33:57,194
fell in love?

694
00:33:58,354 --> 00:34:01,554
I was studying piano overseas.

695
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,834
In one of my performances...

696
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,073
I'm sorry. I'm a bit nervous.

697
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:09,593
No worries.

698
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:13,394
He came to listen to my performance.

699
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,553
Then we fell in love at first sight.

700
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:19,314
When did she ever learn
how to play the piano?

701
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:21,954
I don't know.

702
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,954
I heard that besides piano,

703
00:34:24,154 --> 00:34:25,874
you have many other hobbies.

704
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:27,714
Say, painting and exercising.

705
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:29,914
You've been doing charity as well.

706
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:32,634
Yes, I like these.

707
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:36,194
Is she still the Chen Fei'er

708
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:37,154
that I know?

709
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:39,434
She's marrying Zhao Mingxuan.

710
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:43,553
Of course, she needs to hide something.

711
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:45,154
I got it.

712
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:47,113
Just like how you lied to me,
saying that

713
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:48,513
you're not in contact with her.

714
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:50,794
Xiaoran.

715
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:54,593
Last but not least,

716
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:55,513
can we talk about

717
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:56,593
the wedding?

718
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,834
This should be the wedding
of the century,

719
00:34:58,034 --> 00:35:00,434
most anticipated by the viewers.

720
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:01,474
I heard that Mr. Zhao

721
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:02,634
has got your best friend

722
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:03,794
to plan for the wedding

723
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:04,914
to make sure

724
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:06,594
you have a perfect wedding.

725
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:10,914
I'm looking forward to it, too.

726
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:12,874
He's our mutual friend.

727
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:16,994
Okay.

728
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:17,874
Thank you once again.

729
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,834
Thank you, Miss Chen.

730
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:21,834
The mutual friend she said

731
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:22,634
is you, right?

732
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,234
I can explain.

733
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:25,714
No need, I roughly got it.

734
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:26,834
Xiaoran, don't think too much.

735
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:27,394
Xiaoran.

736
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:30,274
Can you come with me
to clean my makeup?

737
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:33,514
Now?

738
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:39,034
What do you need me to help you?

739
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:42,594
You're very composed now.

740
00:35:42,794 --> 00:35:44,074
You're different from the He Xiaoran

741
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:44,834
I knew before.

742
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,354
Three generations of educated family.

743
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:50,074
You know how to play the piano,
you like painting,

744
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,274
and you like exercising.

745
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:55,234
I barely know you anymore.

746
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,234
Do you remember when we
were in university,

747
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:01,714
we went for ceramic art?

748
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:04,154
We knead it, burn it and glaze it.

749
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,514
It'd become a nice vase.

750
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:09,634
So, you let them

751
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,474
reform you

752
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:11,434
and make you into

753
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:12,754
a princess in Yunduan?

754
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:18,114
At least for me who is a

755
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:19,274
defected product,

756
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:21,514
this is the best outcome.

757
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,594
Your face...

758
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:34,434
He asked me to pass this to you.

759
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:49,274
The color is too plain.

760
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,234
It suits you better.

761
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:56,074
Here you go.

762
00:36:58,354 --> 00:36:58,954
I don't want it.

763
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,114
He bought it for you.

764
00:37:00,314 --> 00:37:01,314
It's limited edition.

765
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:02,514
He lined up to buy it.

766
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:03,674
If you don't like it,

767
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,674
return it to him yourself.

768
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:07,874
You said he lined up to buy it.

769
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:10,114
Won't he be sad if I return it?

770
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:13,234
Are you afraid that he'd be sad

771
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:14,354
or that he'll find out

772
00:37:14,554 --> 00:37:15,354
you treat him as a rebound

773
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:16,674
and he won't care and
concern about you anymore?

774
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:19,354
Xiaoran,

775
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:21,314
you've finally said it.

776
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:26,714
I've been holding this for a while.

777
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,154
You knew

778
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:29,914
he's loved you for so long,

779
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:31,714
yet you don't accept him

780
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:33,154
and you don't reject him either.

781
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:34,714
Now, we're going to graduate.

782
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:35,714
When are you going to

783
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:36,474
stop doing this to him?

784
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:38,114
He Xiaoran

785
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:40,114
have you been looking down

786
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:40,954
on me?

787
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:46,314
Yes, I'm using Xiao Shangqi.

788
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,434
I'm not letting him go.

789
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:48,674
I don't have anyone to count on.

790
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,594
I want him to be by my side

791
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,034
until I find my true love,

792
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:52,714
can't I?

793
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:55,394
You're too selfish.

794
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:56,314
Have you never used

795
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:56,994
anyone before?

796
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:01,234
Didn't you use

797
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:02,554
the Triangle relationship

798
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:03,914
and in the name of Xiao Shangqi's

799
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,354
wingman

800
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:06,794
to stay by his side?

801
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:12,634
You love Xiao Shangqi.

802
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:13,594
I knew it,

803
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:15,634
but I don't want you to get together.

804
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:16,434
Just like how I don't want to

805
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:17,434
date him.

806
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:19,714
I only hope

807
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:21,474
the three of us can be friends forever.

808
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,474
You've never treated us

809
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:24,634
as your best friends.

810
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:27,474
Whatever.

811
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:37,274
Goddess,

812
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:39,074
the night ball is starting soon.

813
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:40,954
Where are you going to sit later?

814
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:42,794
This kind of night ball

815
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:43,834
is meaningless.

816
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:44,794
I'm leaving now.

817
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:27,674
(There's a boy.)

818
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:28,154
Hello.

819
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:29,794
(He has been staying in the hotel
since young.)

820
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:30,474
Fei'er.

821
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:32,394
(He'd feel lonely sometimes.)

822
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:33,274
Where are you alone?

823
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:35,314
(But he's bright...)

824
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:36,114
Don't worry.

825
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,114
Send me the address.

826
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:37,794
I'll be there.

827
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:42,074
(Xiao Shangqi.)

828
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:47,394
(I've loved you for so long.)

829
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:49,234
(It should be starting from high school.)

830
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:50,554
(It has been)

831
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:52,154
(five years and four months now.)

832
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:55,994
Fei'er!

833
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:58,234
Fei'er!

834
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:00,754
Fei'er!

835
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:22,074
Fei'er!

836
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:25,954
Fei'er!

837
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:35,674
Fei'er.

838
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:39,274
What happened to your face?

839
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:54,514
Come on.

840
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:30,514
The police informed me that

841
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:32,234
Zhang Xiaojun has been arrested.

842
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:33,754
Good that he's been arrested.

843
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:35,314
This is terrible.

844
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:36,914
How did we get into
this kind of trouble?

845
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:37,554
He even caused my daughter

846
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:38,434
to become like this.

847
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:39,434
How much is he going to compensate us?

848
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:42,034
Can you stop making noise?

849
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:43,114
He didn't manage

850
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:43,914
to do anything.

851
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:45,434
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

852
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:46,634
She'll have the scar
for the rest of her life.

853
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,954
Our daughter is disfigured.

854
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:49,594
Let me tell you.

855
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:50,714
The most critical thing now is

856
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,114
how much he is going to compensate us?

857
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:53,514
We need to ask as much as we can.

858
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:54,114
Yes,

859
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:55,394
we need to ask for more.

860
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:55,994
Medical fee,

861
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:56,954
consultation fee,

862
00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:58,314
moral damages,

863
00:41:58,554 --> 00:41:59,754
and...

864
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:00,394
And...

865
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:02,034
Where are you going?

866
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:03,194
She needs a plastic surgery

867
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:03,994
to cover the scar on her face.

868
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:04,514
Yes.

869
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:32,394
Fei'er.

870
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:34,354
Are you okay?

871
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:39,594
Shangqi.

872
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,314
Don't worry about me.

873
00:42:44,914 --> 00:42:45,714
You don't have to pay

874
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:46,794
my medical fee.

875
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:50,234
No matter what medicine I'm using

876
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:51,274
and how long the treatment is,

877
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,114
my face is disfigured.

878
00:42:57,794 --> 00:42:58,354
Don't worry.

879
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,114
Take it slow to recover.

880
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:02,514
It's going to recover.

881
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:04,154
How slow do I need to take?

882
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:07,354
Until when I'm old and frail?
