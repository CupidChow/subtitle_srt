1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This technique is perfect.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I think it's gonna be better for today's experiment

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because it has more details in it.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The second method is to get the second method.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, definitely make an experiment

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which you are going to level with.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,580
Actually, I'm unconscious.

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,580
Please simply don't get up yet.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,620
Be quiet.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,380
It's lunch time.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,880
I'll come clean.

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,300
Brother!

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,560
Brother!

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,660
Yu shuffle.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,760
Zhao He%.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I gave this to you.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Today,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you dare to step forward again

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and blame me for being ruthless.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yun Ya,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Xiao Zhi is my brother.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't just watch him die.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Brother Hao,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
leave now.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You will die.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please let him go, okay?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please let him go, okay?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Please kill me.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't kill my brother, okay?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Brother Hao!

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Brother Hao,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
leave now!

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Brother Hao, leave now!

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't care about me!

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't!

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Brother Hao!

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Brother Hao!

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brother Hao!

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Brother Hao, I beg you!

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Leave now!

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are a traitor!

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you know what they look like

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
when I killed your family?

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They are pitiful.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You are dead!

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They are helpless.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I am not even blind!

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I am not blind!

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will kill them all!

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kill them all!

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiao Zhi!

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You should all die!

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are dead!

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will never give up!

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Xiao Zhi!

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiao Zhi!

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Xiao Zhi!

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Xiao Zhi!

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Brother Hao!

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I love you the most.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I will protect you.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You have protected me.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now,

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I finally protect you.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now, I am not.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Xiao Zhi!

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Xiao Zhi!

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Xiao Zhi!

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Xiao Zhi.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Xiao Zhi.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,840
Xiao Zhi

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Xiao Zhi, wake up!

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Xiao Zhi!

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Xiao Zhi!

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Xiao Zhi.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wake up.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Xiao Zhi!

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Xiao Zhi!

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wake up, Xiao Zhi!

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Xiao Zhi.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Xiao Zhi.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,960
Xiao Cheng,

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,720
I didn't protect you well.

89
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
I didn't teach you well.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,440
I really did it.

91
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Brother, this wood is so similar to you.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,360
This is the gift from you.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,600
Then I'll let it stay with you and keep it with you.

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,920
Just like you've been by your side all this time,

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,840
okay?

96
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,960
Thank you, uncle.

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Xiao Cheng,

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
I'll keep it safe

99
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,560
and never let you get hurt again.

100
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
Lord Yan will have to rest for worse.

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,280
Who would ever want to carry off this段?

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
When the celular with the stone in our hands

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,280
will rfire,

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
how bright we shine in thisregard!

105
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,600
Yesterday,

106
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
the Lord passed into theます and thar has come back.

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,760
And the worldawan dreames.

108
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
Until the end.

109
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,520
Today,

110
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,280
the daughter of the greater clan

111
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,160
',

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
wants a light of Camp fire

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
I will show you my glory.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
Tell me.

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
How are you going to punish me?

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
I love you.

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,360
Why are you like this?

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,960
You look so strange.

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,240
You turned me into this.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,200
You locked me in the room.

121
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,760
You made me see her for the last time.

122
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
We are sisters.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Do you feel so bad for me?

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I don't understand.

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,320
We have been through so much suffering.

126
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
And she

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
is the one who tortured us

128
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
to the point of catching Taibushu.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
Why did you help her?

130
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,480
Because I am willing to do everything for her.

131
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
I will watch over you

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
from the moment you came to the King's Mansion.

133
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I will tell her everything.

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
And I will make the needle

135
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
that killed Zhao Zhe.

136
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Every time,

137
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
every time,

138
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
I saved her.

139
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Every time, I saved her.

140
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Why did I do this to her?

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Why?

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I was not with her when she died.

143
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Yuan Zhi.

144
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Think about it.

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
She killed the people in the Moon Tribe.

146
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
She killed so many innocent people.

147
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
She didn't deserve you.

148
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
She knew it!

149
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
She took the person who was in the wrong

150
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
as my face.

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
She killed the person I wanted to kill.

152
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
That person tortured me.

153
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
He didn't deserve my father.

154
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
What do you mean?

155
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Stop!

156
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
See if your mother knows.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Get out of here!

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
I don't have money.

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
No money?

160
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
You're a loser!

161
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Father, stop gambling.

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
We don't have money anymore.

163
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
You're a loser!

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
You're a loser!

165
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
How dare you blame your father for gambling?

166
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
You're a loser just like your mother!

167
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
That's all?

168
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Tell you what.

169
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
This money is not enough.

170
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
After three days,

171
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
I can't get the money to pay the gambling debt.

172
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
I will sell you to the brothel.

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Do you know that?

174
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Get out!

175
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
You're a loser!

176
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
You don't have money

177
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
after three days.

178
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
You don't want to live anymore.

179
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
I can figure out a way

180
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
to make more money.

181
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
No.

182
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I have a girl who doesn't know how to make money.

183
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
If I can't pay the money,

184
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I will give you her.

185
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I thank him.

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,480
I thank him for saving me from the brothel.

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Now you understand.

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm different from you.

189
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
You're the daughter of the bandit on the high court.

190
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
And I'm just the one who was killed.

191
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Half of the body is dead.

192
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
I can't live like this.

193
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
I've been a big boy.

194
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm a big boy.

195
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm a big boy.

196
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
I've been used to living in the dark and the rain.

197
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
He doesn't belong to me.

198
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
He's nothing to me.

199
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Only Zhao Zhe

200
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
makes me feel like someone is protecting me.

201
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I'm willing to be hurt by him

202
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
and be his little rabbit.

203
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Don't be obsessed with him.

204
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
He doesn't love me.

205
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
He doesn't love you at all.

206
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
He loves me!

207
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
I love him too!

208
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
I love him.

209
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
I love him too!

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
You don't understand at all.

211
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Yun Chi.

212
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
You don't understand at all.

213
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Yun Chi.

214
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Listen to me.

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
A person who really loves you

216
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
won't hurt you

217
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
or use you.

218
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
He won't let you be a dead man.

219
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Actually,

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
the person who really pulled you out of the garden

221
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
wasn't him at all.

222
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
But you.

223
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
You can live better.

224
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I really don't want to see you

225
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
do this again.

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Yun Yao.

227
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
I've never felt

228
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I was wrong.

229
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Love has no wrongs.

230
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
He can see

231
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
everything I did.

232
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Because he's hurt.

233
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Full of regrets.

234
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Attention.

235
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Why don't

236
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
he leave us with you?

237
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Hope.

238
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Don't touch me.

239
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
I can't help to do this.

240
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
For you,

241
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
you're the reason I did him.

242
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:55,280
The Breeze Seeker

243
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,440
But you don't make it, vilum.

244
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
You just ...

245
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
I will introduce you and it's up to me.

246
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,160
That's right.

247
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,200
Can you?

248
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,400
I will.

249
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,640
You are a receptors.

250
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,520
It will be there.

251
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,720
You mustınıt you.

252
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,040
It seem to be attracted.

253
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,900
I will let you know my future.

254
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:14,920
You need to show it,

255
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,200
to have a better family.

256
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,760
Don't you dare to give her up!

257
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,020
Have a look at the coin cup.

258
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,600
Go gets her name.

259
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,320
This death is harsh and tough.

260
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,160
Perhaps we'll have chance,

261
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,000
yet it's a kind sword.

262
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,880
Lies are sharp enough to pierce lovers.

263
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,580
Don't fall for my love.

264
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,980
The night is different.

265
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
You dream too much.

266
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,300
