1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by humans.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by humans.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by humans.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by humans.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by humans.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by humans.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The End

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Episode 1

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Zhenhu.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Princess,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this is not the place you should come.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
General Wushuang,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the imperial doctor said

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
my blood can be saved.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But...

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
General Wushuang,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
there is something strange about this.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Only when he was awake

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
did he know what happened.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let him in.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Your Highness,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you found that fire lotus.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let the imperial doctor take the medicine.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How is Zhen?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I didn't protect you.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How dare you!

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who dares to bully the people in my Mansion?

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He is my brother.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He won't do anything to me.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When you pretend to be a gentleman,

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we will escape together.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How can you do that?

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mother.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What are you doing?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't want him to die like you.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I will teach my brother.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Get out.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Brother,

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
what are you doing?

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Here you are.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Brother,

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
this wood is so similar to yours.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is the gift from my brother.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will let him keep you company

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and protect you.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Just like my brother

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
is always by your side.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is that okay?

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you, brother.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yize.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yize.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You let him in?

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I believe he won't hurt you.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can go out.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yuanyang,

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
do you want to believe me?

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yuzhi said I wanted to believe you.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'd rather believe the truth.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
His brother has been a part of my family.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I wanted to kill them!

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Xiaochun.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Xiaochun,

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
go get the doctor!

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yuanyang,

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
eat something.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zhang Hu,

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
go to the palace.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The prince is awake.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Did you hear that?

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's awake.

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It seems that

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
my heart is really in pain.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you doing?

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't touch me.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Zhang Hu, don't touch me.

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The prince is in a coma.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Xiaozhe!

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Xiaozhe,

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
this is your favorite wood carving man.

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The prince will put it next to you.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's with you.

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just like the prince is with you.

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He'll never feel lonely and scared again.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your Highness,

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
please,

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't want to see you

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
so sad

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
under the nine rings.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The prince is awake.

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go.

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go.

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Go.

96
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I want to see him again.

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't let him go in.

98
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Give me some time.

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll find the truth for you.

101
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.
