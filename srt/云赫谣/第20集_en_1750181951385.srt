1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
One more bite.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You said my wound was not good.

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can you serve me forever?

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I didn't think so.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But you're still in your prime.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Drink the medicine.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've sent some new medicines for you.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Drink it.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll take care of it.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll go get it.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I feel better lately.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you for your medicine.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't have to take care of you anymore.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
By the way,

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
this is for you.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll give it to you.

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Give it to me?

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
What is this?

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
It's a skill.

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Don't think it's small.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Just use it as a power.

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
When you encounter danger,

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
you can't just run away.

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,440
You should learn to protect yourself.

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Okay.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
I hope that

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
you won't use it again.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your Excellency!

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Give me some money.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,160
I'll reserves it for you.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,880
It looks great!

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
I'll give you some medicine.

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
I'll come back later.

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
It's okay.

35
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
I'll be back.

36
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
I'll be back.

37
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll be back.

38
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
I'll be back.

39
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I'll be back.

40
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Zhao Zhe!

41
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Zhao Zhe!

42
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Bastard!

43
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Are you okay? Get out of here!

44
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
I'll be back.

45
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
He's gone.

46
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Everything has changed.

47
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,880
This cold palace was built by me and my brother.

48
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,880
We spent countless days here.

49
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
But now,

50
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880
he's gone with that bastard.

51
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,880
He only has that bastard in his heart.

52
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I know.

53
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
I know he's rich.

54
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
He can give you.

55
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I can do it too.

56
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I can do anything for you.

57
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
It's good.

58
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Let's start.

59
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Didn't you say you've seen Jiang Ling Yu?

60
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Miss Yun Yao gave me a mission before she left.

61
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
I need your help.

62
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I'll go now.

63
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll go.

64
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I'll go.

65
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
I'll go now.

66
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
I'll go.

67
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
I'll go to the kitchen.

68
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Stop! What are you doing?

69
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
What are you doing?

70
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I can't hold it anymore.

71
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I'll go.

72
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Guys, it's time to go.

73
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll go now.

74
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
What's wrong with you?

75
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
It's me.

76
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Why are you here?

77
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Stop talking nonsense.

78
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
What's wrong?

79
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
What's wrong?

80
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
We're all dead.

81
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
You're going to kill me?

82
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
No.

83
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Did you see that?

84
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I saw it first.

85
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Did you see it?

86
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
I saw it first.

87
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
I saw it first.

88
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I saw it first.

89
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I saw it first.

90
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I saw it first.

91
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I saw it first.

92
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
My lord, our communication document.

93
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Why are you all women?

94
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm not lying, my lord.

95
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Actually, these are my wife and men.

96
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Wife and men?

97
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
So many?

98
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm so handsome.

99
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Can't you see?

100
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Can't you see?

101
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I've never seen such a shameless woman.

102
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
What are you talking about?

103
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Greetings, general.

104
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
What's wrong?

105
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
General, I just saw so many women here.

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
They are suspicious.

107
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
What's suspicious?

108
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
They have a common sense of humor.

109
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Yes.

110
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Yes.

111
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Let's go.

112
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Miss Wushuang is really beautiful and kind.

113
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Get out of here.
