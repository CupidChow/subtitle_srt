1
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,840
Your Highness.

2
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Did you find theשר that

3
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,600
wasducational army sent to Nichosar's yazins?

4
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,880
Where is he now?

5
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
In the forest of Cao.

6
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Experienced at the time.

7
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
This alone is Huiqiao's reputation.

8
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Don't tell him, Princess.

9
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,120
Don't tell him who, please.

10
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Good-bye, Your Highness.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,720
You...

12
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,320
Brother Huang, I heard you.

13
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't worry.

14
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,920
I'll take care of Huang Zao.

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Don't talk nonsense.

16
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,920
Okay.

17
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,040
Why are you locking the door?

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sister-in-law,

19
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,000
I promised Huang Zao to take care of you.

20
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
What do you mean?

21
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
I heard that

22
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,880
they found a clue

23
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,480
that you might be in danger.

24
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,240
So,

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
leave it to me.

26
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Stay here.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,760
Open the door.

28
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Open the door!

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Open the door!

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Hurry up!

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,720
Yun Yang!

32
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Open the door!

33
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Yun Yang!

34
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,360
Open the door!

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Open the door!

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Yun Yang!

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Open the door!

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,520
Yun Yang!

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:26,960
Yun Yang!

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Your Highness the Prince of Qi,

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
open the door!

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Open the door!

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,040
No.

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,200
I promised Huang Xiong to lock the door.

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
I won't let our Yitong

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
get into trouble.

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm afraid that

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,480
he'll make a mistake

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
and make a mistake.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm not like that.

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,640
Okay.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,520
You said you're not like that.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
How do you prove it?

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
I've always been a light.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,680
I've never...

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,160
I've always been a light.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
I've always been a light.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
I've always been a light.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
I've always been a light.

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
I've always been a light.

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,160
I've always been a light.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
I've always been a light.

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
I've always been a light.

64
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
I've always been a light.

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,800
I've always been a light.

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
I've always been a light.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
I've always been a light.

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,240
I've always been a light.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
I've always been a light.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
I've always been a light.

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,600
I've always been a light.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
I've always been a light.

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,080
I've always been a light.

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,280
I've always been a light.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,560
I've always been a light.

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
I've always been a light.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
I've always been a light.

78
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
I've always been a light.

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
I've always been a light.

80
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,900
I've always, always been a light.

81
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,500
Who is it?

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
What are you doing?

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Yun Zhi.

84
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You...

85
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
What are you doing?

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Something's wrong.

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Let me go.

88
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
You're from the North Army.

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,880
We just want to know the truth.

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,120
We won't hurt you.

91
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Stop it.

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,720
Xun Wei,

93
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,120
you're a liar.

94
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,480
You're the one who killed the General.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
And you.

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
I know you're from the Yue Army.

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,880
All the people from the North Army

98
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,400
died because of you.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I killed you!

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
You...

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
Do you know who I am?

102
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
King Qi.

103
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
Of course I know you.

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,480
He's my brother.

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,880
He won't hurt me.

106
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
You pretend to be stubborn.

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,200
Let's escape together.

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Take it.

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
But...

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Why?

111
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't come over.

112
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Or I'll kill him.

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
You dare not.

115
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,880
Why?

116
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
He's my brother.

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
I wanted to kill them.

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Say it again.

119
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Yun Niang.

121
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Your Majesty.

122
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Xiao Zhi.

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Xiao Zhi.

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Xiao Zhi.

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Xiao Zhi.

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,600
How could this happen?

127
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Xiao Zhi.

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Xiao Zhi.

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,600
Hold on, Xiaozhe.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Brother Wang.

131
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,280
Don't blame Huang Suo.

132
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
Xiaozhe, stop talking.

133
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't blame him.

134
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,600
Xiaozhe.

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Xiaozhe.

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
Xiaozhe.

137
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,200
Wake up.

138
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,280
Xiaozhe.

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Xiaozhe.

140
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,560
How is it?

141
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,600
Your Highness.

142
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,160
I hope you're not upset.

143
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,080
I...

144
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
I don't understand.

145
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
You must save me.

146
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Don't kill you.

147
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,760
Please calm down.

148
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,040
I just want to...

149
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Well,

150
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
there's something else to her.

151
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,840
What is it?

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Go there...

153
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,780
Your highness

154
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,600
You are not alone

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,920
There is another medicinal们

156
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
The condition of the chief is extremely difficult.

157
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,920
He needs to be in the long run and take the position of the chief.

158
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I don't know where I can find him.

159
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Your Highness.

160
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm looking for you, young master.

161
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Young master, someone is looking for you.

162
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Did something happen to him?

163
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
It has nothing to do with him.

164
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I want to find a treasured medicine.

165
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Please tell me where Fire Lotus is.

166
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Fire Lotus, I have it here.

167
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Why are you standing there? Go get it.

168
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,920
If you want to find it, I will help you unconditionally.

169
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Thank you.

170
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Young master, why do you want to give Fire Lotus to him?

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,920
But you are with Feng Yuexuan's mother and she is in the room for seven days and seven nights.

172
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
No, you...

173
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Who did you hear that from?

174
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Jianghu has already passed away.

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I...

176
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
I...

177
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Zhenhu.

178
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Princess, this is not the place you should come.

179
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
General Wushuang, the doctor said that my blood can be saved.
