1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You outfits.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Zhou.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Still alive.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will not bear to see you for long.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then I willç•€ your pain.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why did you come out of the temple?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Why are you wearing the clothes of the Tai Pulin?

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Since you really want to know this,

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
come with me.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Tomorrow.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,360
The

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Imperial Brother,

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
do you remember this place?

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Of course, I remember.

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
This is our childhood.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
When I was young,

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
I remember this place.

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
I was a little bit of a little girl.

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
I was a little girl.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I was a little girl.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
I was a little girl.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
When I was young,

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
I remember this place.

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I was a little girl.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Mother.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Mother, don't die.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Please, Lord Li,

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
please save my mother.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Get out of here.

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
What else do you think?

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Two princes who are not brought up.

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Mother.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Don't call me a mother.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Don't call me mother.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't call me mother.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Don't call me mother.

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Xiaozhuang.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
You are not worth living.

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I understand that.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
This concubine died here today.

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
No one will be punished.

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
You are not worth living.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
You are not worth living.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
You are not worth living.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I am not worth living.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Please, don't kill him.

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I beg you.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Brother, why didn't he save us?

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
This palace

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
has filled with too many colds and selfishness.

56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Xiaozhuang,

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
I promise

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
I will never let you get angry again.

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Since then,

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
you have been working hard to get me.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Later,

62
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
you have been working hard.

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Father asked what you want to say.

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
You only need a long yard.

65
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I remember you telling me

66
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Xiaozhuang,

67
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
this is our home.

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
I was so happy.

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
We finally got home.

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I remember all of this.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
But you?

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
You forgot everything that you promised me.

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,360
You said we should be strong together.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
To complete our promise,

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I have become too weak.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I am going to be a fool every day.

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I will say the good things for you.

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I will stop you from doing it.

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Why are you like this?

80
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
I don't want to.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
But you are too kind.

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Only I can take this.

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
This is what we were crying for when we were little.

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,360
The eunuch who saved my mother's life.

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
And this is the one

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
that you just took a big bite of the last few days.

87
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
And this.

88
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Enough!

89
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Are you crazy?

90
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
I am not crazy.

91
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
You are crazy!

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
For a woman,

93
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
you are willing to give up all the future of our brothers?

94
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Of course I won't allow it.

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
The people of Yue are so pure.

96
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
They are not like the ones who are in the wild.

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Enough!

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I will never agree to your marriage.

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
I also tell you,

100
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
if you don't go this time,

101
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I will take back your military power.

102
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
From now on,

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
you are no longer my son.

104
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Father, come here!

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I will put him down!

106
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
So five years ago,

107
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
you were the one who killed Yue's clan.

108
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Yes.

109
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I pretended to be a saint

110
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
and promised you a wedding.

111
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
On the way to Yue's clan,

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I will take you out of the city with me.

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I will wear the military uniform of your army

114
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
and become your wife.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I am you.

116
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
King of the Silver.

117
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Xiao Cheng, you...

118
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Xiao Cheng, you...

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Do you want to know

120
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
how I killed Yue's clan?

121
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Princess.

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
This is the real Northern Army that was born back then.

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Your Highness,

124
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
do you remember what happened that year?

125
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
That year,

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
we returned from Yue's clan to the Great Wei State.

127
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,360
We killed Yue's clan's Northern Army

128
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,360
and implored them to leave the capital.

129
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I was lucky enough to survive.

130
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
So,

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,360
did you meet the ambush in Yue's clan?

132
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Yes.

133
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
After the ambush,

134
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
King of the Silver

135
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,360
was in a coma.

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
When we left the capital,

137
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,360
he was like a human.

138
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
A human?

139
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Did he already have another one?

140
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Do you remember

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
what was the same place

142
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
after he was ambushed?

143
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Except for

144
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
some people who even called our names.

145
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Oh, right.

146
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,360
There was a small black-and-white

147
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
taichi in his back.

148
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Taichi?

149
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes.

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
He said that

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
he wouldn't kill me.

152
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Taichu is Zhao Zheng.

153
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
He is the one who killed my family.

154
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
How should I tell Zhao Zheng?

155
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
How is it, brother?

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
This is a genius.

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm not sure.

158
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
This is a genius.

159
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
A genius?

160
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
So why did you leave the capital?

161
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Because those evil spirits

162
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,360
can give father a long life.

163
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
What do you think I want?

164
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I want the future of the King of the Silver

165
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
and the Seven Nations.

166
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
But who knew that I was old?

167
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,360
That drug-dead saved you again.

168
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
I can't let him get close to you

169
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
and hurt you.

170
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Turn around.

171
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Turn around and look at me!

172
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
So you know that Jia Si killed you.

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
You'd rather let me believe that you're dead.

174
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Am I right?

175
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
I'm sorry, brother.

176
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm worried about you.

177
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Brother, don't be angry.

178
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Don't be angry, brother.

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Brother, don't be angry.

180
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Don't be angry.

181
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Don't be angry.

182
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Don't be angry.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Don't be angry.

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Don't be angry.

185
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Don't be angry.

186
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
It's all because of me

187
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
that you've become like this.

188
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I'll help you

189
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
to get the future.

190
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
