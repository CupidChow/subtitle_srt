1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The first time I saw a monster that was very powerful.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That monster was very powerful.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was very powerful, really powerful.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It was very powerful, really powerful.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I remember all the memories of your family.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How should I tell him that everything is done by Zhao Zhe?

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Actually...

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's me.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The one who threw your son in the wedding was me.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You said it was you.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How do you prove it?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All the members of the band

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
were happy for the wedding.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I brought the gold in the army.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The night club was so crowded.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was so crowded.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It was so crowded.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The band saw me, but they were so happy.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was so scared.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I killed everyone.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everyone in the band was buried in this wedding.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I didn't get off the horse yet.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I killed someone in the mirror.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It seems like the one in the wedding room

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
couldn't even come to the wedding.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The blood was spilled on the wedding day.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A piece of silver was spilled.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The blood was spilled on the floor.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The blood was spilled on the floor.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Those gold-gray people

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
were so confused.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They were so beautiful.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And that Wen Pongzi.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He wanted to steal the wedding dress from behind.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But where was he?

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I turned around and saved his head and body.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Blood was spilled.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They were all running around.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Enough.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Stop talking.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why did you do that?

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because you bandwomen's blood is so white.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
From the moment you saved me

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I was the one who took the task of the band.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was all my plan.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Shut up.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You said it was all your plan, right?

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want you to kneel before the band's victory.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want to kill you personally.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to make your blood

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to remember every spirit of the band.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your Highness, you're back.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I've been looking for you since yesterday.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've found the real heir to the army.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sit.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Your Highness, since you lost your will

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you haven't had a drink with us.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's the occasion today?

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's been a long time since we've talked to each other.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Tonight, we'll be free and not guilty.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Cheers.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Cheers.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Cheers.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Cheers.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Cheers.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cheers.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Cheers.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've seen your growth.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've seen your growth.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Zhenhu.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I remember you were very timid.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now you're a well-off general.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Not bad.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, no.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're all in charge of the army.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Xiaofeng.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you remember this scar?

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because of your uncle's beard

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I helped you carry it.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, you can't be careless

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
when you go to the battlefield.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Your Highness, you're here.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The key is to protect us

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
at the first time.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Am I right?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What if I'm not here?

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Your Highness.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Nothing.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm just kidding.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wushuang.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're the only female general

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
in the army.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If not for me

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you wouldn't have been here

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
for two years.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You won the game

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in the first year.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But you didn't have enough strength

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to win the game.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In the second year

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you stood in front of the army

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
at the gate of the King's Mansion

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and fought for a long time.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But you didn't see your name.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Stop looking.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Go. I don't have you.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you want to join the army?

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Can I?

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Follow me.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But in the battlefield

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you're like them.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're in the war.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're even more powerful

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
than them.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wushuang.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I didn't see you wrong.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Every person you're sitting with

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is the pride of the army.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're also the hero

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that I admire.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We fight together

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and guard the country.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Every battle

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and every battle

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
have saved the reputation of the army.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Your Highness.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What do you want to say?

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Stop the army.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
From now on

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Shen Wushuang

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
is your new general.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your Highness.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm so proud of you.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How dare you take such a heavy responsibility?

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Your Highness.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Where are you going?

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Your Highness.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're our general.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We'll follow you.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Your Highness.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We can't lose you.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't listen to me?

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is the military uniform of the North.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It can handle hundreds of troops.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's also the military position of the North.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Take it.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Take it.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The soldiers of the North

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
will take you to the battlefield

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
in the future.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Please keep your guard up.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No matter where I am

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
my heart is with the North.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The war is over.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
All things

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
are because of me.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let me bear

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
all of this.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Give me some time.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll find the truth for you.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Will you believe me?

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Go.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is he more suitable for the people next to him?

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Or is he more suitable for me?

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It must be him.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What are you looking at?

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's go.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go back to work.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Come.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Come.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Did you hear that?

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The soldiers of the North

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
were taken by the demon.

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They even handed over the troops.

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The demon escaped.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I heard that the demon

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
had a bone in his blood.

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He would be punished

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
for drinking it.

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The soldiers must have suffered.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll go back to work.

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The war is over.
