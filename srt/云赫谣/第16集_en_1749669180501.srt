00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,540
Episode 14

3
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,920
Tell me,

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,440
The big-still beast would have let you escape

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,300
by devouring frontier

6
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,340
with your wicked heart taken away by your evil spirit,

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,300
and there was agroup of ancient women

8
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,240
Elder Li is austere,

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,280
after drinking will be jealous of her,

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,380
Goddess of War must having suffer a bone heart.

11
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
How did you guess it?

12
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
I'm sorry. I'm late.

13
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Didn't I tell you to watch over the sword slave?

14
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Where is he now?

15
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Where is he?

16
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Are you okay?

17
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Where is the sword slave now?

18
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,300
I'm going to take him to the Moon Realm to revive Sheng Chi.

19
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
He's already on his way.

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
The sword slave is going to kill my brother.

21
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
No.

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
He must die in my hands.

23
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
What's going on?

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
You have a problem?

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Prince of Nianwang already knows your identity.

26
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
I won't let you be in danger.

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Leave this to me.

28
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Okay.

29
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,300
Okay.

30
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
I want you to be my good sister.

31
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
And I will be your secret.

32
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
I'll never forgive you.

34
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
I didn't mean it.

37
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
목 Bank

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Lord

39
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,420
Don't mention it.

40
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,100
and into my land?

41
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,440
Father.

42
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,420
Let's get out of here.

43
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,120
As you wish, Father.

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
Mother,

45
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,080
please.

46
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,680
Mother.

47
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,460
Shiden Yi.

48
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,260
Granny.

49
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,740
Granny.

50
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,420
It seems that the whole village is infected.

51
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,100
Granny.

52
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,980
Don't die.

53
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,780
He has been infected for a long time.

54
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,100
Granny, don't leave me.

55
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,940
Granny.

56
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,980
Don't leave me.

57
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,580
Don't be afraid.

58
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,380
He's infected too.

59
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,140
Granny.

60
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,860
The expected Monster На laws

61
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,060
won't be the same.

62
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,860
You will get to the end of it.

63
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm not as young as you think.

64
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
I saved him,

65
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
but I have a lot of hatred in my heart.

66
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,420
I hate myself for being weak and helpless,

67
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
and I can't see a lot of people die.

68
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Let's go.

69
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,420
The Water Garden

70
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
It's a poison.

71
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Poison?

72
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
The Water Garden has a problem.

73
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,420
The usual plague won't spread so fast.

74
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,420
Poison is a drug that is made with the body of the infected.

75
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Someone put it in the water garden

76
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,420
to not only speed up the spread,

77
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,420
but also cause a disease.

78
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
Poison

79
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
Poison

80
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,420
Poison

81
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Don't be afraid.

82
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Poison

83
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Good boy, Poison will be back soon.

84
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
What did he go to do?

85
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,420
He...

86
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
He is protecting this little thing.

87
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,420
There is a legend in our country

88
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
that after a family's death,

89
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,420
they will become a beautiful bubble.

90
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,420
Then they will float, float,

91
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,420
float to the top of the sacred pool,

92
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
become a star,

93
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,420
choose the most beautiful wish in the world,

94
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,420
and then do your best to fulfill it.

95
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Really?

96
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Then my mother-in-law

97
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
is a star in the wild?

98
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Can she hear my wish?

99
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
Of course.

100
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Maybe she is the brightest star in the sky.

101
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,420
She is working hard to listen to Xiaowan's wish

102
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
and is preparing to fulfill it.

103
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,420
Then I hope that my mother-in-law will come back soon.

104
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,420
People in the village will never be separated.

105
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
They will be together forever.

106
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,420
Good boy, you are sleeping in the hall.

107
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
My mother-in-law is already well.

108
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,420
I was like her back then.

109
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,420
I saw my mother-in-law's death.

110
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
I must fulfill her wish.

111
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
This is a human's fate.

112
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
It will happen soon.

113
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
So we must move right now.

114
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
How about this?

115
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,420
You go to the water source with that lens.

116
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,420
I will go to the village to check on the body

117
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
and see what solution I can use.

118
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
You are going to be in danger alone.

119
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
It's too urgent.

120
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
I can't let more people suffer.

121
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Wait a minute.

122
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Xiaowan, use this.

123
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Take this young man.

124
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
If there is any danger, blow him away.

125
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I will be back soon.

126
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Okay.

127
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Next time,

128
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
What are you doing?

129
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
Do you want the face of a back snake?

130
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,820
You killed so many people at night, you must have killed him!

131
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,380
I know him! He's the one who told me to kill him!

132
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,260
Kill him! Kill him!

133
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,660
Okay! But even if you kill me, you can't end this crisis.

134
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,940
Nonsense! I'll catch him!

135
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,340
Catch him! Catch him!

136
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,900
You killed so many people at night, you must have killed him!

137
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Kill him! Kill him!

138
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,100
Kill him! Kill him!

139
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,700
Kill him! Kill him!

140
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Kill him! Kill him!

141
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,900
Kill him!

142
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Kill him! Kill him!
