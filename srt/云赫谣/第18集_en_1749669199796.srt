I have never been a little bit

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I have never been a little bit

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I have never been a little bit

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have never been a little bit

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have never been a little bit

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have never been a little bit

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have never been a little bit

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have never been a little bit

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have never been a little bit

I have never been a little bit

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,160
I really want you to see who I am

17
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe you can find yourself in the mirror

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,560
Maybe there are two more miracles

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,000
There are two miracles

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I know

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I know

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Once again

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have always expected

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's good that you're back.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You've been with me all this time.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you hurt?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's raining outside.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to go out and get some air.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on, be careful.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello, everyone.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello, Wang Ya.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Here.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to buy some food.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to cook some food at home.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Be careful.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Here.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Be careful.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've saved everyone's life.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
According to our local customs,

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the people of Yongjie are living in the house.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The wine that is served on the river

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
can be used by Miss Wu.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Everyone, is that okay?

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, then.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You guys go to the room.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You guys go to prepare the food.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Everyone, move up.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's so busy.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We don't work forutzers.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
At night, people stop in any way.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hopefully the weather is good.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I entirely supported Miss Wu at work

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
because she isn't seeing the wonderful day.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Withdraw our financial payments,

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
we'll調 you well.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You must work with us just this time.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080

63
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,240
I can't

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,000
It's none of

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,200
Sometimes that part is no longer

66
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
we always fight

67
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I understand you.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,800
But do you know that I still have a chance to meet you?

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
This time, I have no hatred.

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Only you and me.

71
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I love you so much.

72
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I love you so much.

73
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
He was saved by you.

75
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Kill me.

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
You dare not?

79
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
You are also infected.

80
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
No!

81
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Chacha!

82
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Chacha!

86
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Come here.

87
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Why don't you use the antidote?

90
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm sorry.

91
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
