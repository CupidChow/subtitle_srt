1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not sure if I can get the fourth one.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,780
The voice actor had givenchten

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,980
If you don't care, it will be useless

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,460
too many stupid people

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,720
Si Wang

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,500
You write it

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,220
But Duan faze Ou

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,500
MyРЕ

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,460
If you don't want

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:35,780
The key to

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,480
First, I'm doing that over to protect royal officials and everybody.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,900
You're harder than you think.

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,480
I'll show you how hard it is to beows.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,820
So take action now!

22
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,220
How could you think that I'd write you very hard?

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,800
avanzed

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,100
She's the one in charge here with the throne.

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,180
she alone was doing everything to defend our nation.

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,400
King Wuyu.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Ah, god.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
What's your name?

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
The drug of the Tai Bu Shu.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Without a name,

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
there's only a name.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
From today on,

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
you are the drug of the Tai Bu Shu.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Without a name,

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
there's only a name.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
What's wrong?

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
It's good.

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
You're still trying to kill me?

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Don't think you saved me.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I'll thank you.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
You're just like them.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
You brought me back.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
You want to humiliate me.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Of course I want to kill you.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Your highness.

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
The people who drank the drug of the Tai Bu Shu

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
were poisoned.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
They're all dead.

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
It's your poison?

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Yes.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
The people of the grassland

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
want to kill me.

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Today,

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
they want to kill you.

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
They want to kill us

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
with the blood of the drug.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
They're all dead.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I want them to pay for it.

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Look at her.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Zhang He.

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I can't kill you today.

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You're a bastard.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Miss.

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I'll leave you alone here.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Just call me if you need anything.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm Shen Wushuang.

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you.

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
I'll tell you to be safe.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
If there's another time...

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
What?

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Kill me.

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Then you can do it now.

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
There's no maid in the Prince of Ning's Mansion.

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Remember to apply the medicine.

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I'll kill you.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Zhang He.

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
You were a bandit before me.

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
But I was a demon.

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Now,

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
you've forgotten the crimes you committed.

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I'll make you pay for it.

82
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Where's the drug?

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Where's the drug?

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Didn't I ask you to bring it back

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
and give me the medicine for my long life?

87
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I sent it to the banquet.

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
You're a good person.

90
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Who would have thought

91
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
that Prince of Ning was so powerful?

92
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Powerful?

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
His Majesty is dead.

95
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
What?

96
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Dead?

97
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Yes.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
He's poisoned.

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Your Majesty,

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
the time hasn't come yet.

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
The letter of the drug...

102
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
You're too harsh.

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
You said that

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
if you can make it,

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
you can make me die.

106
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I don't care if he's dead or alive.

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
You must find him back

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
and continue to practice.

109
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Yes.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Get out of here.

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
You're dead.

112
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Get out of here.

113
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I'll show you what I'm done with.

114
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Go!

115
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I'll show you what I'm done with.

116
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
What are you looking at?

117
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
That's him.

118
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,560
It's his blood.

119
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,320
He killed my lord!

120
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
Take him away!

121
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,120
How dare you!

122
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
How dare you bully my people?

123
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,480
Kill them all!

124
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
My lord is innocent!

125
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,400
This demon must die today!

126
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
A year ago,

127
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,520
the demon in the Qianqiu Palace

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
was not even a hundred years old.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Who would have called for them?

130
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
Isn't the demon's life

131
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
a life of death?

132
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,080
The demon is dead.

133
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,360
How dare you talk to my lord?

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Kill him!

135
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
Kill him!

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Kill him!

137
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,960
You can't kill him!

138
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,240
You can't kill him!

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,960
Kill him!

140
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,440
Go!

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Kill him!

142
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,840
Kill him!

143
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,400
Stop!

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
You can't kill him!

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Who dares to do this?

146
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Kill him!

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
My lord!

148
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,200
My lord!

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
How dare you!

150
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
My lord!

151
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,920
My lord!

152
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,760
Your highness,

153
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,480
it's for your Yi-Wan's sect to handle this poison.

154
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Your highness, please treat this Medical Lady is useful.

155
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,520
If I won't,

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,680
This...

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
Take a look!

158
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,560
They cucumbers and psychogreed you

159
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:52,080
making it so he can treat this

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,040
Medicine Girl.

161
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,160
Toob 56

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
Your Majesty in�

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
My daughter has been dead since day one

164
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,040
rigth

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
Miss Cao coloured her in red

166
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh what should we do

167
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,520
This is the crystal

168
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
Of the past

169
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,040
Young man

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,080
He was yellow

171
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,520
Even though I was divid Parkinson's

172
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,300
I don't think you need drug

173
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm not telling you

174
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
Nothing strange

175
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,800
So

176
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,060
Because of that

177
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
You insist on fighting the Holy Order?

178
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,060
I will tell father about this.

179
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
Let's go.

180
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,060
The Holy Order

181
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
Brother Hua, you were busy last night.

182
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Why did you do this?

183
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
Why are you so protective?

184
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
You can't take father's soul seriously.

185
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
Brother Hua.

186
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,060
Zheng He, you left me.

187
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Your Highness,

188
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,060
Miss Yijiu's corpse is in the toilet.

189
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,060
You want to keep her alive?

190
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Is she the person you drew?

191
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,060
How did you find out?

192
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,060
I only found out that the Imperial Guards of the North of Zhenbei

193
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
were not back yet.

194
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,060
They said they were killed.

195
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
I sent the message to the people.

196
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
I asked them to kill Yujie.

197
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
But I have no memory of this.

198
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,060
I said that she has my memory.

199
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Keep an eye on her.

200
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Yes, Your Highness.

201
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
If she is not Hua Zhongren,

202
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
who else can she be?

203
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
I will kill her.

204
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
The poison in the Holy Order is getting stronger.

205
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,060
I can't even take the medicine bottle.

206
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,060
I must get the antidote as soon as possible.

207
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
General Wushuang, the next day is the Lantern Festival.

208
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I have a baby.

209
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,060
I promised to visit Lantern Festival.

210
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,060
I want to see if I can find someone to take care of me.

211
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
There are not many men like you.

212
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Okay, I will leave.

213
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,060
Thank you, General Wushuang.

214
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Hua Zhongren.
