1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to do a sonara but still work effectively.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It will centur quality damage decide only the damage.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
دا

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why did Sis have to have her friends?

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to lose him.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You have to live well for me.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That arrow is not dead for a day.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You have to keep an eye on him.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,620
The

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your Highness, your eyes...

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm fine.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't worry.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There is a kind of grass in the Moon Tribe.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will cure it with a miracle.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wushuang, take care of yourself.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't lose you.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't know what you're going to do.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I will wait for you.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wushuang, what are you waiting for?

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Xiaowan, the fire is about to start.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When I grow up, I will fight like General Shen.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Protect our family.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Nothing.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Wait a minute.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
General Wushuang, I'm late.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
General Wushuang, please take care of Xiaowan.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's go.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Your Highness, please go upstairs.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Be careful.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wait here. I'll get some water.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Be careful.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Who's there?

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who's there?

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who's there?

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I won't be polite if you do that.

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's go.

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't cut it.

48
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I told you not to cut it.

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sorry, Yunyang.

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm not well now.

51
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can't see the smoke.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't protect you.

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's good.

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll protect you.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I told you.

56
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm your life.

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm your life.

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll let you live to the fullest.

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong?

60
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I remember that the mountain in front of the small lake

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
was poisoned by the smoke.

62
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's a tomb there.

63
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll go ask.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's go.

65
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's wrong?

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know.

68
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't know.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know.

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know.

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Excuse me.

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I want to ask

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
why the small lake in front of the lake was poisoned?

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a painful thing.

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The bamboo village in the mountain was poisoned a few years ago.

77
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The small lake was poisoned by the smoke.

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The smell of the blood was all the way down.

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The villagers couldn't stand it.

80
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So they poisoned it.

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was the water that was sealed in the lake.

82
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you know anything else?

83
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's something.

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We have to go around the mountain

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and take a different direction.

86
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But that road is not easy to find.

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't waste your time.

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go and take a road for the children.

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you, aunt.

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you, uncle.

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She's so good looking.

92
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
She's pretty.

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
She looks like I was young.

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're so good looking.

95
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're even compared to her.

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Liu Chunsheng, what do you mean?

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm still upset.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I dare not.

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I dare not.

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let them have a good laugh.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll go and get ready.

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why don't you sit down and eat something?

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No, thanks, aunt.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Be careful.

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Be careful.

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Be careful.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Be careful.

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Be careful of the slope and stones at the bottom of your feet.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Be careful of the stones.

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go this way.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Uncle Liu, how long will it take to get there?

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Almost.

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Almost.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Be careful of the stones.

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Raise your feet higher.

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right.

117
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong?

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Uncle Liu, are you okay?

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm fine.

120
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Who's so weak?

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can't do anything without you.

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Uncle Liu, you're easily hurt.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll help you get out of here.

124
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, no, no.

125
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't bear to do this.

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This...

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yunyao, come over here.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Be careful.

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Left, left.

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll carry you.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Be careful.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come on.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
One, two, three, go.

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come on.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Try this.

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes, yes, yes.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Right here.

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Uncle Liu.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's going on?

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's wrong with your feet?

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's okay, my dear.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I just got a minor injury.

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was accidentally injured by the supplementary.

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How many times have I told you to be careful?

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why are you still so careless?

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're not the one who said that.

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you have any white flowers, snakes, grass,

148
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and purple flowers?

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You need to take care of this wound.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I do.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have a lot of family matters.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll go get it right away.

153
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Be careful.

154
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.
