1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now I'm using the same technique as the other one.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,120
is

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
the

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Where is he?

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm the only one in the wild.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who are you guys asking?

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's talk.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who is he?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The Jiang Wuni of Kui Xing House.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Someone actually called him Jiang Gezhu.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You are Jiang Wuni.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm still his old man.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where is the old man?

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Luo Yun Fei Jian.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He really is Jiang Wuni.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sorry.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wait.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What do you think I am?

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I just want to leave.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Get out.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who are you?

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Miss.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Miss.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you okay?

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Sir.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who is he?

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's him.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He is a good person.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He can be a good person.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He is a good person.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's take him to the room.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You are awake.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's you.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's interesting to be chased by a dress.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not a good idea.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He can't be chased.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come on,ìˆ star.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We can take the crap.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He is cheating.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A little girl.

49
00:04:50,140 --> 00:05:14,240
She was a demon who came out from the

50
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,300
white cave and was kept alive.

51
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
It's really a good deal.

52
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,300
You can go.

53
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Thank you for your help.

54
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Sir, can I borrow some money?

55
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
We never raise strangers here.

56
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
Hurry up.

57
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I accidentally broke your food today.

58
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
I...

59
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
I'll go and make you some food.

60
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Where's the kitchen?

61
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
The kitchen is over there.

62
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Sir, he's playing with us.

63
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
I know.

64
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
You know he's not going out.

65
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
He's not leaving.

66
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
He's putting us in trouble.

67
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Life is boring.

68
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
But I...

69
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
I just want to give myself some fun.

70
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
You're playing with me.

71
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Get him a new suit.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
He's wearing red.

74
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
He's so ugly.

75
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Okay.

76
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Okay.

77
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Your Highness.

78
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Where's Yijiu?

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
I don't know.

80
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,300
You're obviously alive.

81
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
How could you not know?

82
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
He's so good to you.

83
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
He's so deep in your heart.

84
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Tell me.

85
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Where's he?

86
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Tell me.

87
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Where's he?

88
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
I really don't know.

89
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Your Highness.

90
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Please calm down.

91
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
How can I calm down?

92
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm lying on the bed right now.

93
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I'm in a coma.

94
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
It's all because of these damn drugsters.

95
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Your Highness.

96
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
I've sent someone to investigate

97
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Yijiu's news.

98
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Now, it's all because of His Highness's illness.

99
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
We need to wait patiently.

100
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
If my brother has any three-way relationship,

101
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I'll never let you off.

102
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Lock him up.

103
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Sir.

104
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Why hasn't he done his job?

105
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
He's been doing it for a long time.

106
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Here he comes.

107
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Have a taste.

108
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
It's still beautiful.

109
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
It's okay.

110
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
It's okay.

111
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
How is it?

112
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,300
I want the fresh flower cake.

113
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
But there's only cake.

114
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Where's the fresh flower?

115
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Fresh flower cake.

116
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,300
I want the fresh flower cake.

117
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
It's not the fresh flower.

118
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
It's just a joke.

119
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
This cake is also a match for the fresh flower.

120
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Fresh flower with delicious filling.

121
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Fresh flower cake.

122
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Do you want some?

123
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Sir.

124
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
The red thread and the main body...

125
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
I can collect all the news

126
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
in the city for the first time.

127
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
Wake up.

128
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Wake up.

129
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
It's a joke.

130
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Who is this girl?

131
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Why is she so bloody?

132
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
I...

133
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I met her when I was about to die.

134
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
She's a woman with a deep wound.

135
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
She's not well.

136
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
She can't be loved.

137
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Yes, Saintess.

138
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Have you forgotten the rules left by our ancestors?

139
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
We can't let outsiders enter the village.

140
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
But...

141
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
But I can't just die.

142
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Then you can't let her in.

143
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
It's a big deal.

144
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Right?

145
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
I'm sorry.
