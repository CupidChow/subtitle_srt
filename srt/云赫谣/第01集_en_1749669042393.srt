1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
It's going to be just the two of us.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I had no........

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm going to use the same technique as you.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,400
It's on your blade.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,640
Who brought me out of the pajamas?

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,360
Suppose a drug first,

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,540
then we'll succeed.

19
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,400
Todayâ€¦

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,480
Special Enchantress,

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,680
An Rel formas drugs and drugs

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,600
That broke theoph el Gad.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,800
Why justesses

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,580
laugh

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:03,680
Is

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,880
Ah

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
The next batch...

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Many drug slaves have died.

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
These drug slaves can cure hundreds of poisons.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
It's hard to get out of here.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
You're questioning me?

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
It's you.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I'll send you off.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
To Prince Ning.

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Lord Li,

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
can you really let me die for a thousand years?

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm so desperate.

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm afraid I'll die for nothing.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I can't die.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
The next batch,

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
leave!

42
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Brother Huang,

43
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
you killed the Wei's men.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
The palace is under siege.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Everything will be destroyed.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
The Wei's men,

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
everything will be destroyed.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Now I can live out of the Wangu Palace.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
My blood can kill people and kill innocent people.

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Only if you die,

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
can I live.

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Wake up.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Wake up.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Your Highness.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Who are you?

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
It's him.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Brother Zhang.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Brother Zhang,

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
he doesn't know me.

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Brother Huang.

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Brother Huang.

62
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Brother Zhang.

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Brother Zhang.

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Brother Huang, you finally wake up.

65
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Prince Ning,

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
you're so lucky.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
You're alive.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Where's he?

69
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Who is he?

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
The one who saved me.

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
He...

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
He was taken back by the Grand Tutor.

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Today is the Grand Tutor's banquet.

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
The banquet?

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
The Grand Tutor

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
is the most expensive banquet

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
for the noble.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Every day,

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
he uses holy water to wash his face.

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
He uses the holy water to soak his hands.

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
He uses holy water to clean his face

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
and give the noble to drink.

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
The medicine he doesn't use

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
can cure the poison with blood.

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
It can also cure the disease.

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Brother Huang.

87
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Those people drink the medicine

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
and see the mountain as a light

89
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
and protect the spring.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
So they use the holy water

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
to make the banquet.

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Uncle Wang,

93
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
you're not bad, right?

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
But let me tell you.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
The best thing about this palace is

96
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
the new blood of the medicine.

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I'll get him a new blood now.

98
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
The Grand Tutor

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Prince Ning has come.

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I heard that the moon is broken 5 years ago.

101
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Prince Ning is injured and lost his memory.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
The medicine is a good blood.

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I hope you can recover your memory.

104
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Prince Ning,

105
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
the medicine is a good blood.

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
The blood is the best.

107
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
The best is the best.

108
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Prince Ning, please.

109
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
The Grand Tutor

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm afraid that

111
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I'll kill you

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
with the blood of the Grand Tutor.

113
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
But you're so heavy.

114
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
The blood is the best.

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
The autumn wind blows up a long lotus

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
to wait for the flower to bloom.

117
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
The blood is the best.

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Don't be afraid.

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm here to save you.

120
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I've never been a person

121
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
who can be as gentle as you.

122
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I can't live with you

123
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
and be as gentle as you.

124
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I've never been a person

125
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
who can be as gentle as you.

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I can't live with you

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
and be as gentle as you.

128
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I can't live with you

129
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
and be as gentle as you.

130
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I can't live with you and be as gentle as you.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Prince Ning,

132
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
the medicine is a good blood.

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Are you sure you want to stop me?

134
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Prince Ning,

135
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
the medicine is a good blood.

136
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Are you sure you want to stop me?

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm sure.

138
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm sure.

139
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm sure.

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm sure.

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm sure.

142
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm sure.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm sure.

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm sure.

145
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm sure.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm sure.

147
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Who are you?

148
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm a girl.

149
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm a girl.

150
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm a girl.

159
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm a girl.

160
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm a girl.

161
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm a girl.

162
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
