1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first battle is over.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The battle is over.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The battle is over.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The battle is over.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The battle is over.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The battle is over.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The battle is over.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The battle is over.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The battle is over.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The battle is over.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The battle is over.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The battle is over.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The battle is over.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The battle is over.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The battle is over.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The battle is over.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The battle is over.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The battle is over.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The battle is over.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The battle is over.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The battle is over.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The spell must have been done well before the battle.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The ninth battle is over,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,580
I want to say goodbye to

25
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,780
you, and wish you good luck.

26
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,620
Day Day Fall

27
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,080
Hundreds of years have passed

28
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,780
I dreamt about it

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,920
Push the moon

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,480
I wrote my own songs

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,100
Enjoy my life

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,560
I offer a new future

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
When the fire burns, the fire will disappear.

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,560
But it's hard to get it all out.

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
It's hard to get it all out.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,560
You wrote all these?

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Every time I think about it, I'll write it down.

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Yuanyang, give me some time.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
I'll help you find the truth.

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I heard he told you everything.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
I think I've never seen this book.

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,560
I think I bought it when I was at the flower shop.

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Your Highness,

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,560
this is the daily routine I've prepared for Miss Yi Jiu.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
I've bought it.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
I've bought it.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I've bought it.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
I've bought it.

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I've bought it.

50
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
I've bought it.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,560
I think he'll help me find the memory.

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
It was indeed a bit heavy back then.

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
You asked me to investigate it for so long.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
I still can't find the useful clue.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I thought I'd find the memory

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
and find out the truth.

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
If I'm not the one who killed the bandit,

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
who will it be?

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
But if we can't find the useful clue,

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
the thing that you and Princess Yu are fighting is the enemy of the Mages.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You've kept it by your side.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm afraid it's...

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
No matter what the conspiracy behind it is,

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I must find out the truth

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
and explain it to Yuanyang and the bandit.

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
General Wushuang, what's this?

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Your Highness, why are you looking at the study room?

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I'll bring him some food.

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Put the things over there.

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Yuanyang.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Didn't you say you'd give me an explanation?

72
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
You can tell me.

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
I went to the bandit's place

74
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
and what happened.

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
What did you do?

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I received your letter

77
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
on the 8th of August,

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,560
saying that your father agreed to our wedding.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
You'll come to the bandit's place to marry me.

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Actually,

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
my father didn't agree to our wedding.

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,560
I think you've been bewitched by the bandit.

83
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I told you to investigate the bandit.

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,560
I didn't ask you to be honest.

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
But when I was injured,

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
the bandit's daughter saved my life with her letter.

87
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
What if you were saved?

88
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,560
They've been practicing martial arts for years.

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
They're trying to kill people.

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
No, father.

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
The bandit's heart is pure.

92
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
It's not like the rumor.

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Enough!

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
But three days later,

95
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
father suddenly ordered us to agree to our wedding.

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I was really worried about the bandit's family

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,560
and led the army to the bandit's place.

98
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
But I was so worried about my father.

99
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I couldn't remember what happened next.

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
But I saw it with my own eyes.

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
You were wearing the bandit's dress and swallowing my family.

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
If it wasn't for you,

103
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
who would I be?

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
This is the truth I want to know.

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
I've been looking for the real bandit's life these years.

106
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
But I have no reason to.

107
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Yun Yang,

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
do you want to trust me?

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I saw the pearl in the room

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
and the text.

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
I heard your memories of the broken flowers.

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I have the same memories.

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
I have the same feelings.

114
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Instead of believing you,

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I'd rather believe the truth.

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Don't worry.

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
The truth will come to light sooner or later.

118
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
If I really did something wrong,

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I'll let you do it.

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Yun Yang.

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Yun Yang.

122
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
This is from General Wushuang.

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
It's raining tonight.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
It's better to stay warm.

125
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
I see.

126
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Thank you.

127
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Yun Yang.

128
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
It's cold.

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Go to bed and sleep.

130
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Yun Yang.

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
The battle is over.

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Let the brothers wake up.

133
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Go find the way.

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes, General Wushuang.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Wushuang.

136
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Your Highness.

137
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
I haven't seen Xiao Zhe in a while.

138
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Where is he?

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Your Highness.

140
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I haven't seen him in a long time.

141
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
I heard you haven't eaten well recently.

142
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
What's wrong?

143
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
It's already so big.

144
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I need to feed you.

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Brother Huo.

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Why did you bring that woman who killed you?

147
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
She's a group of people.

148
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Many things are not as simple as you think.

149
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
She's your sister-in-law now.

150
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I'll do it.

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
It's my own reason.

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
What's your reason?

153
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
She has something to do with my memory.

154
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
I'll do it.

155
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
It's related to my memory.

156
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Brother Huang.

157
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Do you remember anything?

158
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Not yet.

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Since you can't let her go,

160
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll try to treat her as my sister-in-law.

161
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
But if she has any intentions,

162
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
I won't let her go.

163
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Okay, okay.

164
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I see.

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Remember to drink the porridge.

166
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
I'll drink it.

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I beg you.

168
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Please let me go.

169
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
I beg you.

170
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Please.

171
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
You'd better beg your good sister.

172
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
She's a good girl.

173
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,560
You can only take the medicine.

174
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Brother Huang.

175
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Sir.

176
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Sir.

177
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Sir.

178
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
It seems that I have to go to the drugstore.

179
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm sorry.
