1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't bend your eyes.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's right.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Miss Yun-Gun, you're awake.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll clean it up and leave.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll leave now.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll leave now.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you going?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I...

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My arm is broken.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please help me take a look.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why is it broken all of a sudden?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Sir,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
isn't this arm broken?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's not broken.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's broken.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not broken.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not broken.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Really?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It rained yesterday.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The roof keeps falling down.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have to find someone to repair it.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Or the rain will fall.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sir,

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you said

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll let you repair the sink last night.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're great.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll let you repair it.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Actually,

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want to say

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
this window.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I want to say this window.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's that side and that side.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's all blown up.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you know that the weather

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
keeps falling down?

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's easy to catch cold.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sir,

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the house without the wind is too expensive.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We can't afford it.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's too expensive.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Sir, are you hungry?

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I have to do something else.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I really don't have time to cook.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes, why?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well...

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Then

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll go cook.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you for your help.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sir,

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
did you say he saw it?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You deliberately took it from him.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is my acting that long?

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's because you're too slow.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Bro Hao,

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm here.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I said

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll come back

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
to you

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
as soon as possible.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll come back

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
to you as soon as possible.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I've got it.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've got it.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll come back

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
as soon as possible.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And you.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Protect the yellow one.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Your Highness,

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
you'd better eat something.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll go.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Your Highness.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Highness.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Your Highness.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your Highness.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Your Highness.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm standing here.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don't you go train?

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Didn't you hear what I said?

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Train!

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll train with you!

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Your Highness.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your Highness.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Bro Hao, you have to train with me.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't worry.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll protect you.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Miss Yunyao,

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
it's time to eat.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This ...

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Tap!

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,300
It's been quite a while since I last claimed

113
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,000
theburgic Lake Bay.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,900
My words

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,880
rausally

116
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,000
come from the North Shore.

117
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:27,000
I should be

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
con 결국.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,180
I don't want Chow's

120
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,500
2 Chicken.

121
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
4 Peppers?

122
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,140
18 NutDIts?

123
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,280
2 Chicken?

124
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,880
Give me a small slice

125
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,120
This piece is pricy

126
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,620
you can use that

127
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,160
1?

128
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,060
Keep it

129
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,580
All right

130
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,020
Look.

131
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,900
Did he calculate it?

132
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,940
Sir, look.

133
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,740
He's counting it when he's holding it.

134
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,460
Look.

135
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,060
Keep going.

136
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,900
Let's go.

137
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,660
Here.

138
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,980
My mother-in-law is not home recently.

139
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,180
She's not happy.

140
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,060
She's not in a good mood.

141
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,700
She's quite emotional.

142
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,420
Look, she's smiling.

143
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,340
She's smiling.

144
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
She's smiling.

145
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,380
She's smiling.

146
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,740
She's smiling.

147
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,060
She's a star in the sky.

148
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,980
She's not happy because of Xia Zai.

149
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,140
She's so thoughtful.

150
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,740
Keep going.

151
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,140
Yijie.

152
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,100
Are you there?

153
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,420
You.

154
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,540
and that night didn't go until next night.

155
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,220
We have to look for him again at bed time.

156
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,980
What's this drug?

157
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,340
It's me and his third time seeing each other.

158
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,220
I know it's not serious.

159
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,100
If he's that strong,

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,380
I won't let him go easily.

161
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm just a important guy.

162
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,140
You gave it to me on the temple?

163
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes.

164
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,700
This is...

165
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,780
This is my palm!

166
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,540
I...

167
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,740
Mister!

168
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,340
Don't run!

169
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,140
Your Highness, you've found the wrong person.

170
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,980
You didn't find the dagger

171
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,660
that was used to help His Highness.

172
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,860
I think someone took it away.

173
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,460
And that dead man, Zhen Bei Jun,

174
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,940
was the one who poisoned himself.

175
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,580
Xiao Zhe's death

176
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,060
is not that simple.

177
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,100
I mean,

178
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,300
I don't understand.

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,140
His blood can make me die.

180
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Why can't I save Xiao Zhe?

181
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,260
Your Highness,

182
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,540
do you suspect that

183
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,300
His Highness is not the Princess Consort?

184
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,900
Let's go.

185
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,340
Sorry for the interference in the long�

186
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,140
today.

187
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,940
Do I know

188
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,300
that you want me to be happy?

189
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:49,980
But right now,

190
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,300
I want to figure it out

191
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,900
first.

192
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,380
But what exactly

193
