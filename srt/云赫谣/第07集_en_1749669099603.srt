22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
into evil.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When it momento.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000

I'm sorry.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Be honest.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm telling you.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Your wound is deep.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you don't treat it in time,

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
it will be very sensitive.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know what?

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you are lucky to meet me.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You...

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can hold it yourself.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll cook for you.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Here comes the food.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's eat.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on, get up.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Get up and eat.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wake up.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't die.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't die.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What should I do?

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What should I do?

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Medicine.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm awake.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you doing?

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Today is the first year of the month.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you want to play together?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The first year?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not sure.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not sure.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not sure.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not sure.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not sure.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm not sure.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not sure.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not sure.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not sure.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wake up.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Follow me.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What do you think?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It looks good.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's the matter?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not good.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's not good.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's not good.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not good.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not good.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not good.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's not good.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's badly forced.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's not good.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The heat is cold enough.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's not good.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not good.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
People form a group to collaborate

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
in order

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000

87
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,800

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Sleepay and to die lose.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well?

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,580
I won't disappoint you.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The blood of the Holy Queen is the blood of the Holy Queen.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The Holy Queen is the blood of the Holy Queen.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You are really lucky.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If not, our Holy Queen would have saved you with her blood.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You would have been so lucky.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I am telling you,

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
our band has a century-old record.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If we save a group of people with her blood,

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it will be a secret.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't believe it.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on, drink.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Come on.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Here.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What is this?

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is the blood of the band.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's very big.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Try it.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What kind of wish did you make?

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I made it...

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to be with Yun Yao forever.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Just give it to me.

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When father agrees to our wedding,

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I will come back to welcome you.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I will come back to welcome you.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will come back to welcome you.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will wait for you.

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I will wait for you.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will wait for you.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Your Highness.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Your Highness, you are awake.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Brother, you are finally awake.

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where is Yun Yao?

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know.

124
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I only know that the person who is in the Tai Bu Shu is looking for her.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The one in the Tai Bu Ling again?

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Brother, do you still have the secret service

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to find that witch?

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
She is not a witch.

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
She is your sister-in-law.

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
General Wushuang.

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Your Highness, I have found the whereabouts of the queen.

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Brother, what are you doing?

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yun said you can't get out of bed.

134
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Brother, you are awake.

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brother, you are awake.

136
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Brother, you are awake.

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Brother, you are awake.
