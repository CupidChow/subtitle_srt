1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll try to get the third one.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Qian Man Xue...

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ming Yue....

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Goodbye...

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The silver lantern is full of flowers.

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
It's good. It's good.

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,800
Don't disturb me by writing the lantern.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
The lantern.

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,760
Tomorrow is the grandest day of my Wei Dynasty.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The lantern festival.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,200
Every year, brother Huang will take me there.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,840
So this is the lantern?

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,280
I've been in Tai Bu Shu for too long.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
I've never been to the lantern festival.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Then you're so stupid.

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
The lantern festival.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,800
The whole city will go out to see the lantern.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,200
The lanterns on the street are all different.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
It's useless to tell you.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
Anyway, I won't take you there.

25
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,540
Chart icon.

26
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,840
Your Highness, we can face the truth now.

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,460
Come on.

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,840
Father,

29
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,600
we all suffer for the values of death.

30
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,340
That's how you'll explain to your prisoner?

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,880
Father,

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,380
I especially deserve to be killed with my alcohol.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,060
But that first thing with me

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
I deserve to die.

35
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,300
But the officials he killed

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,740
are also the worst.

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,420
The worst!

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,620
You monster!

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,220
You killed so many officials in the court.

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,780
You want to punish them,

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,300
you have to punish me!

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,060
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,060
the medicine that you took that day

44
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,060
has been dead.

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
He'er!

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,060
I'm telling you.

47
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
These people

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
are just the most dangerous

49
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,060
and ungrateful

50
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
medicine for Wei.

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
The one you saved

52
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,060
is the same.

53
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
I want him dead.

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060
He has to die!

55
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Don't be angry, father.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,060
Two days.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Father gave me two days.

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,060
I'll give you

59
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
a reasonable answer.

60
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Two days?

61
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
I'll give you two days.

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
It seems that he killed him.

63
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,060
I still need another way.

64
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
Oulin,

65
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
His Highness is coming back.

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Is his soup ready?

67
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,060
It's coming soon.

68
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,060
It's coming soon.

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,060
Don't worry.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
Zhao He,

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,560
thank you for мешing me a lot.

72
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
Your Highness,

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
the remedy to your Using hand aks

74
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,220
is wrong,

75
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm deathly angry.

76
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Don't be angry.

77
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
That's very exciting!

78
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
My good,

79
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,060
Your Highness,

80
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,060
you've been criticized for

81
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,060
being most innocent.

82
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,980
Hurry up!

83
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,020
Come here!

84
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,500
There's a girl inside!

85
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Help!

86
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,780
There's water!

87
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Water!

88
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Someone's coming!

89
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,220
What's going on?

90
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,020
There's a girl!

Hurry up!

95
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Go get her!

96
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,340
Your Highness!

97
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,020
Your Highness!

98
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,020
Your Highness!

99
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,500
Your Highness!

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,300
You can't go in!

101
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,500
Your Highness!

102
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,580

Liko!

104
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,580
Liko!

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,140
The night is dark in my dreams

106
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,740
Liko!

107
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,600
The one who is weak is the one who is

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,660
The one who is drunk is the one who is drunk

109
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
The one who is drunk is the one who is drunk

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Your Highness, the one who is drunk is here

111
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Someone flew away, the sky is you

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,660
The clothes are in my dream

113
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,660
I have passed thousands of miles

114
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,660
I am chasing your trace

115
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
I have passed thousands of miles

116
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,660
I am looking for your memory

117
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
I have passed thousands of miles

118
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
I have passed thousands of miles

119
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I am chasing your trace

120
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,740
I want to spend the whole day with you

121
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
The sky is you

122
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Come over and help us

123
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Come on, this way

124
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
It's so good, mother

125
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,740
I'll go and warm you up

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,740
I can really believe you

127
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Who is it?

128
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,740
It's me, Miss Yijiu

129
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Miss Yijiu

130
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
This is a new dress for you

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Remember to change it tomorrow

132
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
What's the problem?

133
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
It's not that common

134
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
You can give it to your husband

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
You can care about it

136
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
It's so hard

137
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Your Highness, the people of the Wudeng Festival

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
have sent a secret patrol

139
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
You must protect the safety of the people

140
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Yes, I have

141
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Come on

142
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980

You are wearing a special dress today

146
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
I am not wearing it for you

147
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
You are a girl

148
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
You are wearing it for your family

149
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Let's go, brother

150
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,980
You don't have to go there

151
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Let's go

152
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Where are we going?

Hua Dengjie

154
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,980
I am not happy

155
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Let's go

156
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
You can take this dress

157
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Remember to wear it well

158
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980

Miss, is it Tang Huo?

165
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Tang Huo

166
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Tang Huo

167
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Little friend, are you okay?

168
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Thank you, brother

169
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Go

170
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Your Highness

171
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,980
He is really in trouble

172
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I want to see what he is talking about
