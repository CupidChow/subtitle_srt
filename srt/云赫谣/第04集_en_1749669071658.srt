1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
3. Everyone waited anyway

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,740
It's over

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Maybe this is for you.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Maybe this is for you.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,120
I wonder what you want to buy from me.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
Soul-catching antidote.

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't need to make money.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
And the antidote for Soul-catching is so precious.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,800
What do you use to exchange it?

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,560
My blood.

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,560
Good.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,320
Hello.

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,600
Is there anything interesting?

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,680
I don't know.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,440
Have you heard of the drug of Thailand

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,960
whichosexual appliances andLionna

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,880
have stringent blood account for period of one year?

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,080
Springummyllum!

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
You give the medicine to me.

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,560
I will give you a lips blood for period of one year.

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,080
I won't accept this pain.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
You should go back.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Go back?

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Isn't it you who gave me Prince Ning's hand in everything you've done?

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Prince Ning?

53
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
You killed so many people in the Celestial Palace.

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
He could protect you all his life,

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
and all your life.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
I don't need to tell him.

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I don't need to tell him anything.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
I don't need to tell him.

59
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
I don't need to tell him anything.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
I don't need to tell him anything.

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
You can't tell him.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
I don't need to protect him.

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Even if he dies,

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,680
I won't go back to the place where you were buried.

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Okay.

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Even if he dies today,

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
I will take him back.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
If you don't come back,

69
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
I will kill you.

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Prince Ning, you really came here to save me.

71
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
And you saved this beauty.

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
It's not easy to kill her.

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Leaving her in the manor

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
must be a disaster.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
You're right.

76
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
It's a disaster.

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I can't get rid of you

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
from the manor.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
You?

86
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Prince Ning really took her as his wife?

87
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
I remind you.

88
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
She was buried by His Majesty.

89
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
I'll kill you

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
if you keep it a secret.

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Get out!

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm safe.

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
The enemy is in the way.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
The Grand Tutor won't let me go.

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Since you know it,

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
you should keep it a secret.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't talk nonsense.

98
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Miss Yijiu, where did you go?

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Your Highness,

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
I've bought all the daily necessities

101
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
you asked me to prepare for Miss Yijiu.

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Aren't you going to see the lantern?

103
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Follow me.

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I'll help you.

105
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
The lantern is like a spell.

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
The moon is like a moon.

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
In our band,

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
the moon will be

109
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
the moon's moon.

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
What will you do?

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
The moon will be the lantern.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
The whole city is a lantern.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
The lanterns will be bright and bright.

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
The lanterns will be lighted up.

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
The moon will be the moon.

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Yunyao,

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
I want to take you to the moon.

118
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
I'll ask for you from my father.

120
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
We'll be together forever.

121
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Will you marry me?

122
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
You can't tell me that.

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
No.

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
The mountains and rivers are far away.

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
We'll be together forever.

126
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,680
We'll be together forever.

127
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Make a wish.

128
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
I have no feelings.

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
I'm not afraid.

130
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
I have no feelings.

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,680
I hope you won't be afraid.

132
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Your Highness told the Taipei Commandant

133
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
that I'm yours.

134
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
So,

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
can you live with me for a lifetime?

136
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
I was just kidding.

137
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm not afraid.

138
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Put the wedding dress on the window.

139
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Yes.

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
You,

141
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
bend your head.

142
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Move a little.

143
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
My hands will only be on the roof.

144
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
I can't do this.

145
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Hurry up.

146
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
What are you doing?

147
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Miss Yunyao.

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Your Highness,

149
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Yes.

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Your Majesty,

151
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
the two-day deadline is here.

152
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,680
We'll take the servants away with us.

153
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Come on, take them away.

154
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Yes.

155
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I'll kill you.

156
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
There's no need for you here.

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
From now on,

158
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
she is my Princess Consort.

159
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Tell me.

160
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
What's the deal?

161
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Go.

162
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
My Lady.

163
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Do you want to ask me

164
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
if I married you

165
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
just to protect you?

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Yes,

167
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
but not only that.

168
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Five years ago, I was injured.

169
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I lost my memory.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,680
I was the hero of the Five-Demon Clan.

171
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,680
But I had no idea about that memory.

172
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Until you saved me that day,

173
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,680
you and I were so similar.

174
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,680
So I think you and I have a memory.

175
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Five years later

176
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Maybe you should let me down.

177
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,680
I'm not the person you want to find in your painting.

178
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
So you're going to marry me?

179
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Yes.

180
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Maybe you should let me down.

181
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm not the person you want to find in your painting.

182
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,680
I'm not the person you want to find in your painting.

183
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
How can I live with you?

184
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Maybe I should let you down?

185
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Maybe you should let me down.

186
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm not the person you want to find in your painting.

187
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:48,680
