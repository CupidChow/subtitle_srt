1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're safe now.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll leave these to you.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You must send them to the band and meet Miss Yunya.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't worry. Aren't you going with us?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course I have something important to do.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
See you.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you, Young Master.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Woohoo!

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We're not going to say hi.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is it not good?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If we say hi, it'll be even worse.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've changed the map last night.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll take a look.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They're really good people.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll come back to see them when I get the chance.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I love you.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I love you.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes, I love you.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I love you too.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You and me.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We're two different worlds.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't talk about that.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I love you.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love you.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I love you.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I love you.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I love you.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is blood.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You can see it.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In our position,

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
we are together with the one we love.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The guest is white-haired.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I remember that one year,

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
David had a lot of blood.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I took my brother

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and secretly left the palace

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to run to the snow.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And hit the snow.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That day, we played Soul Land and Soul Stone.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
After we went back,

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we fought with Mother.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And we were punished.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
what's blood?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is it like sugar?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
When the border is over,

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll take you to the Great Wei.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I promise.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I promise.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't fight with him forever.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I promise.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hurry up.

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
He liked it Chopin in wetà¸§ome one the best,

69
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,040
at the driving of lightning and weak rien.

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,160
We often needed to return now.

71
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,160
Now the bandit was soCTaste.

72
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Zhou He, you created all of this.

73
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Yingyao!

74
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Renzhi!

75
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
You guys, we're back.

76
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
It's good that you're back.

77
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
It's good that you're back.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
He...

79
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
It's him!

80
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Yes, he killed our whole family.

81
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,160
The Holy Lady finally brought him back.

82
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Tomorrow,

83
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,160
I'll marry his heart and make the royal family pay.

84
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Re-establish the royal family!

85
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
The Holy Lady

86
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Tomorrow is the ceremony.

87
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Is there anything you want to tell me?

88
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
This painting has been with me for five years.

89
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Every time I think I'm like walking on a walking path,

90
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
it's him who's holding me.

91
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Now I'll give it back to you.

92
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Let me see.

93
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Here, let's have a drink.

94
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Yunyang, Jiu Li.

95
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Xia Lu Ran is dead.

96
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Why?

97
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm waiting for someone.

98
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Denshan.

99
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Your brother.

100
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm waiting for someone.

101
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm waiting for someone.

102
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm waiting for someone.

103
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Denshan.

104
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Your brother.

105
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm waiting for someone.

106
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Your brother.

107
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Zhao He.

108
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
It's been a long journey.

109
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I've been through a lot.

110
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
I already knew

111
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Zhao Zhe was too powerless.

112
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
He was the real brother of the bandit.

113
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
No.

114
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
It was me.

115
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
It was me.

116
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
It was me.

117
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
From that day on,

118
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
I knew

119
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
you were lying to me.

120
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
No.

121
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
His rear-end was

122
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
a green-and-white bandit.

123
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
It was me.

124
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I was the one who made you the bandit.

125
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
I told you

126
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
that I was your life.

127
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I want you to live to the fullest.

128
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
So you've been trying to get me.

129
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
It's all because of Pian Xiaozhen.

130
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
That's right.

131
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I've given you many opportunities,

132
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
but you never said it.

133
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Zhao He.

134
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
You have the people you want to protect.

135
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
And I

136
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
have my responsibility.

137
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm sorry.
