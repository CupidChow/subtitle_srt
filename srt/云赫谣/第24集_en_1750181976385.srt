1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll try to get the third one.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll try to get the third one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're so cute.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you for coming all the way here.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If it weren't for you, the father of the band wouldn't have come so soon.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I should leave after seeing how well you've been doing.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Where are you going?

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I...

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll be the best in the world.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The world is still so beautiful.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Fang Ziyin?

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, right.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to know...

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
if you'll make it to this holy temple.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Will you really make it?

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is the money we made.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can you guarantee that you'll make it?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll make it.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll try my best.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Did you feel it?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Maybe I'm not that sincere.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Forget it.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's go.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Be careful, Lu Cheng.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll be back.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll be back.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How is father?

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Highness, you're finally here.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
His Majesty is in a critical condition.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please go and have a look.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Father.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I brought back Xiaozhen.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He...

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How is he?

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm guilty.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't protect Xiaozhen.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I killed him.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Xiaozhen.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Xiaozhen is really a child.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
When Xiaozhen became the crown prince,

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
he told me that

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
he would pay any price for his father.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I only beg him to be a true northeastern general.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A future king.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Father.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I didn't want this.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This world is not for you and me.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's for the people.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been in the palace for over 20 years.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been on the roof of the palace.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I've been through a lot and saved the poor.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They've suffered a lot because of me.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I hope that I can live on my own.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Father has done many things.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But only one thing.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's all because of my greed.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've hurt this bandit.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've hurt your brothers.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He'er.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He'er, come.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I...

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I...

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have nothing to save.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I will entrust my life to you in the future.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know that?

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The sky and the sky are in the clouds.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The new earth is in the clouds.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The sky and the sky are in the clouds.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The sea and the sky are in the clouds.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The bandit is in the place of the Great Wei.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The Great Wei people want to know that

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the world is in good hands.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There is no mountain or river.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The world is in peace.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The new earth is in the clouds.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The new earth is in the clouds.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The world is in peace.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The world is in peace.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The world is in peace.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The world is in peace.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The world is in peace.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The world is in peace.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The world is in peace.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The world is in peace.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The world is in peace.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You dare to touch my people?

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The autumn wind blows a long lotus.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I wait for the flower to bloom.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The snow falls and the fire is long.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am no longer near.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The old me is not satisfied.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I am no longer near.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't live with you.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to be with you.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The mountains and the earth are in the clouds.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The world is in peace.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The night is in the dark.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The old me is not satisfied.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The atmosphere is still hot.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am no longer near.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am no longer in the dark.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The dream is too much.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You can't hold it in your hands.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You are no longer my clear- unintentional self.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I am no longer here.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why did you abandon me when I was alone?

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
E停天眼从或日无顺 太石一双人

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
'm your guardian like a dove at the sea.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,840
You still can't have it

117
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,040
And just sp bis anesthesia

118
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,960
And death

119
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,260
I'd like to have one

120
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,320
I don't think it's right,

121
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
since I am alone

122
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,340
It's made no difference

123
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,680
Living in a hopeless dream

124
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,260
There are only death

125
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,600
realmente

126
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,540
There is no escape

127
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
it can't be

128
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,380
But how the world

129
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,800
Take my hand

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,460
Come in!

131
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,280
Xiaozhe

132
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,660
Let me tell you something good.

133
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,620
The five regents allow you to stay alone,

134
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,860
except for General Zhenbei.

135
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,020
They also

136
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,840
see Kolkyo become a줘 as much as he makes.

137
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,560
Your Majesty.

138
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,720
Why did you put the little prince here?

139
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
This is where we lived together since we were little.

140
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,280
By the way, how is Xiao Wan?

141
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,720
Don't mention it.

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,880
She's been with men all day.

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
She doesn't look like a girl.

144
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,160
She looks like you.

145
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,200
Let's go.

146
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,800
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

147
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
Go down the road.

148
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,440
You lost.

149
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,840
How could you haveczasue

150
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,160
extent without the vat?

151
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,760
Why did I lose again?

152
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,720
Young Master, the Moon Sect is having a se顾 today.

153
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
Shall we經 the cent goshes together?

154
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,120
We'll talk about that.

155
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm not interested.

156
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,680
Oh, why not talk about the Moon Sect?

157
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Just tell me,

158
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,000
have you ever promo the Moon Percentage?

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,040
How about you?

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,760
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
What wish did you make?

162
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I made it

163
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,600
to be with Yunyao forever.

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Forget it.

165
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,720
Forget it.

166
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,200
Let's do it again.

167
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,600
I will win this round.

168
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
If you have anything to ask,

169
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
I won't help you.

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
My request is

171
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,280
to lose.

172
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,680
Mom.

173
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,160
You are so naughty.

174
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
What are you doing?

175
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,240
There are many handsome men coming to kiss you.

176
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
Go and have a look.

177
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
I have enough for you.

178
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,040
Mom,

179
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,320
I don't have a kid.

180
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,240
I want to find a handsome man.

181
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
You are so naughty.

182
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
What are you talking about?

183
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
I will go by myself.

184
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,960
Mom,

185
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
I will lock you up.

186
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,320
Come on.

187
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,920
Be careful.

188
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
I know.

189
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,160
You are so naughty.

190
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,020
You are so naughty.

191
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,760
You cannot take care of the girl.

192
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,680
I didn't do it.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well.

194
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,560
Don't put my children in danger.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,920
Ladies,

196
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,040
just two days at home.

197
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
You can wash my face under water.

198
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,140
No.

199
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,400
Why not?

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,700
I already have girls in glad Hope city.

201
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,320
So you possibly refuse?

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm not sure.

203
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm telling you, my mom is beautiful.

204
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
How beautiful?

205
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
She's beautiful.

206
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
You'll know when you go there.

207
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Mom,

208
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
how do you think of the dad I found?

209
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Are you satisfied?

210
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Yun He.

211
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm not sure.

212
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
I'm not sure.
