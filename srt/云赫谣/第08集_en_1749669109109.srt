1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll try to get the third one, but I'll try to get the third one.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll try to get the third one.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Will there be any news about him?

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll try to get the third one.

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The second wife is the most suspicious.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
She found the clue of the thief in the room.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So crazy.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What are you doing?

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm helping you to get the news.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Granny, do you know that you're not going to give a word to the haunted building?

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you know the clues, you'll...

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll...

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can do whatever you want.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sir, I have a guest.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The news you want is here.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're not dead.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're the guilty one, the Fourth Princess.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're blaming me for the fact that you're the one who found the thief?

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If I didn't give you the news, would you know that he's here?

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Would you know that he's here?

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come with me.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why should I come with you?

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Princess, the whole city is in danger.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You might be in danger at any time.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Only the Prince can protect you.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You want to kill me, right?

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're the only one who can take me.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Damn it.

30
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,380
THE AVENGER

31
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,740
Bi Qiu!

32
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,500
Bi Qiu!

33
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,740
Brother, wait!

34
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,860
Hello!

35
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,180
Follow me!

36
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,900
Theена!

37
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,300
Brothers!

38
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,280
By the edge of the sea,

39
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm waiting for you

40
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Yixing

41
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm here to be a good girl

42
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Yixing

43
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm here to be with you

44
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I'm here to leave you a memory

45
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
I'm here to take you back to the past

46
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm waiting for you

47
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm waiting for you

48
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Yixing

49
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

50
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm here to be with you

51
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm not going to wait for you

52
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,280
I'm here to be with you

53
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Yixing

54
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

55
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

56
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Yixing

57
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Yixing

58
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Yixing

60
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Yanyang

61
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

62
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

63
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm here to be with you

64
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm not going to wait for you

65
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Yanyang

66
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

67
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm here to give you a deep love

68
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Yanyang

69
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Are you hurt?

70
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
What did you just call me?

71
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Yanyang

72
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Yanyang

73
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Do you remember everything?

74
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
I remember the life of the band five years ago

75
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
You told me your name was Yanyang

76
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,280
You left me without any responsibility

77
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
And you saved me

78
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
You took me to the band's fortune

79
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
But you joined the band four years ago

80
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,280
And you took many career under the band's control

81
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
I promised you

82
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I would marry you back

83
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Enough

84
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
I don't want to hear you say this

85
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Why did you want to leave me?

86
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I also want to know why

87
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I used to be so heartless

88
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Yuesuren took me to the family

89
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
How could I go to the band...

90
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
You are still lying to me

91
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Yuesuang

92
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Yiju Mountain

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
So it's not a long time

94
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
But before the war

95
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,280
All the men, children and elders were killed

96
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
The band's women

97
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Were caught and killed

98
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
They were the worst slaves

99
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
They were killed every day

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Five years later

101
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I was in the city every day

102
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
I was in charge

103
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
It was me

104
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
It was me who brought you to the band

105
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
It was all because of me

106
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
It was me who made the band to be so hard

107
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
I just couldn't stop

108
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Why do you lie to me?

109
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Why?

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Why do you lie to me?

111
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Why?

112
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Why do you lie to me?

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Why?

114
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Why?

115
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
You tell me

116
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Yanyang

117
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Yanyang

118
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Tell me why?

119
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
I am sorry

120
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Yanyang

121
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Sorry

122
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
You ask me why

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I'm sorry, Yuezuo.

126
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
I believe I didn't do it.

127
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,280
But why did I do it, Tongmei?

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,560
I really can't believe it.

129
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,680
You said you can't believe it.

130
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,200
Your Highness, Your Highness.

131
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,760
I finally found you.

132
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
I'll take you to see something.

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Your Highness.

134
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Don't follow me.

135
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,320
Cindy Longwell,

136
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,960
please don't follow me.

137
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,520
I have followed선 these few years.

138
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,720
from the Yue Clan.

139
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,160
After these things,

140
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,760
we are змuted in a negative nature.

141
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,600
The estimate of the Mu Qins

142
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
deviats from the choice of the Yueなく剖剤陰性

143
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,280
Yun Yang

144
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,160
I suspect there's a trigger in this.

145
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm not afraid of you.

146
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm not afraid of you.

147
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm not afraid of you.

148
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm not afraid of you.

149
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm not afraid of you.

150
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm not afraid of you.

151
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
I'm not afraid of you.

152
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm not afraid of you.

153
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm not afraid of you.

154
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
I'm not afraid of you.

155
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm not afraid of you.

156
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
I'm not afraid of you.

157
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm not afraid of you.

158
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm not afraid of you.

159
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,520
May the moon and moon

160
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Always leave me alone

162
