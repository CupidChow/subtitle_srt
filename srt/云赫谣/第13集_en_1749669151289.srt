1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,700
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,360
Wait coming soon

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,260
So, who's next?

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,260
Step 2

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,340
Who wants to play hide-and-seek with you?

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,340
Kill Zhao Zhe.

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,340
That's not right.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,340
Then why would they kill King Qi?

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,340
And pretend to be the army?

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,340
Think about it carefully.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,340
The warning of the accident is not fatal.

17
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,340
Or is it poison?

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,340
Why are you looking at me?

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,340
I'm not a superpower.

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,340
There's only one way to find the truth.

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,340
Let's go.

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Where are you going?

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Let's go.

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,340
My lord.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
My lord.

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,340
We've found out the secret of the secret.

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,340
They are doing something.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,340
The arrow slave is really a superpower.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,340
You know what to do next.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
Yes.

31
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
What are you doing?

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
You're trying to get into King's Mansion?

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,340
There are so many people there.

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
I can't beat them.

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Brother Shiwei, thank you for your hard work.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Here, try some food.

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,340
Here.

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,340
What are you laughing at?

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,340
I'm the master of the Kui Xing House.

40
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,340
You're making me crazy.

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,340
Then you try the bed.

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,340
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
I'm the master of the Kui Xing House.

44
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
You're making me crazy.

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
Then you try the bed.

46
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Then you try the bed.

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,340
I'm the master.

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
I...

49
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
How can I be the master?

50
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
This way.

51
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
This way.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
No way.

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,340
You really plan to be the master of the Kui Xing House?

54
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
I'm going to be buried tomorrow.

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
It's the best time now.

56
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
No, I've been buried for the rest of my life.

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,340
I'm going to be the master of the Kui Xing House.

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
All right.

59
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Come on.

60
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Your Highness, don't be so rude.

61
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
I'm not a ghost.

62
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
You're just pretending to be a ghost.

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
What do you mean?

64
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Go after him.

65
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
It's all right.

66
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,340
I can't see him anymore.

67
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Xiao Chen.

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
Where's Xiao Chen?

69
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Xiao Chen.

70
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Look.

71
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
You misunderstood Miss Yun Yao.

72
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
It's not the time to say this.

73
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
The most important thing is to find Xiao Zhe's body.

74
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Are you all right?

75
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
I won't bother you, Your Highness.

76
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,340
You're worried.

77
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
Let's go.

78
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,340
We don't have to be so impulsive this time.

79
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
Stop talking nonsense.

80
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
I'm doing you a big favor.

81
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,340
You need to make me a big meal.

82
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
What's the matter with him?

83
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,340
What's wrong with him?

84
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
What's wrong with him?

85
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340
What's wrong with him?

86
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
What's wrong with him?

87
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
Get out of here!

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Your Highness.

89
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,340
What's wrong with him?

90
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Your Highness.

91
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Where's he?

92
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
Our minister is not here.

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Tell me.

94
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,340
He's really not here.

95
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Why are you so angry?

96
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
Where's my brother's body?

97
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Your Highness, you didn't go to the doctor to check on that killer.

98
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,340
But you came to me to find trouble.

99
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
I think you're looking for death.

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,340
You've been in this area for so long.

101
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
I'll help you take it off.

102
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
Go.

103
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,340
My brother asked you to find a bodyguard.

104
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,340
When the enemy is following you,

105
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
you can pretend to be safe first.

106
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
Then use your head to push him away.

107
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
If someone dares to bully you,

108
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
remember,

109
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
that's how you treat them.

110
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
I'll help you.

111
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
Don't move.

112
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,340
If the wound is infected,

113
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
your hand will be cut off.

114
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Such a big wound,

115
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
you can't help but to get it over with.

116
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,340
Have a joke.

117
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
By the way, I have something to tell you.

118
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
There are soldiers of the north of the country

119
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
in the capital.

120
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Who can steal his body?

121
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Maybe he's not dead.

122
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Smart.

123
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,340
So the eyes are not necessarily real.

124
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
That's how the king of Qi died.

125
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,340
I'm afraid that's the same for you.

126
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,340
I was born in the south of the country.

127
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
If I didn't rely on

128
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
the hatred of Zhao He

129
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
and the obsession of finding the truth,

130
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
I would have survived

131
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
the cruel and lonely place

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
in Tai Bu Shu.

133
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
If not,

134
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
I would have died in the place

135
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
where the dark day was.

136
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Someone is coming.

137
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
I'm looking for you.

138
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Are you okay?

139
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Xiao Zheng.

140
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
I found out

141
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
about Xiao Zheng's death.

142
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Tomorrow,

143
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,340
I will give you an answer.

144
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
I don't need your answer.

145
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
I'm doing this

146
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,340
just to give myself a clear answer.

147
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
General Wushuang.

149
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Princess.

150
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
His Highness hasn't come back

151
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
since last night.

152
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
He can't find her.

153
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
Is he here to find you?

154
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Last night,

155
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
he did come to me.

156
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
He said

157
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
he has something to do

158
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
with Xiao Zhe.

159
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
He has a new clue.

160
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
He's not here.

161
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
He's not here.

162
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
He's not here.

163
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
He's not here.

164
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
He's not here.

165
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
He has something new

166
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
about Xiao Zhe.

167
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
General Wushuang.

168
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
Is there anything

169
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
important

170
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
about this?

171
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
The last time

172
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
the dead man was fake.

173
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Someone deliberately made it.

174
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
I've found the real dead man.

175
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
He gave me

176
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
an important clue.

177
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Prince Yin.

178
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
It's been a long day.

179
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
What did you find?

180
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Who are you?

181
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,340
Prince Yin.

182
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Prince Yin.

183
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Prince Yin.

184
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Prince Yin.

185
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Prince Yin.

186
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Prince Yin.
