1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm just going to put my finger in the throat,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and stick it in between the ears.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If I do it, your neck is going to be fine.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,320
From this person , she is the deliverer .

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,040
The deliverer is Rakrets .

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,480
The deliverer is Namamaga

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,480
I'm gonna do the same one more time.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,100
Don't worry.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
I'll find him.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,940
Yuan Ya.

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,520
Look over there.

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
What should we do now?

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
He's approaching me.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Zhao He...

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Zhao He, open the door!

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,380
Zhao He...

28
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Zhao Ge!

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,660
The US army is protecting the people.

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,380
I really can't help you.

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,780
Zhao Ge!

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,300
Zhao Ge, open the door!

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
Zhao Ge!

35
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,460
Zhao Ge!

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Yun Chang,

37
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
who are you?

38
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,940
If you dare to say anything,

39
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,380
I'll let you go ten times more.

40
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Don't let him in.

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
It's me.

42
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,780
It's me who brought you to Yuezu.

43
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,180
It's all because of me.

44
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,740
It's me who caused Yuezu to be born like this.

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,900
Why did you lie to me?

46
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,180
Why?

47
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,500
Why did you lie to me?

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,380
Why?

49
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,500
It's me who brought you to Yuezu.

50
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,700
Yun Yao,

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,420
I'm here to protect you.

52
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,420
Zhao Ge!

53
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,860
Zhao Ge, hurry up!

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Zhao Ge!

55
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,060
Zhao Ge, don't worry about me.

56
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,580
Hurry up!

57
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
Zhao Ge!

58
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,580
Hurry up!

59
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Zhao Ge!

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,260
Zhao Ge,

61
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
hurry up!

62
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Zhao Ge!

63
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,620
Zhao Ge, I'm leaving!

64
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Zhao Ge!

65
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Zhao Ge!

66
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,180
Zhao Ge!

67
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Zhao Ge!

68
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
Zhao Ge!

69
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Your Highness!

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,580
Zhao Ge!

71
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
Zhao Ge,

72
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
your Zhenbei is here!

73
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
Zhao Ge!

74
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,580
Zhao Ge!

75
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Zhao Ge!

76
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,580
Zhao Ge!

77
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
Zhao Ge!

78
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Zhao Ge!

79
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
Your Highness,

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
the villagers have been controlled.

81
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Have you not woken up yet?

82
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,580
The poison has been absorbed.

83
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Even if I wake up,

84
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,580
the palace might not be able to recover.

85
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
General Wushuang,

86
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
have you found those herbs?

87
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
I've already ordered them.

88
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
Okay.

89
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,580
It's okay.

90
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Hold it.

91
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Hold it.

92
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
Your herbs are not right.

93
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
You have to do it like this.

94
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Keep going.

95
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Okay.

96
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,580
Your Highness,

97
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,580
His Highness is unable to control it.

98
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,580
He can't even take the medicine.

99
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
Are you okay?

100
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm fine.

101
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
But His Highness...

102
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
You go back and rest.

103
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
Yes.

104
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Zhao Ge!

105
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Zhao Ge!

106
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
Don't do this!

107
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Zhao...

108
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,580
Zhao Ge!

109
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Zhao Ge!

110
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
Zhao Ge!

111
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
Zhao Ge!

112
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Go!

113
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Go!

114
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Go!

115
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Zhao Ge!

116
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
Zhao Ge!

117
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Don't do this!

118
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
Zhao Ge!

119
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Don't do this!

120
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
Zhao Ge!

121
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Don't do this!

122
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
Go!

123
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Go!

124
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Go!

125
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,580
The time is still young,

126
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
and the night is short.

127
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
The mountains and seas are full of the lost,

128
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,580
whose dreams are they?

129
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,580
The rain is falling.

130
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
The sky is full of the lost,

131
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
whose dreams are they?

132
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
The rain is falling.

133
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
The sky is full of the lost,

134
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
whose dreams are they?

135
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
The rain is falling.

136
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
The sky is full of the lost,

137
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,580
whose dreams are they?

138
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
The rain is falling.

139
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,580
The sky is full of the lost,

140
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
whose dreams are they?

141
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,580
The rain is falling.

142
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
The sky is full of the lost,

143
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
whose dreams are they?

144
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
The rain is falling.

145
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
The sky is full of the lost,

146
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,580
whose dreams are they?

147
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
The rain is falling.

148
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
The sky is full of the lost,

149
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,420
whose dreams are they?

150
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,580
The sky is full of the lost,

151
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,580
whose dreams are they?

152
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
The rain is falling.

153
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
The sky is full of the lost,

154
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
whose dreams are they?

155
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
The rain is falling.

156
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
The sky is full of the lost,

157
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
whose dreams are they?

158
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,580
The rain is falling.

159
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

160
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm sure I can make it.

161
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
I'm sure I can make it.

162
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
I'm sure I can make it.

I'm sure I can make it.

165
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm sure I can make it.

166
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
I'm sure I can make it.

167
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm sure I can make it.

168
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
I'm sure I can make it.

169
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm sure I can make it.

170
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
I'm sure I can make it.

171
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
I'm sure I can make it.

172
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
I'm sure I can make it.
