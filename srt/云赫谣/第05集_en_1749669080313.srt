1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Open your eyes.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a little bit difficult for you to see.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Open your eyes.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Open your eyes.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Open your eyes.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Open your eyes.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why are you here?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,760
It's the Nian Wang to the Tai Bu Shu to get your life and death weapon.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,260
He also saved me.

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,260
Yes.

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,140
Nian Wang, this is the life and death weapon of Miss Yi Jiu you want.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,140
The Tai Bu Shu is ready.

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,740
What's wrong with you two?

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,240
Yi Jiu...

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Is Yi Jiu still alive?

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
You know Yi Jiu?

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Miss Yi Jiu.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We are going to the army to get the female army.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will take her with me.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yun Yao, what happened recently?

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why did you get married with Nian Wang?

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Did he force you?

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yun Zhi, I waited for five years to kill him personally.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I met him again from the Tai Bu Shu that day.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But now, it's the best time.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is...

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the antidote for the Soul-Catching Plant.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As long as you take it down, you can restore your vitality.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's no use to be long-winded.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yun Yao, are you okay?

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Zheng He, you are the one who saved me tonight.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sorry, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
His Majesty asked me to tell you.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you don't take back the antidote,

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the Yangji will not know your hard work.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I will kill you as soon as I see you.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yukoилиi, the three squalid most merciless amateurires Helen facilitator

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Reshatt!

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,000
As the almightyубли din,

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
competetive

54
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,580
Let our Prize of never end

55
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,780
honor up our foundation

56
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,740
and start our millennium

57
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,080
I can accomplish the task for the nation today.

58
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,140
Who is me?

59
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,700
An alliance.

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Zhao He,

61
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,660
as a beauty of the world,

62
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
learns to break the law every day,

63
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,220
and serve his people.

64
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,260
It is worth Copוס' life.

65
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
I will never let you go

66
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
I will never let you go

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
I will never let you go

68
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
I will never let you go

69
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
I will never let you go

70
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
I will never let you go

71
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
I will never let you go

72
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
I will never let you go

73
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I have walked thousands of miles

74
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I have walked thousands of miles

75
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740

I have walked thousands of miles

82
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
I have walked thousands of miles

83
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
I have walked thousands of miles

84
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I have walked thousands of miles

85
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
I have walked thousands of miles

86
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
I have walked thousands of miles

87
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
I have walked thousands of miles

88
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740

I have walked thousands of miles

98
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
I have walked hundreds of miles

99
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740

I have walked thousands of miles

102
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
You...

103
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Why?

104
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Zheng He,

105
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,740
do you know that I've been waiting for you for five years?

106
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
What are you talking about?

107
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Aren't you looking for memories?

108
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
Fine,

109
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
then I'll tell you.

110
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,740
I am the Moon Clan.

111
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,740
Only for five years,

112
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,740
I'll be there for you every day.

113
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
I'll be there for you.

114
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
For five years,

115
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,740
I've been waiting for this day to come.

116
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,740
I swear I'll kill you

117
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,740
for the revenge of the Moon Clan.

118
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Huang Xiong!

119
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Your Highness!

120
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Huang Xiong!

121
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
Your Highness!

122
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Your Highness!

123
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Let go of me!

124
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
How is it, Huang Xiong?

125
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Huang Xiong.

126
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Huang Xiong.

127
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Zhao He,

128
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
I've been a disciple of the Moon Clan.

129
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
I've been a disciple of the forest.

130
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,740
All the girls are cursed by the demons.

131
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
They are not as good as they were born.

132
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,740
This is all because of you!

133
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
I want you to be a hell!

134
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
I want you to be a hell!

135
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Let go of me!

136
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
Let go of me!

137
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Don't you dare to hurt me!

138
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Let go of me!

139
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Don't you dare to hurt me!

140
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Don't you dare to hurt me!

141
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
You must be a hell!

142
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Let go of me.

143
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
One more time.

144
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Let go of me!

145
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Let go of me!

146
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Your Highness!

147
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Your Highness!

148
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Your Highness!

149
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Your Highness!

150
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Your Highness!

151
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
Your Highness!
