00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Brother.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Brother.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you okay?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You bastard.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let go of me, brother.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm the one you're going to kill.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xiao Zheng.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is all my plan.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're a dangerous woman.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother, look.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't listen to my advice.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't want to protect this woman.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
She's hiding here with us brothers.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I should have killed you.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Shut up.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yun Ya, she's still young.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiao Zheng doesn't understand.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Brother, you don't have to beg her.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stop talking.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yun Ya, Xiao Zheng still doesn't understand.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll kill her.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll kill her.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I beg you to let her go.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I beg you to let her go.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yun Ya.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yun Ya.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't be so angry in front of me.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Kneel next to Sheng Zhi and take good care of the Yue Clan.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Guards.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Take her away.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yun Ya.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yun Ya.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Brother.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How is she?

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
She's already been put up by me.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's good.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She'll be fine after she wakes up.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, right.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How are those women who were controlled?

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They're still in the coma.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But don't worry.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They'll wake up tomorrow.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you for helping me to save them.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you for your help.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But I think Yun Zhi is in trouble.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Zhao Zhi.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're here.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Are you okay?

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Get out of here.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm going to kill the Sword Dragon.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is a thousand years of luck.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can't open it.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But don't worry.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll find a way to save you tomorrow.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yun Zhi.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why did you do so many things for me?

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Get out of here.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who allowed you to touch my rabbit?

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Get out of here.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm the first time I've seen you in a different way.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hurry up.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hurry up.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you doing?

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You bitch still wants to get rid of me?

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let go of me.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let go of me.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm afraid you'll be moved by my actions.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Since then,

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
in the Taibushu of An Wu Tianzhi,

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
I've been almost hopelessly

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
being swallowed by the darkness.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm telling myself,

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can do anything for you.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
My lord, we're here.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Are you willing to become my dead body?
