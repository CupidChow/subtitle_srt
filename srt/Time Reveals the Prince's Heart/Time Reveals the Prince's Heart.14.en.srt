1
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,880
Sir, he has no choice

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,160
but to choose me.

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,440
I've swallowed my pride

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,770
and endured hardships.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,000
I've waited for so long.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,730
I've been waiting for this day.

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,760
So you've been scheming all along

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,680
just for your own ambition.

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,680
You kept saying it was all for me,

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
but those were all lies.

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
Who says it's not true?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Don't forget,

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
what you had with Liu Silin was just a fling,

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,260
but you and I grew up together.

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,280
I order you

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,680
to leave him immediately.

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,200
We'll be

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
taking our leave now.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,720
Thank you.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,039
Please.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,400
Caiyue.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,360
Where is the young mistress?

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
She was just here.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,200
Where did she go?

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,240
What about me?

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,759
What am I to you?

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,039
You tell me to leave and I leave.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
You tell me to stay and I stay.

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,039
Am I just a pawn to you?

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,520
Or a puppet you can summon and dismiss at will?

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Don't forget.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,039
He was the one who took me away from you.

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,660
Now I want to take you back.

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
I want to take you back.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,570
I order you to leave him.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,500
Did you hear me?

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,960
Let go of me.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,280
Silin.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Let me go.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,160
Silin.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Are you okay?

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,020
What are you doing?

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,720
Liu Silin.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,880
Don't think you can compete with me just because you dug up some old recipes.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,960
Just you wait.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,960
I don't believe that shabby restaurant of yours can stay in business.

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,200
We'll see about that.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Liu Silin.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,620
I really underestimated you.

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,600
I should have known your madness was all an act.

51
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,880
Pretending for all these years.

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
It must have been hard on you.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,240
You can only blame your own poor judgment.

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,640
Let me warn you too.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,880
If you dare touch Yiyu again,

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
that head on your shoulders,

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,520
I'll take it off myself.

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Let's go.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
I'll take you somewhere.

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Where?

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,160
This is your mother's memorial tablet.

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,399
On my 18th birthday,

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,260
my mother committed suicide.

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,480
It's snowing.

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,480
On my 18th birthday,

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,810
it was a snowy night just like this.

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,200
Today is my son Silin's birthday.

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,760
Thank you all for coming.

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Have a drink.

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Thank you.

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Come.

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Mother.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,090
Good. Please be seated, everyone.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,200
Sir, the item you requested.

75
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,360
Silin,

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,680
this is from your mother and me,

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,320
a birthday gift for you.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Thank you, Father.

79
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,010
You should thank your mother for raising you.

80
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,140
Thank you, Mother.

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,960
Father.

82
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Do you like it?

83
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,080
I do.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Good.

85
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Mother.

86
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Mother.

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,400
Mother.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Mother.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Mother.

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm convinced my mother's death wasn't so simple.

91
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,420
She and my father were deeply in love.

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,860
And it was my birthday.

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,170
Why would she take her own life?

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,159
Mother.

95
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,080
Mother.

96
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Please wake up.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,040
Yaqin.

98
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,080
Yaqin.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,520
Yaqin.

100
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Why?

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
That wasn't something my parents brought.

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Well.

103
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Madam Liu

104
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
she and someone else.

105
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,090
I never thought my mother would betray my father.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
I was completely distraught at that time.

107
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,720
So was it from then on

108
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
that your temperament became violent?

109
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,200
So those servants were really killed by you?

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I have never harmed anyone.

111
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,159
After that day,

112
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,280
servants began having accidents in my courtyard for no reason.

113
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
People started spreading rumors

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,740
that I was born to kill.

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,920
and capable of any evil.

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,180
This is already the third one this month.

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,520
Ever since our young master went mad,

118
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
he's been torturing servants to death.

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,159
Let's try to avoid him from now on.

120
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,880
Yes.

121
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,220
I couldn't defend myself.

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,840
Gradually,

123
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,080
my father started believing these rumors too.

124
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,140
He grew more and more distant from me.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
No matter how I tried to explain,

126
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,200
it was all in vain.

127
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,320
I lost my mother

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,730
and then lost my father's protection.

129
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,610
I gradually became bullied in my own home.

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
Then why did you pretend to be mad?

131
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Because of a big fire in my room three years ago.

132
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,120
I could tell someone deliberately set the fire to kill me.

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
I escaped by luck.

134
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
Having survived this disaster,

135
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
I took the opportunity to pretend to be insane.

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,720
To deceive my enemies

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,930
and protect myself.

138
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,640
Do you believe me?

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,880
But once,

140
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,280
I saw you kill a servant with my own eyes.

141
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,780
That person was trying to kill me.

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
I discovered his plan.

143
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
To protect myself,

144
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,850
I accidentally killed him.

145
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,200
So that's what happened.

146
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,520
I misunderstood you before.

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,680
But don't you care what others think of you?

148
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,360
I don't care.

149
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,480
Since they want me to be a murderous monster,

150
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
a madman,

151
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll play along with their game until the end.

152
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,840
And now I have you.

153
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
As long as you believe in me

154
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,660
and understand me,

155
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,970
I'm not afraid of anything.

156
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Silin.

157
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,080
Yiyu.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Your father was also at Fulu Restaurant

159
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,320
when the incident happened to my mother on the same day.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,650
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

161
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Yes.

162
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,440
Young master, young mistress.

163
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,570
It's time to wash up.

164
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,140
It's all right.

165
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,900
Let her sleep a little longer.

166
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,000
