1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,480
Hmm.

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,840
Young master.

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,240
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Oh, I'll let you talk.

6
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,690
You don't need to leave.

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,680
Stay here.

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,760
Just say what you need to say.

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,520
We're not strangers here.

10
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to take over the Fulu Restaurant.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,680
What did you say?

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,009
The Fulu Restaurant has barely been getting by all these years.

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,570
I wonder why the young master suddenly...

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,960
Silin.

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,920
So you want to start working?

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm very pleased.

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,280
This restaurant was our Liu family's first pot of gold.

18
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,759
If it weren't for us old folks being sentimental,

19
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,040
it would have closed down long ago.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
Silin,

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,919
our Liu family has so many businesses.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,000
Pawnshops,

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,400
docks,

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
banks.

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,960
Why do you insist on taking over the restaurant?

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,960
Sinan is managing the other family businesses.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,930
I just want something to do.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,160
I don't want to sit idle at home all day.

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,280
Besides, you and mother started this restaurant yourselves.

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,450
I want to make it successful again.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,480
Fine.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,760
But your mood has been so unpredictable lately.

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
I hope you won't cause any trouble at the restaurant.

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
Father, if you're worried,

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,440
you can send someone to keep an eye on me.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Who?

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
Qian Yiyu.

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
All right.

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,560
I will do as you wish.

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Liu Silin must have locked the door.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,040
Caiyue, Caiyue.

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,240
Caiyue.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Madam, what can I do for you?

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Let me out quickly.

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
But the young master said

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
without his permission,

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,050
you're not allowed to go anywhere.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,960
Um, I'm hungry.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,600
I haven't had breakfast yet.

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,810
I'll prepare it for you right away.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,760
Madam.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Madam.

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,840
Madam.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Madam.

55
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Madam.

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Madam.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,040
I was blind not to recognize your importance.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,880
I didn't know it was you, Madam, gracing us with your presence.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,200
Please forgive me, Madam.

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,760
I hope you can overlook my offense.

61
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,240
Get up. Get up quickly.

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,240
Wasn't the young master insane?

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Why did he suddenly come to the restaurant?

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,760
Who knows.

65
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,240
The young master went straight to the kitchen this morning.

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,040
No idea what he's doing in there.

67
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,120
Um, can I go check the kitchen now?

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,960
Yes, go ahead.

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,840
What are you doing?

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
Cooking. Can't you tell?

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,400
I was planning to call you when it was ready.

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,680
That useless girl Caiyue.

73
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,880
She can't even keep an eye on one person.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,960
Try it first.

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Try it.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,880
What is this?

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,280
Is this even edible?

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,680
On my 18th birthday,

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I first tasted sweet and sour ribs at Fulu Restaurant.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
It was the most delicious dish I'd ever had,

81
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,440
so I wanted to learn how to make it.

82
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,400
Of course.

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
My father made that.

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
Now I've added some Western cooking techniques.

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
So why did you come to the restaurant today?

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
What's wrong with me liking to cook?

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,960
Well,

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
the young master can cook?

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,760
Is the young master really crazy or not?

90
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,720
I asked my father to let me manage this restaurant.

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,400
I specifically asked you to assist me

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,160
so you can freely come and go in the restaurant.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,090
No one will dare bully you anymore.

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,040
Who asked for your help?

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,000
I came here because I have important business to attend to.

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,560
I know you want to investigate what happened to your parents.

97
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,400
I'll help you.

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
Don't flatter yourself.

99
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,460
I came here to revive the restaurant.

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
So I need to study

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Master Jiang Huai's signature dishes from back then.

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,720
What's that?

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
It smells so good.

104
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
It's about time.

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,159
Honey mung bean cake.

106
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,340
I used to love the pastries your father made.

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,000
So I tried to make them based on what I remembered.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,730
I don't know if they taste good.

109
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,240
Hot!

110
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,840
This one

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,060
tastes better when it's cooled down.

112
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,720
Hot!

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,680
Yiyu.

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,160
This way the mung bean cake will be nice and cool, sweet but not greasy.

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,159
It's the best.

116
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
Try it.

117
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Is it good?

118
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
It's just a bit too sweet.

119
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
You stay here and enjoy it.

120
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,290
I'll go check the restaurant's accounts.

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,880
Let's go. Back to work.

122
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,320
Yiyu.

123
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,960
Hmm.

124
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,680
That chef Zhang just now

125
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,980
had a strange expression when he heard your father's name.

126
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,559
I asked around.

127
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,000
He used to be your father's kitchen assistant back then.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,059
I think he might know about what happened in those days.

129
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,280
There are too many people in the restaurant.

130
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,120
I found out where he lives.

131
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Really?

132
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Thank you.

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,490
What are you doing here?

134
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Why don't you go comfort your childhood sweetheart Yiyu?

135
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,240
Shuyun.

136
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
What are you talking about?

137
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,720
You are my fiancée.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
I can't let this matter go.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,560
No one has ever dared to hit me in my entire life.

140
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,960
She's just a lowly maid, yet she dared to be so disrespectful.

141
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,680
And she made my father lose face in front of so many people.

142
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,760
I really don't know what the Liu family's eldest son sees in her.

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,560
Shuyun, you're so generous.

144
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,200
Can't you just let it go?

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,000
I will make her pay for this.

146
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Shuyun.

147
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
Sinan.

148
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,560
You should leave first.

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
Wait a few days until Shuyun calms down a bit.

150
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,680
Then we'll visit your master at your home.

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
By the way, Commander.

152
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,970
There's one more thing.

153
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,890
Mr. Sun has a profitable business deal that needs your help.

154
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,520
He said after it's done, he'll give you

155
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
this much.

156
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Mrs. Zhang.

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
For lunch,

158
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,960
please ask the second young master to stay and eat with us.

159
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,880
Alright.

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
Shuyun.

161
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,520
You go up first.

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,620
Sinan and I have some other business to take care of.

163
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,320
Hurry up.

164
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Sir.

165
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
Master Zhang.

166
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,360
Hello.

167
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
You're usually so busy at the restaurant.

168
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,320
We didn't want to disturb you.

169
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,640
Today, since you're off work,

170
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,900
my sister and I came specially to see you.

171
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,320
By the way, I'd like to ask you about Chef Jiang.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir.

173
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,080
Please tell me everything you know.

174
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,920
This is really important to me.

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,680
Mr. Zhang, please.

176
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,760
Sir.

177
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,120
My father is Jiang Huai.

178
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,320
He can't just die without explanation.

179
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
I heard you were old friends.

180
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,680
I'm begging you.

181
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,760
Please tell me everything you know.

182
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,360
Child.

183
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,760
Please get up.

184
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,880
I don't deserve this.

185
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Come.

186
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Sit down.

187
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
Have some tea.

188
