1
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,540
Are you going to run away again in the future?

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,760
No, I won't.

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,480
I've decided to stay here and find out who the real culprit is.

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,520
Real culprit?

5
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
That's right.

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,700
The murderer who killed my birth parents is in the Liu mansion.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,080
I am the daughter of Jiang Huai, the head chef at Fulu Restaurant,

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,920
and Lingwu, the personal maid of Old Lady Liu.

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,000
When I was little,

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,080
they were brutally murdered.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,760
But it's okay.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now finally some clues are about to surface.

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Look at this.

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,320
Yiyu, I found it.

15
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,920
I asked the elders at the market.

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,820
Five years ago,

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,039
Master Liu gathered the most famous craftsmen in the city,

18
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,840
selected a fine piece of Hetian jade,

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,720
and crafted this unique jade pendant for the young master.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,400
It was his 18th birthday gift.

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
The young master?

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,800
Yes.

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,160
They say the young master's birth mother, Lady Liu, was extraordinarily beautiful in her lifetime

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,280
and shared a deep love with Master Liu.

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,440
That's why Master Liu was especially doting on the young master.

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,770
The whole city knows it.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm afraid it was the master's excessive indulgence

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
that made the young master arrogant and overbearing.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Until he caused trouble.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,040
Husband, you've been ignoring me for days.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,600
Have you grown tired of me?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,760
Who was it that desperately insisted on bringing me into this household?

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
Don't you hate me?

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Isn't this what you wanted?

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
Husband.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,770
We've been married for days but haven't consummated our marriage.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,680
Today is such a beautiful day, perhaps we could...

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,680
Husband, I've come to my senses.

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,120
The Liu family is wealthy and powerful.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,760
You are the eldest son.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,040
A wise man knows when to adapt to circumstances.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,400
Liu Sinan is merely a husband in name only.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,120
Being your wife,

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,600
is my greatest fortune in three lifetimes.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,240
I was too immature before.

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,600
Please don't hold it against me.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,300
What are you doing?

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Fire!

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,840
Fire! There's a fire! Help!

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,960
Fire!

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Fire! Fire! Fire!

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,240
Stay back! Don't come any closer!

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
Do you remember this?

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
It's yours, isn't it?

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
Please be seated, everyone.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Silin,

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,600
this is a birthday gift from your mother and me.

58
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Thank you, Father.

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,210
You should thank your mother for raising you.

60
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,380
Thank you, Mother.

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,399
So even the eldest young master of the Liu family gets scared sometimes.

62
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,880
Tell me.

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
Is it yours or not?

64
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
I don't know. I don't know.

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
I don't know.

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Something terrible has happened! The young master's room is on fire!

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,680
Help! There's a fire!

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,840
Husband, are you all right?

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,760
Young Master, are you all right?

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Fire! There's fire!

71
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,320
The Young Master is in shock.

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,960
Quickly, go fetch a doctor.

73
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
Yes, Madam.

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
Yiyu.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Sinan.

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,880
Here's the slow-acting poison you asked me to find.

77
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,610
What are you going to use it for?

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,050
I've found the murderer who killed my birth parents.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
Who?

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,280
It's Liu Silin.

81
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,760
How is that possible?

82
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Although my brother mistreats and abuses his servants,

83
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,960
but at least he has...

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
Stop making excuses for him.

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,160
I know blood is thicker than water,

86
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,680
but I've confirmed it.

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
He's the one who murdered my birth parents.

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,680
Will you help me?

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,159
Since my brother has done such a thing,

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,530
his crime is unforgivable.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,560
However, Yiyu,

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
what concerns me most

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,720
is your safety.

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,480
Hey, what's going on?

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
There was a fire in the young master's room yesterday.

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
The young master was frightened.

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,810
He's had a high fever all day today.

98
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,120
The master is furious.

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,320
He says if anything happens to the young master,

100
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,960
we'll all pay with our lives.

101
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,010
I'll go check on him.

102
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,600
The young mistress is back.

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,560
You may go now. I'll take care of him.

104
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
Yes.

105
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
Why is your hand so hot?

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
Take your medicine quickly.

107
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,880
Get Liu Silin out here.

108
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,720
Gentlemen, let's talk this through.

109
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,400
No need for weapons.

110
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Hurry up and bring that crazy son out.

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,280
Or I won't be so polite anymore.

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,940
What's that sound?

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
Sounds like gunshots.

114
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,440
What are you doing?

115
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm not dead yet.

116
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
What's going on here?

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Young master, you absolutely cannot go out.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,760
Why not?

119
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,720
The police are looking for you everywhere.

120
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,000
The master is furious right now.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,600
If you go out now, you'll be in serious trouble.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,880
Mr. Liu.

123
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Excuse me.

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,410
I apologize for the intrusion.

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,740
Someone reported that

126
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,320
Liu Silin recently beat a vendor to death on the street.

127
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,559
I'm here under orders to arrest him.

128
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,240
Mr. Liu, we understand.

129
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,720
You're a big name in Yuncheng,

130
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,159
with vast wealth and influence.

131
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,690
But when these incidents happen repeatedly,

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
don't you find it embarrassing?

133
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
The commander is showing you respect.

134
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,490
You need to show respect to the Commander.

135
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,440
Qianfan, is this true?

136
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,440
Sir.

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
I have indeed heard of it.

138
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,120
Sir.

139
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,440
Please calm down.

140
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,560
Don't be angry.

141
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
My friend.

142
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
Our master is in poor health.

143
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,560
If his health deteriorates from anger,

144
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,760
you'll have to answer to the General.

145
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,760
Here's what we'll do.

146
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,880
You go back first.

147
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,100
I'll discuss this with my master.

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
We'll certainly give you an answer.

149
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Fall back.

150
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Bring

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,080
that wretched creature here.

152
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,360
Sir,

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,040
the young master is still running a high fever from the shock.

154
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
Enough.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,880
Go

156
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,320
and tell Sinan to come see me.

157
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,760
Yes, sir.

158
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,880
What happened?

159
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,680
Drink your medicine quickly.

160
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,320
It's getting cold.

161
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,880
Hmm.

162
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Madam.

163
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
What is it now?

164
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
The master is asking for you.

165
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,760
I...

166
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,240
Thankfully, Sinan is such a filial child.

167
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,440
He's been taking good care of the master these days.

168
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
Indeed.

169
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,120
Otherwise that unfilial son would have been the death of me.

170
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,000
Yiyu, come here.

171
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,360
My child.

172
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm sorry you had to marry Silin.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,760
In the end, I've failed Qianfan.

174
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,880
He feared no one would take care of that unfilial son after my death.

175
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,880
That's why your father had you marry Silin.

176
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,320
I hope you won't blame your father.

177
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,240
And don't blame me for punishing you that day.

178
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,360
Sir, please say no more.

179
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,760
I've thought it through now.

180
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,880
I've decided.

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,880
To let Sinan manage the restaurant.

182
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Sinan, don't be sad.

183
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,000
I hate myself.

184
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,520
I hate my mother.

185
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Making me unable to hold my head up in this family.

186
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,140
