1
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,730
Gugu.

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,720
Sinan, I've finally become your wife.

3
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,440
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Sinan.

5
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,920
You're here.

6
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,120
No father, no mother, no one to care for her.

7
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,320
Picking food from garbage. Stop it!

8
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,480
What are you doing?

9
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,960
Yiyu.

10
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

11
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Who are you?

12
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
I

13
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,760
am your husband.

14
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,290
The eldest young master of the Liu family,

15
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
Liu Silin.

16
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,760
Since our young master went mad,

17
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
he's been tormenting servants to death.

18
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,320
We

19
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,120
should try to avoid him from now on.

20
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,880
Yes, indeed.

21
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
How could this be?

22
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
I clearly married the second young master.

23
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,120
It's Liu Sinan.

24
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,880
Who just married you in the ceremony.

25
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,480
That's me.

26
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Don't come any closer.

27
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Stay back.

28
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
Liu Sinan.

29
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,480
You dare call another man's name in front of me.

30
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,880
Yiyu.

31
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,880
Brother.

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,880
Brother.

33
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let her go.

34
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,120
You want to die?

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
You dare to cause trouble in my bridal chamber.

36
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,700
Yiyu was supposed to marry me.

37
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,920
But you took her away.

38
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,440
Is there no justice left?

39
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,000
Then I'll send you to meet your ancestors.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
Meet them.

41
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,000
Go on.

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,960
Stop! No more fighting!

43
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Young Master.

44
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,880
From now on,

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Yiyu is in your care.

46
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
Why don't you look for her? Go look!

47
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
Just go find her!

48
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm willing to marry you.

49
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Guards!

50
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,560
Yes, sir.

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Yiyu!

52
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Yiyu!

53
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Yiyu!

54
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Yiyu!

55
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,040
Sinan, I'm sorry.

56
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Go away!

57
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,159
No!

58
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,560
You!

59
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,570
Congratulations, Mr. Liu.

60
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,100
Please have a seat.

61
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,159
The Liu family truly deserves to be called Yuncheng's wealthiest.

62
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,440
This banquet is quite grand.

63
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,560
The housekeeper's daughter marrying the young master of the Liu family.

64
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
That's certainly a stroke of good fortune.

65
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Thanks to Mayor Wu's blessing.

66
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,000
Congratulations.

67
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,000
Look at my jade pendant.

68
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Sister Caiyue.

69
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
This jade pendant is so beautiful.

70
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,120
Where did you buy it?

71
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,680
This is something money can't buy.

72
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
It's been passed down in my family.

73
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Pretty, isn't it?

74
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,050
I came in wearing a bridal veil last night.

75
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
I don't even know how to leave.

76
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
It's beautiful.

77
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Let's go once we finish cleaning up.

78
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Madam.

79
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,320
You're up so early.

80
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,380
I'll fetch water for you and the young master to change.

81
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,760
No need.

82
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,540
The young master is still asleep.

83
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't disturb him.

84
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,200
Hey.

85
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,520
Wake up.

86
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
Xiuhe.

87
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
Is that you?

88
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,860
You've mistaken me for someone else.

89
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm sorry.

90
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,440
You are

91
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,320
the new bride who just arrived yesterday, right?

92
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

93
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
Who are you?

94
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,800
Why are you here?

95
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,120
My name is Guo Zixin.

96
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,440
I'm a servant in this household.

97
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,740
Because I offended the young master,

98
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,380
I've been tied up here for a day and night.

99
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,560
He's truly insane.

100
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,090
Thank you, young mistress.

101
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,800
Please get up.

102
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Do you know how to escape from here?

103
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
Ah.

104
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,920
Two of you go that way.

105
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
Two of you come this way.

106
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,560
Yes.

107
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
If we don't find the young mistress today,

108
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,760
the young master won't spare any of you.

109
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,560
Yes.

110
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
Where do you think the young mistress could have gone?

111
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,680
I heard there was a lot of noise from the young master's room last night.

112
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Could she have ended up like the others?

113
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,530
Did the young master...

114
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,240
Keep your voice down unless you want to lose your head.

115
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,760
Yes, yes.

116
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,820
Let's go, hurry up.

117
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,240
It's just a dog.

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
Let's continue searching.

119
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's go.

120
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,120
Stop!
