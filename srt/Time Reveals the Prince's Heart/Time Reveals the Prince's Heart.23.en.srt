1
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,290
Qianfan, I'm going to kill you.

2
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,450
Are you crazy? I'm your father.

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,960
No, you're not.

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
You're that man in black.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
You've done so many evil things.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,180
How dare you call yourself my father?

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,760
Seize him!

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,360
You talk too much.

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
Go tell it to the King of Hell.

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Yiyu!

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,080
You!

13
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,039
I'll fight you to the death!

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Get rid of him completely.

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,440
Yes.

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
Why don't you kill me?

17
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,160
You're my daughter.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Why would I want to kill you?

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
You're not my father at all.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,450
A married daughter is like spilled water.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,260
Taking sides with outsiders.

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
So all these years,

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
I've raised an ungrateful child.

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
You raised me all these years

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,440
just to use me as

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,000
a pawn you could manipulate at will?

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
To hurt others.

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,600
You're absolutely despicable.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,480
You killed my birth parents with your own hands.

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,240
And here you are pretending to be a loving father.

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,200
Bah!

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,079
My dear daughter,

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,050
you shouldn't say such things.

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,760
Your parents were meddling in affairs that didn't concern them.

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,000
And now you're just like them.

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,760
You've done so many shameful things.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,800
You even committed adultery behind the master and mistress's backs.

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
You killed my parents

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,480
just because

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,320
they knew about all your dirty secrets?

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,220
You're talking nonsense!

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,240
Mrs. Liu.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,040
She loved me.

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm the one she should have married.

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Why?

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,760
I built everything from nothing with Liu Muzhi.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,880
Why is he the respected Mr. Liu?

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,240
While I'm just his workhorse.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
It's not fair.

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,960
The woman I love.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,480
He took her too.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,160
I can't accept it.

53
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Stop fooling yourself.

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,480
Someone as despicable as you.

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,400
How could Mrs. Liu ever love you?

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
What do you know?

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,660
Liu Muzhi left on a business trip.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,320
He never returned.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,210
No news of him anywhere.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,160
People said.

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
He met with a shipwreck.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
And died abroad.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
Mrs. Liu.

64
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,600
My Yaqing.

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,880
Was heartbroken.

66
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,240
I was the one who took care of her.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
I told her.

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,760
I would be her support from then on.

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,760
That day.

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,600
That night.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
We drank a lot.

72
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,880
What a blissful night it was.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,600
Those days.

74
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,240
Were the happiest time of my life.

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,680
I asked someone

76
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
to custom-make a pair of gemstone rings in Shanghai.

77
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,680
They were meant to be our tokens of love.

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,360
You were just taking advantage of the situation.

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,200
You.

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,770
But who would have thought.

81
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,040
Right on Liu Silin's 18th birthday,

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,640
he actually came back.

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,680
He came to celebrate that brat son of his.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,960
Today is my son Silin's birthday.

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Thank you all for coming.

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,800
Have a drink.

87
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,640
Thank you.

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,880
Come.

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Mother.

90
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,040
Please be seated, everyone.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Such a young boy, so precious to him.

92
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,480
My Yaqing.

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
When she saw him,

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,040
she was speechless.

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
She hanged herself.

96
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
My Yaqing,

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
do you know?

98
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,360
She was pregnant with my child.

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,480
I will make

100
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Liu Muzhi

101
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,600
Liu Silin

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,960
pay blood for blood.

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,640
Shut up!

104
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,920
You're utterly despicable,

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,920
saying such vile things so shamelessly.

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,159
I've called you father for so many years.

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,480
I feel sick

108
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,920
and disgusted.

109
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,760
If you have the guts, kill me now.

110
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,040
Otherwise, I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

111
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,800
Last time,

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Liu Silin's aim was poor.

113
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
He didn't hit my vital spots.

114
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
Only slightly injured my hand.

115
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,080
Look.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,880
I should have known.

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,960
You were the one in black that night.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
As expected

119
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,800
of a good daughter I, Qianfan, raised.

120
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
You actually knew.

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,680
Using a fake secret letter to trick me.

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
After them!

123
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Butler!

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
What are you doing?

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,080
Someone broke into the Liu mansion.

126
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,210
The young master sent us to catch them.

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,480
Hey!

128
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,730
I think I saw someone running that way.

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,080
Let's go!

130
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,040
What a pity.

131
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
That was your last chance.

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,520
Yet you all

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
let it slip away so easily.

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,600
Everyone in the Liu mansion,

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
they're all fools.

136
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,320
I've been playing them like puppets.

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,880
They're not fools.

138
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,080
It's you.

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,159
You used them.

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,960
You betrayed their trust.

141
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,080
You hurt them.

142
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,400
Someone like you

143
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
deserves to burn in hell.

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,640
Go ahead, curse me.

145
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,960
Shout it out.

146
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,640
Let it all out.

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
Kill me then!

148
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,920
If you have the guts, kill me now.

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,920
Why would I kill you?

150
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,880
Killing you would be pointless.

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,800
You're still useful to me.

152
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,210
What are you going to do?

153
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm going to make

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Liu Silin

155
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,920
suffer beyond endurance.

156
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,680
Yiyu

157
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,040
Caiyue

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Caiyue

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,730
Young Master

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Where is the Young Mistress?

161
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
The Young Mistress left last night.

162
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
She hasn't returned yet.

163
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Did she say where she went?

164
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
She said she had some family matters

165
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,240
to take care of.

166
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
Young Master.

167
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,260
Young Master, it's the head butler calling.

168
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Qianfan.

169
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,160
Yiyu is in my hands now.

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,130
What are you going to do?

171
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
How is Yiyu?

172
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,600
She came to me herself.

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,250
You can't blame me for that.

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
Listen to me, Qianfan.

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,960
If you dare harm Yiyu in any way,

176
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,290
I'll tear you to pieces.

177
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,060
Release her immediately.

178
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,120
My young master,

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
don't panic.

180
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
Yiyu is still fine.

181
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,680
If you want to see her,

182
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,690
come to my house right away.

183
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,200
Qianfan.

184
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Qianfan.

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
Yiyu.

186
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Yiyu.

187
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,000
Yiyu.

188
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,000
Qianfan, Qianfan.

189
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
Get out here right now!

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Silin.

191
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,360
Yiyu.

192
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,800
Silin.

193
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Let Yiyu go.

194
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,500
Don't move.

195
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Move and I'll kill her.

196
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,680
If you agree to my terms,

197
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,920
I'll let her go.

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,490
If you release Yiyu,

199
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,600
I'll agree to anything.

200
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
Put the gun down first.

201
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,280
Put it down.

202
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
Silin, don't.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,480
Kick the gun over to me.

204
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,240
Hurry up.

205
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,160
Silin.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
Silin.

207
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,920
Liu Silin

208
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
Young Master Liu.

209
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,900
So you've fallen this low.

210
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,160
You've really disappointed me.

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Weren't you supposed to be so great?

212
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,680
Weren't you so proud?

213
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,480
Look at you now.

214
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
All for a woman.

215
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
I truly despise you.

216
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,160
You're just as worthless as your dead father.

217
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,000
I really can't understand.

218
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
How Yaqing

219
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,240
could ever marry that bastard father of yours.

220
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,220
And then gave birth to a little bastard like you.

221
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,560
Your father should have died at sea long ago.

222
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,160
Then Yaqing wouldn't have killed herself.

223
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,280
So you're the one who drove my mother to suicide.

224
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,600
You bastard.

225
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,360
My father thought you were loyal.

226
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,160
He always treated you like a brother.

227
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
Why?

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why?

229
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,480
Silin

230
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,480
Don't hurt Silin.

231
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
You don't know yet, do you?

232
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,160
This woman

233
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,220
is the one I convinced your father

234
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,440
to place by your side.

235
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,680
