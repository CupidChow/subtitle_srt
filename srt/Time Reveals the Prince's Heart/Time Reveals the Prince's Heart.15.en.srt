1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,260
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,520
our Fulu Restaurant

3
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
not only aims to promote traditional cuisine,

4
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,880
but we've also incorporated Western techniques

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,680
to launch a series of new dishes

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,280
to attract more customers.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,840
I believe

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,280
before long,

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,600
our Fulu Restaurant

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,459
will become the number one restaurant in Yuncheng.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,680
Let's all work hard,

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,080
and your salaries will double when that happens.

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,000
Great!

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,080
Thank you, boss! Great!

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,240
Fulu Grand Restaurant now reopened!

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,440
Welcome! Please come and taste our food!

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,200
This way, please.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,160
I've heard that Fulu Restaurant

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,360
has brought back all their classic dishes.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,620
I've traveled from afar just to try them.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
The only problem with Fulu Restaurant is it's too far from my home.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,060
Otherwise,

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,240
I would come here every day.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,770
Exactly.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,060
I've been craving their food.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,240
Young Master,

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
your luck today

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,039
isn't very good.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,440
Damn it!

30
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
Such rotten luck!

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,960
Master, please calm down.

32
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,570
You should have played the Two of Wan just now.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,420
Who the hell asked you to teach me how to play?

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,680
It's all because of you two jinxes.

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,850
Get the hell out of here!

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Young Master.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,520
Why are you so angry today?

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,160
Is it because of the Fulu Restaurant?

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,640
Old Mu.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
What about Fulu Restaurant?

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
You don't know yet?

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,400
Fulu Restaurant has been doing very well lately.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,320
They say it's because

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,760
the Elder Young Master and his wife know how to run a business.

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,320
The restaurant is gradually returning to its former glory.

46
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,280
Shut up.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Never mention the young mistress in front of me again.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,840
Sir.

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,720
We need to increase our monthly opium supply.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
I've already made arrangements.

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,360
All the brothels in the city

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
must use my product.

53
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,160
I want to see

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,240
how they can compete with me

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,579
in revenue with just a small restaurant.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,240
I want everyone to know.

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,960
I am the pillar of the Liu family.

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Second Young Master,

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,760
it's like this.

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,700
Our current volume is already large enough.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
If we increase it further,

62
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
it's not very realistic.

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,320
Besides,

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,600
both the underworld and authorities are watching us now.

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,800
If you cut off someone else's livelihood,

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,600
they'll come after us with everything they've got.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,120
Since when did you become such a coward?

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,400
Hey, don't worry.

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,240
In Yuncheng, we have Commander Xu backing us up.

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,680
Who would dare mess with us in Yuncheng?

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
Second Young Master,

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,760
are you perhaps angry with the First Young Mistress

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,320
and trying to drag us into taking risks?

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,120
Didn't I say

75
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,600
never to mention the First Young Mistress again?

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
Come on, we're all friends here.

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
What are you doing?

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
Old Mu, you...

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Apologize!

80
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, Second Young Master,

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,760
it was my fault just now.

82
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,960
My Second Young Master,

83
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,820
Old Mu is our long-time customer.

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
How can we work together if you act like this?

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Right?

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,960
With my current status in Yuncheng as Liu Sinan,

87
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,780
what does it matter if I offend one customer?

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,800
Besides,

89
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,820
everyone is fighting to do business with me now.

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,880
Get out!

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Hey, hey, Old Mu!

92
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm telling you... oh my!

93
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
Hey, Old Mu!

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,320
Really...

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Mr. Mu.

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,960
Mr. Mu, Mr. Mu.

97
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
The young master is impetuous.

98
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,780
Don't take it personally.

99
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
He's completely full of himself now.

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
He's not the same person I used to do business with.

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Sigh.

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
One day

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,050
he will destroy the Liu family.

104
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,680
Goodbye.

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,040
Sigh.

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

107
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,200
Why are you back?

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,290
Who made the young master angry again?

109
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
You did.

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Just a casino owner.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,440
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,280
This is no place for women.

113
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm here for my fiancé.

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Sinan.

115
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
You're out all night,

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,040
staying in places like this.

117
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Do you even care about me anymore?

118
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,720
It's business networking.

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,640
What would a woman know about it?

120
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
Sinan.

121
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,380
I heard your conversation with Mr. Sun just now.

122
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,280
Didn't my father tell you

123
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,720
to be kind to others,

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,480
not to push things too far?

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
That's how business lasts.

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,159
Besides,

127
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,960
you're always so reckless.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,120
After we're married,

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,720
how can my father feel comfortable entrusting me to you?

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,850
Commander Xu should just focus on his military affairs.

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,880
Business matters

132
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,840
are not his concern.

133
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,280
Liu Sinan.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Do you know who you're talking to?

135
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,280
Without my father,

136
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,160
your shady businesses wouldn't be this successful.

137
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,290
They would've been shut down long ago.

138
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,040
Commander Xu just expanded his army.

139
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
And built a new mansion.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
Wasn't that all funded by me?

141
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,760
Who really needs whom?

142
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,610
That's not certain yet.

143
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
Liu Sinan, you...

144
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
The restaurant is officially launching delivery service today.

145
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Free delivery

146
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
within 3 kilometers.

147
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,120
Regular customers who deposit 2 silver dollars

148
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,880
can enjoy 20% off on all dishes.

149
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,200
Goodbye, ma'am.

150
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,680
The restaurant is no longer exclusive to officials and nobles.

151
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,520
We've also introduced affordable dishes

152
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,980
and welcome everyone in town to dine with us.

153
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Please don't rush, you two.

154
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
Please wait over there for a moment.

155
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,010
I'll be right there.

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,850
Bring a pot of water to the table in the middle.

157
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
Come again, gentlemen.

158
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Mother.

159
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,520
Your spirits in heaven must be

160
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
very happy seeing all this.

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,040
Business is good.

162
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
It seems

163
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,680
Fulu Restaurant is truly back on track again.

164
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,840
The master in heaven

165
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
would be greatly comforted.

166
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,360
Your father, Jiang Huai,

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,300
would surely be happy for you too.

168
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
Thank you.

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,360
If you hadn't helped us find the recipe,

170
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,600
the restaurant wouldn't be doing so well.

171
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
It's what I should do.

172
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,040
My daughter,

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
you've decided

174
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,559
to be with the eldest young master sincerely.

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,720
Good.

176
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,880
The eldest young master's madness was fake,

177
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,840
and you two get along well.

178
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,960
My worried heart

179
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,600
can finally be at ease.

180
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
This second young master,

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,880
after becoming the head of the family,

182
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,940
has indeed become quite outrageous.

183
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
It seems that position

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,960
really can change a person.

185
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,600
My daughter,

186
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,500
no matter what path you choose in the future,

187
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
I will support you.

188
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,100
Thank you, Father.

189
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,040
What are you good for?

190
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,960
You can't even brew a pot of tea properly.

191
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,600
Are you trying to scald me to death?

192
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,060
Get out!

193
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Get out!

194
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,840
Hey.

195
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
If you're trying to persuade me

196
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,960
not to increase the order quantity,

197
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
I advise you not to say it.

198
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,210
What did you say?

199
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
Fulu Restaurant.

200
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,260
I certainly know their business is booming now.

201
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,640
Do you have any way

202
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,770
to cause them some trouble?

203
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,410
Stop eating, everyone.

204
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Who are you people

205
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,300
coming to my territory causing trouble?

206
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Isn't this the eldest young master of the Liu family?

207
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,640
No wonder.

208
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,160
How can food made by a lunatic be edible?

209
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,420
What are you doing?

210
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,600
If you keep causing trouble, we'll report you to the authorities.

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
Report to the authorities?

212
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,040
We haven't reported anything yet.

213
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,280
You want to report us?

214
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,210
What do you mean?

215
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,040
Bring it in.

216
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,080
Today at noon,

217
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,400
my uncle had a meal at your Fulu Restaurant,

218
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,360
and he ate something bad there,

219
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,360
now he's bedridden.

220
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
What do you think

221
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,850
we should do about this?

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,400
It hurts so much!

223
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm dying!

224
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,400
So what do you want?

225
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,460
Here's what I want:

226
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,240
pay my uncle 500 silver dollars

227
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,160
and publish an apology in the newspaper.

228
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,290
This is ridiculous.

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,800
I think you're just trying to extort us.

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,240
Before we've investigated this matter thoroughly,

231
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
on what grounds can you claim

232
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,960
that he got sick from eating at our restaurant?

233
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,490
Exactly.

234
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,040
Words alone are no proof.

235
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,800
Besides,

236
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
we've never even seen your uncle.

237
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,720
The biggest restaurant in town, Fulu Restaurant,

238
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,440
using your size to bully customers,

239
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,760
making people sick and refusing to admit it.

240
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,600
In the future,

241
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,500
who would dare eat here again?

242
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,840
What proof do you have

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,400
that he got sick from eating at our restaurant?

244
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,720
You won't be satisfied until you see the Yellow River!

245
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
If we hadn't consulted a doctor,

246
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
would we be here again?

247
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
Go get Dr. Li.

248
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,600
This is Dr. Li from Li's Clinic in the south of town.

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,040
He just examined the old master.

250
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,160
Dr. Li.

251
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,600
Please tell us,

252
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,040
what's wrong with my father?

253
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
I just examined the old master.

254
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,040
The old master

255
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
is definitely suffering from food poisoning.

256
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,280
Sir,

257
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,040
what did you eat?

258
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,700
It's that dish.

259
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,260
Dr. Li, please take a look.

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,480
Dr. Li.

261
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
Can you tell me

262
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,860
what's wrong with my dish?

263
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Dr. Li.

264
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,720
Feel free to speak.

265
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
My brothers and I

266
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,680
will definitely support you

267
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
and your family.

268
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,000
Yu.
