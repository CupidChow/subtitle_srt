1
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,160
Mr. Qianfan.

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,570
Mr. Qianfan.

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,280
Mr. Qianfan, please help me.

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,480
Young Master.

5
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Young Master.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,920
What have you done?

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,360
The whole city is looking for you now.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,200
Mr. Qianfan.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm finished.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Qian Yiyu and Liu Silin know everything I've done.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,440
And they're going to report me to the police.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,000
I have nowhere to run now.

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,720
Mr. Qianfan.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,160
Mr. Qianfan, I'm begging you.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,090
You must help me.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,420
Let me go, Mr. Qianfan.

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,360
But...

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
If I let you go...

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,080
The eldest young master won't spare me.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
You've worked at the Liu family for so many years,

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,410
they will surely give you face.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,880
Uncle Qianfan.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,880
You've watched me grow up since I was little.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,810
You can't push me into the fire pit!

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,560
Uncle Qianfan.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
Uncle Qianfan, I'm begging you.

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,450
I'm begging you.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,360
Please.

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,320
Quick,

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,920
get up when you speak.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,720
Take this money,

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,000
take it for now.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,960
Tomorrow,

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
at the southern path junction,

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,080
I'll arrange for someone to wait for you there,

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,440
they'll escort you on your way.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,840
Never come back to Yun City again.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,639
Alright. Thank you, Uncle Qianfan.

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,100
Thank you, Uncle Qianfan.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,400
Take it easy.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,720
Have you seen a square box like this?

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,160
No.

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,480
Go look for it.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,740
I'll go look there.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,320
My mother is the lady's personal maid.

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,060
If it's not with my mother,

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
where else could it be?

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,160
Is it possible

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,850
that your father has hidden it?

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,680
My father?

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,120
Fulu Restaurant.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Alright.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
Uncle Qianfan sent you here, right?

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,560
Yes, Second Young Master. Hurry onto the boat.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,700
After them!

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Stop!

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Don't run!

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
Stay back!

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,880
I'll jump if you come any closer!

60
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,680
Go ahead.

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Jump and save me the trouble of killing you.

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,680
Stay away!

63
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
Father, you're here.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,960
It's been a while

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,700
since I came to see you all.

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,680
This way.

67
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,060
Have a seat.

68
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,600
Now

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,400
the truth about the opium trafficking has come to light,

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,880
and your innocence can be fully restored.

71
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Oh my, I never expected this.

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,440
That the second young master would do such a thing.

73
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,360
Trafficking opium

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,640
and framing you for it.

75
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Really.

76
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,960
I watched him grow up.

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
When he was little,

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
he was such a gentle boy.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,520
Who knew he would turn out like this.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I never expected Liu Sinan to become like this either.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,200
Now he's missing,

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,850
and the entire Yun City is looking for him.

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,600
My daughter.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
It's good that you listened to me

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
and married the eldest son.

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,640
You see?

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,460
How could I ever harm my own daughter?

88
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,740
Look at the eldest son,

89
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,320
managing the entire Liu family

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,240
and the restaurant so well.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Daughter,

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,800
you should live a good life with him from now on.

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,600
As they say, a long journey tests a horse's strength,

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,530
and time reveals a person's heart.

95
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
The restaurant just created some new dishes.

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
Please try them,

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,680
and let Silin drink with you.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,490
I'll have a few drinks then.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,280
Young Master.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
I've searched the entire restaurant.

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,080
There's no box anywhere.

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,680
This area is built with special stones.

103
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
It keeps things cool and dry.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,660
It's where the kitchen stores vegetables and meat.

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Young Master.

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,920
The head butler is here.

107
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,250
The young mistress asks you to come along.

108
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,120
Young Master.

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,420
Let me toast to you.

110
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,800
Uncle Qianfan, please.

111
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
I should be the one toasting you.

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,480
I toast to you.

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
Young Master.

114
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
I really didn't expect this.

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
That we can become a family.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
It's our honor.

117
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Not at all.

118
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,780
You've watched both of us grow up.

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,360
In our hearts, we've always considered you family.

120
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
If my parents are watching from heaven,

121
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,140
they would be pleased.

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,400
Yiyu.

123
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,800
Yiyu.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Silin.

125
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,600
If I can't come back,

126
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,210
help me continue searching for the truth about that box.

127
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Madam.

128
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,090
It's so late now.

129
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,330
Where are you going?

130
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,049
I need to go home for something.

131
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,480
The young master is already asleep.

132
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,799
Please don't disturb him.

133
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,320
Yes.

134
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
How did it go?

135
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Liu Sinan fell off the cliff,

136
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,500
but we couldn't find his body.

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,040
What?

138
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Idiot!

139
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,120
I need proof. Either the man or his corpse.

140
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,080
Keep searching.

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Yes.

142
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
Miss,

143
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
why are you back?

144
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
I haven't been home for a long time.

145
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
I came to see my father.

146
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,170
The master has already gone to bed.

147
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,240
I understand.

148
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
You may leave now.

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,440
Guards! Catch the assassin!

150
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,600
Yiyu!

151
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,300
Don't come any closer!

152
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
There's an assassin!

153
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
Take off that mask!

154
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,600
Liu Sinan.

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,130
The entire Yun City is hunting for you now.

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
After all the evil things you've done,

157
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,600
you still dare to come back.

158
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Qianfan.

159
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,120
You old fox.

160
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm afraid you've done more evil than I have.

161
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
You're slandering me!

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,240
Which of my actions

163
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
wasn't ordered by you?

164
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,680
I never thought you could be so vicious and cruel,

165
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
trying to silence me forever.

166
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Surprised?

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,680
I'm standing right in front of you.

168
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,440
What?

169
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
You think killing me will clear your name?

170
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
You think you can pin all the crimes on me?

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,480
Let me tell you,

172
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
that's impossible.

173
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Even if I die,

174
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll take you down with me.

175
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Stop twisting the truth,

176
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Yiyu.

177
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,040
Don't believe him.

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,280
Killing innocent people and framing my brother,

179
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,160
competing with him for the family leadership.

180
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,280
Selling opium

181
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,640
and poisoning my father.

182
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,560
Which of these wasn't ordered by you?

183
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
I was too naive before,

184
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,360
thinking you had my best interests at heart.

185
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
Now I understand.

186
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
You've been using me all along to fulfill your ambitions.

187
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,800
Yiyu!

188
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,900
Don't believe him.

189
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,920
Everything I did was under his orders.

190
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,500
You're talking nonsense!

191
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,480
Yiyu.

192
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,930
I know I've done many terrible things.

193
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
You hate me, resent me,

194
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,210
and that's fine.

195
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,160
But today,

196
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,720
I want to tell you the whole truth.

197
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,820
Didn't you ask me last time

198
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,720
what happened to your brother's jade pendant?

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,720
After I stole the pendant,

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,460
I accidentally killed Xiuhe.

201
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,330
Young Master, are you alright?

202
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,420
Uncle Qianfan,

203
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,800
quick, get up!

204
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
Hurry!

205
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,700
The master is looking for you.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Go back quickly.

207
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,280
In my panic,

208
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,000
I hung the pendant on Qianfan.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Yiyu.

210
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,080
After Qianfan kills me,

211
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
he'll kill you and your brother too.

212
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
He's been with our Liu family for so many years,

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
all for his vicious ambitions.

214
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,920
Qianfan, I'm going to kill you!

215
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
Are you crazy? I'm your father!

216
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
No, you're not.

217
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,440
You're that man in black.
