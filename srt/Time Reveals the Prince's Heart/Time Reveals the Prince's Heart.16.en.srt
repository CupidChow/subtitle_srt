1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,600
Dr. Li.

2
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,240
Can you tell me

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,060
what's wrong with my dish?

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,480
The wild mushrooms in this dish.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm afraid they are

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
poisonous.

7
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,200
You!

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Did you hear that?

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,760
The food is poisoned.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Pay up now!

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,860
That's not right. I don't lie.

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,260
What are you doing?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,920
This is

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,760
Dr. Guo from Yuncheng Western Hospital.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Western medicine is fashionable now.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,760
Many government officials prefer Western doctors.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,720
I think Dr. Li's eyesight is failing him.

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,440
Why don't

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,120
we trust scientific instruments instead?

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,920
Why are you

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,320
afraid to check?

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Could it be that you're not

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,280
really sick?

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
Fine, let's take a look.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Then I'll trouble Dr. Guo.

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,380
What are you doing?

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,919
Oh, sir,

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
please lie down.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,360
Western doctors

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,760
use this treatment method.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,090
We need to draw blood first to examine you.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,880
Come.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Excuse me,

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
could you all help hold him down?

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,560
How dare you

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
try to fool me!

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,329
Smash it all!

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,160
Let's go!

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
Silin, what's wrong?

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Madam,

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,760
to what do I owe this honor?

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Sinan,

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
I'd like to ask you

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,480
for a favor.

45
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,400
Madam

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,800
asking me for help?

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm flattered.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,320
There have been troublemakers at the restaurant today.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
They're quite difficult to deal with.

50
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,880
Even your brother couldn't resolve it.

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,890
My brother is incredibly capable.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,120
There's nothing he can't handle.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,320
Sinan.

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,400
But if this continues,

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,079
the restaurant's reputation will suffer.

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I want to ask you

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,120
to seek Commander Xu's help.

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
If soldiers come,

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,600
those troublemakers will be scared away.

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,320
Yiyu.

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
I told you before,

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,920
opening Fulu Restaurant wouldn't be easy.

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
But you wouldn't listen.

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
However,

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,520
A customer got food poisoning.

66
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,700
This won't be easy to resolve.

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,680
Sinan.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,160
I never said

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,610
that the customer got food poisoning.

70
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
How did you know about it?

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Are you trying to frame us?

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,240
Let's go.

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,680
Silin.

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
What's wrong?

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,680
That gang leader just now

76
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,520
had a bat tattoo on his arm

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,060
identical to the one who tried to kill me before.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,340
I just remembered something.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
When I was tied up in the courtyard,

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
the two servants who attacked me

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
had similar tattoos on their hands.

82
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
They said

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,960
they were following your orders, young master.

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,160
Now it seems

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,330
they're all working together.

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,320
So,

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,200
you suspect Liu Sinan?

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,080
You're trying to trick me.

89
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,400
Yes.

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,640
You've been framing Liu Silin

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
and even wanted him dead.

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
It was all you, wasn't it?

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
So what if it was me?

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm the head of the family now.

95
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,810
What can you do about it?

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,800
You're despicable.

97
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,050
I'm not despicable enough.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,480
I regret not killing him directly

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,980
and leaving you by Liu Silin's side instead.

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Which led to

101
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,180
you hopelessly falling in love with him.

102
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,520
What did you say?

103
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
How does it feel to be an undercover?

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
Little Yu.

105
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,040
So...

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,760
You knew all along about marrying me off to Liu Silin?

107
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,290
I didn't just know about it.

108
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,880
I personally delivered you to his bed.

109
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,640
You beast!

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,160
I...

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,880
Beast.

112
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Blame yourself for falling in love with me.

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,660
Blame yourself

114
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,280
for being willing to sacrifice everything for me.

115
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,400
So...

116
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,400
So when you took me to elope,

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
it was all a lie.

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Otherwise, how do you think

119
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
Liu Silin could have

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,400
found that inn so easily?

121
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,240
That sachet

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,040
I deliberately left it there.

123
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Yi Yu

124
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,760
There's only one inn nearby.

125
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,290
Let's make do for one night.

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,680
Liu Sinan

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
You're absolutely terrifying.

128
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,680
I never imagined you could be so calculating.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Terrifying.

130
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,930
Terrifying.

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,080
But why does no one fear me even now?

132
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Why?

133
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,480
Why am I still not in control

134
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
even though I've become the head of the family?

135
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
Because you're ruthless.

136
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,480
You're despicable.

137
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,040
Let me tell you.

138
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,640
If you dare help him again,

139
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,360
don't blame me for forgetting our past.

140
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
Past.

141
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,880
How could someone like you be capable of feelings?

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,159
Why did I have to meet you when I was young?

143
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,690
Why did you have to be the one I liked as a child?

144
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,220
Don't think I wouldn't dare kill you.

145
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Go ahead.

146
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,210
Kill me if you have the guts.

147
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,680
You think those dirty things you've done

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
are unknown to others?

149
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
How about it?

150
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,920
I want to be alone.

151
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Yiyu, then you...

152
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,610
What do you want?

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,080
What?

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
Aren't you supposed to be so tough?

155
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,360
Beat him hard!

156
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Silin!

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,500
Yiyu, don't be afraid.

158
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm here.

159
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
Stop!

160
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,700
What are you doing?

161
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,060
Yiyu, don't be scared.

162
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,850
I'm here.

163
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,720
It's him.

164
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,680
He's the one who saved me.

165
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,360
All this time I thought it was...

166
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
Stop!

167
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Young master.

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Young master,

169
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
are you alright?

170
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm fine.

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Let's go. Hurry back.

172
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
I've been beaten up like this

173
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,380
and you're still smiling?

174
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,140
So you were the one who saved me when I was little.

175
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,170
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,060
I wanted to tell you on your birthday.

177
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,680
It's just...

178
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,560
Just what?

179
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,600
I was afraid.

180
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
I was afraid that you

181
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,460
still had Liu Sinan in your heart.

182
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
Silly.

183
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,570
I'm so glad it's you.

184
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,240
It was you all along.

185
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,920
They all know about the mushroom poisoning incident.

186
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,980
What else can we do?

187
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Xiuhe.

188
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Slow down.

189
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,800
Alright.

190
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,600
Zixin.

191
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,850
Long time no see.

192
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,680
Young Master.

193
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,690
What are you doing here?

194
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,920
The Master and Mistress don't have time to see you.

195
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm here to see you.

196
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,680
Me?

197
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,360
What for?

198
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,100
Let's talk over there.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm busy right now.

200
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,840
What if I told you

201
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,240
I know who really killed your cousin Xiuhe?

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,490
Don't you want revenge?

203
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,280
What did you say?

204
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
What makes you think

205
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,040
Enjoy your meal, sir.

206
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,450
What makes you think the Master killed Xiuhe?

207
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,730
Do you remember how Xiuhe looked when she was killed?

208
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
Of course I remember.

209
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,900
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

210
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,680
That bullet.

211
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,700
I've kept it all this time.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Just so that someday

213
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,000
I could find the real culprit.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,480
The gunshot wound on Xiuhe's forehead

215
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,440
was caused by Liu Silin's German-made revolver.

216
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
That gun was a birthday gift from the old master to him.

217
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,560
But at that time

218
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,680
everyone in the Liu household was protecting the eldest son,

219
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,240
so the matter was naturally covered up.

220
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,340
What you're saying

221
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
is true?

222
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,890
If you don't believe me,

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,220
just compare them and you'll see.

224
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,280
