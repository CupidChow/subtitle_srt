1
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,840
You go rest.

2
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,340
I'll take care of this.

3
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,440
How is it?

4
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,320
I think it needs some fennel.

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
I'll go get it.

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:41,880
Okay.

7
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,920
Be careful.

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,220
Guo Zixin, what are you doing?

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm going to kill him.

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Are you okay?

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
You want to kill me?

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,039
You killed Xiuhe.

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,360
Why do you think I killed Xiuhe?

14
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,960
The bullet that killed Xiuhe

15
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,000
came from your revolver.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
What else do you have to say?

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,360
Guo Zixin,

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,400
listen to me.

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't be impulsive.

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,960
Yiyu,

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,890
why are you protecting him?

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,620
Have you forgotten

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,010
he might have killed your parents?

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,920
Until things are clear,

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
I choose to trust him.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,320
I hope you'll calm down first.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,450
We will definitely find out the truth.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,840
Guo Zixin.

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
I've always considered you my best friend,

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
the person I trust most.

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,920
So,

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,490
haven't I felt the same?

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,320
But no one can stop me from avenging Xiuhe.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,640
Silin!

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,079
Silin! Silin!

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,960
Help! Someone come here!

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,600
Silin, wake up!

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,880
Hang in there!

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,760
Silin!

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Silin, wake up! Silin!

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,960
You're awake.

42
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,400
It's all because of me.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,329
You got hurt so badly because of me.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
It's okay.

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
It didn't hit any vital organs.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
You'll recover soon.

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,260
If I hadn't sent Guo Zixin to the restaurant,

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,960
this wouldn't have happened.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,480
I told you it's fine.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,380
Guo Zixin must have been used by someone.

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,480
Well,

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,130
could it be Liu Sinan again?

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,960
Yiyu.

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
No matter how many people wrongly accuse me

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,180
or frame me,

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,660
as long as you're here,

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,980
that's enough.

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Extra! Extra!

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,160
General Wu has led his troops into Yun City!

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,040
Extra! Extra!

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,400
General Wu has led his troops into Yun City!

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,320
Extra! Extra!

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
General Wu has led his troops into Yun City!

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Who are you people?

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,680
Hey!

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,570
Let me go!

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,159
Who are you?

69
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,040
Why are you tying me up?

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,040
Do you know who I am?

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,720
Master Duan, the head of Qinglong Hall.

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,040
The boss of Yun City docks.

73
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,380
I can't believe you don't recognize him.

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
Master Duan.

75
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
I've heard so much about you.

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,700
I don't know how our Liu family

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,240
has offended you.

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,800
Besides, you must know

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I'm Commander Xu's son-in-law.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,640
You'd better release me now.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,360
Otherwise, Commander Xu won't let you get away with this.

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
Young Master.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,080
Don't get excited.

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,200
Things have changed in Yun City.

85
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,560
General Wu has entered the city.

86
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,040
Commander Xu himself

87
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,640
can't even stay here anymore.

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,480
Who can protect you now?

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,060
Your Liu family business is too prosperous.

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,080
Everyone in Yun City can see that.

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,890
Yet you don't pay a penny in protection money.

92
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,040
That just won't do, will it?

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,540
The brothers in our circle

94
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
need to eat too.

95
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,280
What are you talking about, Brother Hu?

96
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,920
We have no connection with each other,

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
so why should we pay protection money?

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,200
In the past, you ran a legitimate business,

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,520
so we left each other alone.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,080
But now,

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,880
your Liu family's opium business

102
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,520
is flourishing.

103
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,600
All the brothers are envious.

104
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,810
What do you want?

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,200
That's easy.

106
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,740
From now on,

107
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,520
you're not allowed to run the opium business anymore.

108
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,080
Also,

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
for all Liu family business rights,

110
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,760
I want

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
30 percent.

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,800
I spit on that!

113
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't push your luck!

114
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Let me tell you,

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,920
since my father started our family business,

116
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,760
we've never been afraid of anyone.

117
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,020
If you've got the guts,

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
then you just—

119
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Young Master!

120
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,700
Don't get excited.

121
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,520
Now we can talk properly.

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
No, no, no!

123
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,050
Master Duan,

124
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
Master Duan, I agree!

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,480
I agree!

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,240
I agree!

127
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,360
Good.

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,610
Put the gun down.

129
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
Second Young Master.

130
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,290
Pleasure doing business with you.

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,640
Young Master

132
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Yiyu.

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,200
What's so urgent?

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,400
Something terrible happened!

135
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,880
The Liu family is in trouble.

136
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,800
What happened?

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,730
This Qinglong Gang is nothing but extortion.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,050
They're so corrupt.

139
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Yes.

140
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,160
If we follow the conditions the Second Young Master agreed to,

141
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
the Liu family will lose money every month.

142
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,680
If this continues,

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
the Liu family will certainly collapse.

144
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm here today

145
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,520
representing the shareholders and Liu family elders

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,580
to ask you to return

147
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,480
and discuss countermeasures together.

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,880
But Sinan is now the head of the Liu family.

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,400
It wouldn't be appropriate for me to go back.

150
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,159
To be honest with you,

151
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,290
First Young Master,

152
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,200
everyone in the Liu family,

153
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,400
is quite dissatisfied with the Second Young Master.

154
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,480
The shareholders and elders have all agreed

155
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,760
to remove the Second Young Master from his position as head of the family.

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,200
That's why I came to you.

157
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,200
But when Father passed away,

158
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,640
he explicitly said Sinan would take his place.

159
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I can't go against his dying wish.

160
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,520
Listen, young master,

161
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,160
do you realize what's happening?

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,420
You can't just stand by and watch the Liu family fall apart.

163
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,640
Silin.

164
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,680
I believe the spirits of the master and madam

165
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,040
would want you to save the Liu family.

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,640
I'll be with you.

167
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,640
Mr. Duan.

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,820
Please have a seat.

169
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,960
Fulu Restaurant truly deserves its reputation as Yun City's finest.

170
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,640
I wonder

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,360
what business the young master has with me.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Mr. Duan,

173
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,810
from today onwards,

174
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,240
I'll be temporarily in charge of the Liu family.

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
I invited you here

176
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,650
hoping for your support in the future.

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,760
Young master, you have remarkable presence

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
and business acumen.

179
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,800
Restoring Fulu Restaurant to its former glory,

180
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,760
you should rightfully be in charge.

181
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
I've been wondering

182
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,480
how Liu Sinan became the head of the Liu family.

183
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,320
Mr. Duan,

184
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,370
you misunderstood my meaning.

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,920
What I meant was,

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,530
the Liu family now has a new master.

187
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
The agreements Liu Sinan made with you

188
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,050
are no longer valid.

189
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
What did you say?

190
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Mr. Duan,

191
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
don't get angry.

192
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,680
I've heard

193
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,160
things are changing in Yun City.

194
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,040
The new Commander Wu

195
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,130
is known for his integrity.

196
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,000
If anyone wants to continue in the opium business,

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
it won't be easy.

198
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,340
If your Qinglong Gang wants to keep collecting protection money,

199
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,940
that won't be easy either.

200
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,920
What do you mean?

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,250
Are you threatening me?

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Don't misunderstand me.

203
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,500
I just think your Qinglong Gang brothers

204
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,100
living on the edge,

205
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,490
isn't sustainable in the long run.

206
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
If you don't mind,

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,170
we could work together.

208
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,100
What do you say?

209
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,280
Mr. Duan, as you know,

210
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,480
my Liu family's business spans far and wide,

211
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,840
but now we urgently need people for transportation.

212
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,160
And my Fulu Restaurant

213
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,800
outside of Yun City

214
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,680
has also gained quite a reputation.

215
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,560
Many people want our dishes delivered outside the city.

216
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,040
If we join forces,

217
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,240
my Liu family business can grow even bigger,

218
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,420
and your Qinglong Gang will have legitimate business.

219
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,460
What do you say?

220
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,360
Young Master,

221
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,560
you truly think ahead.

222
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,440
Today I, Duan,

223
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,280
have learned something new.

224
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
To be honest,

225
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm also trying to find

226
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,800
a way to feed my Qinglong brothers.

227
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,040
Since that's the case,

228
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,280
why not do it?

229
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
Great minds think alike.

230
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,920
Mr. Duan,

231
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,920
I toast to you.

232
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,600
Cheers.

233
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
Brothers,

234
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,800
learn from the Liu family's young master.

235
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,720
This is what being

236
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,040
a true leader looks like.

237
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,920
Yes.

238
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,040
Where are you going?

239
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
Where to?

240
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,840
I'll hide in the suburbs for a while.

241
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
You keep an eye on things in the city.

242
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,840
If there's any sign of trouble,

243
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,240
let me know immediately.

244
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
As for our relationship with the Liu family,

245
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
What?

246
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
we need to maintain it well.

247
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,780
Otherwise, we'll have no chance to turn things around.

248
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,040
Liu Sinan is no longer the head of the family now.

249
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,680
Liu Silin is in charge.

250
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,280
I'm afraid now...

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
Damn it!

252
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,720
I was blind not to see it coming.

253
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
Who knew that bastard Liu Silin

254
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,600
was just pretending to be a fool?

255
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,920
Perhaps

256
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
your marriage to Liu Sinan

257
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
should be put on hold for now.

258
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,000
Alright, let's go.

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,800
Let's go.

260
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,280
They're gone.

261
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Young Master.

262
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,480
Look, I found it.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
According to the accounts,

264
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,920
the Second Young Master has been

265
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
secretly selling opium for a long time.

266
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,440
He's been using other businesses to cover it up.

267
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,240
No wonder he could

268
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,240
expand the family business so quickly

269
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
and gain father's trust.

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,400
You may go now.

271
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,680
Yes, sir.

272
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,240
Silin.

273
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,970
The servant said

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,600
there will be a business gala in Yuncheng tomorrow,

275
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,260
and our Liu family is invited.

276
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,360
Good.

277
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
Come with me tomorrow.

278
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,680
Yu.
