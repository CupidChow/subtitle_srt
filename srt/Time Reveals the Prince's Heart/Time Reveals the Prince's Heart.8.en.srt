1
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,200
Day after day,

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,880
what's the use of drinking these herbal medicines?

3
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,360
That unfilial son will be the death of me sooner or later.

4
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,160
Master, please calm down.

5
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,160
Everything was fine,

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,480
but that wretched boy ruined the wedding banquet.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,480
How am I going to explain this to the Commander?

8
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,760
The Commander's family has returned all our betrothal gifts.

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,840
Commander Xu and Miss Xu are just angry for now.

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,240
I'm sure they'll come around once they've calmed down.

11
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,479
No.

12
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,680
I can't let that wretched boy roam freely anymore.

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,640
I must lock him up

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,080
and keep him under strict supervision.

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,640
Father, please reconsider.

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,080
If this gets out, it will look bad for us.

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,400
Indeed.

18
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,480
If it weren't for...

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,160
Because I feel guilty toward his mother...

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,920
I would

21
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,080
absolutely not tolerate this unfilial son.

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,720
Father, don't worry about Miss Xu.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,930
I'll take care of it.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,320
Miss Xu has a good impression of me.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,240
I believe the relationship between our families will improve soon.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Sinan.

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
Do you hate your brother?

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,820
He is my own brother after all.

29
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,680
How could I possibly hold a grudge against him?

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,360
After I marry Miss Xu,

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,329
I will definitely expand the Liu family business

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,720
and take good care of him then.

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,680
Sinan.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,040
You are so generous.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
I indeed chose the right person.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,040
Not at all.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,480
You want to investigate what happened to your parents at Fulu Restaurant.

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,140
Because...

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,320
It's been so many years

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,050
Could there still be any clues?

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,320
I want to give it a try.

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,240
Liu Silin's jade pendant

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,720
was also lost at Fulu Restaurant back then.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,480
I feel there's more to this story.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,840
This Fulu Restaurant...

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
Although it belongs to the Liu family

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,400
but...

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,120
The young master's madness

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,060
is now known throughout the city.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Besides, a few days ago

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,480
you just ruined the wedding between the Liu family and the Commander's mansion.

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
It won't be easy for you to get in now.

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,880
So I want you to come with me.

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
Me?

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Excuse me.

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Fulu Restaurant isn't a place just anyone can enter.

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,780
You two can go to the small restaurant next door.

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,680
Are you hiring?

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,760
You two?

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
We're siblings who fled from famine

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
looking for work to feed ourselves.

62
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,480
We can work for less pay.

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
Manager.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,120
These two fled from famine

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
and want to work at our restaurant.

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,320
All right. I happen to need two helpers.

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
You can stay for now.

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
Thank you, Manager.

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,880
This isn't clean enough.

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
And this too.

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,440
I've been here less than a year.

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,000
You're asking about something from seven years ago.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
How would I know?

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
No idea.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,040
Ma'am.

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
How long have you been working here?

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
At least twenty years.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Even the manager hasn't been here as long as I have.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Then I'd like to ask you something.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Do you remember five years ago

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
when the young master held his birthday banquet here?

82
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,010
Isn't the young master insane?

83
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,840
Why would he hold any banquet?

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,440
I don't remember. I don't remember.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,500
If you two keep slacking off, I won't be so nice anymore!

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,320
And these too.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
You've been leaving early and coming back late

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,000
these days. What have you been up to?

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,159
Oh please,

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,610
mind your own business.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,880
The young master is here. Hurry up with those desserts,

92
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,600
or we'll all be packing our bags and leaving.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,560
Yes, our restaurant used to be so quiet.

94
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,040
Thanks to the young master, we now have all these distinguished guests.

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
Stop the chatter.

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Hurry and take these dishes to the young master in the Cuiyu private room.

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
Yes, alright, let's go.

98
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
Here, Young Master, a toast to you.

99
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Come on.

100
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,720
Young Master,

101
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
what is Liu Sinan doing here?

102
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
Now, I am Commander Xu's future son-in-law.

103
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,280
And who are those people?

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,840
In Yuncheng,

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,840
who wouldn't show me some respect?

106
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
That's right.

107
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
In the future,

108
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,560
if you need anything from me,

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
just say the word.

110
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
Of course.

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
Cheers.

112
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,360
Drink up.

113
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
The Liu Sinan now

114
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,929
is not the Brother Sinan I used to know.

115
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,520
I hate those who climb the social ladder through connections.

116
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,850
In the future, I will rely on my own efforts

117
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
to build my career.

118
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,960
Anyway, it has nothing to do with me anymore.

119
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Let me see what they're talking about.

120
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,160
Young Master, here's to you.

121
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,160
Sinan,

122
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,250
there's something I want to discuss with you.

123
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,720
Recently, there's a shipment of opium coming to Yuncheng.

124
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,400
I can't hear clearly what they're saying.

125
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,960
I want to use your connection with Commander Xu to pull some strings.

126
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Of course.

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,200
You'll definitely get your fair share of benefits.

128
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,320
Sir.

129
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
You...

130
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Alright.

131
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,960
What does that hand gesture mean?

132
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,440
It seems like

133
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,080
they're making some kind of deal.

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,680
Okay.

135
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,680
Come on.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Let's drink.

137
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,840
Why has she been

138
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,220
eating so much lately?

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,530
Has she been doing physical labor?

140
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,820
They might know what happened back then.

141
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
Father,

142
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,480
I miss you so much.

143
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,440
Sir, may I ask you something?

144
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,120
Come.

145
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
It's you again.

146
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you doing?

147
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,580
Why are you wandering around in the kitchen?

148
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
I just wanted to take a look.

149
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,520
The kitchen is a restricted area.

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,560
Front hall workers are not allowed in here.

151
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,000
This has always been the rule at Fulu Restaurant.

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let me tell you,

153
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
a busboy like you

154
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
could contaminate the kitchen and make customers sick.

155
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Even your life wouldn't be enough compensation.

156
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
But I haven't done anything.

157
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,960
That doesn't matter.

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I must give you a few lashes today to teach you a lesson.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,440
Hey, innkeeper!

160
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,120
If you want to hit someone, hit me.

161
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,250
Don't hit my sister.

162
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,200
If she's hurt, she won't be able to work.

163
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,260
Look at that, she's got an old flame speaking up for her.

164
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,760
I can see you're not really here to work.

165
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,680
Flirting with everyone.

166
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,120
Either you're flirting with the waiters or wandering aimlessly in the kitchen.

167
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,320
I won't hit you today.

168
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,800
Who knows what trouble you'll cause me later.

169
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
She usually...

170
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
If you're going to hit, then hit.

171
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,780
Stop wasting your breath.

172
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
Little brat.

173
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,520
Who hit you?

174
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,120
No one.

175
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Nobody hit me.

176
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,880
Then stay at home tomorrow.

177
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,120
Don't go anywhere.

178
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,440
Why should I?

179
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,880
Because I'm the eldest son of the Liu family.

180
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
And you are my wife.

181
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,200
Yu.

182
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,480
Lei Wenli Bin.

183
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Lei Pengchao.

184
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,960
Ran Pingxiang Shidi Tao Lei Wenli Bin Ping Caichao Lei Pengchao Chang Ting Yuebo Zhang Feng Chaonan Qin Dongzhu Qundong Liu Jinghong Jun.

185
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,800
