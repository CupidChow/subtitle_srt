1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,360
So you're the one who drove my mother to suicide.

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,680
You bastard.

3
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,520
My father thought you were loyal to him.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,160
He always treated you like a brother.

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,960
Why did you

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,280
do this?

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
Silin.

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
Don't hurt Silin.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,440
Silin.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,960
You don't know yet, do you?

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,440
I convinced your father to place this woman

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,240
by your side.

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,680
Unfortunately, this woman

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,800
is useless.

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,050
She actually fell in love with you.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,280
This useless thing.

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Qianfan, you.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,440
Anyone who is troubled by love

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
will never achieve greatness.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,759
And you, Liu Silin,

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,420
are exactly such a person.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,120
No!

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Don't hurt Silin!

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,280
Liu Muzhi.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,960
Open your eyes and see.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,640
Your glorious young master

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,120
The eldest son is now under my foot.

28
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,800
Your second son.

29
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,600
I killed him too.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,039
You treated me like a servant.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,720
Treated me like a servant.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,720
I've been a damn servant my whole life.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I've had enough.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,400
Now I want to be the master.

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
Qianfan.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Don't celebrate too soon.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,680
If you just

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,720
gently

39
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,040
put your fingerprint on this,

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
voluntarily giving up

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,440
all the Liu family's property and restaurant shares,

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
you'll be free.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll also

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
spare you and Yiyu.

45
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,920
The young master just said

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,520
that all shares and property

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,560
would be given to me.

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,720
Did you all hear that?

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
I heard that.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
No!

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,720
Don't hurt Silin!

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,640
From now on,

53
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
the Liu family belongs to me.

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,200
From now on, the Liu family will be surnamed Qian.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,440
I've finally made it.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
I've finally succeeded.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,720
I've finally endured it all.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't celebrate too soon.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Look.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
What is this?

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,920
Back then,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,880
you went to great lengths

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,920
to kill Yiyu's parents.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,920
Wasn't it all for what's inside this box?

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Where is it?

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,560
Where did you get this?

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,440
Everyone, put all these books and papers in a well-ventilated place

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
to prevent moisture damage.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Also put them where mice can't reach them,

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
so they can be preserved longer.

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,080
Did you hear me?

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,560
Yes.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,560
Could your father have hidden it?

74
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,280
My father?

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,640
Fulu Restaurant.

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,080
Young master.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,480
We've searched the entire restaurant

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,600
but found no box.

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
This cellar is built with special stones

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,360
to keep it cool and dry.

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,220
It's where the kitchen stores vegetables and meat.

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,620
Caiyue, follow me.

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,160
Young Master.

84
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,970
There's an important document in the box.

85
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
Master Jiang wanted to preserve it for a long time,

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,330
so he might have hidden it here.

87
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Found it!

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
It really is here.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,440
Where's the stuff?

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,040
I released Yiyu.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,720
I let her go.

92
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
You released her?

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
You let her go?

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,280
Yiyu.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,200
Silin.

96
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,159
Silin.

97
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,200
Yiyu.

98
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Do you know what's in the box?

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,290
It contains all the evidence of Qianfan's crimes

100
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,600
over all these years.

101
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
You trafficked tobacco,

102
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,560
human trafficking, murder and robbery.

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,820
You did all these terrible things behind my father's back.

104
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,200
You sweet-talked my mother

105
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,600
probably just to use her

106
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,600
to cover up your crimes.

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
And the reason my mother committed suicide

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,760
was because she found out what you had done.

109
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
She felt she had betrayed my father.

110
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
Liu Silin, that's enough.

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,360
Silin.

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,760
Where is it?

113
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,880
Give it to him, Silin.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,080
Give it to me.

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
You really are

116
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,440
scheming your whole life

117
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,100
but foolish at this critical moment.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,040
Something this important,

119
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,820
how could I possibly carry it with me?

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,200
I already had Caiyue

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,159
deliver it to the police station.

122
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
You and I.

123
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
Silin.

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Silin, how are you? Silin!

125
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Yiyu.

126
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,040
You're okay.

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,200
That's

128
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,880
good.

129
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,640
Silin! Silin!

130
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,640
Wake up!

131
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,600
Silin!

132
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Silin!

133
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,760
Silin, open your eyes and look at me!

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
Silin!

135
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,770
Search everywhere!

136
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Silin!

137
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
Open your eyes and look at me.

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
Open your eyes, Silin.

139
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,800
Go in and search.

140
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Yes.

141
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,890
Stop shaking me.

142
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,700
If you keep shaking me, you'll really shake me to death.

143
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,500
Fortunately, I didn't come too late.

144
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,340
Thank you, Director Wang.

145
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
I thought you had taken Qianfan's bribe

146
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
and wouldn't come.

147
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,880
Nonsense.

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,640
Do I look like those corrupt officials?

149
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
I swear to follow General Wu until death

150
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
and fight against evil at all costs.

151
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,900
Actually, the reason I let you go that day

152
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,380
was because I secretly investigated

153
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,320
and found Liu Sinan was the one trafficking opium.

154
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
I just never expected

155
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,500
that Qianfan was the real mastermind behind it all.

156
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,200
So what was the document

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,040
Miss Xu used to threaten you?

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,640
It was nothing, just a photo.

159
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,440
A photo?

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,960
Once,

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,440
Commander Xu

162
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,810
took me to Yihong House for drinks.

163
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
I got drunk that day,

164
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,080
and he took a photo

165
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,420
that he's been using to blackmail me ever since.

166
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
Director Wang,

167
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,880
you really are a man of passion.

168
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,050
That's nice.

169
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,640
It's all over now.

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes.

171
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,840
It's all behind us.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Do you remember

173
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,500
how you looked on our wedding day?

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,930
It hurts so much.

175
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,840
Isn't it better yet?

176
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,010
Yiyu, what's wrong?

177
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,160
Your little crazy one is coming.

178
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,280
Yu.
