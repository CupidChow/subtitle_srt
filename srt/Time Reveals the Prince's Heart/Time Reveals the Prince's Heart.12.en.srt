1
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,520
Get out!

2
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,200
Young master.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
Please talk to the master.

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Wake up.

5
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,800
Wake up.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,440
Father, it's time to get up.

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,770
I've failed you as a son.

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,680
You scold me.

9
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,080
You hit me.

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,000
Hit me.

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Hit me.

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,000
Hit me. Hit me.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,360
Hit me.

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,880
I'll hit myself.

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
Silin.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Silin.

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
I'll hit myself.

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,000
Father, get up and hit me.

19
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,500
Young master, your wounds have just healed.

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,340
Please don't get too excited.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,760
Young master.

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
Father.

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,760
Silin.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
Take him away.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Young master.

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,880
Young master.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,280
Get up and hit me.

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,360
All of you, leave now.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,820
Let me be alone with my father.

30
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,280
Father.

31
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
Can you hear me?

32
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,160
You've never cared about me your entire life.

33
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,079
Just because of my humble origins.

34
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,120
I've been looked down upon everywhere.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
While that madman Liu Silin has done so many outrageous things.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,460
Yet you've always been lenient with him.

37
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,520
He even dreams of replacing me as your heir.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,920
Do you think as a father,

39
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
you deserve that title?

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
My dear father.

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,560
I won't let you and Liu Silin succeed.

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you know how much effort I've put in

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,920
to reach this position?

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,140
It doesn't matter.

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,800
You won't need to know anyway.

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,280
Because,

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
today,

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,440
you're going to die.

49
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
You probably don't know,

50
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
that in your daily meals,

51
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
I've been poisoning you.

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,440
So your health hasn't improved,

53
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,530
but has gotten worse and worse.

54
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
But,

55
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
is all this my fault?

56
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Is it my fault?

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Blame yourself.

58
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
It's your own favoritism.

59
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,570
You deserve this retribution.

60
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,520
Master.

61
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,240
Where is the young master?

62
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,500
The young master is still locking himself in his room and refuses to come out.

63
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
Brother.

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,280
Brother.

65
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
Father has been gone for over a month now.

66
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
Brother, you need to pull yourself together.

67
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,960
The Liu family has so many affairs waiting to be managed.

68
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,680
I can't handle everything alone.

69
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Do you know what the elders in the family are saying about you?

70
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,480
What are they saying?

71
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,570
Never mind. It's not pleasant.

72
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
I'd better not say it.

73
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Tell me.

74
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,280
What can't you say?

75
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
They all say the master raised a useless son.

76
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
A coward.

77
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,560
Who only causes trouble when he's not having fits.

78
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,840
The master was probably angered to death by him.

79
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,840
Say that again.

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,200
I said I wouldn't tell you, but you insisted.

81
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,240
I told you.

82
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,080
Now you're upset and can't accept it.

83
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,840
Let me tell you.

84
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,500
Father's death must not be as simple as it seems.

85
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,240
I will find out the truth about everything.

86
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,280
Brother.

87
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,840
Face reality.

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,720
Father used to protect you.

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,920
But now

90
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,640
you're like a stray dog with no home.

91
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,280
Just look at yourself now.

92
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,100
If you're not useless,

93
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,240
then what are you?

94
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,120
You.

95
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,240
—Yu.

96
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,440
Yiyu.

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,480
Young Master Liu manages everything in the Liu family. You're extremely busy.

98
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,280
How do you have time to come here?

99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,600
Yiyu, I came specifically to see you.

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,050
Are you feeling better?

101
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Please don't trouble yourself worrying about me, Young Master.

102
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
Yiyu.

103
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,880
I've finally made it.

104
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,130
Now I'm in charge of everything in the Liu household.

105
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,900
Do you remember the promise I made to you?

106
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Promise.

107
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
I promised you.

108
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,700
Once I take control of the Liu family.

109
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll be with you.

110
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Have you

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
really fallen for Liu Silin?

112
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,570
Don't come looking for me unless it's important.

113
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Liu Silin is just a madman.

114
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,720
He's finished.

115
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,520
He lost his father.

116
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,400
He's like a pile of mud.

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,780
Do you still want to be with him like this?

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,200
Liu Sinan.

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,560
Although you're now the head of the Liu family,

120
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,160
Silin is still your elder brother.

121
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
So please show him respect.

122
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,280
Also,

123
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,160
where I go is none of your business.

124
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
So please leave now.

125
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,640
Our positions are different now.

126
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,420
It wouldn't look good if others saw us together.

127
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,840
Silin, please eat something.

128
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,320
Silin.

129
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
If you continue not eating or drinking for a month,

130
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,720
look how worn out you've become.

131
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,080
If this continues,

132
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,720
the master won't rest in peace.

133
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,320
All the servants have left.

134
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,960
Why haven't you left?

135
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,320
Why should I leave?

136
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm the wife of the Liu family's eldest son.

137
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,970
You follow your husband wherever he goes.

138
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,840
Listen to me.

139
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,280
The master is gone. That's a fact.

140
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,080
But you can't keep wasting away like this.

141
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,520
Liu Sinan now controls the entire Liu family.

142
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,780
I heard from people at the restaurant

143
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,210
that he's often associating with shady characters.

144
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,130
Who knows what kind of business he's involved in.

145
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,080
You're the eldest son of the Liu family.

146
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,600
You can't just stand by

147
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,400
and watch him destroy the Liu family.

148
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
But I...

149
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,600
I have nothing left now.

150
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,720
No!

151
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,400
You have me.

152
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,720
And you still have the Fulu Restaurant.

153
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
The restaurant?
