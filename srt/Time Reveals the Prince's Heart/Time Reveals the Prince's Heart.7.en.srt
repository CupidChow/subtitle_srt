1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
You wanted to poison me.

2
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,760
What?

3
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm not dead.

4
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
Surprised?

5
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,880
Today,

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
your dear Sinan is getting engaged.

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
Are you heartbroken?

8
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,020
I don't need your help anyway.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Do you think your precious Sinan will save you?

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,760
It's none of your business.

11
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,700
Did you really think I wouldn't kill you?

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,440
You've killed more people than I can count.

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
And my biological parents

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,640
were killed by your own hands.

15
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,800
If I told you I didn't kill them,

16
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,400
would you believe me?

17
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,640
The evidence is conclusive.

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,479
What explanation could you possibly have?

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Is this jade pendant yours?

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,320
This pendant...

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,420
Why was it in your possession?

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Just answer yes or no.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,640
Yes.

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,240
I found this on Caiyue.

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,320
How could a common maid have such an expensive jade pendant?

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,520
After investigating, I discovered this pendant indeed belongs to you.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,360
The murderer who killed my parents was wearing this pendant.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,640
What explanation do you have?

29
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,400
It's true that this pendant is mine.

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,000
But I lost it on my 18th birthday.

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
This jade pendant was commissioned by the master and mistress

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
from the best craftsman in the city for you.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,900
How could you possibly lose such an expensive pendant?

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,120
How am I supposed to believe you?

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,600
I don't care how many people misunderstand me out there,

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,760
but not you.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,120
I didn't come here expecting to leave alive anyway.

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,320
Do what you want with me.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm just curious,

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,240
how are you still alive?

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,960
Will you always be this good to me?

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Don't overthink it. Go to sleep.

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,680
If you call someone's name

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
and they avoid eye contact,

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
it means they're hiding something.

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,680
My mother told me that.

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Do you want me dead that badly?

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,560
Yes, you scum. You worthless piece of trash.

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,490
You should have been dead long ago.

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,480
You want me dead?

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
You want me dead?

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,040
I refuse to die.

53
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,839
Otherwise,

54
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
how would I torture you?

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,600
Guards!

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Yes.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,480
Lock her up.

58
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Without my permission,

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
no one is to let her out.

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,680
Yes.

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,840
Move.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,130
Young Master, you asked for me?

63
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,880
Close the door.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,160
Where did you get this jade pendant?

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,880
Young Master, this is a family heirloom of mine.

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,320
Nonsense.

67
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
Do you know who it belongs to?

68
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,240
I don't know.

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,480
How dare you.

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,280
You have the nerve to steal from me.

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,240
I didn't steal it.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,420
Please believe me, Young Master.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,680
This jade pendant

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,480
was a gift from my parents for my 18th birthday.

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,680
No wonder it disappeared that day.

76
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,760
So the thief was under my own roof.

77
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,040
What else have you stolen during your years in the Liu household?

78
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
You're wronging me, Young Master!

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
I truly haven't stolen anything.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Talk.

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,720
You know what I'm capable of.

82
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,690
It's been a while since I've shown my methods.

83
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,380
Today is a good opportunity to practice.

84
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,000
You've been stealing for years.

85
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,840
Even if my father found out, he wouldn't say anything.

86
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,560
Young Master, I'll talk! I'll talk!

87
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
Mother.

88
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,740
Your daughter is useless.

89
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,760
I couldn't avenge you.

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
Who's there?

91
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,960
Yiyu, it's me.

92
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,160
Yiyu.

93
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Why are you here?

94
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
To see me in such a miserable state?

95
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,440
Yiyu, how can you say that?

96
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,600
I brought you some food.

97
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
I heard from the servants

98
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,440
that my brother locked you up here.

99
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,570
I was worried, so I came to check on you.

100
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,130
You're still angry with me?

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
What are you doubting?

102
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
My feelings for you?

103
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,320
Go find your Miss Xu.

104
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,000
Why bother visiting someone as pathetic as me

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
and giving me explanations?

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,960
Yiyu.

107
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,480
My father worried that as heir, I wouldn't have enough power

108
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,720
to control the various family factions.

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,280
So he arranged a marriage alliance with the Yuncheng Commander's family.

110
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,440
But that's just for political advantage.

111
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I don't have feelings for Xu Shuyun.

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
You must believe me.

113
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,290
You're the only one in my heart.

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,780
What difference does it make?

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,880
It's all just an act between us.

116
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
Once I secure my position as head of the Liu family,

117
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,170
I'll break off the engagement.

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,720
Then we can truly be together.

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
Yiyu.

120
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
You must believe me.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,960
You're the only one I've ever loved.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
Liu Silin, that bastard,

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,450
how dare he lock you up in a place like this.

124
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,980
I won't let him get away with this.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
Yiyu,

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,160
let me get you out of here first.

127
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll explain everything later.

128
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,160
I think Liu Silin is coming. You should go.

129
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,720
Yiyu.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
I'll leave for now.

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,770
I'll find a way to rescue you later.

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
Sinan.

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
It's so late.

134
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,440
Why are you here?

135
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,080
That's right. I'm warning you,

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
if you bully Qian Yiyu again,

137
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
I won't let you off.

138
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
Please understand your current situation.

139
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,380
You're the Commander's future son-in-law.

140
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,880
Stop thinking about your sister-in-law.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm warning you for the last time.

142
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,320
My woman doesn't need your concern.

143
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
Tell me,

144
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,880
what if I tell your father about you secretly meeting Yiyu?

145
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,500
What would happen?

146
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
Liu Sinan came to rescue you,

147
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,780
why didn't you go with him?

148
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,520
All you men are the same,

149
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
for your own selfish interests,

150
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,410
you'd sacrifice anything.

151
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,520
What are you doing?

152
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
I told you before,

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,930
you're the only one who shouldn't wrongly accuse me.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,120
Young Master,

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
Young Mistress.

156
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,680
A few days ago,

157
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,240
a traveling merchant was selling this jade pendant at the door.

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,080
The price was very cheap.

159
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,090
That person specifically instructed not to reveal its source,

160
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
only to say it was a family heirloom,

161
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,680
because it was secretly taken from a wealthy household.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,880
I was tempted by the low price

163
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
and bought it when I saw it was genuine.

164
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
But, young master,

165
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
I truly didn't know it was yours.

166
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,080
Did you get a clear look at that person?

167
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,240
That person was wearing a large felt hat

168
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,960
that covered their face.

169
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,690
I couldn't see clearly.

170
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,880
Five years.

171
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,380
Finally returned to its rightful owner.

172
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,760
So, does this prove my innocence?

173
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,240
Do you remember where you lost your jade pendant?

174
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,880
At the Fulu Restaurant.

175
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
The banquet wasn't even over

176
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,290
when it couldn't be found anymore.

177
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,880
Because of this,

178
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,880
my father gave me a severe scolding.

179
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
Fulu Restaurant.

180
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Yu.
