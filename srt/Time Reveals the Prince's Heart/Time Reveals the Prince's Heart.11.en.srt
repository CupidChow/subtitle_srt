1
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,640
I can't believe she did something so ridiculous.

2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,200
I'm going to talk to her father right now.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,400
Actually, forget it.

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,380
I don't believe you dare to offend Commander Xu.

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Yiyu.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,040
Don't worry.

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,160
When I take control of the Liu family in the future,

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,220
I'll definitely get justice for you.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,440
Do you like the birthday gift I got for you?

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,760
I found the best tailor in the city

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,460
to custom-make this with the finest fabric.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,680
I think

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,760
you'll look beautiful in it.

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Young Master.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,800
Please don't come to see me unless necessary.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
After all, I'm married to your elder brother now.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,260
You should address me as sister-in-law.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,160
Yiyu, are you alright?

19
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,690
My wife doesn't need your concern, brother-in-law.

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,600
Let's go.

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
What's this?

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,080
Open it and see.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,820
Isn't it your birthday today?

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,810
Don't look anymore.

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Thank you.

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,850
I'm glad you like it.

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,180
You're still not well.

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,360
Rest a bit more.

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,040
Liu Silin.

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,840
What is it?

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
I want you to help me with something.

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,600
The truth about the Fulu Restaurant case from 10 years ago.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Extra! Extra!

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,560
The case at Fulu Restaurant from ten years ago!

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
By the looks of it.

36
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
The master won't make it through this winter.

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,420
Don't talk nonsense. Don't let the master hear you.

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,400
But the Second Young Master has been managing the business so well lately.

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
The master has nothing to worry about anymore.

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,560
That's true.

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,660
Everyone can see the Second Young Master's abilities.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
These are this month's accounts for the bank, dock, and medicine shop businesses.

43
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,890
Please review them.

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
No need to look.

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
You can handle it all.

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't worry, Father.

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Yes.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,400
The master truly has a son worthy of his father.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,880
The Liu family has a worthy successor indeed.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,560
Yes. Since the Second Young Master took over the business,

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,760
all the Liu family businesses have improved.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,490
Profits are increasing daily,

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,680
and we all have better prospects now.

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Sinan,

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,480
I have one more thing to tell you.

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,880
Father, please speak.

57
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,959
I'm listening.

58
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,399
Our Liu family

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,880
has been running legitimate businesses for generations.

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
You understand certain principles.

61
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,960
No matter how much money we could make,

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,040
illegal activities

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,560
are absolutely off-limits.

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Do you understand?

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
Father, rest assured.

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,780
I will follow your teachings.

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Good.

68
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,560
How is the Fulu Restaurant doing lately?

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,400
Since Chef Jiang Huai's incident,

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,570
no one has been able to make the restaurant's signature dishes.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,480
The revenue has been mediocre for years.

72
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,160
And lately, there's been no improvement.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
The First Young Master has mental illness after all.

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,780
His health is poor.

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
It's unrealistic to expect him to run the restaurant well.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
As long as he has something to do

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,000
and doesn't cause trouble,

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,440
that would be best.

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,000
Silin was such a bright child from a young age.

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,400
I had hoped he would bring honor to our family

81
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,440
and make the Liu family even more prosperous.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,560
I failed to guide him properly.

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,320
Now,

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
that he's willing to settle down,

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,680
I am truly relieved.

86
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,440
I hope he stays on the right path from now on.

87
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,040
His mother,

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,120
her spirit in heaven must be comforted too.

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
Though this restaurant is small,

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
it's still part of the Liu family's assets.

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,840
If he can manage it well,

92
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,160
perhaps he'll achieve greater things in the future.

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,960
Sinan.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,440
You wouldn't have to work so hard.

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Yes, Father.

96
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,840
Yiyu.

97
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
Are you feeling better?

99
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,600
Almost recovered.

100
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,880
Why are you here?

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm here to report to my father about the business over the past two months.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,000
What about you? Why are you here so late?

103
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,880
I also have important matters to report to the master.

104
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
What matters?

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,360
You'll find out soon enough.

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Watch out!

107
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Who are you?

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
Take off your mask.

109
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,960
Silin.

110
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
Doctor, how is he?

111
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Don't worry, madam.

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,040
The knife didn't hit any vital organs.

113
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
The young master is not in immediate danger.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,160
He just needs rest due to blood loss.

115
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,330
Alright. I understand. Thank you.

116
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,760
Why are you so foolish?

117
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Why did you take the knife for me?

118
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,760
I shouldn't have let you help me.

119
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,240
Liu Silin.

120
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,840
What is it?

121
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,680
I need your help with something.

122
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
I want you to spread a false rumor.

123
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
This way,

124
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,920
I can find my parents' real murderer.

125
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
Don't worry.

126
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
I won't die so easily.

127
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,000
You're awake. Have some water.

128
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080
Thank you.

129
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,920
I've let you down.

130
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,250
If you don't want me to take care of you,

132
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,320
then stop getting yourself hurt.

133
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Did they catch the culprit?

134
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,000
The servants chased him outside the mansion,

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,520
but he still got away.

136
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought we could finally find who really killed your parents.

137
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,120
Let's not think about this now.

138
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,220
We'll talk about it later.

139
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,120
If I had really died,

140
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,650
would you have been sad?

141
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,170
What nonsense are you talking?

142
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,520
Of course I would be sad.

143
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
But I won't allow you to die by someone else's hand.

144
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,760
You can leave these tasks to the servants from now on.

145
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,120
That assassin can easily enter the Liu residence.

146
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm afraid that...

147
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,050
Does it hurt?

148
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,000
No, it doesn't.

149
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,640
Promise me.

151
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,880
No matter who it's for in the future,

152
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,680
don't hurt yourself again.

153
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,250
Young master! Something terrible has happened!

154
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
What is it? Why are you so flustered?

155
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,920
The master! The master is dying!

156
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
What did you say?

157
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,120
Father, you can't abandon your son!

158
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,320
Father, wake up! Look at me!

159
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,000
It's me, Sinan, Father.

160
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
Young master.

161
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,780
He was fine yesterday.

162
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
How did this happen so suddenly?

163
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,880
I... I don't know.

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,520
What kind of doctor are you?

165
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,200
I swear I'll shoot you dead.

166
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,100
Young master, even if you kill me,

167
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm afraid your father is beyond saving.

168
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,210
Young master, please don't do anything rash!

169
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,520
Get out!

170
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,440
All of you, get out!

171
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
Yu.
