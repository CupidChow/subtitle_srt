1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,297
Ah, that's right.

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,375
It's not Friday.

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:06,296
Yes.

4
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:07,750
It's Thursday.

5
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:10,484
My apologies.

6
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:11,945
Yes.

7
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:23,726
Ichijou-san.

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,812
Did something happen with your girlfriend?

9
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:27,766
Huh?

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,219
You've always been amazing,
but now you're making mistakes.

11
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:33,190
So I thought something must have happened
over the weekend.

12
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,539
No. This is...

13
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,834
See you!

14
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,516
It's nothing.

15
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,625
Ichijou, sorry for being
strapped for cash last time.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,645
Stripped?

17
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,012
The 5,000 yen I borrowed the other day.

18
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:55,055
Thank you.

19
00:00:57,827 --> 00:00:59,059
You're welcome.

20
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,352
Thank you.

21
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,112
Hey, Ichijou.

22
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:11,980
What's on your mind? Bare it all to me.

23
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:13,163
Bare it all?

24
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:14,680
A heart-to-heart talk.

25
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:15,883
Open up to me.

26
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,062
I see.

27
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:19,850
My girlfriend is...

28
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:22,358
having a potluck party with
her guy friends.

29
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,702
It's definitely suspicious!

30
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:26,109
There are men who like cooking
these days, right?

31
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,984
No, that's not the point.

32
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,126
Why would she want to eat food made by other men?

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,461
Isn't that strange?

34
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:34,562
Why not?

35
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,936
So what if she likes to eat food?

36
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,844
What if she falls in love with someone else?

37
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:38,695
Huh?

38
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:40,999
What if they fall in love with her?

39
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:41,680
Huh?

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,258
Huh?

41
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,070
Could it be that...

42
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:51,086
Ichijou-san has never been jealous before?

43
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:54,562
I guess not.

44
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,070
Seriously?

45
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,661
I see.

46
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:04,046
I made a mistake, I shouldn't have
asked you since everyone loves you.

47
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,366
How nice. You never have
to worry about anything.

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,681
As if...

00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,061

52
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,515
The key.

53
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,273
Please keep it.

54
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:27,578
I just feel like it's better this way.

55
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,883
It's good to let everyone see!

56
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:43,695
Huh?

57
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,960
So beautiful, let's show off.

58
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:48,374
Hey, Ryu-san, what are you saying...

59
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:49,914
The potatoes.

60
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:53,375
Oh.

61
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:55,289
The potatoes.

62
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,172
What's wrong?

63
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,422
It's nothing.

64
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,477
Speaking of which,

65
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,647
how was Mizuchi's granddaughter?

66
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:10,710
Seems like she's left already.

67
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,468
We didn't get to talk.

68
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:15,367
Shall we cancel it?

Hello.

72
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,788
I guess no one's home.

73
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,406
(World heritage)
You haven't changed.

74
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,609

(Harrisa sauce, tajin powder)

77
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:55,882
And then.

78
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:59,030
I made it in time for the train.

79
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,757
When I sat down,

80
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,014
I realized that he was sitting next to me!

81
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:06,702
And we both bought the same boxed lunch!

82
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:08,194
Amazing.

83
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:09,546
That's why

84
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:15,577
that's why soulmates definitely exist,
connected to you somewhere in the world.

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,593
Is that true?

86
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:18,686
It is.

87
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:22,632
As long as they're really your
soulmate, then they'll definitely appear.

88
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:24,663
Do you get it?

89
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,606
Yes.

90
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,499
Mizuchi-san.

91
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,718
Could it be that he noticed?

92
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:42,554
Impossible.

93
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:55,156
I have no appetite.

94
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:11,132
That's it.

95

96
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,874
Ichijou-san's on fire today.

97
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:24,179
Yeah.

98
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:26,187
What happened?

99
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,225
(Miki fruit and vegetable store | Open)

100
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,429
What's important is

101
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,140
how casually you can talk.

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,710
You got this...

103
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:44,721

104
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,554

(Miki fruit and vegetable store | Open)

106
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,976
G-good morning.

107
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:50,679
Yes!

108
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,406
Good morning.

109
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:55,882
Well...

110
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:59,702
I was hoping to find a young
man wearing a red apron.

111
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:01,968
Mahiro?

112
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:04,015
He's off delivering now.

113
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,851
Is that so?

114
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,066
Do you know him?

115
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:12,851
Something like that.

116
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:16,288
Is he always the one

117
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,561
doing deliveries?

118
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,396
Yes.

119
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:22,296
I see.

120
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,070
So that's how it is.

121
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,823
Are you from Mizuchi-san's house?

122
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:29,749
Huh?

123
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,139
I heard from Mahiro.

124
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:33,850
- The other day...
- No!

125
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,343
Sorry.

126
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,780
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,351
Speak of the devil, he's coming back.

128
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:43,257
Oh.

129
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,757
Sir!

130
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,843
Ryu-san, what's wrong?

131
00:07:59,257 --> 00:07:59,952
Nothing.

132
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:02,484
We just had a customer...

133
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,398
Maybe I imagined it?

134
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,358
How strange.

135
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:18,788
What did he hear?

136
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,544
Was it about my naked dining?

137
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,788
He already told everyone?

138
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,007
No. Hold on.

139
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,007
Be natural.

140
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:33,327

Oh.

Okay. Be careful.

167
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,077

See you.

179
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:31,070
Wait.

180
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:35,023
These vegetables...

181
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:37,572
can you teach me how to prepare them?

182
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,210
Do you have time?

183
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,156

189

190

different from jarred stuff.

00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:26,273
(Corn tortillas)
they're made from corn flour.

194
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,601
This is the staple food of Mexico.

195
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:30,750
Is that so?

196
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:33,140
- That’s right...
- Also

197
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:34,462
the vegetables you mentioned earlier.

198
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:35,843
This is coriander.

199
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,216
It's called cilantro in Mexico.

200
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,218
Do you know how to say garlic there?

201
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:43,999
Huh?

202
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,045
"Aho" [Homonym for "idiot"]

203
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:45,974
Idiot?

204
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,095
Mizuchi-san taught me that.

205
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,256
She first asked me, "did you
buy any baka [dumbass]?"

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,663
Later, I looked it up

207
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,775
and then I realized what she
said was "vaca" [cow in Spanish].

208
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:58,778
Really?

209
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:03,468
She knew a lot about
old ruins all over the world.

210
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,640
When I making this dish,

211
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,523
she told me there are
also pyramids in Mexico.

212
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,210
The ones with the staircases?

213
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,679
Yes. I've heard about it.

214
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:13,554
There are 365 steps.

215
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:16,035
Maybe she read the world heritage book

216
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,204
that I left behind.

217
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:19,187
She had an insatiable curiosity.

218
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,734
She was warm and charming.

219
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:26,163
She was really cool.

220
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,983
- Please drink.
- Oh, thank you.

221
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,572
Oh, right.

222
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,937
You were surprised the other day, yes?

223
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:46,868
Huh?

224
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,704
No, well...

225
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,718
When you came to my house.

226
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,734
Oh.

227
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:58,304
Actually, at that time I
accidentally spilled tea all over.

228
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,173
I ended up getting my suit dirty.

229
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:03,460
That... I thought that was the case.

230
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,094
Did you get the stains out?

231
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:08,473
Yeah.

232
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,053
Great.

233
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:12,769
That's right,

234
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:15,521
the raw pepper that Mizuchi-san ordered

235
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:17,732
will arrive next month.

236
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:18,900
Next month?

237
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:21,152
They only ship once a year,

238
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:22,695
so it took a while.

239
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,323
I was wondering what to do with the order.

240
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,538
Then...

241
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:33,706
can we cancel it?

242
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:34,916
Huh?

243
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,921
This house might not be here for
much longer.

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,256
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,550
I see.

246
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:46,609
I got it.

247
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,641
You're going to cook pescado frito, right?

248
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,140
What about whitefish?

249
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,777
Didn't you buy it?

250
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,749
Let's go to the shop
in front of the station...

251
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,046
No, it's okay.

252
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,812
Huh?

253
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:08,975
But...

254
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,410
It's okay!

255
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:13,663
Aren’t you going to cook it?

256
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:17,041
Then why did you order these?

257
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,852
Then I'll bring it back.

258
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:38,694
- Let me pay...
- Don't be silly.

259
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,944
I don't know what you're trying to hide.

260
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,925
These vegetables might only

261
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,230
be worth a few hundred yen to you,

262
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,532
but for me,

263
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,701
they are hundreds of times
more important than your excuse.

264
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:58,718
I think it's important

265
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:02,624
to cherish things that others value.

266
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:07,147
I didn't think you were
this kind of person...

267
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,882
How naive.

268
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,108
I thought nothing had changed.

269
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,257
What am I doing...

270
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:50,426
I can only think about myself.

271
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:05,116
(Pescado frito with tajin
powder from Mexico)

272
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,881
(Couscous salad with
harissa sauce from Tunisia)

273
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:17,312
She knew a lot about
old ruins all over the world.

274
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:21,208
by living life without danger.

275
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,218
She said she didn't want to get rusty

276
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,154
without any adventures.

277
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,310
(Couscous salad with
harissa sauce from Tunisia)

278
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:33,874
Tunisia.

279
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:39,115
(Pescado frito with tajin
powder from Mexico)

280
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,726
Mexico.

281
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,770
Souta.

282
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:45,773
Do you remember that
there's a globe at my house?

283
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,651
Yes, there is.

284
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:52,572
I saw it and thought of
something interesting.

285
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,907
Sorry, Grandma.

286
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,701
I got a work call.

287
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:58,146
I'll call you later.

288
00:17:58,147 --> 00:17:59,184
Alright.

289
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,410
Don't overdo it.

290
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,013
Thank you.

291
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:08,646
That's right.

292
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:20,852
(World Heritage Sites)

293
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:25,021
So the next question is,
how many stairs are there?

294
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,155
Hmm.

295
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:32,028
I don't know. How many?

296
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:35,005
There are 365 steps!

297
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:36,824
Amazing!

298
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:38,302
365 steps!

299
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:41,051
I'm going to see this
place! Want to join me?

300
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,497
Of course!

301
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:45,028
Then, I'll take you.

302
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:46,232
Really?

303
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:49,489
I'll travel around the
world and have adventures,

304
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:51,748
and explore different kinds of things!

305
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:52,715
Really?

306
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:53,700
Then you definitely gotta do it!

307
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,176
- Yes.
- Yes.

308
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:59,138
Let's mark it. Where is it? Here?

309
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:00,556
- Here.
- Mexico.

310
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:03,544
- Let's go together.
- Yes.

311
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:11,011
(Mexico)

312
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,111
You said you'd go with me.

(Fresh pepper crab from Cambodia)

314
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,200
What are you doing?

315
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,567
Found him.

316
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:55,528
Hey...

317
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,030
Please

318
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,146
Please give me those
ingredients you just brought.

319
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:03,845
And...

320
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,891
and the spices my grandma ordered before,

321
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:08,820
sell me those too!

322
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:19,093
I...

323
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,300
only think of myself.

324
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,685
Even though I love Grandma so much,

325
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:32,356
lately, I've been forgetting many things.

326
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:39,029
But she never forgot my promise

327
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:43,206
to go on adventures with
her, she always wanted to go.

328
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,412
I know it's late.

329
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,706
But at least,

330
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,625
I want to see the cooking trip through,

331
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,421
the thing that Grandma
cherished until the end.

332
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,167
Grandma's wish,

333
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:04,472
I'll make it in the end.

334
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,895
So, please!

335
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,147
Sell me the ingredients!

336
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:16,837
If possible, please teach me how to cook.

337
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,653
I want to make every last dish.

338
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,793
Mizuchi-san and I

339
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,296
were working together here.

340
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:42,486
The coriander from earlier

341
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:46,388
was also grown from
seeds sown by Mizuchi-san.

342
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,184
I'm the worst grandson.

343
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:53,854
Well...

344
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,400
But you can change, can't you?

345
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:04,782
Huh?

346
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,327
You noticed it, so...

347
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,044
I'll do it, too.

348
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,380
Let me help you.

349
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,090
It'll dirty your suit.

350
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,967
Who cares.

351
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:48,367
Thank you.

352
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:01,839
Weeds need to be pulled from their roots.

353
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:06,510
Yes.

354
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:10,264
Grandma.

355
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:11,599
I finally feel...

356
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:16,205
From this day forward, It seems
like I've finally started to change.

360

Ichijou-san, what should I do?

361
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:26,837
You look so happy.

362
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,101
Is your lover alright?

363
00:23:28,126 --> 00:23:30,117
You seem to get along with your lover.

364
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,369
I'd like to get to know him better.

365
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:35,873
(Gone)
Is there a quiz today?

366
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,458
I don't know. Ask Ichijou.

367
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:39,335
Ichijou, you listening?

368
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:40,630
Oh, yeah.

369
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,047
Is there a quiz today?

370
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,021
