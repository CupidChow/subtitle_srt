- Those two!
- Exactly!

5
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:07,687
It's a fateful reunion

00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:09,093
with his ex-boyfriend!

7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,711
Ex-boyfriend!?

is called jealousy.

13

Jealousy...?

That means he

75
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:52,188
was the former staff member in charge!

76
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:56,453

96

Oh come on!

98
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:43,618
Haven't I grown up a bit?

99
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,679
Really?

100
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,859
Qian ren...

101
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,510
I see, an ex-boyfriend.

102
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,180
It was a misunderstanding on your part?

103
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,227
Exactly! I'm sorry!

104
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:07,834

105
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:11,133
Well, I guess I'll go then.

106
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,609
Kousuke, I'm sorry about earlier.

107
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:14,866
If you'd like,

108
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,711
you two can come to my wedding.

I wish you happiness.

110

Oh, right!

111
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,313
I'll return to the shop.

112
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:47,961
Um, Souta-kun...

113
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,086
I'm really sorry.

00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:16,953
Yeah.

119
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,641
Don't laugh.

120
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,563
I said it in the heat of the moment...

121
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,883
I finally realized, I like you.

122
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:38,859
Yeah.

123
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,414
Ah!

124
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,008
I should probably

125
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,133
start heading back to the shop.

126
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:56,765
Wait!

127
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,766
Shimizu-san.

128
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:40,354
Umm...

129
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:43,882
Here.

130
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:53,719
About earlier,

131
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,883
I'm really sorry.

132
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,313
Thanks to Shimizu-san,

133
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,117
I was finally

134
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,515
able to be honest with my feelings.

135
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:12,383
I'm really grateful.

136
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,078
I truly...

137
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:18,281
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:24,203
It's your first love, isn't it?

139
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,539
Huh?

140
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,969
I always thought something was off.

141
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:31,891
Remember when you said before

142
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:34,688
that you've never felt jealous?

143
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:36,859
Yeah...

144
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,133
I thought maybe

145
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:44,125
you hadn't experienced true love yet.

146
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,398
So,

147
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,085
this is your first love, right?

148
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,445
Maybe...

149
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,406
Yeah.

150
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:01,242
Well,

151
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:03,492
then our relationship starts

152
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,008
from a clean slate!

153
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:08,047
I mean,

154
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:11,578
it was originally my whimsical idea.

155
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:15,469
Thank you for being

156
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,437
with me until now.

157
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,773
Me too.

158
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,156
Thank you so much.

159
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:30,859
I'm off then.

160
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,383
Bye bye, Sou-chan!

161
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,406
What's with that nickname?

162
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,086
This will be the last time!

163
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,422
Bye bye, Sou-chan.

164
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,891
Souta! Welcome back!

165
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,516
I'm home.

166
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,703
What's wrong?

167
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,133
It's just that...

168
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:58,922
I think it's nice.

169
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:00,789
You mean...

170
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,648
When you say

171
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,544
"welcome back.".

172
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:09,664
You're exaggerating!

173
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:10,719
Hey.

174
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,695
You should join in too. Let's clean!

175
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:13,984
Sure.

176
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,461
Alright.

177
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,086
There's no area to clean.

178
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,007
(Suki naam and Thai suki sauce)

179
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,266
(Egyptian dukkah crusted
chicken from Egypt)

180
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,266
We sure made a lot.

181
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:42,750
Our food trip,

182
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,516
we just need one more dish.

183
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:46,820
(Fresh pepper crab from Cambodia)

184
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:49,094
As for this,

185
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,445
it hasn't arrived yet.

186
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,055
The final ingredient, fresh peppers.

187
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,382
Is that so?

188
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,438
Yeah.

189
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,969
Look like it will arrive next week.

190
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,054
I see.

191
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:02,438
No cooking this week then...

192
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:06,922
How about this?

193
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:09,688
Today...

194
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,922
Don't be so sure.

195
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,952
Huh?

196
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,607
Thank you all for participating

197
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:23,108
in the annual kimchi-making experience!

198
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,242
Alright!

199
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,078
Let's make delicious kimchi

200
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,515
using freshly harvested cabbages!

201
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:31,773
Great!

202
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:32,892
So exciting!

203
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:44,757
Is it big?

204
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,109
So heavy.

205
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,382
What a good harvest this year.

206
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,906
For the cabbage,

207
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,992
you tilt the outer leaves like this.

208
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,421
The root right? Oh, I got it.

209
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,898
I'll pull it.

210
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:03,070
Souta! Are you okay?

211
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:04,922
Sorry.

212
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:05,930
Be careful, alright?

213
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:09,742
Please?

214
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:14,461
Alright.

215
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,930
Souta, here.

216
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:21,430
Huh?

217
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,289
Here, right here.

218
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,469
That's not it.

219
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:38,664
Satoshi.

220
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,695
Yes!

221
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,938
Souta, what's wrong?

222
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,047
It's nothing,

223
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:00,156
really.

224
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:09,631
Keep on cutting it.

225
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,781
Once you're done...

226
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,490
- Oh!
- Oh!

227
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,328
Beautiful.

228
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,438
While it's fermenting,

229
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,898
Let's turn the radishes into yangnyeom.

230
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,258
Yangnyeom, as in

231
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:36,967
the sauce for yangnyeom chicken?

232
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,148
Sweet and spicy,

233
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:38,835
right?

234
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,421
Originally, yangnyeom means

235
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,117
a method of seasoning.

236
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,216
This time we'll make yangnyeom,

237
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,678
the base of kimchi,

238
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,406
which is spicy and full of umami.

239
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:57,828
Alright.

240
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,203
Oh!

241
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,555
You've gotten better at handling it.

242
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,492
Right?

243
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,054
The sweetness in the yangnyeom

244
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,148
comes from the apple?

245
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:06,695
Yeah.

246
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:09,687
Sometimes pears and honey are also used.

247
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:10,836
Wow.

248
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,820
Ever cut an apple before?

249
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:14,969
No.

250
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,375
Let me show you.

251
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,039
- Let me try too! Teach me.
- Sure.

252
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:24,890
Alright.

253
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,593
Turn it upside down and cut it.

254
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,625
Turn it upside down.

255
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:30,914
Yes!

256
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,305
- I did it!
- Good job.

257
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,163
And then cut to the other side.

258
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,124
The other side.

259
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,234
- Like this?
- Yes.

260
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:40,624
Oh.

261
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:50,336
Don't you two seem quite close?

262
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,742
Perhaps... the two of you...

263
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,804
You two are dating, right?

264
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,250
I had a feeling!

265
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,476
You look good together!

266
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,460
Well?

267
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:21,133
Yes.

268
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,906
Mahiro and I are dating.

269
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,054
I knew it!

270
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,060
Mizuchi-chan is probably delighted

271
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,913
in heaven, isn't she?

272
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,460
Mizuchi-chan adored Mahiro

273
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:35,757
like her own grandchild, after all.

274
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:36,828
Yes!

275
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,172
It's a good thing!

276
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,351
When?

277
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,359
Not too long ago.

278
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,516
The two of them

279
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:42,742
have me

280
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,116
as their cupid~

281
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,180
Good job!

282
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:47,828
Lovey-dovey!

283
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,023
Hey, Satoshi!

284
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,906
Riho-san...

285
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:54,586
has a child?

286
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,015
Let me introduce him.

287
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,023
This is my son, Satoshi,

288
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,265
and my daughter, Riko.

289
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,219
And this is my husband...

290
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,626
I'm Kenji. Thanks for
already looking out for her.

291
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,201
Oh, they're married...

292
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,406
Yeah.

293
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,742
I shouldn't have gotten jealous.

294
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,273
Huh?

295
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,914
Yes! Looking great!

296
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:19,523
Good job.

297
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:24,748
A bit more.

298
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:26,210
That's no good.

299
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:29,139
Souta sucks.

300
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,625
Be careful, it'll get in your eyes.

301
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,398
Good job.

302
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:48,758
Apply thoroughly.

303
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:55,844
Wow, today's feast is amazing!

304
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,133
But we can't eat the kimchi yet.

305
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:02,469
That's right,

306
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,617
it's best to eat it after

307
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,953
three days of marinating.

308
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,906
So, shall we make something with this?

309
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,711
How about yangnyeom toast?

310
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:13,023
Toast?

311
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:15,460
Or we can make yangnyeom natto rice.

312
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,742
- Natto rice?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,397
Yangnyeom sauce surprisingly

314
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:19,874
goes well with many things.

315
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,367
Which one do you prefer?

316
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:23,336
Both.

317
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:24,615
Alright.

318
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,695
For yangnyeom toast,

319
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,992
you mix the sauce with shredded cabbage

320
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,874
and spread it on top of the toast.

321
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,257
Then add cheese and bake it.

322
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:35,632
It's so simple!

323
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,023
And the yangnyeom natto rice

324
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:39,328
is even easier.

325
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,382
Just mix the natto with yangnyeom sauce

326
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,898
and pour it over the rice.

327
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:50,593
Let me have a taste.

328
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:53,750
I guess there's no helping it.

329
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:55,250
Aah...

330
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,078
Ahh!

331
00:18:57,258 --> 00:18:58,203
Huh?

332
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,523
Alright.

333
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,469
Delicious.

334
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,250
Yeah.

335
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:09,773
That one is good too.

336
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:10,617
Yeah.

337
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,336
Aah...

338
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:21,836
Delicious?

339
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:22,711
Yeah.

340
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,008
It tastes good.

341
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,852
On your mouth.

342
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,297
Embarrassed?

343
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:36,265
Of course not!

344
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,210
Cut it out!

345
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,671
Is it still here?

346
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:41,054
- No.
- Good then.

347
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,515
- Oh, here it is.
- Stop it.

348
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,257
Looks delicious!

349
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:00,507
Shall we start eating then?

350
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:16,461
Are you sure?

351
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:18,516
Not taking it off.

352
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:20,875
Huh?

353
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,867
Even when we first met...

354
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,422
Souta,

355
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,484
when you eat,

356
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,294
do you...?

357
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:43,898
No,

358
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:45,469
I mean, that was...

359
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,227
just a stain on my clothes.

360
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:48,179
Really?

361
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,727
And even when.

362
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:53,445
Komachi-chan came for the first time...

363
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:57,383
No.

364
00:20:57,492 --> 00:20:58,508
This is...

365
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:00,383
I'm just changing before eating.

366
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,258
So yeah...

367
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:06,227
It's just...

368
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:09,633
It's not a big deal, is it?

369
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:12,703
Huh?

370
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,563
It's like

371
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,960
drinking coffee milk

372
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,665
naked at a public bath.

373
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:21,859
It seems liberating.

374
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:25,672
It's okay, isn't it?

375
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,609
No lies between us.

376
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,953
You can eat however you like.

377
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:43,323
I...

378
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,679
Is it starting now?

379
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:47,953
Huh?

380
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,727
In front of you...

381
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:54,670
Can I take my clothes off?

382
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,016
Yeah.

383
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,016
Wait a moment.

384
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:21,445
Yes, Section chief.

385
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:23,484
Yes.

386
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,563
Huh?

387
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:31,938
Right now?

388
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:36,781
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:39,125
It's okay,

390
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,555
it's your work.

391
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,727
It's not a big issue.

392
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:45,094
I'll be back in the evening,
wait for me.

393
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:46,031
Yeah.

394
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,344
Then...

395
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,719
I'm off.

396
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,070
Take care.

397
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,859
At that time,

398
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,594
I had absolutely no expectations.

399
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:16,561
I never imagined that Mahiro and I...

400
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,172
That Souta and I...

401
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:23,344
- would end up like this.
- Would end up like this.

402
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,406
(Next episode)

403
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:38,843
I have something important to say.

404
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:41,484
Are you going to sell
Mizuchi-chan's house?

405
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:43,914
I thought you wouldn't ever come back.

406
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,484
Things that excite me,

407
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,228
I actually want to try going.

408
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,420
If you're going to chase

409
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:49,187
after your dream,

410
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,256
I'll support you.

411
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,086
Stay safe.
