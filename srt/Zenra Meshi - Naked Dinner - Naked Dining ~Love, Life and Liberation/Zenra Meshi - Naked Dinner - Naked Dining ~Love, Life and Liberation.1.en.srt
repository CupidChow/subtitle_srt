When stress builds up,

2
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:04,711
how do you relieve it?

3
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:07,585
Go all out at karaoke?

4
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:09,078
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,266
Not bad.

6
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,170
Of course there are sports, too.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,063
In my case, it was eating.

8
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,229
That was it...

9
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,986
Until that disastrous encounter.

12
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,107
it's "Sanisani".

13
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,346
No matter

14
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,760
how you look at it,

15
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,619
(Sansan-chan)
it must be 'n'!

16
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,857
Sansan?

17
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:08,110
- Sasosasosa.

18
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:09,319
What is it today?

He's been struggling to
read the draft for 20 minutes.

20

- Sanisani-chan.

21
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:14,985
What is this?

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,159
- Section chief.

23
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,143
Sorry for disturbing you.

24
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,557
I'm busy right now.

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,751
We got two versions of the
upcoming PR magazine cover.

26
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:25,132
Which one do you prefer? The
art director wanted you to decide.

27
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:27,147
Last time,

28
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:31,616
you gave us a great idea, so they want
to borrow your wisdom again this time.

29

30
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,557

31
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,331
As soon as possible, please.

32
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:43,815
It can't be helped.

33
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,147
Thank you.

34
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,799
Thank you, Ichijou. You really saved me.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,861
Geez, you should know how already.

36
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:56,319
As expected of Ichijou-san.

37
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,780
You're my role model.

38
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:00,370
Ichijou.

39
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:04,130

a productive member of society.

(No worries, I got this!)

41
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:15,177
- This is my daily routine.

42
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,142

43
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,536

48

OK.

49
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,643
But.

50
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,938
I can’t tell anyone about this.

51
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,273
Because...

52
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,652
Bon appetit.

53
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,060

Stripping away everything and

55
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,634
focusing all my senses on my taste buds

56
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:52,108
to savor the joy!

57
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,697

58
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,510

Why.

This is...

73
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,847
I found some of your belongings in the closet.

74

Please come and visit once in a while.

Shall I go?

99

Now that I think about it.

100
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,810
When she wrote that letter,

101

102

that her time was running short.

103

And

104
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,583
that I...

105
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,492
was exhausted from such a dull lifestyle.

106
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,955

117
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,987

What are you doing in someone else's house,
you thief!

136

You're the thief!

Well then, why don't you try
opening that shelf over there?

What does that mean?

167
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:18,896
Her knees got bad.

169
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:26,868
We only saw each other...

through video calls...

171
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,040
Still,

172
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,585
she kept trying new things constantly.

173
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:41,734
She said she didn't want to get rusty

174
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,008
by living life without danger.

175
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,728

asking to come clean up.

Please take it.

192
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,579
It's just a flesh wound, no worries.

193
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:02,837
The key.

194
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,006
Please keep it.

195
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,550
I just feel like...

196
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,971
It's better this way.

197
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,577
Is this really happening?

198
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,511
Is there really no instant ramen here?

199
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,765
I thought there would be...

200
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:10,613
(Cuisine Trip 2022)

201
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,247
(Couscous salad with Harissa sauce)
Harissa sauce?

202
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,667
The tour departure begins in Tunisia.

203
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,458
The breeze carried by the Harissa sauce

204
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:26,850
evokes the coastal scenery

205
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,319
of the Mediterranean sea.

206
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,348
(Miki fruit and vegetable store | Open)

207
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:45,442
- Hey...
- Yes?

208
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,185
Do you have a salad?

209
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:48,616
- Salad?
- Yes.

210
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,411
We don't have that sort of thing.

211
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:52,989
You...

212
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,274
There's many different kinds of vegetables, though.

213
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,230
Well, I think it's called Harissa...

214
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,415
I'd like to eat it with a salad.

215
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:04,792
Is that so?

216
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:19,640
Alright, here.

217
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:21,310
And...

218
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,146
Couscous.

219
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:26,897
This is from Tunisia.

220
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:29,567
This is...

221
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,360
A very small grain.

222
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,454
A staple food in Tunisia.

223
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,115
Is that so?

224
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,787
I wonder if I can make this.

225
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,110
I've only ever made instant noodles.

226
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,832
Why don't you give it a try?

227
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,872
"Trying it out" is the most important spice.

228
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:50,421
Most of the time it won't be a huge failure.

229
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:53,076
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,511
Here.

231
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,476
Thank you.

232
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,560
That will be 970 yen.

233
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,875
Oh, right...

234
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:10,941
Mahiro.

235
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,330
Please have some tom yum kung!

236
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:14,723
Are you sure, Nueng?

237
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:15,887
Thank you.

238
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,833
It's fine.

239
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,615
Also, can I get
some "gapao"?

240
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:20,772
- Basil, right?
- Yes.

241
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:22,274
Okay. When do you need it?

242
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:27,309
- Lets see, how much do I need...
(Send fresh peppers to Auntie Mizuchi next month)

243
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:33,161
(Couscous salad with Harissa sauce)

244
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:37,927
Add suitable amounts of salt
and olive oil.

245
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:41,188
Pour in boiling water,

246
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,723
mix it,

247
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,364
then cover with plastic wrap.

248
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,480
Is this really okay?

249
00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:54,944
In the meantime, wash the vegetables

250
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,821
and slice them up.

251
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:19,363
Finish it off with

252
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,452
fresh mint?

253
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:30,450
(Mint)

254
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,483
So fragrant.

255
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,948
Place it on the top...

256
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,667
Two spoonfuls of Harissa sauce in there.

257
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,260
Finished.

258
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,430
All done.

259
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,934
Really? It's that simple?

260
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:14,106
Now then...

261
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,152
Let's do it.

262
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,548
Bon appetit.

263
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,650
Breeze from Tunisia?

264
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,659
Not as spicy as I expected.

265
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:07,701
Oh?

266
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,039
It's a bit like curry.

267
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:14,083
But I like it a lot.

268
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:23,425
The couscous is great.

269
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:24,844
I quite like it.

270
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,160
The feeling of liberation from naked dining...

271
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,349
Not just that!

272
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,726
What is this excitement?

273
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,019
Happiness!

274
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,673
I'm so happy!

275
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,705
No...

276
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:57,868
You see...

277
00:22:57,896 --> 00:22:59,808
I rang the doorbell but no one answered,

278
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,566
so I was wondering if something happened.

279
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,465
No. This is...

280
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,675
See you!

281
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:14,776
I'll definitely be seen as a freak now.

282
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,067
What should I go?

283
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:22,852
(Memory)
Let's go to the cafeteria?

284
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:23,986
Let's go.

285
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,457
There's a limited-time sale today.

286
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,324
Really?

287
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:28,122
Sausage.

288
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,403
- You forgot?
- I forgot.

289
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:30,784
- Let's go.
- Want to go together?

290
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:31,952
Before it's sold out.

291
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:32,729
Really?

292
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:34,204
- Oh you.
- Completely forgot.

293
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,456
Oh dear, Ichijou.

294
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,707
Seriously?

295
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:40,253
(Next episode) You told
someone about my naked dining?

296
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,372
Stop playing around.

297
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:44,048
Aren't you jealous, Mr. Ichijou?

298
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:46,091
Don't tell me you remember?

299
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,990
You'll definitely meet your Mr. Right.

300
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:52,790
(This is a work of fiction.)
