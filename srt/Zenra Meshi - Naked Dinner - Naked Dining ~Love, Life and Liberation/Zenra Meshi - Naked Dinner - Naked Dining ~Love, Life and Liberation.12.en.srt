1
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,999
"Naked Dining"

2
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:22,976
"Final Episode
Room with shirts and fresh peppers"

3
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:24,656
(I'm going abroad)

4
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,578
(It's so sudden.
When are you leaving?)

5
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,687
(You're already overseas?)

6
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,242
It's been a week already, right?

7
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:40,867
It's strange.

8
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,180
Yeah...

9
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:49,037
The amount of work Ichijou

10
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:50,371
had is unbelievable!

11
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:51,551
How many people's work

12
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,974
was he doing all by himself?

13
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:03,214
Hello, this is Kasuga from

14
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,317
the PR Department.

15
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:05,770
This is Miki Mahiro from

16
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,427
Miki fruit and vegetable store.

17
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,531
Oh, Mahiro-kun?

18
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,379
If it's Ichijou, he's enjoying

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,591
himself in Singapore.

20
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,210
What's up?

21
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:16,342
I wanted to get in touch

22
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,232
about this weekend's matter.

23
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,430
The weekend?

24
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:21,549
That might be impossible.

25
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:22,854
Not just the weekend either.

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,107
Rumor has it that he

27
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,796
might not even come back.

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,893
For good?

29
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:27,635
Yeah.

30
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:30,449
He seems to be having a great time.

31
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,018
But I'm going crazy here.

32
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34,307
Kasuga-san, the meeting is starting!

33
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:35,604
Oh no! Talk to you later!

34
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:43,128
Hello.

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,268
Hello.

36
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,705
Ah, it's Mr. Something Trading, right?

37
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:48,220
Hello.

38
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,236
Yep! Charmochamoi Marage Trading here.

39
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:51,495
Guess what?

40
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:53,260
The fresh peppers
have arrived after a year!

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,526
Ah!

42
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,010
- Takura-san.
- Mahiro-kun.

43
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,542
Look at this.

44
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:07,831
Mahiro.

45
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,611
That is...

46
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,885
Timing

47
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,643
can be really tricky, huh?

48
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:22,448
Yoshiko-san.

49
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,417
I brought the ordered items.

50
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:25,525
Mahiro.

51
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,338
Including the ones from the fishmonger.

52
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,823
I see, thank you as always.

53
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:33,002
Mahiro-kun, how's it going with him?

54
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,542
Are things going well?

55
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:36,073
Yeah,

56
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,096
it's okay.

57
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,305
In that case,

58
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,997
why don't you two live together there?

59
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:43,204
Is he still going to sell

60
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,029
Mizuchi's house after all?

61
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:49,204
There are various circumstances,

62
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,229
I suppose.

63
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,026
I hope it gets bought by a good person,

64
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,792
but it feels a bit lonely, you know?

65
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,737
This time,

66
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:00,907
it's really goodbye to

67
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,524
Mizuchi-chan, huh?

68
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:20,846
I want to see through the cooking trip

69
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,854
that Grandma cherished until the end.

70
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:29,721
Scary!

71
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,432
Don't laugh!

72
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:36,331
Mahiro.

73
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,792
I like Mahiro.

74
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:25,901
Souta-kun

75
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:28,276
is going overseas, right?

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,503
What about you?

77
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:35,651
What are you going to do?

78
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,768
If it's about the shop

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,370
or about the omusubi field association,

80
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:47,963
you can leave it to me.

81
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:52,760
He's your destiny,

82
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:54,674
right?

83
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,057
Earlier,

84
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,260
when I went to Mizuchi-san's house,

85
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:06,487
it reminded me of

86
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,487
something from our high school days.

87
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,573
Is there anything you

88
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:13,971
want to do in the future?

89
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,229
I hope I can...

90
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,190
contribute to connecting Japan

91
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:21,838
and the world.

92
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,487
Connecting Japan and the world?

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,456
Amazing.

94
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,456
That's a big dream.

95
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:31,752
A big dream?

96
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,799
If that dream can come true,

97
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:38,323
then I want to support him.

98
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:41,190
That's why

99
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:43,689
I've decided to see him

100
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:44,877
off with a smile.

101
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:50,909
Won't you regret it?

102
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:55,495
Yeah.

103
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:02,330
I told you

104
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,518
that it's Sani-sani-chan.

105
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:05,909
Writing this way

106
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,651
it's read as Saso-saso-chan, right?

107
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,080
Geez,

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,456
if you don't grow up,

109
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,072
- They never learn...
- it reflects poorly on my abilities.

110
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:24,924
Ichijou-san!

111
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,456
Welcome back!

112
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,854
You've finally returned, huh?

113
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,649
Without you, everything was in chaos...

114
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,400
Section chief,

115
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:35,091
may I have a moment?

116
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:36,896
Huh?

117
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:42,755
- Thank you very much!
- I'll be back.

118
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,779
I'm back.

119
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,411
He's back.

120
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,849
Sorry for not replying for a while.

121
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,521
I have something important to discuss.

122
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,286
Can we meet at Grandma's house?

123
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,724
You got this, no worries!

124
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:29,755
You got this, no worries!

125
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:37,021
Take your time.

126
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:38,693
Thank you.

127
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,794
- I'm off then.
- Alright.

128
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:46,997
Do your best!

129
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:48,302
Mahiro.

130
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:08,747
It's been a while.

131
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:10,865
Yeah.

132
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:12,872
I'm sorry for

133
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,693
leaving your texts unanswered.

134
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,138
I forgot to bring my own phone.

135
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:21,417
I thought it might be

136
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:22,582
something like that.

137
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,326
I wasn't worried at all.

138
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,036
That's a relief.

139
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:29,240
I thought you might be angry.

140
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,255
What did you want to talk about?

141
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,240
It's...

142
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:44,302
You see...

143
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,646
Excuse me.

144
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,560
We saw the sign outside

145
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,326
and we wondered

146
00:08:58,576 --> 00:09:01,083
if we could take a look inside?

147
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:03,326
Yes.

148
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:04,638
Please come in.

149
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:05,771
Excuse me.

150
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:12,552
It's a lovely home.

151
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,278
You can tell at a glance

152
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,103
that it's well-maintained.

153
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,560
We're actually planning

154
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:24,435
to live together as a couple and

155
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,199
we've been looking for

156
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:28,028
a home in this area.

157
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:30,560
I see.

158
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,076
Actually,

159
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,771
we're not actually a married couple.

160
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:41,560
We were classmates in junior high,

161
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,661
and we just recently got together.

162
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,208
Life has

163
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:50,630
a way of surprising you, doesn't it?

164
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:53,208
We don't need

165
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:55,622
to conform to societal expectations

166
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,301
at this point in our lives,

167
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,216
but we want to live

168
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,411
each day together.

169
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:04,755
That sounds wonderful.

170
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:10,732
However,

171
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,388
I'm sorry,

172
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,646
but I can't

173
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:18,497
sell this place.

174
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:20,466
Eh? Souta?

175
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,302
Actually, I've decided

176
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,013
to stop selling this place

177
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,161
and turn it into a cafe.

178
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:27,115
Huh?

179
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,232
I want to

180
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,169
create a place

181
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,208
where people who visit this town

182
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:35,896
can easily drop by

183
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,099
and spend time with the locals.

184
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,302
And someday,

185
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,841
I hope to turn this place

186
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,801
into a destination that attracts

187
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:46,387
people from all over the world.

188
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,591
That's my dream.

189
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,341
I hope I can contribute to connecting

190
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,989
Japan and the world.

191
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,224
So,

192
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,888
does that mean this house will remain?

193
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:01,919
Yes.

194
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,974
I have no plans to demolish it.

195
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,443
Please make it happen.

196
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,505
We'll come back when that time comes,

197
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,318
the two of us.

198
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,701
Thank you very much.

199
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,880
I wish you happiness.

200
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:40,466
Excuse me...

201
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:51,451
Nothing.

202
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,083
Please take care.

203
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:13,701
Those people...

204
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:18,208
Mahiro.

205
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,466
Opening a café,

206
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:23,654
what do you mean?

207
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,302
I mean,

208
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:28,380
like I said earlier,

209
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:30,638
Aren't you going to move to work abroad?

210
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:33,747
The opportunity was there,

211
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,177
but I turned it down.

212
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:38,615
Huh?

213
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:39,973
I'm resigning from

214
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,137
the Financial Services Agency.

215
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:42,529
I've already informed the section chief.

216
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:43,607
Huh?

217
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,387
You've never mentioned it even once!

218
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,302
It's because it's an important matter

219
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,933
that I wanted to talk to you in person.

220
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,536
Didn't you want to work in a job

221
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,364
that connects Japan and the world?

222
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:57,544
That's why we can start it here!

223
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:02,115
What do you mean?

224
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:04,857
I don't understand anymore...

225
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:19,169
While I was in Singapore,

226
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:23,372
I thought about you every day...

227
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:26,435
But

228
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,161
if I heard your voice,

229
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,068
I'd surely yearn for you.

230
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:35,247
So I held it in until I returned.

231
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:39,044
And at that moment,

232
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,794
I saw them in the supermarket,

233
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:44,997
strawberries

234
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,646
from Chiba Prefecture.

235
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:54,740
They made me so nostalgic

236
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,302
and happy.

237
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,521
It was then

238
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,653
that I finally understood

239
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:06,145
the meaning of what you were doing.

240
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,966
You were growing vegetables

241
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:12,216
from different countries

242
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:15,083
for people from all over the world

243
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:17,076
that are living here.

244
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,831
Working overseas isn't the only way

245
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,915
to connect Japan and the world.

246
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:26,888
Just like how you can bring

247
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:29,872
people together

248
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:33,551
here with something delicious,

249
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:35,987
it's also one way to connect

250
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:37,276
Japan and the world.

251
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,880
At this point,

252
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,810
I wanted to live honestly,

253
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,099
pursuing what excites me here.

254
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,192
You can do whatever you want.

255
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,029
No,

256
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:19,005
I won't let you go.

257
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,185
I've already caught you.

258
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:42,005
(Cambodian food)
Chaa muk marei kuchai.

259
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,341
Stir-fried squid with fresh pepper?

260
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,521
This is

261
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,943
fresh pepper.

262
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,918
Wow... it's green.

263
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:53,559
Yeah.

264
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,482
Unlike regular pepper, it's not dried.

265
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:58,270
That's why it's only available

266
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,778
during a limited time.

267
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,919
So that's why Grandma couldn't make it.

268
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:03,865
Yeah.

269
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,380
(No discord, no concord)

270
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,193
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

271
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,974
Are water lily vegetables

272
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,536
available here?

273
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:26,451
Water lily vegetables?

274
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,138
Yes.

275
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:28,490
No problem.

276
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:29,911
We can find them.

277
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,099
Oh...

278
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,185
You are...

279
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:33,724
I'm Taiwanese.

280
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,763
- Really?
- Yes.

281
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:36,083
I'm from Dalian.

282
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:37,279
Dalian?

283
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,164
Yes.

284
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,927
Sorry for making you work on Saturday.

285
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,923
I couldn't reach Kasuga-kun.

286
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:49,857
No problem.

287
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,955
Are you

288
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,966
okay with

289
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,614
Ichijou-kun resigning?

290
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:04,724
No problem.

291
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,083
Is that so?

292
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,153
But...

293
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:12,450
I can't interfere

294
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,155
in other people's lives.

295
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,380
I have no relationship

296
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:16,856
with him whatsoever.

297
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,216
Huh?

298
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,474
Aren't you two dating...?

299
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,372
It's obviously not like that.

300
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,365
And that's why

301
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,169
the chief scolds you for not

302
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:29,177
properly managing your subordinates.

303
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,091
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:35,630
And

305
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:39,068
this evening,

306
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,701
please accompany me.

307
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:42,740
Huh?

308
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,263
I feel like

309
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,247
practicing intensely.

310
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,224
You mean badminton?

311
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:49,372
No holding back.

312
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,481
I've participated in the

313
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:52,419
national high school championships.

314
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:53,443
What?

315
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:55,333
Sorry,

316
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:57,779
I didn't see your calls.

317
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,818
- You're so late, Kasuga.
- You're so late, Kasuga.

318
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:02,935
Huh?

319
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:04,943
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

320
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:19,426
(Miki fruit and vegetable store | Open)

321
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:20,099
Today,

322
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:22,602
I'd better close the shop early.

323
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:27,646
The final dish is chaa muk marei kuchai.

324
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:38,740
Fresh pepper goes in first?

325
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,761
Yeah. We want to

326
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,950
transfer the spiciness

327
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:42,341
and fragrance into the oil.

328
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:45,482
Ah,

329
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:46,583
it smells good.

330
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:48,106
Once the aroma comes out,

331
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,184
the color becomes vibrant,

332
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,044
we'll take out the fresh pepper.

333
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,755
Alright.

334
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:55,958
Then stir-fry the ginger and vegetables.

335
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,305
- Add onions.
- Sure.

336
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,138
For the squid and shrimp,

337
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,661
we need to stir-fry them quickly,

338
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,129
or the meat will become tough.

339
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:08,653
Yeah.

340
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,505
And the seasonings...

341
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,380
Add oyster sauce.

342
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,388
And fish sauce.

343
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,388
Add back the fresh pepper

344
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,372
and stir-fry everything together.

345
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,340
You got this, no worries!

346
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,669
How tricky.

347
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:50,685
Want me to do it?

348
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:51,544
Sure.

349
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,341
So difficult.

350
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,115
What language is 'DUY'?

351
00:19:58,404 --> 00:19:59,240
What does it mean?

352
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:00,583
Oh.

353
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,169
Did I say that?

354
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:03,076
Yeah.

355
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:04,950
Really?

356
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,240
It's a abbreviation,

357
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,560
You got this,

358
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,669
no worries!

359
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:12,927
So,

360
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:14,809
DUY.

361
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:18,568
Aren't you mixing them up?

362
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,435
Nah, it's DUY.

363
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:30,091
Awesome.

364
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:31,169
- Is it good?
- Yes.

365
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:31,964
Again.

366
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,161
Great, that's it.

367
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:51,831
Your soulmate is surely something that,

368
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,025
even if you can't see it,

369
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,049
is connected with you somewhere.

370
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,159
I'm not sure about that.

371
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:58,924
If that person

372
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:01,518
is actually your destined one.

373
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:03,643
Yeah?

374
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,002
How is it?

375
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,377
Yeah.

376
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,073
Looks great.

377
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:27,932
What's wrong?

378
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,174
Nothing.

379
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,510
Looking back now,

380
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,072
maybe Grandma

381
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:44,018
saved the last recipe for me.

382
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:46,760
So that I could come here,

383
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:48,392
away from the busy lifestyle,

384
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,252
and find the recipe notebook.

385
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,854
So that my life could

386
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:57,260
change significantly when I met Mahiro.

387
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,870
(Chaa muk marei kuchai. Cambodian food)

388
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,049
But

389
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,909
life really brings

390
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,323
unexpected things, doesn't it?

391
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:10,838
Right,

392
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:12,971
Grandma?

393
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,166
Be happy.

394
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,640
Well then... Let's eat.

395
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:43,557
It's fine to go with

396
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:44,721
your favorite style.

397
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:46,713
Huh?

398
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,666
But...

399
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:52,729
From now on,

400
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,057
let's live honestly, following

401
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,753
what excites us, right?

402
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,307
Then...

403
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,943
"Let's do it together!"

404
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:20,815
Sure.

405
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:37,295
"Naked Dining"

406
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:41,859
"The end"
