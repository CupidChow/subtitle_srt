Shimizu-san.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,539
Are the flowers and
keepsakes ready for tomorrow?

5
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:13,781
Yes.

6
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:14,531
Thanks.

7
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:17,016
Ichijou.

8
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:19,311
What should I do?

9
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:22,156
Kasuga-san, you fought with
your girlfriend again?

10
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:27,343
I couldn't make a reservation

11
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:29,218
at the restaurant for tomorrow.

12
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:31,766
I hope it's not

13
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,227
about the party venue.

14
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,328
I called to confirm earlier,

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,436
but they didn't get my reservation email.

16
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,771
The other private reservations

17
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,172
are already filled, too.

18
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:47,843
This is pretty bad, Kasuga-san.

19
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:51,555
Teshi's the organizer, too.

20
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,422
I wonder if I'll be fired.

21
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:58,016
Wasn't Bhutanese cuisine a requirement?

22
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:58,875
- Yeah.
- Yes.

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,414
There are only two shops in Tokyo.

24
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,117
Yes.

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,140
The other one is also fully booked.

26
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,038
No choice but to go to another restaurant

27
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,827
that doesn't serve Bhutanese food.

28
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,164
I'll go talk to the section chief.

29
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:15,664
Please do!

30
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:18,977
No worries, I got this!

31
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:22,172
Sorry to have you worry about the party.

32
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,179
Not at all.

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,804
Your honeymoon was in Bhutan, right?

34
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:29,148
I still have the fabric that you
gave me displayed at my house.

35
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,734
It was a nice place.

36
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,735
My wife wants to go there again.

37
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:34,391
But there hasn't been
an opportunity yet.

38
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:35,594
Leave it to me!

39
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,712
I'm sure your wife will be delighted.

40
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:38,803
Allow me.

41
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,093
Please come in. To your right.

42
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:51,946
How did it go?

43
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,727
Bhutanese food is a must.

44
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,173
I'm screwed.

- You see,
can we meet tonight?

53
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:01,321
Yeah.

54
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,587
Sure.

55
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,273
What's the matter?

56
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,406
- What a relief.

57
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,699
See you at Grandma's house
in two and a half hours.

58
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:09,750
Yeah.

59
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,673
Alright.

60
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,118
What was that?

61
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:18,204
Isn't this an invitation for a date?

62
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,219
Huh?

63
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,587
You're making that face.

64
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,071
What? No way!

65
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,462
So, tomorrow,

66
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,010
you're celebrating your boss's

68
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:33,844
Yes.

69
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,501
It's an important place for both of them.

70
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:41,515
Bhutan is a peaceful and simple
place surrounded by nature.

71
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,329
I think

72
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,391
it was also in Grandma's notebook.

73
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:46,946
Here.

(Ema datshi from Bhutan)

75
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:52,477
Understood.

76
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:53,829
Huh?

77
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:55,602
I haven't said anything yet.

78
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:57,977
You want to have a party here, right?

79
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,352
If it's okay with you, I'll do the cooking.

80
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:01,610
How did you know?

81
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,118
It's written all over your face.

82
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:04,079
No way!

83
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:06,165
Is it okay?

84
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,055
Yeah.

85
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,446
Thank you so much!

86
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,571
Hey!

87
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,938
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,000
I thought you

89
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:23,859
would help, Mahiro.

90
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,344
As expected,

91
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,641
a friend in need is a friend indeed!

92
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,102
Thank you,

93
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:30,118
my friend!

94
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,524
Yeah.

95
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:33,891
Then...

96
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:35,985
I'm going to call my colleague.

97
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:37,235
Yeah.

98
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,548
A good friend...

99
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:51,126
is that so?

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,382
Why is my heart pounding?

101
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:02,954
Okay, bye.

102
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,765
At Ichijou's grandmother's house.

103
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,548
Both the director and Teshi said okay.

104
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:14,180
What a relief.

105
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:16,173
What about the food?

106
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:19,930
His friend called
Mahiro-san will be cooking.

107
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:22,188
Oh.

108
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,766
Mahiro-san.

109
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,384
I thought he was going to
show off his girlfriend.

110
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:29,030
Turns out, it was only a friend.

111
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,321
I heard him calling his name so naturally.

112
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:33,305
Right?

113
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:35,680
Alright.

114
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:38,366
I need to do my best
with the decorations, right?

115
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:39,727
That's awesome.

116
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:41,232
As expected,

117
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,327
ema datshi and momo can’t be left out.

118
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,938
And then there is...

119
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:48,344
Pakshaba.

120
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:50,860
But the recipe...

121
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,524
What about this Pakshaba?

122
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:53,376
Huh?

123
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:55,274
Huh?

124
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:57,266
Oh, nothing.

125
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,391
I found a recipe

126
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:02,110
on a website that a
native of Bhutan shared.

127
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,188
Yeah.

128
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:07,423
That's great.

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,238
We should probably
try making tomorrow's menu.

130
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:16,433
I'll return to the store
and get the ingredients.

131
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,563
Oh.

132
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:25,344
I'm not sure how to act.

133
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:28,907
Bhutanese chili peppers?

134
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,704
I'll try asking around a few places.

135
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:33,875
Thank you!

136
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,110
By the way,

137
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:38,638
I have to go to Mizuchi-san's
house in the morning.

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,234
Will the shop be okay?

139
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:41,305
It's fine.

140
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:42,610
I'll take care of it.

141
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,165
Sorry, Ryu-san.

142
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:44,962
Yeah.

143
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:46,704
It's good practice.

144
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:47,852
Huh?

145
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,118
You wanted to run

146
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:52,430
your own restaurant someday, right?

147
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:54,602
Yeah.

148
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,235
Leave it to me.

149
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,485
Go enjoy yourself.

150
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:01,126
Thank you.

151
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,298
- See you later.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,368
What should we cook first?

153
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:14,188
This.

154
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,587
(Ema datshi from Bhutan)
Ema datshi?

155
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,594
(Ema datshi from Bhutan)
Yeah.

156
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:18,266
This is what Japanese think of

157
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,938
when it comes to Bhutanese food.

158
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,399
We absolutely can't leave it out.

159
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:23,352
Then...

160
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,586
Bhutanese spice...

161
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,446
Here.

162
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:31,438
Huh?

163
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:32,602
Ema,

164
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,071
chilies.

165
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,298
You're using that many?

166
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:37,141
Yeah.

167
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:38,391
In Japan,

168
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:40,314
we only use a little to add spiciness,

169
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:41,735
they're used as vegetables there,

170
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,242
not as a spice or condiment.

171
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:44,938
They're for eating.

172
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,946
Bhutan is amazing.

173
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:57,586
Oh.

174
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,391
Good timing.

175
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:00,500
I've heard that a lot.

176
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,266
Add butter

177
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,094
and cream cheese.

178
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,415
Pour some water.

179
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,094
Leave it for a while.

180
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,352
Isn't it going to burn like that?

181
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,390
Not mixing it and

182
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,702
letting it sit is important.

183
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,024
Alright.

184
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:23,383
That's the key to making it delicious.

185
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:27,265
Sometimes, not interfering
too much might be necessary.

186
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,148
How profound.

187
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,852
Mix it in and it'll be done.

188
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:43,906
Do you want to try it?

189
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:45,876
Sure.

190
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,173
Yeah.

191
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:00,109
So spicy!

192
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:02,844
Spicy!

193
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:05,899
Why are you okay?

194
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,829
I love spicy food.

195
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,611
But do you feel a sweetness
after the spiciness?

196
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,235
It's only spicy.

197
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,555
Bhutanese cuisine

198
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,141
is all spice.

199
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,961
And probably high in calories.

200
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:28,632
Maybe it's because it's a cold country

201
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:30,110
and they need to warm their bodies.

202
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,016
I see.

203
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,165
It's interesting

204
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,446
how food differs from country to country.

205
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:40,704
Yeah.

206
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,735
I'm glad you're here.

207
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,024
What's this suddenly?

208
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,258
If it weren't for you,

209
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,248
I wouldn't know anything
about these things.

210
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:54,555
Thanks

211
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:55,960
for being here.

212
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:04,805
Sorry, a colleague called.

213
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:06,453
What's the matter?

214
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:07,696
Oh.

215
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,727
Did you get everything on the list?

216
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:14,016
Yeah.

217
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:16,102
Yeah.

218
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:17,508
Okay.

219
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:18,391
Understood.

220
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,282
Don't be late.

221
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:21,540
Yeah.

222
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:24,173
Okay. Sure.

(Images of the Himalayas in Bhutan)

224
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,212
The foothills of the Himalayas...

225
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:35,493
The happiest country in the world.

226
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,438
The rest is tomorrow.

227
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:48,570
I wonder if starting at 7 AM is good.

228
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:59,547
(Closing ceremony speech)

229
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,610
Is this good enough?

230
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,063
It's already this late?

231
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,211
Sorry, Mahi...

232
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:31,313
Despite being so busy...

233
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,594
Thank you.

234
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,821
What was I trying to do?

235
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,415
That scared me.

236
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:17,266
You're still working?

237
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:18,391
Yeah.

238
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:19,946
What's up?

239
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,415
Thanks for the blanket.

240
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,282
I'm going home now.

241
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,055
I'll be back in the morning.

242
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,493
At this hour?

243
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:29,337
You can sleep here.

244
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,391
I want to take a bath and get changed.

245
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:33,501
Also,

246
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,891
I need to go order items for the shop.

247
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:37,321
Oh, right...

248
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,821
You're running a shop, sorry.

249
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:40,883
It's fine.

250
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:43,743
Actually, I'm enjoying it.

251
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:45,055
Really?

252
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:45,938
Yeah.

253
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,696
Also...

254
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,173
I am glad

255
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,477
that you thought of me.

256
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:57,383
See you tomorrow.

257
00:12:58,032 --> 00:12:58,758
Yeah.

258
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,313
It'll be fine.

259
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,782
You can handle it.

260
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,657
Please get some rest.

261
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:28,742
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

262
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:30,257
Sorry for making you come so early.

263
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:31,032
Not at all.

264
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,485
Well then, let’s start preparing.

265
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:34,047
Sure.

266
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:37,118
Oh, before that, we need plates.

267
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,032
How about using these plates?

268
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:44,563
Good.

269
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,571
I'll carry them.

270
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:47,828
You can focus on the cooking.

271
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:48,461
No.

272
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:50,009
- Just carrying...
- It's fine.

273
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:51,165
I'll do it.

274
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:56,102
Good morning.

275
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,141
Good morning.

276
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,149
And Kasuga?

277
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,421
Did he oversleep?

278
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:05,261
Kasuga-san is with
the director and his wife.

279
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:06,970
Kasuga is attending to them?

280
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:07,790
Why?

281
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:09,501
Haven't you been informed?

282
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,798
The section chief
suddenly couldn't make it.

283
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,243
He dislocated his shoulder.

284
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:14,438
Dislocated?

285
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,571
He got injured during morning
practice playing badminton.

286
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:20,134
Badminton?

287
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:24,226
I'll leave the decorations
up to your taste.

288
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,875
Can it be done by 11 o'clock?

289
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,821
The guests will arrive at 11:30.

290
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,321
Yes. I got it.

291
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,249
Sorry, there is one less participant.

292
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,056
No problem at all.

293
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:36,572
Shall I cut it?

The ema.

295
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:38,415
Huh?

296
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:42,259
You're not telling me
to cook in Bhutanese, are you?

297
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:43,431
Tashi delek.

298
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:44,602
Seriously?

299
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,819
It means "congratulations".

300
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:49,977
That's the only Bhutanese word I remember.

301
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:51,993
What the heck.

302
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:53,821
Let's get started then.

303
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:54,586
Alright.

304
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:57,219
Cut from above.

305
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:58,320
From the middle.

306
00:14:58,345 --> 00:14:59,595
Right in the middle.

307
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:02,087
Oh, that was great!

308
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,633
Tashi delek, right?

309
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:04,251
Yeah.

310
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,712
I said congratulations.

311
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,046
It should be congratulated.

312
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,734
You can do it for sure.

313
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,266
It's looking great.

314
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,806
Good morning.

315
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:14,243
Good morning, Komachi-chan.

316
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,501
Mahiro-san, thank you
very much for the other day.

317
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:18,642
Oh, no.

318
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:19,962
I didn't do anything.

319
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,759

That's great.

323
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,298

324
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,563
Can I borrow your chair?

325
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:34,868
Oh! I'll handle the heights.

326
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,985
It's dangerous.

327
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,204

Yeah.

Not bad, right?

330

All done, right?

Thank you.

383
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,063
The one in charge of today's
cooking is Miki Mahiro-san.

384
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:56,493
Thanks to him, we were
able to hold this party today.

385
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,149
Oh, it's you?

386
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,024
Thank you so much.

387
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:03,913
Everything was really delicious.

388
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:07,975
Food can really bring back memories.

389
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,423
It makes me feel very happy.

390
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:14,049
I'm really glad you liked it.

391
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,962
Where is your restaurant?

392
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,695
I'd love to visit it next time.

393
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,297
Right?

394
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:19,962
Oh, I...

395
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,274
If you don't mind,

396
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,221
please come back here again.

397
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,126
How about it?

398
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:27,789
Then Ichijou-san had
better invite us again.

399
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:30,390
So, the 50th Wedding Anniversary, right?

400
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:31,562
No way.

401
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,594
Next year's wedding anniversary!

402
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,673
Understood.

403
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,204
Yes.

404
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,194
- I'll have to wait starting next month.
- You're right.

405
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:39,914
More to look forward to.

406
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:40,884
Yes.

407
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:56,173
You really helped me out today!

408
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,884
What a relief.

409
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:59,345
Everyone,

410
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:00,657
good work.

411
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,032
- Good work.
- Good work.

412
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:03,837
Then, let's clean up.

413
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:04,634
Oh.

414
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:05,867
Don't worry about it.

415
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll take care of it bit by bit.

416
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:09,438
I can help you. I came
by car, so I'm in no hurry.

417
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:12,156
It's fine. I'll slowly clean up.

418
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:14,977
Komachi-chan, let's go home.

419
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:16,446
Yes...

420
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,009
Mahiro-kun.

421
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,969
Thank you so much for today.

422
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,134
Not at all.

423
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:22,962
Thanks for saving my neck.

424
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,181
Thank you!

425
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:27,001
Be careful on your way home.

426
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:28,712
Thank you.

427
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:30,633
Let's go home, then.

428
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:31,790
Yes.

429
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,071
Please take care of the rest!

430
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:35,142
Thanks for the hard work!

431
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,556
- It's finally over!
- It's finally over!

432
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,368
Mahiro.

433
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:57,642
It's a little late, but...

434
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,951
It might've been in the
way while you cooked.

435
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:04,829
As a souvenir of today,

436
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,134
and...

437
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,587
as a token of my gratitude.

438
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,306
You even prepared one for me.

439
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,431
Of course!

440
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:15,601
You're an important part of today's event.

441
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,610
I couldn't just leave you out.

442
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:25,962
Thank you.

443
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:28,868
Yeah.

444
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,610
As expected, I'm so tired...

445
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,477
Yeah.

446
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:49,080
Maybe because it's a
dish I've never made before.

447
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:51,095
Yeah.

448
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,337
Can I have that juice?

449
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:04,907
Bon appetit.

450
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,962
Huh?

451
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:38,274
No,

452
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,509
this is...

453
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:48,563
You're a worrier who prepares
for every and any thing,

454
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:54,860
and hates leaving others behind.

455
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:00,470
I know everything.

456
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,493
You still haven't changed at all.

457
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:24,626
(Next episode)

458
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:26,883
What does it mean to dream about kissing?

459
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:28,431
Who did you kiss?

460
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:29,830
A classmate.

461
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:31,197
Why is it...

462
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,048
Ichijou.

463
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:33,525
Stop butting in.

464
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:34,861
Awesome.

465
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:35,947
It's fate!

466
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:36,721
Huh?

467
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:38,166
It's fate!

468
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,056
(Marmalade)

469
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,960
(This is a work of fiction.)
