1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:01,727
Please...

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,266
become...

3
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:05,438
my real lover.

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,750
Oh, but...

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,383
Please don't give me

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,633
an answer right away.

7
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:21,148
Because Ichijou-san,

8
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:22,820
you've never seen me

9
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,617
as someone like that, have you?

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,101
That's why I want you to see me

11
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:34,016
first as someone other than a coworker

12
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:35,828
and decide.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,688
I...

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,813
I'm okay with a trial relationship.

15
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:43,897
But...

16
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:45,265
if it turns out

17
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:46,813
I don't see you in that way...

18
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,062
Well, that can't be helped then.

19
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:51,920
I understand

20
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,897
that it might make work difficult

21
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,592
if I'm rejected.

22
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:58,952
So,

23
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,764
please don't end it immediately.

24
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:05,217
Because

25
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,647
I've been

26
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,045
watching you all this time.

27
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:21,271
(Eggplant 100 yen)

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,850
Hasn't there been

29
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,709
any contact

30
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,577
from Souta-kun?

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,866
Yeah.

32
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:40,638
Did you try contacting him?

33
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,678
I understand your fear,

34
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,787
but is it okay to leave it like this?

35
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,577
You should try contacting him.

36
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:02,662
(Ichijou Souta)

37
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,060
Are you available

38
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:05,686
this Saturday?

39
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:09,108
I'd like you to teach me cooking.

40
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:15,765
(Let's make Shepherd's Pie from England)

41
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,452
Bu da bu xiang shi.

42
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,702
Bu da...

43
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,936
Bu xiang shi.

44
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:26,327
Bu xiang shi...

45
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:26,994
Yes.

46
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:33,818
(Bu da bu xiang shi)
Out of blows,

47
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,600
(Bu da bu xiang shi)
a relationship grows.

48
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,123
(Bu da bu xiang shi)
A Chinese idiom.

49
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,053
Like the sky after the rain.

50
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:43,116
(Bu da bu xiang shi)
It would be nice if you

51
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,483
and Souta-kun could become like that.

52
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:48,170
Yeah.

53
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:53,429
(April)

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,975
Yeah.

55
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,748
Looks like it's done.

56
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,209
"Naked Dining"

57
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,512
(Episode 9 A Love Square
that Worcestershire sauce can't hide)

58
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,147
I've been watching you all this time.

59
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,498
I've been...

60
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:59,397
watching Mahiro all this time?

61
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,889
You got this, no worries!

62
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,139
Where's Ryu-san?

63
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,428
He's out in the field.

64
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:31,639
Oh.

65
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:33,459
I see.

66
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:35,584
Yeah.

67
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:41,131
You see...

68
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:42,748
Good morning!

69
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,521
- Huh?
- Huh?

70
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,139
Today, I'll be participating

71
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:47,420
in the cooking as well!

72
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:53,748
Geez,

73
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,230
you're a bit clumsy

74
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,613
in situations like this,

75
00:04:57,538 --> 00:04:58,553
Sou-chan.

76
00:04:58,827 --> 00:04:59,819
Sou-chan?

77
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,819
Alright. Turn around, please.

78
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:14,430
(Shepherd's pie and Worcestershire sauce)
I thought Shepherd's Pie.

79
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:15,655
(Shepherd's pie and Worcestershire sauce)
was a dessert.

80
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,741
It's easy to think that.

81
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,062
It has "pie" in the name,

82
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,240
but we don't use pie crust.

83
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,483
Right, Mahiro-san?

84
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,897
Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,304
Komachi-chan,

86
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,856
you seem to know a lot about cooking.

87
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,202
Let's have a look.

88
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,959
Worcestershire sauce, right?

89
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:35,077
Here.

90
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,873
Oh!

91
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:52,069
(Worcestershire sauce)
Worcestershire sauce.

92
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,264
Yeah.

93
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,827
It originated in Worcestershire,

94
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,374
a county in England.

95
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:05,623
Shepherd

96
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,319
is herdsman’s pie.

97
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,561
The seasoning includes rum,

98
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,474
salt,

99
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,326
pepper,

100
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,491
tomato paste and

101
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:13,718
Worcestershire sauce.

102
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:16,045
The authentic version has strong spices

103
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:18,522
so it has a unique rum smell.

104
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:27,444
Yeah.

105
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:28,678
It's good, I think.

106
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:30,077
Can I taste it too?

107
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:32,655
Yeah.

108
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,561
The potatoes seem to be ready,

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,803
can I mash them?

110
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:57,561
I'll do it. Let's change places.

111
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,366
Yes.

112
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:04,913
Then can you put some meat sauce on it?

113
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:06,060
Yes. I got it.

114
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,077
Oh no!

115
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:12,303
What's wrong?

116
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:14,858
I messed up.

117
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:16,936
I'll go wash it off quickly.

118
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,881
The sink is over there.

119
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:18,819
Yes.

120
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:36,850
- You see...
- You see...

121
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,350
Can I speak first?

122
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,491
I'm sorry for everything.

123
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:49,100
Especially the other day.

124
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,608
I was really rude.

125
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:53,827
I...

126
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:55,741
I didn't understand

127
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:56,850
your feelings at all.

128
00:07:58,475 --> 00:07:59,498
I am...

129
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:01,944
truly sorry.

130
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,553
But.

131
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,022
I still want to be your friend.

132
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:12,944
So...

133
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,022
could we just forget about

134
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:19,592
everything that happened until now?

135
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:25,311
Please.

136
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:37,741
Okay.

137
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:39,772
I understand.

138
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,077
From now on, let's be friends.

139
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:48,319
Really?

140
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:50,530
Yeah.

141
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,873
Then, from now on, I'll support you.

142
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,092
As a friend.

143
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,935
Don't worry, I won't get in your way.

144
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:02,850
As expected,

145
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,045
having someone who watches over you

146
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,303
from nearby is important.

147
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,748
Someone who watches over

148
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,133
from nearby, huh?

149
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:30,483
Really?

150
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:38,663
Yeah,

151
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,022
you're right.

152
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,569
Mahiro,

153
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,397
what were you going to say?

154
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:55,405
Pretty much the same thing.

155
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:56,584
Pretty much?

156
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:57,725
Yeah.

157
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,858
I've washed it off!

158
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,201
- What a relief.
- Yes.

159
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:12,342
Yeah.

160
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,483
Sou-chan, what are you doing?

161
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:16,889
We need to peel the potatoes.

162
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:18,319
Yeah.

163
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,147
Ouch! Hot!

164
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,990
If you grab it with your bare hands,

165
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:25,326
of course it'd be hot.

166
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:26,288
Here.

167
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:27,342
Oh.

168
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,435
All that’s left to do is bake it.

169
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:43,998
Yes.

170
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,483
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

171
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,538
Alright.

172
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,655
200 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.

173
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,858
Start now.

174
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,003
Oh, Ryu-san?

175
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:09,522
Okay.

176
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:10,873
Yeah.

177
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:11,991
Got it.

178
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,311
Okay.

179
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,178
You can return if you need to.

180
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,452
Don't hold back.

181
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:24,928
You're right.

182
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:27,545
And since Komachi-chan is here...

183
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:30,092
Yes.

184
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,030
Can I have something to drink?

185
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,373
I'm feeling thirsty.

186
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:42,397
Sure.

187
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:54,842
Bye.

188
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:57,077
Yeah.

189
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:58,842
Thank you so much.

190
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,131
Are you okay?

191
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:12,022
Huh?

192
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:14,483
What do you mean?

193
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,764
Never mind, then.

194
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:35,876
Dammit...

195
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:42,497
On the way back home...

196
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,319
- Found a frog.
- Good morning.

197
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,443
- There's a frog...
- Good morning.

198
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:47,491
Good morning.

199
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:50,475
Oh no.

200
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:07,803
At that time,

201
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,678
I couldn't convey my thanks

202
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,295
or my feelings of liking you.

203
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,545
Mahiro, we have to go now.

204
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,522
I've been regretting and

205
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:48,733
suffering all this time.

206
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,608
I've repeated the same mistake again.

207
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,248
(Happy Birthday Souta)

208
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,310
Ichijou-san, what kind of

209
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,044
high school student were you?

210
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:40,599
I was a laid-back,

211
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,114
countryside high school student.

212
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:43,803
I attended high school here.

213
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,561
My parents were stationed overseas.

214
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,225
That's why...

215
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:48,740
I felt confused after

216
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:49,895
entering university.

217
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,998
Why was that?

218
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:52,334
Well,

219
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,474
I entered university wanting to

220
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,365
improve my field of expertise.

221
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,059
But everyone around

222
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,372
was focused on choosing

223
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:00,826
fields of study that would be

224
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,325
good for future employment.

225
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,998
Our perspectives were different.

226
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:05,654
So, you didn't originally aspire

227
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,662
to become a government bureaucrat?

228
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:08,428
Yeah.

229
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,342
I wanted to be a freelance journalist,

230
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,459
traveling around the world.

231
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,482
That was until high school.

232
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,154
You made quite a bold

233
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,912
change in direction, huh?

234
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,435
It offered stability

235
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:22,053
and the chance to contribute

236
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:23,598
to Japan's future.

237
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,241
So, I became a civil servant.

238
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,256
But I think Mahiro would see it

239
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,685
as a big transformation.

240
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,084
Huh?

241
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:33,788
What do you mean?

242
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:35,889
We were classmates

243
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:36,920
only for a while.

244
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,193
During our second year,

245
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:40,888
we were in the same class,

246
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,702
but he transferred out quickly,

247
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:44,858
so I don't remember about him much.

248
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,201
A fateful reunion, isn't it?

249
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,780
Wow! It looks so delicious!

250
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,248
It looks deliciously baked.

251
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,381
Let's eat together, just the two of us.

252
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,584
Please grab the plates and forks.

253
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:14,733
What's wrong?

254
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,123
I...

255
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:19,905
I'll pass.

256
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:21,577
Huh?

257
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:23,194
The truth is...

258
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,217
I don't like rum.

259
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:27,818
But Mahiro said the.

260
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,639
Worcestershire sauce masked the smell.

261
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:30,608
Even so,

262
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,006
I'll pass on it.

263
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:33,569
Today...

264
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,616
I just came here on my own accord.

265
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,014
I'm going home.

266
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:40,983
Huh?

267
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,037
And...

268
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:45,576
you should be careful about

269
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,428
giving off misleading vibes.

270
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,334
Huh?

271
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,092
Ichijou-san, youre...

272
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,100
really bad at romance,

273
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:54,147
worse than I expected.

274
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:56,170
Bye.

275
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,631
What's with her, seriously?

276
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:17,702
Fine.

277
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:20,538
I'll eat it by myself!

278
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:32,882
Bon appetit.

279
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,304
It's delicious!

280
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,569
It's so good!

281
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,472
It's amazing!

282
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:24,419
(You got this, no worries!)

283
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,475
(Mom sent you a sticker)

284
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,897
(Mom: Happy birthday)

285
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,920
Today is my birthday?

286
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,795
(By the way, about Grandma...)

287
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:39,272
Huh?

288
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,998
(Miki fruit and vegetable store)

289
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:47,936
Welcome back.

290
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,897
So, you couldn't

291
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,155
reconcile?

292
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,225
We did.

293
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,647
We did reconcile...

294
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:03,929
as friends.

295
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:07,124
Sorry,

296
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,053
you gave me so much advice...

297
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,569
But

298
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:13,936
if you're still by his side...

299
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:15,764
Hello.

300
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:18,335
Komachi-chan...

301
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,772
What's wrong?

302
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,108
I...

303
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,007
asked Ichijou-san

304
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:27,585
to go out with me.

305
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:29,163
Huh?

306
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,061
I haven't received an answer yet.

307
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,530
But.

308
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:39,116
I...

309
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:40,804
will not give up.

310
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:45,522
I want to play fair.

311
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,741
The scent of rum.

312
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:50,460
Huh?

313
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:52,561
Even if

314
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,108
you try to

315
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,921
mask it with spices,

316
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:58,280
but you can't completely erase it.

317
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,827
Especially for someone who you care for.

318
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:06,944
I'll come over next week, too.

319
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:08,749
Well then.

320
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,100
- Thank you for your patronage.
- Yes.

321
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,319
Mahiro-kun.

322
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:29,280
Have you seen it?

323
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,311
Huh?

324
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:41,349
(Nishihara Real Estate For sale )

325
00:20:48,343 --> 00:20:48,936
Alright,

326
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,178
let's go with this lineup

327
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:51,444
for the next issue.

328
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:51,913
Yes.

329
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:52,796
I'll leave the rest

330
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:54,413
to you.

331
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:55,405
Yes.

332
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:56,264
Good.

333
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,069
You seem to be in a hurry.

334
00:20:59,218 --> 00:20:59,913
Yeah.

335
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,163
There's an evening practice

336
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:02,483
before the tournament.

337
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,139
Badminton practice.

338
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:06,327
Badminton, I see.

339
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:07,366
Yes.

340
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,897
Ah, right.

341
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,499
Around the venue,

342
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:14,171
there's a popular power spot

343
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,129
for couples near the venue.

344
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,929
You two could come and

345
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,623
support us during your date.

346
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:20,194
No, we...

347
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,249
These two...

348
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:23,819
So you don't know?

349
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:26,077
These two are dating, right?

350
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:26,850
Isn't that right?

351
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:29,366
No way.

352
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,397
That's not true, section chief. They-

353
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:32,084
We're dating.

354
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:32,772
- Huh?
- Huh?

355
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:35,959
Huh? I didn't hear about this.

356
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:37,343
Section chief.

357
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:38,960
Thank you, I appreciate it.

358
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,300
Let's finish up our work quickly,

359
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,038
yes?

360
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,366
Oh, yes.

361
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:47,350
Take care of your shoulder, please.

362
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,162
I'm a little worried about that...

363
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:50,350
You have to warm up

364
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:51,872
your shoulders first and move.

365
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:53,498
Bye. Thanks for your hard work.

366
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,413
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

367
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:58,780
Here.

368
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:02,139
Thank you...

369
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:04,186
Big news, isn't it?

370
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,155
Big news, isn't it?

371
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:07,413
Big news, isn't it?

372
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:10,061
- Hey, come here.
- What is it?

373
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,335
Ichijou and Komac-chan

374
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:12,248
are dating.

375
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:13,975
Huh? No way.

376
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,029
- So surprising.
- Really?

377
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,147
No. I get Komac-chan,

378
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,944
but Ichijou...

379
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,030
Ichijou-san!

380
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:28,952
Shimizu-san.

381
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,249
What's wrong?

382
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:31,718
That isn't good.

383
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:32,960
What's not good?

384
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,264
Kasuga-san.

385
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:36,346
We need to explain the situation to him.

386
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,308
Isn't it fine?

387
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,522
Huh?

388
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:47,514
Komachi-chan.

389
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:49,686
Yes?

390
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:51,554
Let's give it a try

391
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:54,639
and actually start dating.

392
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,679
Are you sure?

393
00:22:58,436 --> 00:22:59,116
Yeah.

394
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:01,100
I just realized

395
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:05,085
that having someone who watches over you

396
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:07,186
is so valuable.

397
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:16,694
Please take care of me.

398
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:19,694
Please take care of me.

399
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,600
Let's go.

400
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:23,249
Yes.

401
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:37,444
(Next episode)

402
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:38,319
An ex?

403
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:40,030
How long have you known Mahiro?

404
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:41,756
Meeting again is like a miracle.

405
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,444
What you're feeling

406
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:45,889
is called jealousy.

407
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:47,812
I've always liked him.

408
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,125
