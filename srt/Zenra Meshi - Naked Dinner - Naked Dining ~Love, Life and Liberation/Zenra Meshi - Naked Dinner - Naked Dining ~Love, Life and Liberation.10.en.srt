1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:04,781
Komachi-chan.

2
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:07,125
Let's give it a try

3
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:10,086
and actually start dating.

4
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:11,883
I just realized

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:15,164
that having someone who watches over you

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,086
is so precious.

7
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:29,672
Mahiro.

8
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:30,844
Do you

9
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:32,726
really want 100 of them?

10
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,766
Sorry, just 10.

11
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:38,156
This is the third time today.

12
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:40,922
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:43,555
What is it now?

14
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:49,375
Ta-da!

15
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:50,563
Amazing.

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,508
I woke up early to cook this.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,641
Thank you.

18
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,516
I don't know if you'll like it or not.

19
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:56,750
- I'll eat it now.
- Yes.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,765
Please do.

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,906
Umm...

22
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:02,773
Oh?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,148
Not bad at all.

24
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:07,632
Geez, Kasuga-san, don't just grab it.

25
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:08,851
There's only one left anyway.

26
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,906
- It's for two people.
- Yes, yes.

27
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,016
Alright, then.

28
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:18,539
It's delicious.

29
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:19,563
Really?

30
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:20,164
Yes.

31
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,156
It's really delicious.

32
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:22,772
What a relief.

33
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,672
Acting all lovey-dovey..

34
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:25,890
You're still here?

35
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:26,773
Yes.

36
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,875
This third wheel is leaving.

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,633
Should I have my girl do it, too?

38
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:33,297
Ah.

39
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:36,406
Try this stir-fried chicken and tomato.

40
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,094
This is also tasty.

41
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,305
You're so good at cooking.

42
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,813
I tried my best.

43
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,219
But I'm probably not

44
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:50,924
as good as Mahiro-san.

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,078
Oh.

46
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,469
Ah.

47
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:56,594
I'd better eat, too.

48
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,414
Bon appetit.

49
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:00,242
Ah.

50
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,242
Souta-kun and Komachi-chan?

51
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,352
Yeah.

52
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,164
Is that so?

53
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,393
I thought Souta-kun

54
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:10,588
felt something for you.

55
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:15,945
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,391
I said some strange things, didn't I?

57
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:19,984
No.

58
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:22,461
In the end,

59
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,922
Souta and I didn't understand each other.

60
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:28,266
Mahiro.

61
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,703
Come on, Ryu-san.

62
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,015
Don't make that face.

63
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:33,453
But...

64
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,750
It's fine.

65
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,993
I knew it would be like this.

66
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:42,250
The weekends are food trips, right?

67
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:44,633
Yes.

68
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:47,390
There are two menus left.

69
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,422
Grandma's wish,

70
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,476
I want to see it through to the end.

71
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,070
Besides,

72
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,453
the truth is, that house...

73
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,602
(Nishihara Real Estate For sale)
Huh?

74
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:00,672
Mizuchi-san's house is for sale?

75
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:02,773
Yes.

76
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:04,883
But

77
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,055
it's a relief this way.

78
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,727
Mahiro.

79
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,773
Kousuke.

80
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:24,359
When did you come back here?

81
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,055
This morning.

82
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:28,281
I wanted to see you, so I came
straight here from the airport.

83
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:29,484
Geez,

84
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:32,028
you should've contacted
me if you were coming back.

85
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:34,242
I wanted to see your happy face.

86
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,961
The surprise was a big success!

87
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,813
Oh geez,

88
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:40,289
Kousuke!

89
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,430
- I'm back, Mahiro.
- Welcome back.

90
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,992
"Naked Dining"

91
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:08,673
"Episode 10
Agitated Coriander"

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,749
It feels refreshing

93
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,454
when there are two people.

94
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,094
The weather is better, too.

95
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:19,695
Let's go, then.

96
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:20,469
Yes.

97
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,289
Sou-chan, wait for me.

98
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:33,039
Oh.

99
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,984
Ah, welcome.

100
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,735
The spring cabbage

101
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,485
is delicious this season.

102
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,055
Is that so?

103
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,313
The spring cabbage...

104
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,586
Wow, it's heavy.

105
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,141
I'm back.

106
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:05,188
Souta.

107
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:06,203
Komachi-chan.

108
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:07,227
Welcome.

109
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:07,953
- Yeah.
- Yes.

110
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:10,719
Oh? Mahiro's acquaintances?

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,867
Mahiro?

112
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:12,875
Right.

113
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:14,945
You've never met him, right?

114
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,398
Kousuke?

115
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,039
Hello, my name is Kataoka Kousuke.

116
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,844
I've known Mahiro for a long time

117
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,352
in a slightly complicated way.

118
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:26,383
Complicated?

119
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:29,133
What are you saying?

120
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:30,773
Ah.

121
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,944
Ichijou Souta-kun was my classmate.

122
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,656
- Hello.
- Hello.

123
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,836
And she...

124
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,242
Oh,

125
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,375
Don't tell me you two...

126
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:43,375
Yes.

127
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:47,305
We're finally going out.

128
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:49,117
Really?

129
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,188
Congratulations.

130
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,797
Thank you very much.

131
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:53,609
Congratulations, Souta.

132
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:55,617
Yeah.

133
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,859
Souta's girlfriend, Komachi-chan.

134
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,163
Hello.

135
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:02,977
Hello.

136
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:04,938
He said girlfriend!

137
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,211
Kousuke-kun,

138
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:10,171
thanks for looking after the shop.

139
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,094
Welcome, Souta-kun.

140
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:14,445
Wait, Ryu-san.

141
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:18,492
Are you angry?

142
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:20,813
Just come with me.

143
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,500
Are you selling Mizuchi-san's house?

144
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:31,945
How did you know?

145
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:34,578
Mahiro saw the 'FOR SALE' sign.

146
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:36,586
Oh, that...

147
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,461
My parents arranged it.

148
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:40,421
But more importantly,

149
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,366
can we just leave it like this?

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,703
What about it?

151
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:47,202
Doesn't it bother you to see Mahiro

152
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,285
getting along with another guy?

153
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,234
Of course it bothers me!

154
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,031
- Those two!
- Exactly!

155
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:54,352
So then...

156
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:55,773
But geez...

157
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:57,178
It's a fateful reunion

158
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:58,421
with his ex-boyfriend!

159
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,367
Ex-boyfriend!?

160
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:03,461
Yeah.

161
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,875
After returning from abroad,

162
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,867
he came to see Mahiro immediately.

163
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,758
Isn't it romantic?

164
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:12,750
Ryu-san!

165
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,303
If you keep saying that so nonchalantly,

166
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:17,461
another guy will snatch Mahiro away!

167
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,711
Snatch him away?

168
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:21,039
What do you mean?

169
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,273
Well...

170
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:27,265
Because you and Mahiro...

171
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:37,516
Oh.

172
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,664
That was...

173
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:42,406
I was just comforting him.

174
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:45,508
Huh?

175
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:46,367
Yeah.

176
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,391
Then...

177
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:52,578
So, I was overreacting?

178
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,046
(Dukka dip with chicory salad)

179
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,742
(Putting dukka from Egypt)
A trip to Egypt this time?

180
00:07:58,906 --> 00:07:59,929
It's not often that

181
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,327
you get a chance to go to Egypt!

182
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:02,723
So I'm looking forward to it.

183
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,477
Sou-chan.

184
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:09,930
Sou-chan.

185
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,453
Huh?

186
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,719
Oh, sorry. You were saying?

187
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,867
Sorry, I spaced out a bit.

188
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:30,266
Kousuke wanted to come along

189
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:31,951
when he heard about the food trip.

190
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:32,804
Thank you.

191
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,992
Is it okay?

192
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:35,125
Huh?

193
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:36,578
But...

194
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,781
Don't worry.

195
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,117
We won't interfere with you two.

196
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,453
That's not what I meant.

197
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,070
I apologize for the suddenness.

198
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:48,180
I heard it was

199
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,687
Egyptian Dukka this time,

200
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:50,998
and I wanted to

201
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:53,350
come pay my respect to Mizuchi-san.

202
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:55,420
My grandma?

203
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,452
Back when Kousuke was still here,

204
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:08,725
we used to come here together sometimes.

205
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,146
Together?

206
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:10,842
Yeah.

207
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,131
By the way, when it was decided that.

208
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,553
Kousuke would go abroad,

209
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:16,920
Mizuchi-san said

210
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,303
her son and his wife

211
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:20,008
were living abroad.

212
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,647
She was talking about your parents, yes?

213
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,912
Grandma herself officially approved it.

214
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:29,358
Huh?

215
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:33,436
Alright.

216
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:35,702
Let's start preparing.

217
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,772
(Dukka dip with chicory salad)
Here it is.

218
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:46,663
(Egyptian Dukka Dip)

219
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:48,491
It's wonderful how.

220
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,349
Mizuchi-san's grandson

221
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,507
is carrying out her intentions.

222
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,350
Thanks.

223
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,061
Wow, I'm thrilled!

224
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,772
Kousuke works in a food import company.

225
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,624
So, we source most of our

226
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:08,897
spices from there.

227
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,936
Is that so?

228
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:12,607
Kousuke, coriander seeds

229
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:13,678
and cumin, please.

230
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:14,506
Okay.

231
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:16,927
Thanks.

232
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,530
By the way,

233
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,974
When did the two meet?

234
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:24,069
Oh.

235
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:25,358
Back when I was working

236
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,826
at a company in Tokyo,

237
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,218
we lived in the same neighborhood.

238
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:30,256
We hit it off at a nearby

239
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,631
restaurant we'd often go.

240
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,991
But when I first approached you,

241
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,178
he gave me a look like.

242
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,996
'I'm not interested in pick-up lines!'

243
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,849
I didn't give you that look!

244
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,951
I'm really grateful that

245
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,569
you approached me.

246
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:44,428
Really?

247
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:45,842
Of course.

248
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:47,123
After being apart, have you

249
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,889
finally realized how amazing I am?

250
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:49,865
Yes.

251
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,709
I realized, okay?

252
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,223
What is this chicken used for?

253
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:55,288
We're making a dip

254
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:56,693
for bread today, right?

255
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:57,491
Yeah.

256
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:59,756
But might as well

257
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,966
make roasted chicken

258
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,912
with dukka sauce.

259
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,061
Can it be used as a sauce, too?

260
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,014
Dukka goes well with garlic,

261
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:10,264
it's a versatile seasoning,

262
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,983
so it can be used as a sauce for meat,

263
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,688
fish, and even pasta.

264
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,819
Wow.

265
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,030
It's an all-purpose condiment.

266
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:17,686
Yes.

267
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:20,600
Depending on your taste and preferences,

268
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,866
you can adjust the amount

269
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,242
and types of spices.

270
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,663
Different households

271
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,046
have their own variations.

272
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:29,185
So, the combinations are endless?

273
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:29,928
Yes.

274
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,874
Today, we'll use almonds and hazelnuts,

275
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:36,483
along with sesame, coriander, cumin,

276
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,936
salt, and pepper.

277
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,327
So, we'll find our own preference,

278
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,632
it seems like a lot of fun.

279
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:43,952
Yeah.

280
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:48,147
Then, for Souta,

281
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,905
can you lightly roast this?

282
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,444
Roast it and bring out the aroma.

283
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,436
Be careful not to burn it.

284
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:57,631
I got it.

285
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,217
And...

286
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:00,663
Komachi-chan,

287
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,521
please prepare vegetables

288
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,436
for the side dish.

289
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,115
Yes.

290
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:11,139
Ah,

291
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,561
that's no good.

292
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:13,897
- Wait a bit, okay?
- Sure.

293
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,967
- Like this?
- No.

294
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:23,858
Straighten it a bit

295
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,967
and continue like this.

296
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,585
It's unexpectedly difficult.

297
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,170
Don't get too lovey-dovey...

298
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,569
Ah! Sou-chan!

299
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:39,092
Oh!

300
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:42,897
Ah...

301
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,381
We should start over with this.

302
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,202
Sorry.

303
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,475
I'll take care of it.

304
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:51,483
Could you handle cutting the baguette?

305
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:53,051
It's easier to slice

306
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,256
if you face it upward.

307
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:55,905
Got it.

308
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:02,913
How's it?

309
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:04,717
Yeah.

310
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:05,585
Looking good.

311
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:07,077
Hold it like that for a bit.

312
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,710
Alright.

313
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,061
Oh, by the way,

314
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,885
I ran out of shampoo during

315
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,573
my shower this morning.

316
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:15,827
Shower?

317
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,108
I have some extra.

318
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:18,692
I'll get it out when we return.

319
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:19,553
Sorry.

320
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,905
Hey.

321
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:27,205
I'd love to eat that tamagoyaki

322
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,163
you made for me the other day again.

323
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,452
Sure.

324
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:32,248
Really?

325
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,172
Next time, come over to my place

326
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,556
and cook it for me, please.

327
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:36,881
Oh...

328
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:39,435
I'm looking forward to your cooking,

329
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,358
Komachi-chan.

330
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:15,741
Alright, I'll prepare some plates.

331
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:16,951
It's okay.

332
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,483
We'll go and eat outside.

333
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,084
Huh?

334
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,209
- Let's go then.
- Sure.

335
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:23,756
Thank you for having us.

336
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,483
We had a great time.

337
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,248
Wait a minute!

338
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,146
Aren't you going to eat together?

339
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,952
You should eat with Komachi-chan.

340
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,889
Well then, enjoy your meal.

341
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:42,295
Wait...

342
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:50,084
What was that?

343
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,295
What did they come here for, right?

344
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:03,842
What was that?

345
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,764
That's my line!

346
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,967
Did you have fun using me?

347
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:13,131
Huh?

348
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,764
Ichijou-san.

349
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:17,491
Shall I tell you what that thing you're

350
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,928
holding onto right now is called?

351
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,436
It's called jealousy.

352
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,967
Jealousy...?

353
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,912
Don't you realize?

354
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:31,850
You're jealous of Kousuke.

355
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,412
It's better for you to confront

356
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:41,287
your own feelings properly.

357
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:00,584
Where do you want to go eat?

358
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,928
Kousuke, what do you want to eat?

359
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,077
Is it really okay?

360
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:11,780
Huh?

361
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:15,881
Don't worry about me.

362
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:24,272
Why...

363
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:26,561
You see,

364
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,975
can we talk for a moment?

365
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,827
Does that...

366
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,350
belong to Komachi-chan?

367
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:41,701
Ah...

368
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,373
she...

369
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:45,560
suddenly remembered something

370
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:46,704
and went home.

371
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,530
Were you trying to catch up with her?

372
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:50,725
No.

373
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,662
I just misunderstood,

374
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,548
I thought she had returned.

375
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,522
Ah...

376
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,280
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,475
Why are you apologizing?

378
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,506
And you?

379
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,212
Weren't you going to have dinner?

380
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:08,866
Ah...

381
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,373
It seems like.

382
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:11,970
Kousuke also had something

383
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,017
urgent come up.

384
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:15,686
Really?

385
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:17,717
Yes.

386
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:20,225
Ah...

387
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:22,193
Do you want to eat?

388
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,657
The food is still left untouched.

389
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:28,631
Excuse me, then...

390
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,053
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

391
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,233
You see,

392
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,225
I...

393
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,108
have something to tell you.

394
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:15,201
Yeah.

395
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,241
That is...

396
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:19,920
Since that day

397
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:22,202
in high school...

398
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,240
when you shared your lunch with me,

399
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,205
I told you before, right?

400
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,087
Yeah.

401
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,022
Ever since then,

402
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,342
I've always been interested in you.

403
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,155
Without realizing it,

404
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,092
I've always been watching you.

405
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,850
I used to...

406
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,366
like you.

407
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,373
Used to?

408
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:13,772
Yeah.

409
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:18,873
I've always liked you.

410
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,014
I know that you're seeing Komachi-chan,

411
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:27,748
this is what...

412
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,491
I wanted to tell you.

413
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:41,936
- I...
- Well then...

414
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,662
Kousuke is waiting for me.

415
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,702
I'm off, then.

416
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,217
Huh?

417
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,280
Earlier, you said he was busy.

418
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,990
Ah, I'm sorry.

419
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:52,795
I lied about that.

420
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:56,139
Kousuke...

421
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:00,303
told me to talk properly with you...

422
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,475
So yeah...

423
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:06,217
Is that so?

424
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,467
He told you to come...

425
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:11,280
Yeah.

426
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,295
But.

427
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:20,264
I can finally move forward now.

428
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,264
Move forward?

429
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:29,889
For the last menu,

430
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,506
when the black peppers arrive,

431
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:35,616
I'll contact you again.
