1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:02,156
Did I say something wrong?

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,211
- Was I being insensitive...
- I...

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:05,703
I did it.

4
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:08,750
The kiss.

5
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:11,406
I did it.

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:17,477
I...

7
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,352
kissed you.

8
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:27,078
What was that all about?

9
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:31,969
Oh no!

10
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,523
Let's cook first.

11
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,445
Let's focus on food for now.

12
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,609
I don't know why...

13
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:58,312
It feels like something is lacking.

14
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,570
Like some sort of stimulation

15
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,781
or something similar.

16
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,045
No, not that kind of stimulation!

17
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:11,053
Hot!

18
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,655
"Naked Dining"

19
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:34,015
"Episode 7
The spice in the sweet night"

20
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:36,969
Hey.

21
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:38,391
How are you?

22
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:40,773
No.

23
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:42,516
We just met.

24
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:45,055
Hey.

25
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,389
The Ghanaian food last time

26
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:48,438
was delicious!

27
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:52,436
It sounds so unnatural.

28
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,617
Maybe I should just ask directly.

29
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:07,586
Oh, Ichijou-san!

30
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,797
Welcome!

31
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:09,460
Oh!

32
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:10,969
Hello.

33
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,695
You see...

34
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,703
I came to buy vegetables...

35
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,377
If you're looking for Mahiro,
he's out for deliveries.

36
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:24,914
Is that so?

37
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:26,898
- Deliveries, I see.
- Yes.

38
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:27,859
Oh.

39
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,156
So that's the case.

40
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,313
Do you need something from Mahiro?

41
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:33,086
No...

42
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:35,273
You see,

43
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,478
he always helped me
choose the ingredients.

44
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:39,195
Oh!

45
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,813
- Mizuchi-san's menu, right?
- Yes.

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,813
What are you planning to make this time?

47
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:45,273
What was it again?

48
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:48,929
Using some seasoning called Shacha

49
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,429
or something...

50
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,288
It's a Taiwanese hot pot.

51
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,047
Do you mean.

52
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,836
Shacha sauce?

53
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,516
Yes, that one.

54
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:01,430
In that case,

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,336
Then the ingredients are...

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,095
Adding it to the sauce
makes a delicious dipping sauce.

57
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:11,383
Yes.

58
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:13,398
This one as well.

59
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,016
Oh, I see. You sure know a lot.

60
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,084
You're good at cooking too, Ryu-san?

61
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:18,805
Good?

62
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,280
Well, I'm from Taiwan myself.

63
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,406
Is that so?

64
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,236
Yes.

65
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:26,890
- By the way, Mahiro mentioned about a kiss...
- Kiss?

66
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,745
He wanted to sell imperfect produce
that look like they kissed the dust.

67
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,195
Oh.

68
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,867
Kissed the dust, huh?

69
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,430
I'll give you a discount,

70
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,406
how about that?

71
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,500
Yeah, I'll take that, too.

72
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:44,813
I'll put them in the hot pot.

73
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:50,063
Hot pot.

74
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:56,289
Ouch...

75
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,219
Let's calm down for now.

76
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,438
What should I do?

77
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,516
I'm home.

78
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:35,523
Hey.

79
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:36,844
Huh?

80
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,234
What's the deal with these vegetables?

81
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:40,742
Oh, these?

82
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,852
They're for tonight's hot pot party.

83
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:44,180
Hot pot party?

84
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:44,969
Yes.

85
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,166
A hot pot party for the three of us
at Ichijou-san's place!

86
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:50,039
The three of us...

87
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,678
I'll treat you all to Ryu family's

88
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:52,867
special dipping sauce,

89
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,563
so look forward to it.

90
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,109
Oh.

91
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:57,687
The shacha sauce, right?

92
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,109
Could it be that

93
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:00,234
I'm...

94
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,305
a nuisance?

95
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:03,468
No,

96
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:04,850
on the contrary,

97
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,258
I'm glad you're joining.

98
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,217
There's definitely something

99
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,141
between you and Ichijou-san, huh?

100
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:12,883
Something?

101
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,578
You've been acting strangely.

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,617
Really?

103
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,695
Yes.

104
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,172
I...

105
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,073
I told him something that

106
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,417
he didn't need to know.

107
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,328
Something he didn't need to know?

108
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:31,398
Yes.

109
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:32,938
Well, you know,

110
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:34,823
sometimes it's better

111
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,026
to not know the truth.

112
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,253
It's better that way.

113
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:39,797
That's true.

114
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:41,602
Yeah.

115
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,195
But

116
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,558
the truth has many aspects

117
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,808
depending on who sees it.

118
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:57,819
(Shacha hot pot Taiwanese dish)

119
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:12,633
You got this, no worries!

120
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:14,687
You got this, no worries!

121
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,570
Good evening!

122
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:21,609
Welcome!

123
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,867
Mizuchi-san,

124
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,578
sorry to intrude!

125
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:34,000
So, Ryu-san is

126
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,930
from Taiwan, right?

127
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,148
Yes.

128
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,484
I thought it would be a good opportunity.

129
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,129
Besides,

130
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:43,488
hot pot is more fun

131
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,824
with more people, right?

132
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,353
Oh...

133
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,039
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,945
What's with the apology?

135
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:56,383
Three people are better than two.

136
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:57,766
No...

137
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:00,281
You see,

138
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,203
about that thing the other day...

139
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:07,750
Hey, what are you guys doing?

140
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,891
Let's get started!

141
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:11,664
Oh, sorry.

142
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,852
What did that mean...

143
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:21,664
Souta.

144
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:22,875
What are you doing?

145
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:24,289
Let's get started.

146
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:25,914
Yeah!

147
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:27,164
(Shacha hot pot Taiwanese dish)

148
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,992
(Shacha hot pot Taiwanese dish)
So, this is Mizuchi-san's...

149
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,207
way of traveling around

150
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:32,606
the world with food.

151
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:34,633
Alright!

152
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,258
Leave tonight's Taiwan trip

153
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,656
to me as your guide!

154
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:38,813
Roger that!

155
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,270
I'll be in charge of the soup

156
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:42,348
and dipping sauce,

157
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,053
which are very crucial.

158
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:45,546
So, Ichijou-san and Mahiro,

159
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,453
please cut the ingredients.

160
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,468
Alright.

161
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,234
Let's start by washing these.

162
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:54,789
And

163
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:56,016
this one, too.

164
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,062
Try chopping the same way.

165
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:12,945
- Alright.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,656
Oh, wait!

167
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:29,625
Don't throw it away.

168
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:32,742
The coriander roots

169
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:35,437
will make the sauce taste better.

170
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,086
Oh.

171
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,516
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

172
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:50,422
Wow, it smells amazing.

173
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:51,508
Isn't that right?

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,984
Dip them in my special Ryu family sauce

175
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,328
and enjoy!

176
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:01,930
It looks spicy.

177
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,930
Just try it.

178
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:04,805
Yeah.

179
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,430
It's not spicy.

180
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,602
Shacha sauce

181
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:30,305
is more umami than spicy.

182
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:32,351
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

183
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:33,594
Delicious.

184
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,023
As expected from Ryu-san.

185
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:36,781
It's incredibly tasty.

186
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:38,438
What a relief.

187
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,859
Yeah.

188
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,789
Yeah! This, this flavor!

189
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:47,656
By the way,

190
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,156
there are so many
different spices, aren't there?

191
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,438
I used to think that spices were

192
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,704
all about heat and stimulation.

193
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:54,507
Oh.

194
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:56,015
Well, it's true.

195
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,578
But spices are originally

196
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,367
used to enhance aroma,

197
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,617
add richness to the flavor,

198
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,250
and balance out any unpleasant tastes.

199
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:06,305
I see...

200
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:08,703
And so, there are times

201
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,492
that spices can indeed add depth

202
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:11,906
and excitement to our lives.

203
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:16,648
Deepens stimulation...

204
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:20,750
Huh?

205
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,039
Wow, amazing!

206
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,041
- The Niagara Falls of Taiwan, right?
- What's it called?

207
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,187
Shifen Pu Bu.

208
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:39,484
- Shifen Pu Bu.
- Shifen Pu Bu.

209
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:41,570
Shifen Pu Bu.

210
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,695
- Oh, not bad.
- I'm right?

211
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,515
- Taipei building...
- 101.

212
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:47,593
- I didn't say it correctly?
- No.

213
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:48,897
That's not it.

214
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,242
Zhong Zheng Ji Nian Tang.

215
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:51,711
- Amazing.
- Wonderful.

216
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:52,461
Wow.

217
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:58,867
Shall we switch to soju soon?

218
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:00,109
Sounds good.

219
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:01,945
How should we drink it?

220
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:02,750
It's fine,

221
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,891
I'll go get it.

222
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:05,938
I'll have mine straight!

223
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,406
Then...

224
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:08,484
On the rocks for me.

225
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,297
Okay.

226
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:17,484
Hey,

227
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,883
Souta-kun,

228
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,570
do you have someone you like?

229
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:22,875
So sudden...

230
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,187
What's more, Souta-kun...

231
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,445
Talking about love makes us
closer as friends, right?

232
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,406
So?

233
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,570
Is there someone you like right now?

234
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:34,609
Umm...

235
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:36,891
What's wrong?

236
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,086
There isn't anyone?

237
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:42,523
Someone I like?

238
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,617
I wonder...

239
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,367
Lately,

240
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:04,273
I've been feeling unsure about

241
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,491
what it means to like someone.

242
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,070
You don't know?

243
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:13,664
I haven't liked anyone for a long time,

244
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,992
so I guess I've forgotten that feeling.

245
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:19,984
That sounds like

246
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:23,234
there might be someone you have in mind.

247
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,422
Huh?

248
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,023
I'm just guessing,

249
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,046
but maybe you're interested in someone,

250
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,812
but you're not sure

251
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,984
if you actually like them yet.

252
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:39,094
There are many types of love, after all.

253
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:42,625
Many kinds of love...

254
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,867
And you, Ryu-san?

255
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:48,688
Is there someone you like?

256
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:49,953
Yes.

257
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,313
What kind of person?

258
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,695
Wasn't it someone with a cute smile?

259
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,092
They're kind,

260
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:00,209
smiley,

261
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,381
they used to have a cute smile.

262
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:04,264
Used to?

263
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,537
They're no longer in the world I'm in.

264
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:12,287
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,498
Don't be so down about it.

266
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:17,373
Oh.

267
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:22,334
This is what they call the
epitome of holding back!

268
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,099
- Oh.
- Oh.

269
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:27,169
- I was going to eat it...
- I was going to eat it...

270
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,818
You should have said that earlier!

271
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:33,209
It's okay,

272
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:34,560
don't worry about it.

273
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:35,654
No.

274
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,053
You have to say

275
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,896
these things without holding back.

276
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:40,693
Otherwise,

277
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:42,692
you might lose something precious,

278
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:43,912
like I did.

279
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,185
Like you did?

280
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:49,373
Yes.

281
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:56,053
If I had been

282
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:58,701
honest and straightforward

283
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,214
without holding back at that time,

284
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:02,810
maybe...

285
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,818
we could still be together now.

286
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:07,740
Still?

287
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:10,084
Wait a minute.

288
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:12,318
They're not dead?

289
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,506
They're still alive.

290
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,551
But earlier you said

291
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,186
they're no longer in your world.

292
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,832
Because he would never return

293
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:22,012
to the world I'm in.

294
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:24,380
He?

295
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:27,014
Yes.

296
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:29,990
He...

297
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:36,404
I thought it was an unrequited love.

298
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:38,662
But

299
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:43,232
I've always liked him.

300
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,842
So, you know,

301
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:02,412
when he accepted my feelings,

302
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:04,678
I was really happy.

303
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,381
Just being together

304
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,670
already made me truly happy.

305
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:25,451
But...

306
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,060
Shinji!

307
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,074
Long time no see.

308
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:32,233
What long time no see?

309
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:33,780
Your friend?

310
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,592
Yes, that's right.

311
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,725
I doubted,

312
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,334
I felt jealous...

313
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,936
I convinced myself that maybe

314
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,990
he would be happier without me...

315
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,186
Hao Shan!

316
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:49,061
Wait!

317
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,325
(I loved the straightforward Hao Shan)

318
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,733
Wishing you happiness.

319
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,966
(I loved the straightforward Hao Shan)

320
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,264
(Wishing you happiness)
He said it was exhausting

321
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:35,311
being with someone

322
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,616
like me who isn't honest.

323
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,358
That's why I want you two, young ones,

324
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:46,654
to live your lives being true to
your feelings, without regrets.

325
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,553
The feeling of falling in love,

326
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,983
be it a minority

327
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,733
or majority,

328
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,662
it does not matter.

329
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:01,514
It's a miracle to meet someone

330
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,670
who makes you feel that way.

331
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,600
A miracle...

332
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,076
Yes.

333
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,030
Falling in love with someone

334
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:12,897
is a miracle.

335
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:15,444
So, I want you

336
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,420
to cherish that miracle.

337
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,381
Mahiro

338
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:23,194
tends to hold back too easily.

339
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,288
To your loved ones,

340
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:28,764
express

341
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,287
your true feelings honestly.

342
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:34,061
So you'll find happiness.

343
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:39,912
Your kindness and consideration

344
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,061
are also part of your charm, Mahiro.

345
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,014
Isn't that right,

346
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:45,991
Souta-kun?

347
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:46,849
Huh?

348
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:50,428
Oh...

349
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:53,530
Yeah.

350
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:57,201
Because Mahiro is like this,

351
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,709
that's why Grandma trusted you

352
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,459
with the house key.

353
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:07,037
You mistook me for a thief at first.

354
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,147
You did the same!

355
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,303
Oh no!

356
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:14,420
I almost forgot something important!

357
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,381
What is it?

358
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:16,319
What is it?

359
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:19,243
When it comes to hot pot,
you can't forget the finishing touch!

360
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:26,690
Ryu-san really goes at his own pace,

361
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:27,715
doesn't he?

362
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:31,108
Yes.

363
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:32,061
But.

364
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:35,014
But I never would have

365
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,326
imagined he had such a past.

366
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:39,678
Such a past?

367
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:42,842
Nothing...

368
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,069
It's...

369
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,116
How should I say it?

370
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,349
Sorry to keep you waiting!

371
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,358
Here.

372
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,389
It's time for the climax of the hot pot.

373
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:58,967
The noodles

374
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:01,686
you eat with this soup are the best!

375
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:04,069
It's the best.

376
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,115
Dropping the egg in

377
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,482
at the end is the key.

378
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:13,928
Alright.

379
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,034
Ryu-san, thanks for the food.

380
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,264
It was so delicious!

381
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,943
What a relief!

382
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:45,975
I'm stuffed.

383
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:48,834
So sleepy.

384
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:50,530
Hey.

385
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,045
Souta-kun.

386
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:54,115
Can I stay over?

387
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:55,045
Huh?

388
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,818
Sure. There are futons here.

389
00:19:58,701 --> 00:19:59,764
I'm going home.

390
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:02,608
Mahiro must stay over as well.

391
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,967
Ryu-san...

392
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,506
Ryu-san.

393
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,428
Look, I laid out a futon.

394
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:13,366
Alrighty.

395
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,367
Wait! That's my futon!

396
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:16,967
I wish you happiness.

397
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,694
Then,

398
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,209
I'll sleep here.

399
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,287
What is my heart throbbing for?

400
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,405
The feeling of falling in love,

401
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,084
be it a minority

402
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:53,772
or majority,

403
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:55,834
it does not matter.

404
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,662
It's a miracle to meet someone

405
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:01,780
who makes you feel that way.

406
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:22,717
Hey.

407
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,694
Already asleep?

408
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:53,435
Sorry, did I wake you up?

409
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,084
Oh, no.

410
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,787
What? Did you pretend to be asleep?

411
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,951
Do you want some?

412
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,076
Yeah.

413
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:18,795
Wait a moment.

414
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:28,936
Surprisingly, they go so well.

415
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,858
It changed a lot.

416
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:42,303
It's tasty.

417
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,217
I know, right?

418
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:01,420
Hey.

419
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:06,944
Would you

420
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:09,108
like to try again?

421
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:10,756
The hot pot party?

422
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,530
That's not it.

423
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:13,787
What is it?

424
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:28,045
Kissing.

425
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:37,530
(Next episode)

426
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:38,263
Heart broken.

427
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:40,350
One-sided love?

428
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:42,483
If you're serious, you lose.

429
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:43,904
I'm serious about it.

430
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:46,303
It's not like he likes me.

431
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:47,266
My heart aches.

432
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,273
It hurts.

433
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:50,209
(This is a fictional work)
Maybe it's not a misunderstanding.

434
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,149
(This is a fictional work)
Quit fooling around!
