1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:01,906
Would you...

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:04,031
like to try again?

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:05,648
The hot pot party?

4
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:07,453
That's not it.

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,820
Kissing.

6
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,531
What do you think you're doing?

7
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:25,703
Huh?

8
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,891
- What do you mean?
- Do you...

9
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:33,555
like me?

10
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,070
No...

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,664
- That's why...
- Just stop it!

12
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:44,172
What was that for?

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,984
If you don't like me,
don't do this kind of thing.

14
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:55,398
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,430
I'm going home first.

16
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,023
Hold on...

17
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,234
Wait!

18
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:07,859
Tell Ryu-san I'm sorry.

19
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,008
Why are you angry?

20
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,682
I won't understand unless you tell me.

21
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:14,557
Even if I say it, you won't understand.

22
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:20,898
What's with him?

23
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:28,515
What's wrong?

24
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:36,367
Did something happen?

25
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:43,398
And Mahiro...?

26
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,750
Just now he...

27
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,828
Did he really go home?

28
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:53,633
Seems like it.

29
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,695
What happened?

30
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,453
I don't know.

31
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,430
Hey, Souta-kun.

32
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,063
Why...

33
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,094
Why...

34
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,133
I don't get it.

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,914
"Naked Dining"

36
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:09,781
"Episode 8 The taste of adult suki"

37
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,211
Hey, Souta-kun.

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,391
It's time for me to go home.

39
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,133
Why did you leave me behind?

40
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:02,945
Mahiro.

41
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:07,945
I'm going out for deliveries.

42
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,109
What happened?

43
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,609
Did he...

44
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:22,766
say anything?

45
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,109
Nothing.

46
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,219
What happened?

47
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,813
Ugh.

48
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:45,656
Do you

49
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,164
like me?

50
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,406
That's why I wanted to make sure.

51
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,492
A kiss?

52
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:11,414
What?

53
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:13,140
Souta-kun tried to kissed you...

54
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:13,976
Shhh!

55
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,164
Keep your voice down.

56
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:22,594
What?

57
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,172
Well, I mean...

58
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,695
if someone you like tries to kiss you...

59
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,398
You know?

60
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:32,773
But...

61
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:36,398
it doesn't mean he actually likes me.

62
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:37,977
You don't know that for sure.

63
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:39,343
I do know.

64
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,805
I know because I love him.

65
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,602
What a troublesome kid.

66
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,722
Could it be that he thought

67
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:03,207
I was just teasing him?

68
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,617
That was why he got angry like that...

69
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,031
Alright.

70
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,766
After Taiwanese hot pot...

71
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,063
(Suki naam and Thai suki sauce)
Suki naam...

72
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,875
(Suki naam and Thai suki sauce)
Thai cuisine?

73
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,453
Hello, Miki fruit and vegetable store.

74
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:55,664
Ah.

75
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,563
Souta-kun.

76
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:00,734
Huh?

77
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,033
Mahiro?

78
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,172
He's bit busy right now.

79
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:10,445
Yeah.

80
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,679
Yes.

81
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:16,906
Understood.

82
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,734
I'll tell him.

83
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,430
(Sounds like 'like' in Japanese)
He said suki.

84
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:25,727
Oh my.

85
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,508
Somebody's flustered.

86
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:39,883
What?

87
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,211
(Suki naam)
These are the ingredients for suki naam.

88
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:44,383
Well then, I leave the delivery to you.

89
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,391
Huh? No way.

90
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:47,813
Ryu-san, you should go.

91
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:48,953
No can do.

92
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,469
Why?

93
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,164
He wants the delivery

94
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,367
to be done by Mahiro.

95
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:55,802
But...

96
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:56,875
No buts.

97
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,086
Isn't the reunion with Souta-kun

98
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,297
a miracle for you?

99
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,820
I understand that it's scary,

100
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:05,930
but

101
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:08,953
you can do it!

102
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,421
Express your feelings properly.

103
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,078
Is it okay if...

104
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,414
you end up with regret like me?

105
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:32,929
What kind of face

106
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:34,602
should I make when I see him?

107
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,031
It's okay.

108
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,367
Calm down.

109
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,164
Just be honest about

110
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,047
how I truly feel.

111
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:51,742
You got this, no worries!

112
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:53,609
You got this, no worries!

113
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,094
Here are the items you ordered.

114
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:12,273
Thank you.

115
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,313
You can pay later, it's fine.

116
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,351
Wait.

117
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,703
It hurts.

118
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:27,047
Ah.

119
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,273
Sorry.

120
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:33,211
Don't go!

121
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,711
Let's cook together, like we always do.

122
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:41,922
How...

123
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,031
can I do it alone?

124
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,797
Conveniently using me like that...

125
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,398
I want to cook with you, Mahiro!

126
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,188
I want us to cook together!

127
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:03,828
Is that bad?

128
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:09,968
The seventh dish of our culinary journey

129
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,867
is Thai-style sukiyaki for one person.

130
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:12,875
(Thai suki sauce)
Suki naam.

131
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:16,117
Does that mean it's sukiyaki?

132
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:16,914
No.

133
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,280
Well, to be precise,

134
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,172
'naam' means putting soup in.

135
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:22,336
So...

136
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:24,484
suki is sukiyaki then?

137
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:25,117
Yeah.

138
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:26,937
It seems that the 'suki' in Thai suki

139
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,476
comes from the word 'sukiyaki'.

140
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,734
Wow.

141
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,187
By the way, suki without soup

142
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,210
is called 'suki hang'.

143
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,453
Hang is without soup...

144
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:39,922
Did I say it correctly?

145
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:42,875
Well, let's get started.

146
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,772
Wait. Answer me first.

147
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:45,664
No.

148
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:46,758
What's wrong?

149
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:47,594
Stingy.

150
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,594
What are you saying...

151
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:51,398
Let's get started already.

152
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:04,739
Yeah, looks about right.

153
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,169
It's not eaten by dipping

154
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,183
it in a raw egg?

155
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:13,785
Yes.

156
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,434
We'll add this egg-coated pork

157
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,450
to the soup,

158
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,707
and then add the vegetables as well.

159
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:21,099
It's completely different

160
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,347
from Japanese sukiyaki.

161
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,223
Yeah.

162
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,082
It's closer to a spicy vermicelli stew.

163
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,090
Once the vermicelli is cooked,

164
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:42,871
it's done.

165
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:44,199
Oh.

166
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:46,489
It seems easier than I thought.

167
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:50,098
You can make it on your own next time.

168
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:51,387
Huh?

169
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:53,176
No way.

170
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:54,879
Let's cook together.

171
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,236
There are still three dishes left.

172
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,348
That's not what I meant.

173
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,278
You mean suki?

174
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:08,817
Yeah.

175
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:10,348
Oh.

176
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:22,559
You know...

177
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,239
Huh?

178
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:28,754
Yesterday...

179
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:31,621
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:35,871
It's fine.

181
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:36,941
Forget it.

182
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:39,504
I wasn't fooling around with you.

183
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,364
Since that day...

184
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,762
Ever since you said you kissed me.

185
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,230
The feeling around here

186
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,473
is non-stop tense.

187
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:56,153
The feeling of liking someone...

188
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:57,949
I don't quite understand it.

189
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,495
Even so,

190
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:01,840
I wondered if liking men

191
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:04,004
would be possible for me.

192
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,285
But when I'm with you,

193
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:07,293
it's really fun.

194
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,567
And I always want to cook together.

195
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,347
I've been wondering about

196
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,176
what this feeling is.

197
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,637
I really don't understand.

198
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,887
Is it friendship?

199
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:19,793
Or what is it?

200
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:21,206
These thoughts

201
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:23,317
are fighting nonstop in my mind.

202
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,660
Enough.

203
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,692
I understand how you feel.

204
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:27,824
You don't get it at all.

205
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,066
Please hear me out first!

206
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,574
I said enough already.

207
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:35,098
I wanted to make sure!

208
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:39,567
I wanted to figure out what this...

209
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,137
uneasy feeling was all about!

210
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,138
So you gave me a kiss.

211
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:49,543
Yeah.

212
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,270
After you make sure,

213
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:58,426
what if it's not?

214
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,152
Huh?

215
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:12,817
After making sure,

216
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,606
and realizing it wasn't the case,

217
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:23,020
when that time comes,

218
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,543
what will you say to me?

219
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:31,824
I...

220
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,871
You see...

221
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:40,926
You're the worst.

222
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,636
Why did it turn out like this?

223
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:32,473
(Thai suki sauce recipe)

224
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:54,701
After you make sure,

225
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,881
what if it's not?

226
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:02,006
After kissing,

227
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:04,599
after making sure,

228
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,443
and realizing it wasn't the case...

229
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,959
Don't jump to conclusions!

230
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:21,404
(Thai suki sauce)

231
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:29,224
I...

232
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:34,631
I...

233
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,084
I...

234
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,349
Why am I...

235
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,662
why am I always like this...

236
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:05,631
Calm down,

237
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:06,662
Mahiro.

238
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:09,529
Souta-kun

239
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:13,045
is trying to face you, right?

240
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:16,967
But...

241
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,731
What does it mean to make sure?

242
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:26,084
What if it turns out to be different...?

243
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,560
Because he,

244
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:34,740
Souta is

245
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:39,178
different from me and Ryu-san.

246
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:44,318
It's obvious that he's different.

247
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,310
You knew that

248
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,326
from the beginning, right?

249
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,928
But

250
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,904
you still fell for him knowing that.

251
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,224
That's true.

252
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:08,053
I know that,

253
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:12,795
because I know, that's why it's scary...

254
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:15,474
Mahiro.

255
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,506
I should have never liked him.

256
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,584
If I knew I would feel like this,

257
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,279
I should have never liked him.

258
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:53,490
Ryu-san.

259
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:56,998
It hurts...

260
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,592
It's painful...

261
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,560
I understand.

262
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,060
I understand.

263
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,146
Cry as much as you want.

264
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:17,553
What the heck was that?

265
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,313
Switching when it didn't work out here.

266
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,076
Isn't that too fast?

267
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:25,115
What's wrong?

268
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,865
Did you get cheated on?

269
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,685
I was serious with it, you know?

270
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:30,826
Huh?

271
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:32,412
Huh?

272
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:34,607
Serious about what?

273
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,529
Oh, I...

274
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,373
Yesterday,

275
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,146
I got way too into gaming, you see.

276
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:46,271
Yeah.

277
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:48,512
- The one that charges you, right?
- Yeah.

278
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,763
Play in moderation.

279
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:50,654
Right.

280
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,271
If you're too serious about it,

281
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:53,296
you lose.

282
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,756
Is that so?

283
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:07,201
I lost already?

284
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:40,634
It's unusual to see you

285
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:42,298
working overtime, Ichijou-san.

286
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,451
It's just my usual routine.

287
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:46,775
But you usually leave

288
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,118
the office on time, right?

289
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:50,342
That's just for appearances.

290
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:52,638
What do you mean?

291
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:54,779
Ah...

292
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,881
No, it's nothing.

293
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:03,787
If you don't mind,

294
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:05,833
want to talk about it?

295
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,763
Then...

296
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:10,553
Excuse me.

297
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,537
I'll leave, then.

298
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:25,021
I got rejected.

299
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:28,670
You got rejected?

300
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:31,178
I haven't confessed yet.

301
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,787
So, it was unrequited love?

302
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:45,693
Shimizu-san,

303
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:47,099
are you free after this?

304
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:49,240
I am...

305
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:51,888
How about a drink?

306
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:53,574
Join me for a drinking session.

307
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,199
I'm fine with that.

308
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,631
But I don't want

309
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,490
to be just a drinking buddy.

310
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,240
Alright, understood.

311
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:03,004
I'll treat you to some tasty food too.

312
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:04,255
That's not what I meant.

313
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,646
Don't treat me as drinking buddy,

314
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:12,842
but as a lover.

315
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:15,263
Huh?

316
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,435
This time,

317
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,902
it's not an act.

318
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,185
Please...

319
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:26,420
become...

320
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,349
my real lover.

321
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:37,521
(Next episode)

322
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:38,435
We are...

323
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,151
really going out.

324
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,722
Getting closer after quarreling

325
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,153
for the first time.

326
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:45,294
Regretting after all this time...

327
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:46,076
Ichijou-san

328
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,053
isn't a pro at love, right?

329
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:49,773
Everything that happened,

330
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,375
please pretend it ever happened.

331
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,375
(This is a work of fiction)
