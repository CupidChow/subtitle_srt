1
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:02,578
Ichijou-san.

2
00:00:03,156 --> 00:00:03,875
Yes?

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,461
What should I do?

4
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:12,273
Could you make some time

5
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:14,180
for me this weekend?

6
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:16,953
This weekend?

7
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,117
It would be nice

8
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,117
if you clock out early next time.

9
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:23,210
Actually,

10
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:29,336
I have to work on the holiday alone
with the section chief this Sunday.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,445
With Teshigawara?

12
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,898
I need your help.

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,810
He isn't easy to deal with.

14
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:38,953
That's not it.

15
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,218
Recently, the section chief...

16
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:48,547
I do feel bad for your girlfriend,

17
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,187
but it's only this Sunday.

18
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:51,695
Can you help me?

19
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:52,750
No.

20
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:54,843
It's not about a girlfriend or anything...

21
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:56,164
If that's the case...

22
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:58,383
Ichijou!

23
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:00,067
Teshi called for you.

24
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:00,802
I'll be there.

25
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,826
Sorry, this weekend

26
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,654
I'm busy with stuff at home.

27
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,662
I really am sorry.

28
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:14,310
What's wrong?

29
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:16,170
Nothing.

30
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,638
Nothing.

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,044
It's finally over!

32
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:36,170
After all, the weekend

33
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:40,795
is the time to release stress from work.

34
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:04,146
"Naked Dining"

35
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:08,849
"Episode 4 Satay
What's a love-triangle like?"

36
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,552
The third item on the cooking trip

37
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:12,827
is a Malaysian hot pot dish,

38
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:13,936
Satay chayrup.

39
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,490
Put seafood and vegetables on a skewer,

40
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:18,389
then dip them into the soup and eat.

41
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:19,830
(Satay chayrup with satay sauce)
It's a local hotpot.

42
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:22,412
The ingredients for today are

43
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,013
chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms.

44
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,118
But you can also put whatever you like.

45
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,429
(Satay sauce)
Today we're going to use this.

46
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:29,388
(Satay sauce)

47
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,358
satay sauce.

48
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:31,679
Satay?

49
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,194
In Malaysia,

50
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,459
they marinate the meat and skewer them.

51
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,233
Then dip in peanut sauce

52
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,938
and eat it like that.

53
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,669
But we'll make it a dipping sauce.

54
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,936
Sounds delicious.

55
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:42,444
Yeah.

56
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,429
Now then...

57
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:53,202
By the way,

58
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,458
you worked overtime again this week?

59
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,022
Oh, the suit, huh?

60
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,280
Yeah.

61
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,982
There were many things to do.

62
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,952
I almost couldn't make it here.

63
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,311
Sounds tough.

64
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,210
Yeah.

65
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,873
I was given an insane amount

66
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:07,952
of work by my boss,

67
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:09,609
and a junior colleague asked me

68
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:10,899
to work on my day off.

69
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:12,897
- A junior?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,069
"I do feel bad for your girlfriend."

71
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,343
Girlfriend?

72
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,554
No.

73
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:22,031
I've been declining colleagues'
invitations for a while.

74
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,689
And before I knew it, everyone thought I
was spending my weekends with a girlfriend.

75
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:27,099
Oh.

76
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:30,124
Come to think of it,

77
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:33,054
should I introduce you to them?

78
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,186
Huh?

79
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,014
Spending the weekend together,

80
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:39,421
it's just us men.

81
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,717
What the heck are you talking about?

82
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:47,374
Then...

83
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:48,796
your girlfriend...

84
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,890
We broke up a long time ago.

85
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,631
I'm busy with work,

86
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:54,389
and I don't feel like it.

87
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,889
Don't feel like what?

88
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,014
It's a hassle, isn't it?

89
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,364
When it was an anniversary,

90
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,749
we had to go on a date.

91
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,678
I wish I could just say:
'Let's relax at home together.'

92
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,467
Then just ask her to relax at home.

93
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:13,897
Huh?

94
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,966
You got tired from prioritizing
others' needs, right?

95
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,569
You should find someone who
accepts you for who you are.

96
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:24,225
I think it's nice that way.

97
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:30,921
Mahiro,

98
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,865
do you have someone like that?

99
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:34,936
Huh?

100
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,179
I'm not dating anyone.

101
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,843
But a crush...

102
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:46,936
Yeah,

103
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,506
I guess.

104
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,660
Is that so?

105
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,474
If you do it like that, you might
accidentally poke your finger.

106
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,272
This is surprisingly difficult.

107
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:17,819
What are you doing?

108
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,510
Removing the spine of the shrimp.

109
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:24,491
I want to try it, too!

110
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:25,202
Sure.

111
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,249
Hold your left hand like this.

112
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,889
- Like this?
- Yes, grip it tightly.

113
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:29,936
And then

114
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,194
use your right hand...

115
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,857
poke...

116
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,944
in here.

117
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:34,882
Insert it.

118
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,499
- Insert?
- Yes.

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,514
And then...

120
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,820
Pull it out from the top.

121
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:41,827
- Wow, it's out.
- Yes.

122
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,030
Yeah.

123
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,522
It's out.

124
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:54,655
Sorry.

125
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:03,122
Sorry.

126
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:10,223
Looks delicious.

127
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,567
Mahiro, today let's...

128
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:13,316
Hold on.

129
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,161
Hello.

130
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:20,739
Riho-chan?

131
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:21,544
Yeah.

132
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,450
I'll come by right now.

133
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:24,583
Sure.

134
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:25,973
Yes.

135
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,942
Are you going to...

136
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:32,223
Yeah.

137
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:33,458
Work.

138
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:34,473
Is that so?

139
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:35,629
Bye.

140
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:36,653
Yeah.

141
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,387
Who are you?

142
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,536
Since I'm all alone...

143
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:58,551
let's do it.

144
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:18,723
No,

145
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:19,816
this is...

146
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm just changing before eating.

147
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:23,347
When I was about to leave,

148
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:25,223
she was in front of the house...

149
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,902
Shimizu-san?

150
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,739
I beg you!

151
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:35,175
Please come to work the weekend
with me tomorrow!

152
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,239
I know it sounds unreasonable,

153
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,411
but this is an emergency.

154
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,536
Emergency?

155
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:41,684
The thing is...

156
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:45,200
Huh?

157
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,848
It smells nice.

158
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,707
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:00,325
I haven't eaten anything since morning.

160
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,669
So that's what happened.

161
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,676
Can I deliver in the evening instead?

162
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:06,684
Oh, I'll do it.

163
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:07,379
Yeah.

164
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:08,996
I'm sorry, Riho-chan.

165
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,692
Yeah.

166
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,645
Yes.

167
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,426
Everything good?

168
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:14,762
Yeah.

169
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:15,691
No problem.

170
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:16,754
You're a big help.

171
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,238
If I was alone then...

172
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,621
Ichijou-san and Mahiro-san,

173
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,059
let's hurry up and eat.

174
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,997
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

175
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,106
It's spicy,

176
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,668
but it's mild and easy to eat.

177
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:40,341
It's rich, like sesame sauce.

178
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,676
The base of the soup stock is peanut sauce.

179
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,770
By the way, Shimizu-san,

180
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,949
the emergency you mentioned earlier...?

181
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,488
That's right, the main topic!

182
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,520
It's so tasty that I completely forgot.

183
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,442
The thing is.

184
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,160
I...

185
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,543
I'm being targeted by the section chief.

186
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:03,825
Huh?

187
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:06,426
As in romantically?

188
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,113
About a month ago,

189
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,863
we happened to be on the way home together,

190
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,457
so we had a meal together

191
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:16,153
and then parted ways.

192
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:17,606
But then after that...

193
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,036
Yes. I got it.

194
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:20,371
I'll give it to Mr. Suzuki,

195
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,668
the one in charge.

196
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:23,700
Suzuki-san is on a long vacation.

197
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,065
Seems like a honeymoon.

198
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,597
Oh, is that so?

199
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,387
- Then...
- Speaking of which,

200
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:30,442
what about Shimizu-san?

201
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,325
Yes?

202
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,231
Any plans for getting married?

203
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,254
Are you dating someone?

204
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,035
No.

205
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:41,348
Is that so?

206
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,598
I thought he only wanted to

207
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,129
ask if I was dating someone.

208
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,785
Thanks for your hard work.

209
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,520
I'll be off first.

210
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,848
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

211
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,715
Shimizu-san!

212
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:06,294
What a coincidence.

213
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,692
If you don't mind,

214
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,544
let's have a meal together again.

215
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:13,606
Oh...

216
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,169
Today,

217
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:17,317
I'm meeting with my friends.

218
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,278
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:22,684
Shimizu-san!

220
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,512
Another coincidence, huh?

221
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:27,801
If you don't mind,

222
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,676
- Let's have...
- Today,

223
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,731
I have a family business to attend.

224
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,262
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:35,981
Thanks for your hard work.

226
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,176
Thanks for your hard work.

227
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,364
For some reason, coincidences piled up,

228
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,590
and I was invited to dinner many times.

229
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:44,340
Bon appetit.

230
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,715
Looks delicious.

231
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:48,731
You cooked it?

232
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:50,372
Yes.

233
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:52,207
How nice.

234
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,684
I want a wife who is good at cooking, too.

235
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,786
Oh!

236
00:10:57,926 --> 00:10:59,458
That tamagoyaki

237
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,317
looks so delicious.

238
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:07,101
Even though it wasn't direct, he was
basically screaming "Please be my wife!"

239
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,708
So yeah,

240
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:13,465
I'm not misunderstanding things, right?

241
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:16,309
It seems like...

242
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,395
you're totally being targeted.

243
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,817
Right?

244
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,652
It's impossible for the two of us to go
to work on a holiday alone like this.

245
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:25,082
It's an emergency!

246
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,918
But Teshigawara-san didn't
have any ill intentions either.

247
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,785
That's why I feel troubled.

248
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,676
I want to end this with no hard feelings,

249
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:33,207
but since he didn't confess,

250
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:34,512
I can't refuse him.

251
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:37,871
Why don't you go to work

252
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:38,996
with her tomorrow?

253
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,776
I feel sorry for Komachi-chan.

254
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,089
Mahiro-san, you're such a nice person!

255
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:45,200
But even if we survive tomorrow,

256
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,325
It's only a temporary fix.

257
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,544
That's right.

258
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:51,395
So, I have a favor to ask...

259
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:52,911
A favor?

260
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:56,450
Can you pretend

261
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,114
to be my boyfriend?

262
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,863
Pretend to be your boyfriend?

263
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,145
If Ichijou-san

264
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:06,988
pretends to be my boyfriend,

265
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,520
I can completely repel him.

266
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,152
At this rate,

267
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:13,263
it'll cause me trouble when I go to work.

268
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,223
But that's...

269
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,129
Asking you would be
rude to your girlfriend, right?

270
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,996
Like I said, it's not about that.

271
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:22,629
Huh?

272
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,114
I never said a single word

273
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:25,708
about having a lover.

274
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:26,411
Huh?

275
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,794
You don't have one?

276
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:28,652
Everyone was...

277
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,027
That's just what everyone thinks.

278
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:32,809
Then please!

279
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,692
Please pretend to be my boyfriend!

280
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:37,926
If it's you, Ichijou-san,

281
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:39,840
just like your job,

282
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,998
you'll do it perfectly for sure.

283
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:50,692
Well,

284
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,309
it's just a one-time
thing, isn't it?

285
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:55,583
It's not like you're dating for real.

286
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,934
Why don't you help her?

287
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,528
Mahiro-san, you're a really good person!

288
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,645
I got it.

289
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:07,083
Only this once.

290
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:08,950
Thank you very much!

291
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:10,950
Please take care of me tomorrow!

292
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:11,590
Yeah.

293
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,551
If you don't mind, I'll handle it.

294
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:15,747
Okay.

295
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,122
- Alright, then.
- Yes.

296
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,775
Oh, it's a mushroom. I'll take it, then.

297
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,743
You don't eat mushroom, right?

298
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,102
Yes, thanks.

299
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:28,157
- Let's see.
- Is that so?

300
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:30,743
It's not like I can't eat it at all.

301
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:31,868
Here.

302
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:34,376
You like shrimp, right? Please eat.

303
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:35,907
How did you know that?

304
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:36,954
Of course I know!

305
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,063
How many years have we been together?

306
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:45,548
Good morning, Shimizu-

307
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:47,265
Good morning.

308
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,376
Good morning.

309
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,259
Ichijou.

310
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:51,978
Why...

311
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:53,763
It looks like it's going to be hard,

312
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:54,842
so I'm here to help.

313
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,072
Is that so?

314
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,502
(No worries, I got this!)

315
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,969
(No worries, I got this!)

316
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:12,595
Alright.

317
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:17,899
Listen,

318
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,525
the key is to make it look

319
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,230
as natural as possible!

320
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,111
Step one,

321
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:24,806
sticky notes!

322
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:32,906
Section chief,

323
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,868
these documents...

324
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:35,501
(Souta, looking forward to tonight)

325
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,946
(Souta, looking forward to tonight)
Deliberately let him see

326
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,868
private communication with sticky notes.

327
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:41,392
This is the classic
move of office romances.

328
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:47,048
Deliberately showing the sticky
notes will show him that we're dating.

329
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:49,994
Oh.

330
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:51,658
Not that one.

331
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,463
This set.

332
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,088
Thank you.

333
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,565
Please check them.

334
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,549
Step two,

335
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,479
being on a first name basis!

336
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,151
Let's practice.

337
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,807
- Practice?
- Yes.

338
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,455
Let's start, then.

339
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,572
Hey, Souta.

340
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,307
Komachi.

341
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,937
Hey, Souta.

342
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:24,907
Komachi.

343
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,173
Souta.

344
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:27,072
Komachi.

345
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,291
- Please relax a bit.
- Alright.

346
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:31,072
Souta.

347
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:31,806
Komachi.

348
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,205
- That was nice!
- Really?

349
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,806
Souta.

350
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:35,744
Komachi.

351
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:41,834
Ko...

352
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:44,021
Koma...

353
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:49,135
You see, this is...

354
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:49,799
Huh?

355
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:51,362
What's wrong, Souta?

356
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:52,924
I don't understand this part.

357
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,213
I had a feeling Komachi will know.

358
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,166
Oh, Souta, give it to me.

359
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,885
And the piece de resistance,

360
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,416
Step three~

361
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,877
What should we have for dinner?

362
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,533
The usual restaurant?

363
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:14,416
Stay like this and I'll touch your arm,

364
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,018
bring your face closer.

365
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:16,681
Wait!

366
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,073
What's wrong?

367
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,729
You don't have to go that far, right?

368
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,705
Just in case, just in case!

369
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,142
The more intimate, the better!

370
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:26,861
Okay.

371
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,651
I want...

372
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:36,756
I'm thinking Komachi's
meat and potato stew.

373
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:40,791
Oh my, Souta, you...

374
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:02,354
Section chief,

375
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:04,838
about these documents.

376
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,955
Want a drink?

377
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:08,174
My treat.

378
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,846
Thank you very much.

379
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,080
Dang it.

380
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:19,134
You should've told me sooner

381
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:20,454
that you guys are dating.

382
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:22,276
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,900
Because she went out to eat with me,

384
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,323
it gave me hope.

385
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,361
That day

386
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,385
was really fun.

387
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:46,651
Even though it was a silly conversation,

388
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:48,604
but when I saw her smile,

389
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,924
the food I ate felt more delicious.

390
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:53,196
It was the only time

391
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,221
I could forget about work.

392
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,611
When I thought about us

393
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,861
hanging out again,

394
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,049
it felt fun.

395
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,055
I couldn't help

396
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:08,510
feeling excited and I forgot my own age.

397
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:23,252
I'll be off first.

398
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,518
Sorry for a lot things.

399
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,252
Huh?

400
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,666
Working on a holiday is hard,

401
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:36,448
isn't it?

402
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,315
Not at all.

403
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:46,099
I'll leave the rest

404
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:49,242
to the excellent Ichijou.

405
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:52,276
Yes.

406
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,494
I'll do the rest.

407
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,490
(Reference from the central bank institution)
Thanks for your hard work.

408
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:57,974
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

409
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:02,893
Ichijou-san.

410
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:05,408
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,002
And thank you.

412
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:08,564
Oh.

413
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,330
What a relief.

414
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,400
Yes.

415
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,315
Bon appetit.

416
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,299
Why

417
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,315
don't I feel liberated

418
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:09,166
like usual?

419
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,845
(How was pretending?)

420
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:20,283
It's not something I even care about.

421
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:23,127
(How was pretending?)

422
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,440
That's right.

423
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,664
The moon is beautiful, isn't it?

424
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:50,557
Yes.

425
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,643
In Japan

426
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,893
it means "I love you",

427
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,299
right?

428
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:58,471
Huh?

429
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:00,362
You don't know?

430
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,557
Natsume Soseki.

431
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:04,970
"I love you"

432
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:07,237
means the moon is beautiful.

433
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:08,565
That's what it means.

434
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:10,033
It's a famous line.

435
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:11,783
Is that so?

436
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:12,619
What?

437
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,627
Why do I, a foreigner,
know but you don't?

438
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,049
Oh no.

439
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,362
I already sent it.

440
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,721
It's fine, isn't it?

441
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,463
The moon is so beautiful.

442
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,588
Mahiro.

443
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,291
What should I do?

444
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,057
Even though it was a silly conversation,

445
00:21:40,221 --> 00:21:42,057
when I saw her smile,

446
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,682
the food I ate felt more delicious.

447
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,931
- When I thought about us
hanging out again, it felt fun.

448
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,306
(Ichijou Souta, please take care of me)

449
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,509
(It's Mahiro, please take care of me,
too)

450
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,533
(Today)

451
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,563
(I'll visit again next weekend
to have a meal together)

452
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,643
- When I saw her smile...

453
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:19,682
Huh?

454
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:22,862
(have a meal together)
Wanting to eat together...

455
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,752
I'm just like the section chief...

456
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:28,908
Like I think of Mahiro as...

457
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:32,291
I'm not dating anyone.

458
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:35,823
But a crush... yeah.

459
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:40,151
You should find someone who
accepts you for who you are.

460
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:42,791
I think it's nice that way.

461
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:45,088
No way.

462
00:23:00,307 --> 00:23:01,244
Recently,

463
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:03,023
you seem to be in a good mood.

464
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,666
That's nice.

465
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:06,487
No?

466
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,346
See?

467
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,158
You're enjoying yourself.

468
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:17,907
(The moon is beautiful here, too)

469
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,963
The moon is beautiful here, too.

470
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,737
(Moonlight)
Oh no, I forgot it.

471
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:37,901
(Next episode)

472
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,658
Tashi Delek.

473
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:40,931
It must be Bhutan.

474
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:41,938
It's over.

475
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:44,424
You haven't changed at all.

476
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,846
Isn't that a date?

477
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:46,799
I'm glad.

478
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:48,557
that you remember me.

479
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,672
Why is my heart beating?
