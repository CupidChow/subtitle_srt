1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,062
Aren’t you going to cook it?

2
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:05,055
I think it's important

3
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,056
to cherish things that others value.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,954
I want to see through the cooking trip

5
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:12,789
that Grandma cherished until the end.

6
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,273
So, please!

7
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,484
Sell me the ingredients!

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:39,892
"Naked Dining"
"Episode 3 Feelings like Tajin powder"

9
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:46,939
Section chief.

10
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,970
Here's the report on the
financial meeting and...

11
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,899
the proposal for Sanisani-chan's
school visit project.

12
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,462
Here is the composition table for
the next issue of the PR magazine.

13
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:58,290
As expected, you work fast.

14
00:00:58,337 --> 00:00:59,560
Not at all.

15
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:01,462
Can I ask you to summarize

16
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,487
last month's public comments?

17
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,243
Yes?

18
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:07,859
By the end of this week.

19
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,195
By the end of this week....

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,889
Understood.

21
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:19,765
Seems like he's back
to normal this week.

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,872
Good.

23
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:24,165
I guess he made up with her.

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,986
What? How come it's you now?

25
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,625
You don't look happy. What's wrong?

26
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,215
I thought that was my chance.

27
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:31,587
What?

28
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:32,509
Shimizu-san.

29
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:33,492
Yes?

30
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:36,501
It would be nice if you
get work done faster.

31
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:40,758
(24 February)

32
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,861
Only one day left.

33
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:48,883
(18 February)

34
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,330
So, please!

35
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:52,884
Sell me the ingredients!

36
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,759
If possible, please teach me how to cook.

37
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,540
I want to make every last dish.

38
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,161
But you can change, can't you?

39
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:02,486
You noticed it.

40
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:10,908
Oh.

41
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,673
Since we're here, let's ask for it.

42
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:14,775
Huh?

43
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,689
Yoshiko-san!

44
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,611
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,580
You came from Tokyo?

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,634
Yes.

47
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:31,251
All the international
dishes Grandma made,

48
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,872
I want to try making them, too.

49
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:35,251
Traveling abroad by cooking,

50
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,868
how fitting of Mizuchi-chan.

51
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:38,267
What a great idea.

52
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:41,426
If you don't mind,

53
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:43,141
why don't you use my vegetables?

54
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:44,081
Really?

55
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,931
That's why you came here, right?

56
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:47,334
The secret's out.

57
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,719
Yes. Use a lot of force.

58
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,017
It's like a baby spring onion.

59
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,720
Isn't it cute?

60
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:01,619
It's so juicy.

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,955
Looks good.

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,587
It's hard to control the temperature

63
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,267
to grow it this far.

64
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,626
It has been nurtured with utmost care.

65
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,947
I'll make a great dish out of you.

66
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:19,603
(Fish market)

67
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,150
He's only good at cooking.

68
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:22,650
You chose someone suitable.

69
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,642
What do you mean by 'only'?

70
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,689
See? He doesn't speak nicely at all.

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,025
You also don't speak nicely as well.

72
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:32,572
Here.

73
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:33,868
I’m sure Mizuchi-san

74
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,712
must be happy having you visit.

75
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,548
She liked a lively atmosphere.

76
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,517
I hope you're right.

77
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,173
I'm glad since that house was

78
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,735
completely empty and lonely.

79
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:47,150
They say uninhabited
places deteriorate quickly.

80
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,517
Sorry. Wait a moment.

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,298
Okay.

82
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:00,290
Hey...

83
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,861
Did you clean the house

84
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,814
and the garden?

85
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,056
Mizuchi-san

86
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,939
always cleaned them,

87
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:10,947
so I...

88
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,267
Thank you.

89
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,431
Mahiro-kun.

90
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:17,189
Oh, sorry.

91
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,752
Everyone calls you that.

92
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:20,955
It's late but

93
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,555
my name is Ichijou Souta.

94
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,236
Yeah.

95
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,681
Is your name...

96
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,572
Miki Mahiro?

97
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,837
Well, yes...

98
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,033
I knew it.

99
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,351
Since the shop is called.

100
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,938
Miki Fruit and Vegetable Store.

101
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:39,845
So...

102
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,002
Miki-kun.

103
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,744
You can call me Mahiro.

104
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:45,533
That's what everyone calls me.

105
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:46,322
That so?

106
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,641
We're probably around the same age.

107
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,632
I got it.

108
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,478
Then, from now on,

109
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,044
I'll call you Mahiro.

110
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,595
Yeah.

111
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,595
I'll carry it.

112
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,017
That's alright.

113
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:12,282
Thank you.

114
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:16,970
Hey...

115
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,392
Seriously,

116
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,923
you're thin, but you're strong.

117
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,884
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,549
You look delicate,

119
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,298
but the other day I thought

120
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:29,618
I was going to be killed.

121
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,111
Well, I do lots of physical work.

122
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,689
We're going to use oil,

123
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,822
you should put it on.

124
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,695
You never worn an apron before?

125
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,360
Not since cooking classes.

126
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,064
Seriously?

127
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,806
Let me see.

128
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,635
Head over here,

129
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,103
arms over here.

130
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:09,580
Alright.

131
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:14,478
We need to tie the string, too.

132
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,197
By the way,

133
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,540
why are you wearing a suit on Saturday?

134
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,924
I was working overtime
until the morning.

135
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,228
What work?

136
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:27,713
Normal civil servant work.

137
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,775
Civil servants have to work overtime?

138
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:34,197
By the time I realized,
it was always like this.

139
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,767
You can't leave other people alone,

140
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:41,025
so you push yourself too hard, right?

141
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,634
How did you know?

142
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,564
Yes, that's the way it is.

143
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,267
Once I'm asked, I can't refuse,

144
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,400
so I'm always over capacity every week.

145
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:52,431
Sounds difficult.

146
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,119
And you, Mahiro?

147
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,525
Do you always work here?

148
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:59,049
I did get a job.

149
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,799
But I came back and
took over my mom's shop.

150
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,424
So it's your mother's shop.

151
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:05,728
Yeah.

152
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,548
She must be

153
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,940
having tea with Mizuchi-san
on the other side.

154
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:13,220
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,392
Don't be.

156
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,642
It's been a long time.

157
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,174
Shall we begin?

158
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:20,658
Yeah.

159
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:26,033
(Pescado frito with tajin powder
from Mexico) Mexico, Tajin powder...

160
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,392
Pescado frito.

161
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:30,283
What you need is

162
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:32,228
Mexican spice,

163
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,017
Tajin.

164
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:33,948
(Tajin powder)

165
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:38,367
First prepare the whitefish,

166
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,454
coat them with tajin

167
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,509
and all-purpose flour.

168
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:44,806
Fry it.

169
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,963
Dress with salsa.

170
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:49,205
Oh no.

171
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,017
I don't get this at all.

172
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,713
In other words,

173
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,759
it's a Mexican-style whitefish tempura.

174
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,041
It's not hard to make. Don't worry.

175
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:01,243
Please guide me, teacher.

176
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,549
You're exaggerating.

177
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:06,712
Let's prepare the whitefish first.

178
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,206
Cut it into bite-sized pieces.

179
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,306
Cut and sprinkle with tajin and flour.

180
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:12,658
Here, try it.

181
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:13,720
Sure.

182
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:22,900
Oh.

183
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,282
Put the skin side down and cut it,

184
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,770
starting from the flesh side,

185
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,754
and you'll be able to cut them cleanly.

186
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,020
Watch me.

187
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,697
Don't use the knife with force.

188
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,095
But cut it like this.

189
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:42,767
Mahiro.

190
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,791
So beautiful.

191
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:45,658
Huh?

192
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:46,502
Huh?

193
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,556
No. I mean your hand.

194
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:51,808
No. I mean your skill.

195
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,548
Just like a professional.

196
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,462
Then just say so!

197
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:58,078
But I just did.

198
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,298
Okay, try it.

199
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:04,923
Oh.

200
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,744
It's dangerous to hold like that.

201
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,457
Place your index finger lightly

202
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,215
on the back of the knife.

203
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,455
How?

204
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:16,736
Like this.

205
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:18,580
And then

206
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,673
relax your shoulders.

207
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,470
Just cut it.

208
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:24,040
Cut it.

209
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,181
Oh, you're right.

210
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:30,525
It's like I'm teaching a child.

211
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:32,572
It can't be helped, it's my first time.

212
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,111
What's next?

213
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:37,219
Wash your hands after
touching raw ingredients.

214
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,744
It's a basic hygiene practice.

215
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,884
Finish cutting first!

216
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:42,205
Yes.

217
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,252
This is the tajin powder.

218
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:53,384
It looks spicy.

219
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:59,025
Before frying the whitefish,

220
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:00,595
let's make salsa first.

221
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,093
Dice the tomatoes.

222
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,119
Spring onion,

223
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:06,446
coriander,

224
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,517
and then finely chop the jalapeno.

225
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,595
The spring onion is making my eyes tear up.

226
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,877
You're lying, right?

227
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:31,631
Sorry, I just wanted to try it out.

228
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,712
And then mix them up.

229
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:44,736
What about this?

230
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:46,673
The tortilla?

231
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,705
Lightly roast both sides
in a pan over low heat.

232
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:07,196
Should be done by now.

233
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,275
Dip the whitefish in the batter

234
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:11,587
and fry it.

235
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:13,041
Alright.

236
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:32,533
Don't laugh.

237
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,001
But it's...

238
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:36,002
Oh.

239
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:37,361
Huh?

240
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,627
Coriander.

241
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,384
Looks great!

242
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:01,127
I haven't had a freshly
deep-fried dish since high school.

243
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,837
Do you want to drink?

244
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,267
I'm alright.

245
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,431
I'm leaving now.

246
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,470
Oh? You're not eating first?

247
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:10,931
Oh.

248
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,033
I don't always eat like that, okay?

249
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:15,026
I'm always dressed.

250
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,556
I still have work.

251
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,994
Oh, is that so.

252
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:20,291
Bye.

253
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,127
Thanks for today,

254
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,510
for a lot of things.

255
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,451
Eat up quickly or it'll get cold.

256
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,207
Yeah.

257
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:29,938
Bye.

258
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:33,881
- Oh, wait.
- Hi, Mahiro!

259
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:36,002
Oh, Suzuki-san!

260
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,123
You're coming to the
Omusubi rice field tomorrow?

261
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,259
- Of course.
- Yes.

262
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:41,594
Get revenge, okay?

263
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,837
- I won't lose next time.
- Yeah.

264
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,809
Alright, then.

265
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,688
Wait.

266
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,744
What's happening tomorrow?

267
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,080
Oh,

268
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,119
there's a local producers'
information exchange meeting.

269
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:00,656
Although in the end,

270
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,982
it usually turns into a game

271
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,740
or just a drinking party.

272
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,002
Can I go too?

273
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,502
Huh?

274
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,330
I

275
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,181
Want to know more

276
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,994
about here where my grandma lived.

277
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:17,205
Is it okay?

278
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,478
Sure, of course.

279
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:23,261
See you tomorrow.

280
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:24,025
Yeah.

281
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:47,158
Looks tasty.

282
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,353
Then let's...

283
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:54,892
do it here.

284
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:19,032
Bon appetit.

285
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:31,564
Oh.

286
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,408
It's so good.

287
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,874
The coating is both soft and crispy.

288
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,682
Let's do this next.

289
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,009
Some salsa on top.

290
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:14,080
The coriander and spring onion are fantastic.

291
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,939
It feels just like Mexico in my mind.

292
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,994
Delicious.

293
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,517
Mahiro.

294
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,392
You were late.

295
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:54,947
I was so worried.

296
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:56,549
Sorry...

297
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,627
Something came up.

298
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:05,432
But

299
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,658
you look happy.

300
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,861
Is that so?

301
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,259
Huh?

302
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,306
Come to think of it,

303
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:16,259
the raw peppers that Mizuchi-san ordered,

304
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
- shall we cancel it?
- Oh, no!

305
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:20,830
He wanted it.

306
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,572
Huh?

307
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,712
Her grandson.

308
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,869
He said that

309
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,286
he wanted to cook instead of Mizuchi-san.

310
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:31,974
He also wanted to join tomorrow's meeting.

311
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:34,091
That's great.

312
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,076
Yeah.

313
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:46,576
I feel recharged.

314
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:49,701
My body.

315
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,693
A Korean customer

316
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,125
has placed an order requesting

317
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,912
that we continue producing aehobak.

318
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:06,865
Aehobak?

319
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:09,599
I guess it must be hard to find in Japan.

320
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,662
A vegetable like zucchini?

321
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,286
If they only need that amount,

322
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,497
then I can grow them.

323
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,404
Then we'll leave that to you, Suzuki-san.

324
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:18,951
I received a request from the Indian community

325
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:22,122
for growing a vegetable called "drumstick."

326
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:23,701
Drumstick?

327
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:24,630
Drumstick...

328
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:25,711
Never heard of it.

329
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,099
It's probably moringa,

330
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:31,904
a nutrient-dense super-food.

331
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,412
Drumstick is

332
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,095
is a young pod of moringa.

333
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,037
Like the green beans.

334
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,224
Seems like there are no farmers

335
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,732
cultivating a proper amount
of moringa in Kanto region.

336
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,076
That sounds interesting.

337
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,530
I'll look it up later.

338
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:46,131
Thank you so much.

339
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:55,166
That's so international.

340
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,490
They're doing something interesting, right?

341
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:00,037
Oh.

342
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:01,497
Yesterday...

343
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,896
Mahiro was the one who
set up these meetings.

344
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:06,461
- Is that so?
- Yes.

345
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,232
A Vietnamese exchange student was sad

346
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:13,413
because there is no cilantro in Japan.

347
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:14,677
They asked

348
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,147
if everyone would be willing

349
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,852
to try planting them,

350
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,852
The exchange student was very happy.

351
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:26,125
After that, Mahiro
suggested that we do it again,

352
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:30,712
and so that's how the Omusubi
rice field meeting came to exist.

353
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,055
Omusubi rice field meeting?

354
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:33,946
Yes.

355
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,555
Bring delicious food

356
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,305
to connect with people.

357
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:40,094
He said he wanted to
create a field like that.

358
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,476
You must be Mizuchi's grandson.

359
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,462
- What a good man.
- No.

360
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,102
You're from Tokyo, right?

361
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,257
What's your job?

362
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:55,009
I'm a civil servant.

363
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,305
If you don't mind, please have some

364
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:01,164
pickled turnips from my own fields.

365
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,725
Thank you very much.

366
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:04,876
I'll have some.

367
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,273
It's delicious.

368
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:10,915
You, do you have a wife?

369
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,568
I'm not married yet.

370
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,969
This simmered dish is good, too!

371
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,699
Both the potatoes and
carrots are from my field.

372
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:19,665
Thank you.

373
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,462
Come visit us next time.

374
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:23,337
I'll call my daughter over.

375
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:26,384
My granddaughter should
be closer in age to him.

376
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:27,994
That's not true.

377
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,335
Enough.

378
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,380
...Is it really not related?

379
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,590
He's a civil servant.

380
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,093
How nice.

381
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:41,514
Mahiro-kun, I'm sorry. I'm late!

382
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,462
Riho-chan.

383
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:45,810
You forgot didn't you?

384
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,187
No. Taste testing took a long time.

385
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,103
Alright.

386
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:54,235
Here.

387
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,278
Wow.

388
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:57,314
Delicious.

389
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,407
The sweetness and flavor are amazing!

390
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:02,034
It will definitely sell out in no time.

391
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:04,142
Congrats, Riho.

392
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,814
For Mahiro praising you.

393
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,075
If it doesn't sell,

394
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,711
Mahiro must take responsibility.

395
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,204
Yeah, I know.

396
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,627
I'll take responsibility.

397
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:14,352
Will it sell?

398
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:16,632
Don't worry. It'll sell for sure.

399
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:27,150
How was it?

400
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,415
Was it fun?

401
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:32,558
I was almost forced to go out with
some daughters and granddaughters.

402
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,312
It was pretty international.

403
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,908
Amazing.

404
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:41,664
This area has people

405
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,868
from various countries living here.

406
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,445
They share information on SNS

407
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,305
about the area and nearby places.

408
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,749
The world is closely connected.

409
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:55,421
It's amazing.

410
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,589
Isn't that right?

411
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,382
Mahiro, too.

412
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,469
You're amazing.

413
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:05,806
By the way,

414
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,434
was she okay?

415
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,621
Who?

416
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:10,978
The one who was late.

417
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,704
Oh, Riho-chan?

418
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:14,783
Yeah.

419
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:16,692
She drove here, so she'll be fine.

420
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:19,278
Is that so?

421
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,322
Why did you ask?

422
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:22,823
I was thinking...

423
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,242
if I got in your way?

424
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:26,911
Got in my way?

425
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,739
Oh. No.

426
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,999
It's not like that.

427
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:33,552
Is that so?

428
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,586
You guys seem close.

429
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,464
What about it?

430
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:43,177
You're overthinking it.

431
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,802
Don't misunderstand.

432
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:47,681
Is that so?

433
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:48,904
Yes.

434
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,349
What?

435
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:59,286
Why are you so upset?

436
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,942
I'm not upset.

437
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,865
Does it seem like I'm upset?

438
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,318
Yes!

439
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,405
When are you coming again?

440
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:18,212
I'll prepare the ingredients.

441
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,589
What about next Saturday?

442
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,007
So soon?

443
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,537
Are you busy?

444
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:25,990
- Then...
- No,

445
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,740
not at all.

446
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:30,638
Then

447
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:32,226
see you next week.

448
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:35,357
It would be nice

449
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:37,273
if you clock out early next time.

450
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,816
Yeah.

451
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,067
I'll try.

452
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:41,205
Also,

453
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:42,862
don't work too hard!

454
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,544
Ichijou-san.

455
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:17,963
Yes?

456
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:22,240
What should I do?

457
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:32,200
(NEXT EPISODE) Mahiro,
do you have someone like that?

458
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:33,871
A crush.

459
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:34,646
I do.

460
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,739
It means "I love you", right?

461
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:38,474
I think of Mahiro as...

462
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:39,864
Whenever I see his smile...

463
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,003
It's fun.

464
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,630
Please pretend to be my boyfriend.

465
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,340
Is that okay?

466
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:48,325
(MOMENT)

467
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,234
Ichijou-kun.

468
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:52,021
(This is a fictional work)
