1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:08,625
Huh?

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:10,679
No,

3
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,898
this is...

4
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:35,297
That was a dream, wasn't it?

5
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,578
But it felt strangely real

6
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,258
that feeling...

7
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:42,820
I had a dream.

8
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:43,867
A dream?

9
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:44,773
Yeah.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,508
Don't know why she was so mad with me.

11
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,609
Beyoncé.

12
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:51,234
Beyoncé?

13
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:52,195
Yeah.

14
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:53,852
She persistently nag me

15
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:55,391
for no apparent reason.

16
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,352
Dreams of getting scolded

17
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:59,023
are a manifestation of stress.

18
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,960
You know a lot about this kind of stuff.

19
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:05,226
Yes. I like fortune-telling.

20
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:06,258
By the way,

21
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,937
what does it mean

22
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:09,273
to dream about kissing?

23
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,945
Who did you kiss?

24
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,250
Good morning.

25
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,335
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,313
- Oww...
- Huh?

27
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:21,219
Section chief, is your shoulder okay?

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,547
Yes.

29
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:24,570
- Let me help.
- Oh.

30
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,469
The wedding anniversary celebration,

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,787
I'm sorry for leaving it to you.

32
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:29,468
It was a great success!

33
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:30,992
Feel free to ask us again.

34
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:32,086
That's good to hear.

35
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:32,955
By the way,

36
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,554
I heard that you play badminton.

37
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:35,499
Is that true?

38
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,601
I've even made it to the semifinals of

39
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:38,916
the city tournament before.

40
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,080
Oh.

41
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,205
That's amazing.

42
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,486
You think so?

43
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:02,580
"Naked Dining"

44
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,596
"Episode 6 Banku-shaped memory"

45
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:09,534
Alright.

46
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:11,306
It seems like I can finally escape from

47
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,597
the Friday all-nighter

48
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:13,815
after a long time.

49
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,402
I'm off.

50
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,800
Good job.

51
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,691
Could it be Mahiro-san?

52
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:26,605
Huh?

53
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,535
I was wondering if

54
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:31,276
you'll be meeting him this weekend.

55
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:31,933
Oh.

56
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:32,738
Yes.

57
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,050
That's the plan.

58
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,776
Please say thank you to him for me.

59
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,245
Thank you for the delicious food.

60
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,019
Yes.

61
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,480
Mahiro will be happy, too.

62
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:44,678
Alright.

63
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,042
And...

64
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:48,753
I'm still curious about that.

65
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:49,980
Yes?

66
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,019
Who

67
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:59,401
did you kiss in your dream?

68
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,949
Could it be...

69
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:10,112
someone I know?

70
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:12,706
Ah...

71
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:13,605
Ah?

72
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:15,011
Ah...

73
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:16,816
Ri...

74
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,456
...ana Grande.

75
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:20,542
Ariana?

76
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:21,128
Yes.

77
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,652
Ariana Grande.

78
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:27,768
Alright,

79
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,378
let's do it!

80
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,503
Bon appetit.

81
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:06,192
Hmm.

82
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,166
(Miki fruit and vegetable store | Open)

83
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:30,612
Oh?

84
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:32,034
(Miki fruit and vegetable store)
Ichijou-san.

85
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,035
(Miki fruit and vegetable store)

86
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,792
He could've come and said hello.

87
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:47,643
I've arrived.

88
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:56,722
Did Mahiro take care of cleaning up

89
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:59,901
after the party?

90
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:17,143
Already made four dishes.

91
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:45,924
How nostalgic.

92
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,158
It's Grandma's lunch box!

93
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:55,822
But how come...

94
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,846
That guy...

95
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,526
Huh?

96
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:09,815
Back then...

97
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:42,016
Oh?

98
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,407
Ichijou-san!

99
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:49,617
There's definitely something going on.

100
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,172
Nothing.

101
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:52,204
Liar.

102
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,110
It's so obvious,

103
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,508
Mahiro.

104
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,921
I think...

105
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:59,827
you two suit each other.

106
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,429
Like a childhood friends.

107
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:04,569
Does it look that way?

108
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:06,085
Huh?

109
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,506
Wait,

110
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:11,451
is it really true?

111
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:14,304
Actually,

112
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,655
we were classmates.

113
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,194
Could it be

114
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:20,257
he is...

115
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:21,921
the one from those memories?

116
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:25,077
Yes.

117
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,249
What?

118
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:29,490
Well, he hasn't realized it.

119
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:31,671
Then...

120
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,077
That bento...

121
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:34,968
Yes.

122
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:38,171
It was the bento that Mizuchi-san made.

123
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:41,271
I also noticed it a little while ago

124
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:42,623
and was surprised.

125
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:44,217
Amazing!

126
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,177
This is fate!

127
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,201
It's not something like that.

128
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:49,404
Did you tell him about that back then?

129
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:53,662
I don't think I'll tell him.

130
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:55,959
Why?

131
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,466
It doesn't matter if he doesn't notice,

132
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,342
I'm enjoying the present.

133
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:16,138
Hey.

134
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:19,045
Welcome.

135
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,270
I brought the ingredients.

136
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,181
You can leave them in the kitchen.

137
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,076
Yeah.

138
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,412
Got it.

139
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:42,943
DUY.

140
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:44,521
DUY.

141
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,787
Just act like always.

142
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,701
(Banku and okro stew with shito sauce from Ghana)
The fifth menu for the food trip is.

143
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:54,114
(Banku and okro stew with shito sauce from Ghana)
a popular Ghanaian dish.

144
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,240
(Banku and okro stew with shito sauce from Ghana)
Banku and okro stew.

145
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:59,006
With shito sauce.

146
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,387
Okra?

147
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,904
O-ku-ro.

148
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,185
In Ghana, 'Okra'

149
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:05,489
means 'cat'.

150
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:08,623
Cat stew sounds a bit off.

151
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:09,521
Right?

152
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,388
And

153
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,216
that's the ingredient for banku.

154
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,271
Banku?

155
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:16,795
In Ghanaian cuisine,

156
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:18,231
soup and a staple food

157
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,083
are usually served together.

158
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:24,240
Banku is like mochi in Japan, I guess.

159
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,607
Oh.

160
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:27,599
(Baku mix Ready to cook)
It's like mochi?

161
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,162
It has a slight sourness

162
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,467
and tastes like

163
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,911
a salted onigiri.

164
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,349
Let's get started.

165
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:39,443
Alright.

166
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:43,107
Let's start with the Okro Stew.

167
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:46,006
We use plenty of palm oil and

168
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:49,068
after frying the fish,

169
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,692
simmer the

170
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,856
finely chopped ingredients together.

171
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:00,271
Oh.

172
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:02,310
It smells so good.

173
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,099
And then

174
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,185
next is banku.

175
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:13,068
First, mix the fermented cassava dough

176
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,458
with corn dough.

177
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:16,998
What's cassava?

178
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:18,080
It's used as the

179
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:19,590
raw material for tapioca.

180
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:21,255
Using this gives

181
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,529
it a unique chewy texture.

182
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,872
Then, heat it up

183
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:31,458
and slowly stir it

184
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,208
until it becomes sticky.

185
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:36,099
Yeah.

186
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,045
Alright.

187
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,365
Will it turn elastic?

188
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,302
Yes.

189
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:57,873
Huh?

190
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:58,810
Huh?

191
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,832
Oh.

192
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,404
You alright?

193
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:02,256
Yeah.

194
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,862
We need to mix it more

195
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:10,060
thoroughly.

196
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:10,888
Like this.

197
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,717
You're doing it wrong.

198
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:13,880
Like this.

199
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:15,451
Like this.

200
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,442
Can you do the rest yourself?

201
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,084
Yeah.

202
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:36,029
By...

203
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,334
By the way,

204
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:40,849
Shimizu-san

205
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:43,177
wanted me to pass on her thanks again.

206
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,295
You didn't have to.

207
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:46,740
She said

208
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,099
the food was delicious.

209
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,443
I'm glad she enjoyed it.

210
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:53,864
Souta's coworkers

211
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:55,723
are all nice people.

212
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:57,005
Yeah.

213
00:11:59,227 --> 00:11:59,914
Oh...

214
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,435
speaking of which,

215
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,575
the other day Kasuga...

216
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,196
Kasuga-san?

217
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:07,594
Oh.

218
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:08,571
Nothing.

219
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,314
What?

220
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:13,306
You see...

221
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,306
He mentioned

222
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:16,860
having a strange dream.

223
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,306
A strange dream?

224
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:19,751
For some reason,

225
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,603
Beyoncé was angry at him.

226
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:24,548
What?

227
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:28,720
I...

228
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,564
also had

229
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:33,493
a strange dream.

230
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,525
What kind of dream?

231
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:38,571
A kissing

232
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,509
dream.

233
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,142
And the other party...

234
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:48,462
was Mahiro.

235
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,853
Hey.

236
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,126
Isn't that weird?

237
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:01,438
Don't dream such things!

238
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:02,993
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:15,673
The texture has improved quite a bit.

240
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:17,267
Is this okay?

241
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:17,931
Yeah.

242
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,251
It looks just right.

243
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:20,767
And now...

244
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:22,689
when shaping it,

245
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:24,306
we'll use a rice bowl.

246
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:25,360
A bowl?

247
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,032
Yeah.

248
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,118
Let's see.

249
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:33,790
Huh?

250
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,228
The bento box...

251
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,048
I remember it was on the other shelf...

252
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:39,305
I moved it.

253
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,126
Is that so?

254
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:48,032
That bento box is the one.

255
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,790
I used when I was in high school.

256
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:54,150
Grandma always

257
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,665
made me carry two lunchboxes.

258
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,603
Yeah.

259
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,212
Maybe that is...

260
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,759
Mahiro after all?

261
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,524
You see...

262
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,266
Yeah.

263
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,235
You also tried my best.

264
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,056
What happened?

265
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,345
I was talking about the quiz.

266
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,485
I could barely managed it.

267
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:25,517
Right.

268
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:26,993
- That's true.
- Yeah.

269
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,062
It was tough.

270
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,306
Hey, Tanaka.

271
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,282
If you don't mind, here.

272
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,054
At my house,

273
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,742
my grandma makes lunchboxes.

274
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,017
She said I eat a lot,

275
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,134
it won't be enough.

276
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:43,962
So she made two boxes.

277
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:46,517
I can't finish it.

278
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,103
So, if you don't mind.

279
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,157
Hey.

280
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,415
Maybe he doesn't want it?

281
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,048
Shh!

282
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,228
Tanaka.

283
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:11,946
Ichijou.

284
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,157
That's none of your business.

285
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:17,446
Huh?

286
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:19,695
Sometimes,

287
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,359
it's better to leave things alone.

288
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,478
I didn't realize at all.

289
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,087
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,305
It's fine.

291
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,266
After that,

292
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,963
I transferred to another school,

293
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:35,875
and my parents got divorced

294
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:37,696
so I even changed my last name.

295
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,508
I'm sorry about before.

296
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,015
I lacked sensitivity.

297
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,235
That's not true at all.

298
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,953
I...

299
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:52,882
was really happy.

300
00:15:58,578 --> 00:15:59,875
Hey, can I borrow this?

301
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,265
You're going to borrow it?

302
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,219
At that time,

303
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,605
it was painful to see my parents

304
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,230
fighting every day.

305
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:12,542
I didn't have a place

306
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,746
to belong at school,

307
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,289
and I constantly felt suffocated.

308
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,008
But

309
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,914
the moment I ate that bento.

310
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,585
I felt relieved.

311
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,499
I thought that food is amazing.

312
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,007
After that,

313
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,882
I left this town following my mother,

314
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,679
but I wanted to work

315
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,031
in a food-related field.

316
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:49,077
That's why.

317
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,077
I returned to this town

318
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:54,906
and I inherited the store

319
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,370
from her parent's side.

320
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:01,343
So, now your last name is “Miki”.

321
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:03,304
Yeah.

322
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,288
Since I came back here,

323
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,765
I've met people from all over the world.

324
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,585
In order for them

325
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:19,374
to enjoy the nostalgic dishes anytime,

326
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,648
I started doing this work.

327
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:24,593
Therefore...

328
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:27,843
It's all thanks to that bento

329
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,639
that made me who I am today.

330
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,898
All thanks to Grandma, huh?

331
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,359
Grandma is

332
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,999
truly amazing indeed.

333
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,413
Yeah.

334
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:45,609
And...

335
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,913
Thanks to Souta, too.

336
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:50,015
Everyone,

337
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,874
thank you for everything.

338
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:55,140
I wanted to say thank you

339
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,204
for a long time,

340
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,499
but I couldn't say it.

341
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,015
On the last day of school,

342
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:02,757
that day,

343
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,021
you were absent

344
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:05,365
because of a cold, right?

345
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,460
That's why

346
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,640
I couldn't say anything...

347
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:10,984
Back then...

348
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,609
Thank you very much.

349
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:15,593
No.

350
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:17,390
It wasn't a big deal.

351
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,281
But

352
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:23,984
this is fate.

353
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:24,976
Huh?

354
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,155
It's fate that Grandma

355
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,624
shaped the present Mahiro.

356
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:31,819
Yeah.

357
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,867
It's fate.

358
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:36,335
Yeah.

359
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,061
It's done.

360
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,414
This

361
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:54,648
looks so familiar.

362
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:55,718
Huh?

363
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:58,984
It's like Mizuchi-san's onigiri.

364
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,101
You're right!

365
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:05,890
How nostalgic, Grandma's bento.

366
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,331
Her tamagoyaki was very delicious.

367
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:10,101
The sweet one, right?

368
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,780
And the hamburger with parsley in it.

369
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:12,413
That

370
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,109
was in the bento I received, too!

371
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:15,093
That's

372
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:16,874
how I started eating parsley,

373
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,019
thanks to it.

374
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:21,585
Mizuchi-san truly is great indeed!

375
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,037
This is the Ghanaian seasoning, shito.

376
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,726
It's like dipping onigiri in miso.

377
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,843
It goes well with banku.

378
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:36,671
Wow.

379
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:37,937
Looks delicious.

380
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,351
Now that it's done, I'll be going.

381
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,648
Do you want to eat with me?

382
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:45,452
Huh?

383
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,281
We made it together,

384
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:50,117
so,

385
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:52,507
let's eat together.

386
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,640
Sure,

387
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:58,257
let's do that.

388
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,570
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

389
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,265
Oh!

390
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:08,601
Chewy!

391
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:11,882
The slight sourness grows on you, huh?

392
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,171
Oh!

393
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:19,788
The okra stew is spicy and delicious!

394
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,015
The shito really goes well with banku.

395
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:28,296
Yeah.

396
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:29,890
Mahiro,

397
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,499
you're really good at cooking.

398
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,273
You could open a restaurant.

399
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,093
I wish I could do that.

400
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:39,945
Could it be that...

401
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:41,624
Someday,

402
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:44,452
I want to use only local ingredients,

403
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:46,360
and open a restaurant where

404
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,735
you can eat various cuisines

405
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,069
from all over the world.

406
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:50,460
That's awesome.

407
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:51,726
I'll help you, too.

408
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,140
I'll help you every weekend.

409
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,257
Really?

410
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:54,976
Yeah.

411
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,195
If we could keep cooking together,

412
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,796
and enjoy the meals,

413
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:02,827
if we

414
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:05,296
could keep doing, it would be fun.

415
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:08,835
Forever?

416
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:10,112
Yeah.

417
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:11,976
I...

418
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:14,288
when I'm with Mahiro,

419
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:17,585
I feel relieved.

420
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:20,226
Not that

421
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,538
working at the company isn't fun,

422
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,991
but when I come here

423
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:28,132
and stay with you,

424
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,329
I feel comfortable.

425
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,920
It's like I can be honest

426
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,889
with my feelings.

427
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:41,859
That's why...

428
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:45,421
Souta.

429
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,452
Even as we grow older,

430
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,558
it'd be nice

431
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,215
if both of us could continue doing this.

432
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:56,640
Are you saying...

433
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:00,085
Huh?

434
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:01,312
I mean,

435
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:03,226
wanting to stay together like is...

436
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:04,640
Umm...

437
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:05,992
Like,

438
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,061
having a close-knit family relationship.

439
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:12,960
Family?

440
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:13,880
Yeah.

441
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,640
Both of us will

442
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:17,335
eventually getting married.

443
00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:19,999
Having sons who looks just like us,

444
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,101
and enjoying meals together.

445
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,257
Seems fun, right?

446
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:30,546
What's wrong?

447
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,507
I...

448
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:39,710
I'm not like that.

449
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:43,108
Huh?

450
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,312
I'm sorry.

451
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:48,960
I'm going home today.

452
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,132
Mahiro?

453
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:51,952
All of a sudden...

454
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:54,460
Did I say something wrong?

455
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,601
- Was I being insensitive...
- I...

456
00:22:57,382 --> 00:22:58,187
I did it.

457
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:01,343
Huh?

458
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:06,320
The kiss.

459
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,062
I did it.

460
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:12,585
That...

461
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,601
wasn't a dream.

462
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,054
I...

463
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,874
kissed Souta.

464
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:37,421
(Next episode)

465
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:38,601
Let's try kissing?

466
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:39,945
Let's hold a hotpot party.

467
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,343
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

468
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,687
No, I didn't seduce you.

469
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,797
Oww, hot!

470
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,882
He's no longer in the same world as me.

471
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,945
Some things are better left unknown.

472
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:50,453
Liking someone.

473
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,454
is truly wonderful.
