(Laughing my way out to the street,
with talents nowhere to perform)

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,940
(Prison)

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,080
Do you still want to divorce Zheng Hai?

23
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,519
I don't know.

24
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,040
I don't know what's going to happen

25
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,919
after the divorce.

26
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,639
Why are women treated so unfairly?

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,519
The world treats women unfairly

28
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,959
because we

29
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,680
did not fight for our own justice.

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,800
Perhaps we could take a shot with

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,479
what we have.

32
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,559
My cousin Su Wei's

33
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,000
grandmother lost her husband back then.

34
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,440
She raised her daughter up on her own.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,399
However, she was surrounded
by the entire clan.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
They intended to seize
all her possessions.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,600
Alone,

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,440
she knelt outside
in the snow for three days.

39
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,119
She called for justice every day.

40
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,479
That's how they ended up

41
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,839
with the tradition of female shopkeepers
of Su Chang Ji at Wujiang Prefecture.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,679
A widow who was raising a
daughter could achieve that.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,759
Why should we fear?

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,119
What about you?

45
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,440
I will do the same.

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll fight for my way.

47
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,940
(Prison)

48
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,880
I need to talk to you.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,119
There are things

50
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,720
I've wanted to tell you.

51
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,279
I can finally tell you now.

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,039
Once upon a time,

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
there was an arrogant
and domineering Commandery Prince.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,119
He forced a lady commoner to marry him.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,960
The lady commoner

56
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,000
did not want to marry into
the Commandery Prince's Mansion

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,880
as a concubine.

58
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,440
She had her own ambitions.

59
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,880
All she wanted was to retrieve
the title deed of her family's field.

60
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,800
She wanted to spend the rest of
her life back at the village.

61
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,639
However, she was just a peasant.

62
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,119
Neither her nor her family
had the means to

63
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,919
go against
the almighty Commandery Prince.

64
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,520
In the end, they got married.

65
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,000
The lady

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,279
did not enjoy such a life.

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,360
The Commandery Prince was
always on the high horse.

68
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,479
Being in the company of a king
is like living with a tiger.

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,600
She can't

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,199
stay by his side at ease.

71
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,759
However, one day,

72
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,880
the Commandery Prince told the lady

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,559
that he wanted to spend
the rest of their lives together.

74
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,559
However, she knew

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,799
the favour of His Highness

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,720
is limited

77
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,760
and transitory.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Most importantly,

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,239
if she stays with him,

80
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,760
she will remain a concubine forever.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,640
She will

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,359
remain inferior to others forever.

83
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,119
Isn't that right?

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,679
I can resolve this.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
What are you going to do?

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,959
Tell me.

87
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,799
Can we disobey the imperial edict?

88
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,559
Even without Lady Shen,

89
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,959
it would have been someone else.

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,959
Your first wife

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,519
will never be me.

92
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,880
Isn't that right?

93
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,679
Just trust me this once.

94
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,640
I'll definitely resolve this

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
as long as you trust me.

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,959
It's pointless.

97
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,160
Let me go.

98
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,600
Can you please stay?

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,839
I've already found someone I love.

100
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,119
From the moment
I've learned how to love,

101
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,679
she's been residing in my heart.

102
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,839
She is not from a family
as noble as yours.

103
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,799
She isn't as knowledgeable
and refined as you are.

104
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,760
She isn't as generous as you,

105
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,119
but she's the best

106
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,160
in the world.

107
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,839
Do you know how it feels?

108
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,799
When she's mad, she'd bicker with you.

109
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,279
When she's shy, she blushes.

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,519
She has many excuses,

111
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,040
but none of them

112
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,399
makes sense.

113
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,519
I've once imagined a life

114
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,119
without her.

115
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,920
However, I can't do it.

116
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,720
(I can't live without her.)

117
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,040
(I can't love you.)

118
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,160
(I'm sorry.)

119
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,200
Discussion of policies.

120
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,799
For today's question,

121
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,279
discuss the theory of punishment.

(Wujiang Examination Hall)

126
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,239
Cheating in the examination

127
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,880
is a grave crime.

128
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,600
Before the essay examination,

129
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,839
the topic was leaked.

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,359
Who wrote the article for you?

131
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,760
Tell me the truth.

132
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,079
It's the Head of Nencao Hall.

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,200
The Head of Nencao Hall
wrote this article on my behalf.

(Zhong Ziyan)

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,000

(Wujiang Examination Hall)

Examinee Zhong Ziyan

cheated in the examination.

139
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,719
Take this to Prince Pu's Mansion.

140
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,119
Hurry up.

141
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:39,599
Yes.

Will he emerge as the first
in the provincial exam?

145
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,400
Three suns and two moons.

146
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,479
What's the reading of the hexagram?

147
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,440
Twelve.

148
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Divine obstruction.

149
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
The malevolent has its way

150
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,359
while the good is precarious.

151
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,960
A huge effort, but a little gain.

152
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,520
It's not looking optimistic.

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,559
What do you mean by
the good is precarious?

154
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,440
The heavens are above, the earth below.

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,440
Heavens represent the good

156
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,080
while the earth represents the vile.

157
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
Heavens are outward
while earth is inward.

158
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,479
This reading shows
the vile entering the palace

159
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,000
while the good remains in the wild.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,679
What?

161
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,320
Stop mumbling on.

162
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,200
I don't understand.

163
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,760
Just tell me directly

164
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,359
what I should do right now.

165
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,200
Pay me a tael of silver

166
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,559
to eliminate the calamity.

167
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:22,359
A tael of silver?

168
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,239
Fine.

169
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,679

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,119
what are you thinking?

171
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,479
This is clearly a scam.

172
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,479
Why do you buy a lie?

173
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm spending money to
buy a sense of relief.

174
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,599
It's none of your concern.

175
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,799
Go away.

176
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,599
Go.

177
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,640
A tael of silver, right?

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,320
There you go.

179
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm taking this with me.

180
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,679
Hanchen,

181
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,640
look at her.

182
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,880
She is crazy.

183
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,799
This is clearly a scam.

184
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,640
We could have had a great meal instead.

185
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:54,880
By the way,

186
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,440
why isn't Xiaoman here today?

187
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,960
Are you sure this would work?

188
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,559
I have things to attend to. I'm leaving.

189
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,640
Thank you.

190
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
You're welcome. Take care.

191
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,679
Why did Zhao Xiaoqian leave?

192
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,239
He's surrounded by too many women.

193
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,119
He's probably exhausted.

194
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,679
Unlike me,

195
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,719
I'm a lone wolf.

196
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,440
A lone wolf?

197
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:25,799
Minggu.

198
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,760
I intend to compile the Biography
of Legendary Women of the History.

199
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,960
But the work is complicated.

200
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,599
I'm afraid I'll not be able
to handle that alone.

201
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,239
Principal Yang gave me a suggestion

202
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,960
to organize an examination
for the female scholars

203
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,479
of Jingnv Pavilion as well.

204
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,239
The best scorer shall
join my endeavour

205
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,679
in the compilation.

206
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,840
I wonder if you're willing to join me.

207
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,359
I'm willing.

208
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,919
Me, too.

209
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Me, too.

210
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:08,960
Me, too.

211
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,320
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

212
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,440
If that's the case,

213
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,760
in three days,

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,039
the essay examination will
be held at Tingtao Pavilion.

215
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,840
I look forward to your performances.

216
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,380
(Delicacy Restaurant)

217
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,559
Teacher Liu is organizing
an examination for the ladies.

218
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,559
Besides Lady Shen,
who among us would

219
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,039
emerge as the best at Jingnv Pavilion?

220
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,640
She was taught by
the Imperial Grand Tutor.

221
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,599
Our participation

222
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,440
will be a stepping stone for her.

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,799
Who said so?

224
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,440
I think Xie Xiaoman

225
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,080
has the prospects of competing with her.

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,479
Xiaoman,

227
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,320
during the Qixi Festival,

228
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,599
I forgot to pass Xingzhou
the poem I wrote.

229
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,239
Should I

230
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,520
leave my poem in this

231
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,799
and give it to him after
the examination?

232
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,679
What do you think?

233
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,760
Do you want him to know

234
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,119
or do you not want him to?

235
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,479
Honestly, I'm not sure.

236
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:06,919
Minggu.

237
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,200
Xiaoman.

238
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,320
What's going on?

239
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,000
Are you eating?

240
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,719
It's delicious.

241
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,000
Hanchen.

242
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,159
Have you heard that Jingnv Pavilion

243
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,559
will host an examination
for the ladies?

244
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm eager to participate.

245
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,559
However...

246
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,679
I'm done. I'll get going.

247
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,919
I don't know how to
write a discussion essay.

248
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,919
Hanchen, please help me.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,559
All right.

250
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,679
Hanchen.

251
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,799
Wait for me.

252
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,880
Xiaoman.

253
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
Congwen.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,559
Have a seat.

255
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,760
Teacher Liu told me

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
you registered for the examination.

257
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:03,840
Previously,

258
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,919
you took me out of the city
to attend one of your classes.

259
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,440
I'm thinking of

260
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
becoming a teacher just like you

261
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,799
and Teacher Liu.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,039
It's a noble job.

263
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,640
Thus, I would like to give it a shot.

264
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,119
However,

265
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,119
I don't know if I'd pass.

266
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:19,760
How about this?

267
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,679
I heard there are still a
few days left to prepare.

268
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm available during the afternoon.

269
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,159
I can help with your revision.

270
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,060
(Dongguan Building)

271
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,719
Xiaoman,

272
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
are you here to study as well?

273
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,039
There's a seat here.

274
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,159
Come and join us.

275
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
It's fine.

276
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,320
I've made plans with someone.

277
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,359
Lingniang extended her kindness to you.

278
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,599
Lady Xie, you're rather

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,960
impolite.

280
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Thank you, Lady Shen.

281
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm grateful.

282
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,520
Xiaoman.

283
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:05,719
Congwen.

284
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:09,919
Let's go.

285
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,760
My neck.

286
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:22,719
Hanchen.

287
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,520
Who offended you this time?

288
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,840
You look pretty upset.

289
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,799
Writing a discussion essay is different
from composing poems or odes.

290
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,440
Bombastic expressions and
formats are unnecessary.

291
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,080
Address the issue

292
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,200
and lay down your opinions
comprehensively.

293
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Express a critical point of view.

294
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,760
Is something going on between
you and His Highness?

295
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,320
It seems like

296
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,080
something has happened.

297
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,760
We've decided to opt for a divorce.

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm waiting for him to issue
the letter of annulment to me.

299
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Divorce?

300
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,400
Why?

301
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,799
It's often said in the books.

302
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
As a woman,

303
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,200
one is often left with no choice.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,960
He's leaving Wujiang Prefecture soon.

305
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
This may be

306
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,880
a good thing for me.

307
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,000
In a few days,

308
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,000
I would like to give you something.

309
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,799
What's it?

310
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,880
After your examination,

311
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,799
I'll give it to you.

312
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,799
You will find out then.

313
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,460
(How I wish you could understand
my feelings for you.)

314
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,220
(Wujiang Examination Hall)

315
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:57,719
Xingzhou.

316
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,400
Why are you here?

317
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,560
How did the examination go?

318
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,479
Did you catch a cold?

319
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,280
Did you starve?

320
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,160
Mr. Zhong.

321
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,719
Thank you.

322
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,760
Mr. Zhong.

323
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:09,920
The carriage is over here.

324
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,319
Over here.

325
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,239
I'll make a move first.

326
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,199
Are you Zhong Ziyan?

327
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,839
Scholar from Wujiang Prefecture,
Zhong Ziyan,

328
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,239
is involved in bribery and
disclosure of examination topic.

329
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,760
He was caught cheating
with a fellow student.

330
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,760
His qualifications

331
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
shall be revoked from

332
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,000
participating the examination
permanently.

333
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,719
Xingzhou!

334
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,520
I got all excited that

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,359
I forgot to pass him the amulet.

336
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
I forgot to pass him the food as well.

337
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,920
I'll just give it to him next time.

338
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:22,880
Let's go.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,479
Xiaoman.

340
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,319
Xiaoman, look.

341
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,160
This belongs to Xingzhou.

342
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Has Xingzhou completed his examination?

343
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,839
He finished it early this morning.

344
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,079
I went to pick him up.

345
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,079
But I forgot to pass him the pouch.

346
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,400
It's fine.

347
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,239
We will see each other tomorrow anyway.

348
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,560
Xiaoman.

349
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,560
Do you think

350
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,959
Xingzhou

351
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,000
would stop coming to the academy?

352
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,000
He must have passed the examination.

353
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,239
From now on,

354
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,040
would he still come to the academy?

355
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,800
I guess so.

356
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I thought so, too.

357
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,760
Initially,

358
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,839
I wanted to confess
my feelings to Xingzhou

359
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,239
after the examination.

360
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,920
It seems like there's
no need to do it hastily.

361
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,640
Look.

362
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,520
Xingzhou dropped this.

363
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
He folded it so nicely.

364
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,719
I bet he finished the exam
early back at the hall

365
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
and folded this out of boredom.

366
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,800
Look at

367
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,319
the wings

368
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,319
and the neck.

369
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,000
Xiaoman, take a look.

370
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,479
It's exquisite, isn't it?

371
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:43,719
Please leave me alone.

372
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,599
Minggu.

373
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,160
Yanwan, let's go.

374
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,100
(Jingnv Pavilion)

375
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,620
(Personal profile)

376
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,400
Personal profile?

377
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,880
Eat properly.

378
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,719
Look at you.

379
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,239
Father.

380
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,839
Do you know what a personal profile
of the examination is?

381
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
You don't know that?

382
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,520
It's a verification for the participants.

383
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,400
Yes.

384
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,599
Your mother is right.

385
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,359
During the examination,

386
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
the students' identity are
verified with that.

387
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,239
After the examination, they will
be submitted back to the facility.

388
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,640
What happens if they aren't submitted?

389
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,319
That means they did not participate
in the examination

390
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,640
or something went wrong

391
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,560
during the examination.

392
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,439
What could possibly go wrong?

393
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:02,959
What could possibly go wrong?

394
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,359
Things like cheating.

395
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:07,920
By the way,

396
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,119
a few days ago,

397
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,199
I told you to withdraw
some cash from the bank.

398
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,199
Is everything done?

399
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,640
Yes.

400
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,439
I placed them in your chiffonier.

401
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,079
When the new store launches,

402
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,040
you may take it.

403
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,079
Father. Mother.

404
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm done.

405
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,239
I shall excuse myself.

406
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,680
What?

407
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,959
You barely ate anything.

408
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,040
What...

409
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,920
Is she ill?

410
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,560
It's good that she's gone.

411
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,359
Nobody wants to hear

412
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,599
the problems of the business.

413
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,680
Su Tingshan

414
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,439
opened a new store at Tongzhou
before us.

415
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,640
He's planning to meddle in
Wujiang Prefecture as well.

416
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,920
This time, Su Chang Ji must

417
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,199
acquire the store first

418
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,640
in order to let him know that

419
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,920
Wujiang Prefecture

420
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,959
isn't a place he could
meddle in as he pleases.

421
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:57,920
That's right.

422
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,319
The side branch of Su Family

423
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,479
has been coveting Su Chang Ji.

424
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm telling you.

425
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,400
He

426
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,319
had better not show up in Wujiang Prefecture

427
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,160
or I'll beat him to pulp.

428
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,439
Listen to you.

429
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,520
Why are you so happy?

430
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,839
Stop reading. Let's eat.

431
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:18,359
Come on.

432
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,040
Let's eat.

433
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,700
(Wujiang Examination Hall)

434
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,719
Lady,

435
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,839
this is the examination hall.

436
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,199
The examination is over.

437
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:28,959
There's no one in there.

438
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,920
Please leave.

439
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,800
Fellow guards,

440
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,000
it's urgent,
and I need to talk to the examiner.

441
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,119
Please let me in.

442
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,520
I said,

443
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,839
the examination is over.

444
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,239
The results will be
released after a while.

445
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,160
You may inquire the examiner then.

446
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,079
This is extremely urgent.

447
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,319
Please let me in.

448
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:42,880
What's going on?

449
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,280
Let me in!

450
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,880
Lady!

451
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,839
Sir.

452
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:46,880
Sir.

453
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,640
Sir.

454
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,079
She barged in.

455
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,959
I couldn't stop her.

456
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,479
You're dismissed.

457
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,280
Yes.

458
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:54,479
What's the matter?

459
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,760
Sir,

460
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,040
I would like to find out,

461
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,479
among those who failed to submit
their personal profile,

462
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,719
is there a man by the surname of Zhong?

463
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,719
I think so.

464
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,560
What's the matter?

465
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,479
Did something happen

466
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,439
that he failed to submit his profile?

467
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,199
He cheated during the examination.

468
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,359
He

469
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,880
is banned from taking the exam ever after.

470
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,800
All right.

471
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,760
I shouldn't have told you so much.

472
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,680
Hurry up and leave.

473
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:19,640
Sir,

474
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,439
did you make a mistake?

475
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,239
Zhong Ziyan is an upright man.

476
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,959
He'd never cheat, sir.

477
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,719
Sir, it must have been a mistake.

478
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,800
Sir, please investigate the matter.

479
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm sure you made a mistake.

480
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm begging you.

481
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,839
He'd never cheat,

482
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,439
sir.

483
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,940
(Brothel)

484
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,839
The raging wind blows,
and the clouds are enmeshed along.

485
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,599
Sir.

486
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,760
After achieving triumph and peace,
I returned home in glory.

487
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,520
Seeking a hero to protect
all corners of the state.

488
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,119
Xu Shu!

489
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:52,920
Lady!

490
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,400
Get out of the way!

491
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,199
You can't go in there!

492
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,040
Xu Shu!

493
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,839
You can't enter!

494
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,319
Why did you frame Xingzhou?

495
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:57,880
Lady Su!

496
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,560
Get out of the way!

497
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,040
You should return!

498
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,959
Why did you harm Zhong Ziyan?

499
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,680
That's enough.

500
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,239
Get lost!

501
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,000
Do you know how important

502
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,079
the examination is to Xingzhou?

503
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,280
Why did you frame him?

504
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,560
Xingzhou?

505
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,160
Zhong Ziyan is the Head of Nencao Hall.

506
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,520
Xingzhou had no idea.

507
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,119
Go with me to clarify the situation

508
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,479
in the examination hall.

509
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,160
Come with me.

510
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,000
Why should I?

511
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,719
I'm not allowed to undertake
the examination myself.

512
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,680
Why should I help him?

513
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,000
Lady Su,

514
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,319
the examination is important
to your Xingzhou.

515
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,719
What about me?

516
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,160
My father has no expectations for me.

517
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,520
Look at me now.

518
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,400
I am not even as valuable as a dog.

519
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,319
Sons and daughters of
noble households like you

520
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,959
would never understand
what I go through.

521
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,560
Whatever you said

522
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,400
has nothing to do with Xingzhou.

523
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,079
He was unaware.

524
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,199
He had no idea.

525
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,319
He worked all his life

526
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,680
for the examination.

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,719
His whole life is ruined by you.

528
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,000
Please help him out, okay?

529
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm begging you.

530
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,920
Please help him out

531
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,359
and clarify the situation
in the examination hall.

532
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm begging you.

533
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,239
He accepted my money.

534
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,199
Therefore, he must do his job.

535
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,839
Since I've failed,

536
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,160
he

537
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,040
should suffer with me.

538
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,599
Hold on.

539
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,760
Tell me.

540
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,359
What will it take

541
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,560
for you to help Xingzhou?

542
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:46,959
Fine.

543
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,920
Give me 500 strings of 1,000 cash.

544
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,959
I'll testify for his innocence.

545
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,800
500 strings of 1,000 cash?

546
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,400
Fine.

547
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,400
I'll bring you the cash tomorrow.

548
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,000
You're coming with me to clarify
everything in the examination hall.

549
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,640
Hold on!

550
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,719
Lady Su.

551
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
What's your relationship

552
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,000
with Zhong Ziyan?

553
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm in love with him.

554
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,439
I'm in love with him.

555
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
Pass the cash to Madam Su later.

556
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,119
All right.

557
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,079
Watch it closely.

558
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,160
Lady Xie.

559
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,680
Why do you come home so late?

560
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:16,959
I was studying at the academy

561
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,640
and lost track of time.

562
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,400
Where are my books?

563
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,800
Zhu Momo came back this afternoon

564
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,719
and took the books by
the Commandery Prince's orders.

565
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,719
Zhao Xiaoqian.

566
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,439
Lady Xie.

567
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,580
(Sleeping Room)

568
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,719
Your Highness.

569
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,760
Mr. Zhong is not like himself today.

570
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,439
The civil examination has just ended.

571
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,000
He should be elated.

572
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,599
Why is he drowning in wine?

573
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,520
He's probably exhausted.

574
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,479
I shouldn't have taken him out
for a drink.

575
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,160
By the way, Your Highness,

576
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,079
Zipei came to the mansion
to borrow some books.

577
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,079
Zhu Momo sent her to retrieve
them from Lotus Gardens

578
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,800
and said it was by your orders.

579
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:14,599
Zhao Xiaoqian.

580
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,079
Why did you take my possessions?

581
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,920
Why did you take my books away?

582
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,520
Lingniang asked for them,

583
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,680
so I gave them to her.

584
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,319
What's wrong?

585
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,920
Lingniang wanted them,

586
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,719
so you gave them to her?

587
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,959
Yes.

588
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
She's my fiancee.

589
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,359
Whatever she asks for,

590
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,719
no matter what it takes,

591
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm willing to do it for her.

592
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,400
Since you have no feelings for me,

593
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,640
why do you care?

594
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:45,920
Fine.

595
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,560
I understand.

596
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:49,959
Stand right there!

597
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,160
This isn't a place for you to

598
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,199
come and go as you please.

599
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Help me get changed.

600
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,719
You shall serve me in bed tonight.

601
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,119
What?

602
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,839
Since you've not left,

603
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,880
you're still my concubine.

604
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,760
Carry out your obligation.

605
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,680
What's the matter?

606
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,800
Are you afraid?

607
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,239
Let go of me.

608
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,680
Why are you so eager to
participate in the examination?

609
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,760
Are you doing this to leave me?

610
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,520
Yes.

611
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,319
I want to leave you.

612
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,079
I'm doing this to leave you.

613
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,719
Who do you think you are?

614
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:58,719
Who do you think you are

615
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
to play around

616
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,000
with me?

617
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,439
Do you find it fun?

618
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,079
As you watch me

619
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,760
wag my tail like a dog and beg
for your attention repeatedly?

620
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,439
Do you find it fun?

621
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,199
Yes.

622
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,000
Isn't it great that you'd end up
being with Shen Zhaowen?

623
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,920
Since you grew up together,

624
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,959
since you both are of equal positions,

625
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,520
since you're both engaged,

626
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,040
isn't it great that you end up
being together with her?

627
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,680
Why did you mess with me?

628
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,160
Keep this in mind.

629
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,560
Even if I marry Shen Zhaowen,

630
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,000
I'd never allow you to leave me.

631
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
Even if I turn Wujiang Prefecture
upside down,

632
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,079
you're not allowed to take
a step out of my mansion!

633
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,479
In the summer of first year of Jianxing,

634
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,880
Zhu Bao led a rebellion to
conquer Zangke Prefecture.

635
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,319
The uprising begun with
Yong Kai of Yizhou County.

636
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,880
Governor of Liu, Zhang Yi was exiled.

637
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,920
He refused to yield.

638
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,839
Prince of Yi led an army
of rebellion and triumphed.

639
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:50,920
By the end of the year,

640
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,079
Daughter of Zhang Clan
was titled as the Empress.

641
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,120
Lady Xie.

642
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,420
(To Xiaoman)

643
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,080
(Lonely Boat At Night, volume four)

644
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,320
Fellow students,

645
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,879
the discussion of policy
for today's examination

646
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,159
centers around the diplomatic mission
of Princess Consort Ming.

647
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,840
Please rise to deliver your insights.

648
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,120
After the speaker sits down,

649
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:27,199
the rest may rise to
voice your opinions.

650
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,959
You may begin to
express your opinions.

651
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,280
The discussion begins.

652
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,479
Back then, State of Han and
the Xiongnu Empire were in dispute.

653
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,439
The entire state was exhausted.

654
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,679
The people were suffering.

655
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,000
Princess Consort Ming, Zhaojun,

656
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,120
volunteered to marry Huhanye.

657
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,840
She spent the next 60 years
in the north.

658
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,639
She developed Xiongnu and
the people lived in abundance.

659
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,760
Peace reigned for three generations.

660
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,800
Wars ceased and the people have peace.

661
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,399
Such political insight

662
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,000
and noble sacrifice

663
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:06,000
should serve as an exemplar
to the ladies of this age.

664
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,760
Xiaoman.

665
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,719
Xiaoman,

666
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,760
it's your turn.

667
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,800
Zhaojun ventured into
a diplomatic mission.

668
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,360
She deserves the respect and
admiration of the posterity.

669
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,959
However, I believe it was
inferred by causality.

670
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,439
In my opinion,

671
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,639
Princess Consort Ming
volunteered to the north

672
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:32,919
not necessarily to

673
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,760
quell the war between both nations.

674
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,719
It was but a game of fate.

675
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,159
She was forced by the circumstances.

676
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,000
Recorded in the Book of Later Han,

677
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,399
Zhaojun spent years in the palace

678
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,719
without meeting His Majesty.

679
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,000
Grudge and dismay were accumulated.

680
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,239
From this, one could imply

681
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,399
that she was long tired of

682
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,399
living her days like a caged bird.

683
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,000
On one hand, it's the perpetual solitude
of 20 years in the harem.

684
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:58,399
On the other hand, it's being 3,000
miles away from her motherland.

685
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,719
Princess Consort Ming chose

686
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,000
the latter opportunity for herself.

687
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:04,679
Princess Consort Ming's
departure up north

688
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,600
was praised as a virtue for generations.

689
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,199
How dare you proclaim such presumptions?

690
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:10,280
You show contempt

691
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,159
for a lady's sacrifice for the country.

692
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
You show contempt towards the noble
sacrifice Princess Consort Ming

693
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,000
made for her people.

694
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,800
Princess Consort Ming's departure
was praised and respected.

695
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,800
However, in my opinion,

696
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
the people of Han betrayed her.

697
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,800
She was forced to give up her happiness.

698
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,360
Her free will to control her life

699
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,919
was diminished.

700
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:31,679
However,
by her strong will and tenacity,

701
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,280
coincidentally,

702
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,199
she saved an entire nation.

703
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,360
As a delicate woman,
Princess Consort Ming

704
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,000
was forced to marry
a foreign man she has never met,

705
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and forced to spend the rest
of her life with him.

706
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,639
After she passed away,
she could only be buried in the desert,

707
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:48,000
forbidden from returning
to her homeland.

708
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,879
To Princess Consort Ming,

709
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,000
isn't it a great sacrifice?

710
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,320
If what you uphold is true,

711
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,879
Princess Consort Ming was tired of

712
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,479
living her life as a caged bird,

713
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,120
so she volunteered to embark up north,

714
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,479
why were the songs of grievances

715
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,479
sung through the ages?

716
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,479
From the palace to Xiongnu,

717
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,479
isn't that just moving from one cage

718
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,840
to another?

719
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,959
Lady Xie,

720
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,800
do you concur?

721
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:16,760
Spring is everlasting.

722
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,159
The willows never sleep.

723
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,479
The lonely moon lit up the skies while
the stars kept each other company.

724
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,639
In the future,

725
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,280
dreams are far from reach,

726
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,399
remaining in Yuyangli Village.
