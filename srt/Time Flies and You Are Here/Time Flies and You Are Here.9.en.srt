=Episode 9=

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Moon rises on the mount of east,
cows are moving around)

21
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,199
Some people do not mean what they say.

22
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,480
Their eyes tell it all.

23
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,480
In my opinion,

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,559
it's only two years' time.

25
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,319
You should try to get
along with Zhao Xiaoqian.

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Perhaps, he may submit
an appeal to the Emperor,

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,279
and you may be granted
the title as the Commandery Princess.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,319
I couldn't be bothered.

29
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,400
In a play, I heard that

30
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,199
the noble ladies of the capital
may look grand on the surface.

31
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,800
In reality, they are bounded by
the endless customs

32
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,559
to appease their in-laws.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,119
They have to come up with new
methods to please their husbands.

34
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,639
Apparently, some ladies

35
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,520
stopped eating pork for ten years

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,399
due to the fear of gaining weight.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
There are some

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,199
who dare not show themselves before
their husbands without makeup.

39
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,720
They'd remove the makeup
after he's asleep.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,839
Before dawn, they'd wake up
to put on makeup.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,919
It sounds exhausting.

42
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,320
If that's the case,

43
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,320
my mother's life is pretty easy.

44
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,679
My father dare not

45
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,800
show my mother any attitude.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Is this

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
for Zhong Ziyan?

48
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,520
Liangji told me that

49
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:49,160
Xingzhou's mother lives
in Tangjiao Village.

50
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,880
He lost his father since young.

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
He was raised by his mother.

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,199
During this trip,

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
he will definitely pay
his mother a visit.

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,000
His mother's home is
at Tangjiao Village?

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Your mother wants you to marry
Ruying of the Xie Family?

56
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,440
Yes.

57
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,199
My mother also told me that

58
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,839
she has been asking around.

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
If things go without a hitch,

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,639
our engagement will be decided.

61
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,039
By then, both of you
must give me a hand.

62
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,679
Do you hear me?

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Are you getting married?

64
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:22,679
Yes.

65
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,279
That's a good thing.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,119
The sooner it comes,
the sooner you'd part.

67
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,279
Excuse me, Zhao.

68
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:29,759
You...

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,479
We're here.

70
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,199
We've arrived.

71
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,240
We've arrived at Tangjiao Village.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,720
Hurry up.

73
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,160
Students, you may get off the carriage.

74
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
We've arrived.

75
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,199
Here.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,919
Be careful.

77
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,240
Have you decided?

78
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,199
I'll never marry Yan Boyang.

79
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,199
I'm afraid this

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,800
will affect your reputation.

81
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,200
If you refuse to help me,

82
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
I'll have no complains either.

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,640
Forget it.

84
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,839
I'll help you.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,119
Ruying wants me to convey this message.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
During dinner tonight,

87
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,839
she would like to meet you at the
gazebo at the end of the village.

88
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
All right. I'll do so.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Tell her

90
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
that I'll show up.

91
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,440
According to the plaques distributed,

92
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,480
head to your rooms.

93
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Nobody is allowed to
leave your rooms at night.

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,920
This is Tangjiao Village.

95
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,200
This isn't Wujiang Prefecture.

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,040
You do not have attendants with you.

97
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,320
You're all children of noble households.

98
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,359
If anything happens,

99
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,119
nobody will be able to
bear the responsibility.

100
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,200
Yes.

101
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,239
Tangjiao Village

102
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,720
is filled with Demon Foxes

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
and Vengeful Ghosts at night.

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,720
Demon Fox?

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,200
You mustn't head outside.

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,200
Do not ever head outside.

107
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,119
One doesn't

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
talk about monster, rebellion,
ghost and myth.

109
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,959
Mr. Xu.

110
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,359
My home is located in Tangjiao Village.

111
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,559
I would like to pay my mother
and sister a visit.

112
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:34,799
Sure.

113
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,959
However, we will be observing
the farms tomorrow.

114
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,200
You should return as early as possible.

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,160
I understand.

116
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,839
We shall distribute the plaques now.

117
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,239
Come forward as your name is called.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,880
Lang Mengzi.

119
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,359
Present!

120
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,279
Inform Director Xu that

121
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,959
we will be sharing a room.

122
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,440
Take the plaque for me.

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,239
Wang Weicheng.

124
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,320
I want to visit Zhong Ziyan's home.

125
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,679
Are you out of your mind?

126
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
It will not take long.

127
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,399
I'll be back soon.

128
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,600
Keep guard for me.

129
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,279
I shall take a move.

130
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,399
No.

131
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,119
Don't worry.

132
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:18,559
Su Wei!

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Xie Xiaoman.

134
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
I have matters to attend to.

135
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,559
I'm leaving.

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,559
What matters could you possibly have?

137
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,160
I just have stuff to do.

138
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,239
I need to go to the washroom.

139
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,239
Minggu and I are sharing a room.

140
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
She went to the restroom.

141
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
She wanted me to pick up
the plaque on her behalf.

142
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,399
I hope we're not assigned

143
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,720
to an isolated and cold room.

144
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,600
My mother told me

145
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,160
that ladies are vulnerable
to the cold.

146
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,279
During birth,

147
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,839
both the mother and child could die.

148
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,040
Mr. Xu!

149
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,959
Is there a window in this room?

150
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,559
Yes.

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,200
However, the sunlight cannot
reach the room. It's rather damp.

152
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,440
She can't be exposed to the cold.

153
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,880
Get her a room that
is exposed to the sun.

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
That's unnecessary.

155
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,839
I can't take the heat.

156
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,959
This is good enough.

157
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,480
Should I arrange a new room or not?

158
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,119
Yes.

159
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,640
No.

160
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,119
Xie Xiaoman.

161
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,760
Why wouldn't you accept
any kind intentions?

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,239
You're a woman,

163
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,119
not a man.

164
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,559
It doesn't matter.

165
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,839
I'm not switching rooms.

166
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,920
You're the Commandery Prince.
Your health is the priority.

167
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,359
You may sleep wherever you want to.

168
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,200
You...

169
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,000
Xue Yanwan.

170
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
(Guizi Room)
This room faces the sunlight.

171
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,600
You should take it.

172
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,079
Don't catch a cold.

173
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:08,679
Lady Xie.

174
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
Wash my feet for me tonight.

175
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,000
Why hasn't she shown up?

176
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,080
Yan Boyang.

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,159
You gave me a scare.

178
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,320
You gave me a scare.

179
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,320
Wait.

180
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,719
What are you doing here?

181
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,159
What are you doing here?

182
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,080
Me?

183
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm here...

184
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,400
It's none of your business.

185
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,239
You should go somewhere else.

186
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,559
Are you waiting for someone?

187
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,719
The person you're waiting
for isn't going to show up.

188
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,000
How would you know that?

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
Xie Ruying isn't coming.

190
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,679
I know.

191
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Su Wei,

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,520
please mind your own business.

193
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,039
The one involved is often blinded.

194
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,200
I found out a few days ago.

195
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm bringing the message to you.

196
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,599
Xie Ruying isn't interested in you.

197
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,799
She's making a fool out of you.

198
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,880
You should stop indulging
in a pipe dream.

199
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
She's proud and arrogant.

200
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,760
She doesn't want to marry you.

201
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,159
Hold on.

202
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,479
Why are you criticising her?

203
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,320
Hurry up and leave.

204
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,799
I'm just offering you a friendly advice.

205
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,039
You wouldn't accept my kind intentions.

206
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Listen to me.

207
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,119
Apparently, Tangjiao Village

208
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,599
is haunted by Vengeful Ghosts

209
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,640
and Demon Foxes.

210
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,719
Watch out on your own.

211
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,359
Minggu,

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,479
it's really dark and chilly.

213
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,359
It's dangerous, isn't it?

214
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm a man.

215
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,239
I'm strong and fearless.

216
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll protect you.

217
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,960
I'll send you back.

218
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,239
I'll send you back.

219
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,320
Aren't you strong and fearless?

220
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Minggu.

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,840
Look.

222
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,520
You're sharing a room with Xiaoman.

223
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,000
It's really late.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
She'd be out looking for you.

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
If one of you misses a turn,

226
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,039
and Xiaoman got lost,
what should we do then?

227
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,919
Am I right?

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,239
Let's wait for her here.

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,880
Let's wait for her.

230
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,200
I'll carry the lantern for you.

231
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,559
Allow me.

232
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,200
Allow me.

233
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,640
Here.

234
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,119
Let's go.

235
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,239
Get out of here!

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,440
Move it!

237
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,760
Get out of here!

238
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
My status is significant!

239
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,200
Listen to me!

240
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,760
Hurry up and get out of here!

241
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,039
Get out!

242
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,760
Get out!

243
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,159
Get out!

244
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,200
Get out!

245
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,119
Get out!

246
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,000
Quit laughing around.

247
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,679
Hurry up and get rid of it.

248
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,320
Hurry up.

249
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,760
Aren't you a man of significance?

250
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,159
Do you need others
to wash your feet for you?

251
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,080
You probably do not know.

252
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,679
Toads represent a good omen.

253
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,640
Village folks believe that
once you encounter a toad,

254
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,679
you must chant "get rich" three times.

255
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,119
You...

256
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,679
How about this?

257
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,760
Chant "get rich" three times

258
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
and I'll release it.

259
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,280
Get rich!

260
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,440
Get rich! Get rich!

261
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm sorry!

262
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,559
Because of me,

263
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,559
the kitchen decreased your food again!

264
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,080
They didn't even leave
any ice in your room!

265
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,440
I'm sorry!

266
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,799
Don't worry.

267
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,039
I can take the heat.

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,080
You said you can't stand the heat.

269
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,479
Hurry up and go to bed.

270
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,479
Don't worry about me

271
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,119
as long as you're not mad at me.

272
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,039
Will you sleep with me?

273
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,679
I'm afraid of toads.

274
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,200
Those creatures are slimy and sticky.

275
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,039
They croak a lot, too.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
With you around,

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,159
I'll feel much better.

278
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,960
Su Wei hasn't returned.

279
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,080
I have to find her.

280
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
She's a grown woman.

281
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,159
She can find her way herself.

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
There's only one bed here.

283
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,159
What's the sleeping situation?

284
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,679
I'll take the floor.
You can take the bed.

285
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,559
I'll be fine. I'm a man.

286
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,119
Besides, your room

287
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,159
is really damp.

288
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,760
Like Xue Yanwan said,

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,039
women cannot be exposed to the cold.

290
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,239
Otherwise, during birth,

291
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:19,719
they'd...

292
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,599
Cut the nonsense.

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,280
It's inappropriate to enter together.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,880
I'll head inside first.

295
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,840
Join me after this.

296
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,200
All right.

297
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,799
Where have you been last night?

298
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm concerned.

299
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,640
Why are you lecturing me?

300
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,760
I got lost last night.

301
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
I was waiting for you to come
look for me.

302
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,760
Where have you been?

303
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,559
Let's go.

304
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,479
Su Minggu.

305
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,919
Aren't you the young mistress
of Su Chang Ji?

306
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,320
Why would you wear the same
garments for two days straight?

307
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,880
What's wrong?

308
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,479
Is there a problem?

309
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,359
On the other hand,

310
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,599
you're up early for no reason.

311
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Were you off to steal chicken

312
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,799
or grain,

313
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,039
Xue Sanniang?

314
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,760
You...

315
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,000
What's this?

316
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,599
My wallet.

317
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,119
Minggu woke up early

318
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,440
to experience the life of a deity.

319
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,400
Return the wallet to me.

320
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,719
Lady Su.

321
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,440
Who is the man you
laid eyes on this time?

322
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,679
Go on and tell me.

323
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,799
Perhaps,

324
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,559
I could even help matchmake
the both of you.

325
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm warning you, cut the crap.

326
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,239
Return the wallet to me.

327
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,280
Give it back.

328
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,960
Yanwan. Yanwan.

329
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,080
Give it back.

330
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,359
Your shoes are gone.

331
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,359
Could they be stolen by the Demon Fox?

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,919
Master Li Zheng.

333
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,359
This involves a woman's reputation.

334
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,840
Please refrain from joking around.

335
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,640
Director Xu, I found it.

336
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,200
Director Xu,

337
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,799
I found it.

338
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,679
They were found in
Yan Boyang's book bag.

339
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Yan Boyang?

340
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,119
Oh, right.

341
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,760
Yan Boyang hasn't returned all night.

342
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,640
He did not return last night?

343
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
What happened?

344
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,520
Xue Yanwan's shoes were gone

345
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,960
and they are found in
Yan Boyang's book bag.

346
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,320
That's impossible.

347
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,840
No matter how mischievous
Yan Boyang is,

348
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
he's a son of a respectable household.

349
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,760
He will never commit such an act.

350
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:30,919
That's right.

351
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,559
It's early in the morning.

352
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm so tired.

353
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,799
Wait.

354
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,559
Why aren't you saying anything?

355
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,159
Are you all mute?

356
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,080
Stand upright.

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,679
Stand upright!

358
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,640
What did you do last night?

359
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,680
Me?

360
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,760
I was in my room the entire night.

361
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,040
You're lying.

362
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,119
Your roommate

363
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,760
claimed that you did
not return last night.

364
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,479
Yanwan lost her shoes.

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,400
They were found in your book bag.

366
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,680
I can't believe

367
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
you'd commit

368
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,800
such an awful act.

369
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:29,839
Wait.

370
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,359
I'll never marry you.

371
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,839
You lecher!

372
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,880
What...

373
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,479
What's going on?

374
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,000
Before the situation is clarified,

375
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,079
Director Xu,

376
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,079
you're quick to jump into conclusion.

377
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,239
Not clarified?

378
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,040
He is caught red-handed.

379
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
Yan Boyang, let me ask you.

380
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,599
You weren't in your room last night.

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,959
Where were you?

382
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,599
Do you have an alibi?

383
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,560
Yes, I have an alibi.

384
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,479
Men and women

385
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,239
shouldn't get close before marriage.

386
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,119
Wait.

387
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,920
This matter is heinous

388
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,800
and appalling.

389
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,719
Make your way into the wooden shed.

390
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,760
You're forbidden from
leaving without a reason.

391
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
By my position as the director,

392
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
I'm going to punish

393
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,680
a pest like you.

394
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,239
I...

395
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:11,880
The rest of you,

396
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,719
wash yourselves up

397
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,079
and get ready for the expedition.

398
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,160
Xu...

399
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,359
Dismiss.

400
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,040
Go on.

401
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,319
Let's go. Stop watching.

402
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,599
Boyang.

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,760
Boyang, I...

404
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,280
Boyang.

405
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,079
Boyang.

406
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,359
Boyang.

407
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,599
Was it you

408
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,560
the one with Boyang last night?

409
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:12,880
Last night,

410
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,880
I wanted to look for Zhong Ziyan.

411
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,880
However, in the gazebo
at the end of the village,

412
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,959
I noticed Yan Boyang was
waiting for Xie Ruying.

413
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,239
I know that Xie Ruying wouldn't show up.

414
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,880
That's why I went to advise him.

415
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:25,959
Who knows...

416
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,839
I wanted to testify for him,

417
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,079
but I'm afraid I will not
be able to explain myself.

418
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,719
You experienced it yourself.

419
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
A woman's reputation

420
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,599
is more important than anything else.

421
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:43,880
I know.

422
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,040
What happened last night?

423
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,359
If I'm not mistaken,

424
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:53,760
last night,

425
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,680
Lady Su

426
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,040
was probably with Boyang.

427
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:57,599
Why didn't she

428
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,599
testify for Boyang?

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,959
She's a lady.

430
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,719
You're late.

431
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,800
I made the bed for you.

432
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm sleeping with Minggu tonight.

433
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,680
Why would you do so?

434
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,359
Boyang ended up in trouble
because of her.

435
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,839
Now, she expects my wife

436
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,719
to keep her company.

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,959
How did you know that?

438
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Xingzhou told me.

439
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,959
He's guessing that Boyang

440
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,760
was with her last night.

441
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,839
Because of Su Wei's
status as a lady,

442
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,359
she did not testify for Boyang.

443
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,479
How could Zhong Ziyan
possibly guess it right?

444
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,239
Did you forget what happened to me?

445
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,199
I spent a night with you

446
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,599
and ended up as your concubine.

447
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,560
Are you expecting Minggu

448
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,959
to become Yan Boyang's
concubine as well?

449
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,000
We're talking about someone else.

450
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,680
Why would you relate it to yourself?

451
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,719
It's a lesson of my past.

452
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,000
If it were me,
I wouldn't utter a word either.

453
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,439
You men will be reprimanded at most.

454
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:05,959
On the contrary,

455
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,719
our lives will be ruined.

456
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,040
Are you saying that I ruined your life?

457
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,359
I...

458
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,319
Are you saying that I ruined your life?

459
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,599
Isn't that right?

460
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,520
You're just selfish.

461
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,280
You don't want to return to the capital,

462
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,199
so you use my life as a collateral.

463
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,199
You even threatened me.

464
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,719
Yan Boyang is a close friend of yours.

465
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,680
Are you going to put Minggu's life

466
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,479
at stake as well?

467
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,359
What do you mean?

468
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,280
Are you saying that I'm
not treating you right?

469
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,599
Or others treat you better than I do?

470
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,359
Of course.

471
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
I could marry any man

472
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,680
and they'd be better than you.

473
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,359
No one else on earth could

474
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,359
irritate me like you do.

475
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,520
Don't worry.

476
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,079
After two years,

477
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,479
we will be on our own paths.

478
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,199
I'm better off without you.

479
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,599
Where are you going?

480
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,239
Lady Su.

481
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,959
Zhong Ziyan.

482
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,439
I've offended you before.

483
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,599
My apologies.

484
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,959
Boyang is locked in the wooden shed.

485
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,359
I just returned from checking on him.

486
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm going home tonight.

487
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,119
I'm leaving now.

488
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,000
Hold on.

489
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:41,959
How is Yan Boyang

490
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,839
doing?

491
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,000
He's fine.

492
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,119
He bore no grudges.

493
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,439
Don't worry.

494
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,520
I...

495
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,680
I know what you're thinking.

496
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,520
Boyang is upset this happened

497
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,560
to him.

498
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
However, you may not have known.

499
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
The three of us may seem close,

500
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,439
but our personalities
are very different.

501
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,880
Hanchen is arbitrary.

502
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,599
I'm rather gloomy.

503
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,239
Boyang is the only one

504
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,319
that seems unreliable,

505
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,079
but is extremely gentle-hearted.

506
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:10,199
He's optimistic.

507
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,800
He will remain positive

508
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,239
despite what happened.

509
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,599
Don't worry.

510
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,239
Did you find out?

511
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,359
It's getting dark.

512
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,119
I think it's going to rain.

513
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,040
You should go back.

514
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,319
It's not that I don't want to help him.

515
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,079
It's because...

516
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,880
Lady Su,

517
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,400
it's been decided.

518
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Forget it. You should go back.

519
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:43,560
Ziyan.

520
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,880
Zhong Ziyan.

521
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,040
Zhong...

522
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Why are you here?

523
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:31,719
Well,

524
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,560
I made you some noodles.

525
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,000
I made it myself.

526
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,280
Have some.

527
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm not hungry.

528
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,040
Boyang.

529
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,760
I'm sorry.

530
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,439
I understand that I'm at fault.

531
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,520
We're friends.

532
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,839
I should've testified for you

533
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,400
and proved your innocence.

534
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,800
However, I have no guts.

535
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,719
I'm a lady.

536
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,439
I'm afraid of public criticism.

537
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,079
I'm afraid of being
chastised by the teacher.

538
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,560
I'm afraid of

539
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,400
disappointing my parents.

540
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm not blaming you.

541
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,319
I mean it.

542
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,400
I understand

543
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,800
that a lady's reputation is everything.

544
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,560
I'm doing fine.

545
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,239
I just have to endure it
and it will pass.

546
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,839
It will be forgotten
after I'm chastised.

547
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,079
I do not blame you.

548
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,880
I'm glad that

549
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,959
you remained silent.

550
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,719
If you testified,

551
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,839
what should I do if I ended up
like Zhao Xiaoqian

552
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,000
and I'm forced to marry you?

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,680
Isn't that right?

554
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,000
You're bad-tempered

555
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,199
and feisty.

556
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,439
I'll receive a handful all day.

557
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,599
There's a saying that goes,

558
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,839
a coward

559
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,719
with an overbearing wife.

560
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,319
Am I right?

561
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,839
Finish this bowl of noodles then.

562
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,680
Once you finish this bowl of noodles,

563
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,959
I'll take it that you've forgiven me.

564
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,079
Here.

565
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:40,719
Slow down.

566
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,400
Get rich. Get rich.

567
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,160
Get rich.

568
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,920
Do not come near me.

569
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:25,920
Get rich!

570
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,839
Do not come near me!

571
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,560
Stop!

572
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,520
Do not come closer.

573
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,520
Stop it.

574
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,839
Do not come any closer.

575
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,160
Get rich.

576
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,719
Get rich.

577
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,479
Get rich.

578
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,880
Do not come near me.

579
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,439
No.

580
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,479
Do not come any closer.

581
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,400
Get rich.

582
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:42,800
Get...

583
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,000
Get rich.

584
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,280
What are you laughing at?

585
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,599
It's all your fault.

586
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,400
Hurry up and get rid of it!

587
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
Let me take you somewhere.

588
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:26,479
Sure.

589
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,180
(Mount Kunyan Temple)

590
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,880
This is it.

591
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,640
Su Wei said that
there's a huge lake here,

592
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,479
Lake Nanming.

593
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,760
It's named after...

594
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,800
The sea in the south

595
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,079
is a natural beauty.

596
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,000
I can't believe we managed to find it.

597
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,680
It's beautiful.

598
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,599
Is this Lake Nanming?

599
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,160
There's a legend shared.

600
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,520
Have you heard of the work,
Carefree Wandering?

601
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,920
A creature lives in Lake Beiming.
It's known as the Kun.

602
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,160
Its size could go up to

603
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,560
thousands of miles.

604
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,520
This is the location described.

605
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,119
Do you think

606
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,280
there's a large creature that extends

607
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,319
to thousands of miles?

608
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,520
This is a figure of speech.

609
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
It's a metaphor, do you get it?

610
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,439
You sure are smart.

611
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,199
That's right.

612
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,800
My tutors

613
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,920
were reputable scholars.

614
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,640
Unlike Congwen.

615
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,040
They are way better than him.

616
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,160
What are you laughing at?

617
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,800
Food is essential for
the survival of mankind.

618
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,319
I was mad that I
did not wanna eat.

619
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,359
I'm hungry.

620
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,599
I haven't had anything to eat.

621
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,079
It's natural to grow hungry.

622
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,239
I plucked some fruits on our way here.

623
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,760
Go ahead.

624
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,719
When I was young,
we experienced a drought at home.

625
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,280
We had nothing to eat.

626
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,640
My brother didn't want me to starve,

627
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,319
so he wandered through
the wilderness

628
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,640
to pluck me fruits.

629
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,400
Did you eat these when you were young?

630
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,560
I don't want them.

631
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,280
You became an idiot
from consuming these.

632
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,239
I wouldn't eat these
even if I starved.

633
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,119
Are you sure?

634
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,719
This is life.

635
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,000
You...

636
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,239
What are you doing here?

637
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,239
I forgot to inform you.

638
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,959
You need to warn the children.

639
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,119
One mustn't

640
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,839
pluck and consume the fruits
around the village casually.

641
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,119
A specific type of fruit

642
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,319
could cause one to turn hysterical.

643
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,599
I understand.

644
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,359
The academy

645
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,760
consists of children
of noble households.

646
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,599
They will not consume wild fruits.

647
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,400
That's enough.

648
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,959
Go.

649
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,640
Go back to bed.

650
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,880
He gave me a fright.

651
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,880
Did you know?

652
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,199
That's how I grew up.

653
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,680
I belong to the village.

654
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,760
That time was the best.

655
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,199
I had no worries.

656
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,599
I had no problems.

657
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,800
What about you?

658
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,920
How was your childhood like?

659
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,359
You grew up in the capital.

660
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm sure you've seen plenty of things.

661
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,160
Are you asking about my childhood?

662
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,119
I was impressive when I was young.

663
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,839
I entered the palace

664
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:30,920
with my brother.

665
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
Have you heard of Wude Palace?

666
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,839
That's where we stayed.

667
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,640
Behind Wude Palace,

668
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,680
there's a great wall.

669
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,599
In winters,

670
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,640
my brother and I

671
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,479
would fly kites beneath the walls.

672
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,239
My brother was great at making kites.

673
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,400
My kites would fly the highest.

674
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,680
When I was young, I thought

675
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,280
the higher my kite flew,

676
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,680
my parents would be
able to notice us then.

677
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,800
They would come to us at the palace.

678
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,199
That's impossible.

679
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,680
The capital is enormous.

680
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,359
They couldn't possibly see us.

681
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,520
I held on to the dream of

682
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,920
flying kites with my brother

683
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,599
in the snow below the great walls.

684
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,119
Afterward,

685
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,839
my brother turned into a kite.

686
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:26,959
I wanted to go after him,

687
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,560
but I can no longer reach him.

688
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,119
Zhao Xiaoqian, look.

689
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,500
♪Approach you slowly♪

690

It's a Kun

691

that goes up to thousands
of miles in length.

692
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,959
It's a Kun.

693
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,479
Zhao Xiaoqian, look.

694
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,159
It's a Kun.

Director Xu.

705
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,439
That's enough.

706
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,919
You should get going.

707
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,159
I heard about

708
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
what happened

709
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,159
from Lady Su.

710
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:14,479
I have

711
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,639
wronged you.

712
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,120
She spoke the truth?

713
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,199
Where is she?

714
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,600
Seriously.

715
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:23,639
Yan Boyang.

716
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,439
Do you know what it means
to respect your teacher?

717
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:33,520
Su Wei.

718
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,679
Did you really disclose the truth?

719
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,919
Of course.

720
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,760
Why did you do such a thing?

721
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,399
A lady's reputation is everything.

722
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,919
What's going to happen
after you revealed the truth?

723
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,239
Daughters of Su Family

724
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,360
stand upright.

725
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm not afraid.

726
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,919
Are you afraid?

727
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,159
I...

728
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,959
Of course I'm not afraid.

729
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,580
(Residence of the Su Family)

730
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,800
Su Chang Ji is one of the most

731
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,639
reputable textile stores
in Wujiang Prefecture.

732
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,639
I know

733
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,639
Su Wei

734
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,399
is no ordinary lady.

735
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,360
No matter what it is,

736
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,879
she's a lady after all.

737
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,159
Yesterday during the expedition,

738
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,879
she spent a night alone with a man.

739
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,439
Although there's a reason to it,

740
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,080
it's against the norms.

741
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,520
Don't worry, Madam Su.

742
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,399
The academy

743
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,800
will keep this a secret.

744
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,639
Yan Boyang and his family responded.

745
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,879
They will keep this confidential.

746
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,159
Thank you, Director Xu.

747
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:48,080
All right.

748
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,399
I had tea

749
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,639
and delivered the message.

750
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
There are matters to
attend to at the academy.

751
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,159
I shall excuse myself.

752
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,360
Madam Su,

753
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,639
even if it's not for
the sake of Lady Su,

754
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,560
please protect the

755
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,000
reputation of our fellow ladies as well.

756
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:10,639
I won't be sending you off.

757
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,919
Director Xu.

758
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,360
Take care.

759
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,560
Kneel.

760
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,159
Aren't you ashamed

761
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,439
of what you did?

762
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,879
Look at the mess you created.

763
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,639
Dear, please calm down.

764
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,000
Keep it down.

765
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,840
The attendants are present.

766
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,800
It's inappropriate if they'd hear this.

767
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,639
What's wrong with that?

768
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
If Su Minggu would do such a thing,

769
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,040
why would she fear repercussions?

770
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,040
I told you.

771
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,159
Both of us lost our way.

772
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Besides, Yan Boyang promised

773
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,959
not to disclose this to anyone.

774
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,399
Nobody would find out about this.

775
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,600
Why are you mad at me?

776
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,520
No one knows?

777
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,159
Su Wei,

778
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,840
is this what you've
learned from the academy?

779
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,479
Listen up.

780
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,760
If you were born of
a common household,

781
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,600
I would have

782
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,120
married you off to Yan Boyang.

783
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,399
However, you're the young mistress

784
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,320
of Su Chang Ji.

785
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:20,159
You're to succeed
the business in the future.

786
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,040
Look at your current state.

787
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,439
How can I possibly

788
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,840
leave you the business

789
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
of the household?

790
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,120
I don't want the business.
Does that suffice?

791
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:28,919
You...

792
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,919
You once said

793
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,600
that I'm different from other ladies.

794
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm raised like a boy.

795
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,919
I'm going to accomplish
things expected of a man.

796
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,000
When a minor hurdle occurs,

797
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,800
you're lecturing me with
the Admonitions of Women.

798
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,159
Do you think

799
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,479
that I've brought
shame to Su Family?

800
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,520
I, Su Wei, have done nothing wrong.

801
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,159
Even if this was made known

802
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,399
to the whole of Wujiang Prefecture,

803
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,439
I will still live my life openly.

804
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,879
I'll succeed and manage Su Chang Ji.

805
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:51,800
I'm not afraid of anything.

806
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,320
What are you talking about?

807
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,639
Stop it.

808
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,479
Bian Embroidery has arrived
from the capital.

809
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
These are the samples sent

810
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,560
from the Zhang Family of the capital.

811
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,439
I was contemplating to
show this to Lady Su

812
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,879
and confirm the purchase.

813
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,800
Fine.

814
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,840
Since you're going to succeed

815
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,360
Su Family's business

816
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,320
and request me to
treat you like a man

817
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,600
instead of abiding to the
Admonitions of Women,

818
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,560
fine.

819
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,040
Su Chang Ji

820
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,159
is about to launch
a store at the capital.

821
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,040
You have no choice but to
master Bian Embroidery.

822
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,280
You're the heir of Su Chang Ji.

823
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,639
You shall bear such a task.

824
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,639
The moment

825
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,560
you've mastered Bian Embroidery,

826
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,040
you will be released.

827
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:07,959
Father.

828
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,760
Don't call upon me.

829
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,000
Even I can't save you now.

830
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:14,399
You deserved it.

831
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,639
Father.

832
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,820
(Bailu Academy)

833
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:39,639
Chef Zhang,

834
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,360
His Highness would like
to know what's on the menu.

835
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,879
Prawn dumplings with soup, Yuguanfei,

836
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:43,919
Wuhou mackerel,
fried rabbit with scallions,

837
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:44,560
candied tangerine

838
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,879
along with pear milk.

839
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,800
All right.

840
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,760
Food is served.

841
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:30,760
The Wuhou mackerel

842
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,879
is made from the mackerel

843
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:32,639
caught from Lake Tai.

844
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,520
The fish head is sliced into halves.

845
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,600
Along with the skin,
the body is split into four.

846
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,159
It's cooked on low heat for 15 minutes

847
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,600
until the gravy thickens.

848
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:41,280
It will then be cooked in bamboo.

849
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,879
By such techniques,

850
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:43,840
the taste is much sweeter.

851
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,159
By the way,

852
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:46,639
the chef also

853
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,159
prepared a pot of pear milk.

854
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,159
Give it a try.

855
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,159
Isn't this just Peng Cake?

856
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,360
I can make it myself.

857
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,120
It can be done with just
rice flour and barley sugar.

858
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,320
By the way,

859
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,959
why isn't Minggu attending class?

860
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,639
Do not call her courtesy name.

861
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,040
That incident

862
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,639
enraged her mother.

863
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:19,639
Minggu is grounded at home.

864
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,280
She was forced to
master Bian Embroidery.

865
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,159
Bian Embroidery?

866
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,320
She...

867
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,159
What's going on?

868
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,520
Will she be married off?

869
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,959
Of course not.

870
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Don't be ridiculous.

871
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,840
Minggu is the successor of Su Chang Ji.

872
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,560
She has to master such skill.

873
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,520
You're right.

874
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,399
Why are you so concerned about her?

875
00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:40,439
Don't tell me you leaked

876
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,399
the incident out.

877
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,080
Of course not.

878
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,120
I...

879
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,120
I'm...

880
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,800
I'm just casually asking.

881
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,399
Let's eat.

882
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,520
Let's eat.

883
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,360
That night back at Lake Nanming
on Mount Kunyan...

884
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,040
This is delicious.
