Look, this is really nice.

22
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,519
Not bad, Yan Boyang.

23
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,480
It's 20 strings of
1000 cash as you said.

24
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,839
Your father must've taken quite
a lot of money from others.

25
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,239
Pay me.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,480
Give me the letter first.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,959
Pay me first.

28
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you out of your mind?

29
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,360
Why are you giving him money?

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,279
No, wait.

31
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,600
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,440
This is between men.

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,559
Stay out of it.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,440
That's right.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,800
This is between men,

36
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,679
right, Yu Qilin?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,919
What? Yu Qilin?

38
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,839
Nothing.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
What's with this letter?

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Is it Yan Boyang's?

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,559
Yan Boyang wrote a lady a letter

42
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,520
and asked me to deliver it.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,119
Is it wrong for me to run the errand
with a small fee?

44
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,160
It's okay.

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,839
Are

46
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,960
you crazy?

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,000
You've been trying to
cause trouble for us.

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,320
Let me tell you.

49
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,880
Leave the letter behind

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
and scram.

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,600
Yan Boyang,

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,039
if you don't pay me,

53
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm going to tear this into pieces.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,360
Don't.

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,960
Don't tear it.

56
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,520
Su Wei,

57
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,119
you'd better leave.

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Come on.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,160
Leave.

60
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,759
There're more interesting stuff inside.

61
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,720
Don't tear it.

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,240
Su Wei.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,720
Su Wei.

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,479
Leave quickly.

65
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,880
Why are you pushing me?

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
You're being bullied and
threatened by Xu Shu,

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
so I helped you. Yet you're
blaming me and pushed me?

68
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,279
Su Wei,

69
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,919
can you stop minding others' business?

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
Leave quickly.

71
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,520
Yan Boyang,

72
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,479
fine.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
You coward.

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,119
You deserve to be bullied.

75
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,679
I...

76
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,520
Lady.

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,119
Go away.

78
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,559
Pay me now.

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,160
I've already paid you.

80
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,240
Give me the letter.

81
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,759
What are you trying to do now?

82
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,679
What's that just now?

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Damsel saving the scholar in distress?

84
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,160
I

85
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,399
hate to be pointed by others
and scolded the most.

86
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,440
Add 20 strings of 1000 cash more

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,600
to compensate for me.

88
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,039
20 strings of 1000 cash more?

89
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,679
You're jacking up the price.

90
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
That's exactly what I'm doing.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,479
Let's go.

92
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,119
Just wait and see!

93
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,440
Coward.

94
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,320
Yan Boyang!

95
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,559
You made me angry!

96
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,119
You made me angry!

97
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
You won't even listen!

98
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,679
You unworthy man!

99
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,200
Minggu.

100
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,480
Yan Boyang made me so mad.

101
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,640
What's wrong with Yan Boyang?

102
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,119
He's a coward.

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,279
Don't even mention him.

104
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,880
What did Qiongqiong say?

105
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,880
Courtesan Zhu has decided
to get married.

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,359
Qiongqiong hopes that
Congwen will go and see her,

107
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,600
but I think

108
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,119
it's between the two of them

109
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,119
and I shouldn't interfere

110
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
so I didn't agree to it.

111
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,839
Look.

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,200
In the end, they'll separate anyway.

113
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,399
Why are things in this world

114
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,359
so strange?

115
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
Take Yan Boyang for example.

116
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,799
He usually pretends to be composed,

117
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,160
but he's a coward
during critical moment.

118
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,959
Also, Courtesan Zhu and Congwen.

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,600
The two of them were doing fine,

120
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
but in the end, they'll separate anyway.

121
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,359
Perhaps it's as written in the books.

122
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,839
"Such a trying journey,
so full of forked paths before."

123
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Certain things

124
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,559
don't seem as easy on the surface.

125
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,679
Also, everyone thinks differently.

126
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,600
Since there're many forked paths,

127
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
people will gradually go separate ways.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,279
There's nothing wrong with it.

129
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
However, think about it.

130
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,160
Courtesan Zhu's a courtesan.

131
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,640
Congwen's family

132
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,959
is said to be officials in the capital.

133
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,440
They're not destined to be together.

134
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Moreover, Courtesan Zhu's so proud.

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
She usually interacts with
officials and noblemen.

136
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,760
How could she possibly be willing
to be someone's concubine?

137
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,279
That's not...

138
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,399
That's not what I meant.

139
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,359
You're right.

140
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,799
Forget it.

141
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,559
Anyway, it's not like I
can help with anything.

142
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,399
Let's go home.

143
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,880
Okay.

144
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,519
Your Highness,

145
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,799
eat first.

146
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,839
The dishes are turning cold.

147
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,839
Wait for a while more.

148
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:10,839
Your Highness.

149
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Your Highness.

150
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,480
She's back.

151
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,600
Lady is back.

152
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,119
Understood.

153
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:17,640
Go quickly.

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,399
You're back.

155
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,839
Come on.

156
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,959
The dishes are cold.
I was waiting for you.

157
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,839
What's wrong?

158
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
You're in a bad mood?

159
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,480
No.

160
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,959
Come on, let's eat.

161
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,079
I was waiting for you.

162
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,399
The dishes are cold.

163
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,359
I didn't touch any of them.

164
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,359
I was waiting for you.

165
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,239
Eat quickly.

166
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
This, too. Try it.

167
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,279
It's very tasty.

168
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,760
Today is the Ghost Festival.

169
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,239
I purposely booked a
decorated pleasure boat.

170
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
Later,

171
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,040
we'll go and watch the lanterns,
all right?

172
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I don't want to go.

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,239
Don't eat if you don't want to go.

174
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Guizhao Workshop is a large
decorated pleasure boat.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,959
It's not up to you to choose.

176
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,160
You have to go.

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,399
Why must I go?

178
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,519
What are you trying to do?

179
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,279
I...

180
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,040
Anyway, it's...

181
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,720
I have something to tell you.

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,239
Just say it now.

183
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:34,720
I...

184
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,000
Certain words

185
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,959
must be said during the festivities,

186
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,119
so it'll be more formal.

187
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,440
Right?

188
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,679
Yes, that's right.

189
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,720
It's a gift.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,959
Before we arrive at Guizhao Workshop,

191
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,959
you mustn't light it.

192
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,119
Come on.

193
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,040
Let's eat.

194
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,799
Why did you come back so late today?

195
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,559
Can I ask you a question?

196
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,760
Of course.

197
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,720
Is there a type of

198
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,079
relationship which family background
doesn't matter,

199
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,519
and the couple can be together
as long as they're in love?

200
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,079
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

201
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,359
I

202
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,039
recently read a picturebook.

203
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,960
There's a couple in it.

204
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,119
Due to the differences in
their family backgrounds,

205
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
the lady is going to marry someone else.

206
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,880
As for the man,

207
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,559
he didn't get to see
her for the last time.

208
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,320
I just want to know

209
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,840
if everyone thinks

210
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,359
if the family backgrounds
aren't compatible,

211
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,320
they're bound to separate?

212
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,400
Of course not.

213
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
At least not for me.

214
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,599
I don't believe it either.

215
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,520
What great foundations

216
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,960
or large-scale family businesses

217
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:07,840
were all

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,239
earned by our ancestors.

219
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,200
Back then, my ancestor

220
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,919
wasn't a royal or aristocrat.

221
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,200
He established his kingdom.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Now, my entire family

223
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,559
is doing well thanks to him.

224
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Therefore,

225
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,799
where there's a will, there's a way.

226
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,320
Moreover,

227
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,799
a man

228
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,840
doesn't even dare see his
lover for one last time.

229
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,200
This kind of man.

230
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,960
She'll do better without him.

231
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,400
What are you talking about?

232
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,799
If you like someone,

233
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,640
you must tell the person.

234
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,119
The picturebooks you read

235
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,599
tell the stories of scholars
and beautiful women.

236
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,359
All these scholarly officials
are wretched.

237
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,880
He'd risk his life to submit
a memorial to His Majesty,

238
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,159
but is too cowardly to meet his lover.

239
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,200
What is he trying to do
by not saying a word?

240
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:51,359
Does he want her

241
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,239
to miss him forever?

242
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,280
That's only causing trouble for others.

243
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,679
Don't believe that.

244
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm not like that.

245
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Either way, I'm telling you.

246
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,919
A man having a clear conscience

247
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,960
isn't only about serving the nation.

248
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,320
It's also

249
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,799
about his heart.

250
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,080
Do you understand?

251
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,239
Here.

252
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,960
Having a clear conscience here.

253
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,320
Well said.

254
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,559
Don't worry.

255
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,679
I...

256
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,599
I'm quite the man.

257
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,359
I'm going out.

258
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,119
Later, I'll go look for you
directly at Xushui.

259
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,239
Where are you going?

260
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,660
(Teachers' Office)

261
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,039
Congwen,

262
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,599
today is the Ghost Festival.

263
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,719
Let's go back earlier.

264
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm leaving soon.

265
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,359
Congwen,

266
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,719
there's no time.

267
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,479
Xiaoman?

268
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,119
Courtesan Zhu's going to leave tonight.

269
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,559
It has nothing to do with you.

270
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,239
Go home.

271
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,479
That day, when I first came
to Wujiang Prefecture,

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,119
you told me to look forward

273
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,239
to mount the wind, break the waves,
and traverse the vast, rolling sea.

274
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,200
Look forward means

275
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,359
to make peace with
everything in the past.

276
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,919
Someone told me that

277
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
men need to have a clear
conscience in handling matters.

278
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,960
Not only is the conscience
about serving the nation,

279
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:27,840
it's also about here.

280
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,320
When handling affairs,

281
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,239
men also have to be true
to their hearts.

282
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,239
That's what it really means
by having a clear conscience.

283
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,640
Are you going to make yourself

284
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,479
as well as Courtesan Zhu regret?

285
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,359
By the painted window, I shed tears
while staring at the vermilion gates.

286
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,599
Things of the present are right and
wrong, leaving feelings of resentment.

287
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,840
Dreams of ecstasy filled
the old courtyard.

288
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,640
Since we last met,

289
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,119
how much melancholy is there?

290
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,679
Just listen to the raindrops
into evening.

291
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,559
Her feelings have been written on here.

292
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
What about you?

293
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,479
You don't even dare bid her farewell?

294
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,840
This was written by Yanniang?

295
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,760
That's right.

296
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,320
Qiongqiong came looking for me,

297
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,479
asking me to pass this to you.

298
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,440
You two haven't bid each other farewell.

299
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,239
She doesn't want you

300
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,960
to have regrets.

301
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,559
So,

302
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,679
she asked me to give you this

303
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,239
for you to make the decision.

304
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,559
What's the time now?

305
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,719
There's still time.

306
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Minggu.

307
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,640
There's "Night Parade of One Hundred
Demons" on the Ghost Festival.

308
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,440
So,

309
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,640
if you're afraid,

310
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,599
stay with me

311
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,400
so I could protect you.

312
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:00,919
You'll protect me?

313
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,719
Use 20 strings of 1,000 cash
to protect me.

314
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,440
Minggu,

315
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,400
I...

316
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,960
Where's Xie Xiaoman?

317
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
She should be here soon.

318
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,440
Why isn't she here yet?

319
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,559
Why are you asking me to see her?

320
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,760
Don't you want to meet her?

321
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,080
Someone once told me that

322
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,440
while we're alive,

323
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,799
we mustn't let ourselves down.

324
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,960
You've helped me a lot.

325
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,039
I don't want you to
regret in the future.

326
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,520
Your friend

327
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,159
is quite straightforward.

328
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,400
She's here.

329
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:04,320
Courtesan Zhu.

330
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,599
Stop the carriage.

331
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,880
Take it.

332
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,520
Stop, Courtesan Zhu!

333
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,159
Congwen has a gift for you

334
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,359
to bid his old friend farewell.

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,200
Go quickly.

336
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,080
I'll buy another lantern.

337
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,799
Go!

338
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,039
I've never given you any

339
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,159
gift meant for a lady in the past.

340
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,679
My bad.

341
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,520
This is for you.

342
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,559
I don't believe you bought it yourself.

343
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,159
You used to blame me

344
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,239
for not understanding your troubles.

345
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
When I talked to you,

346
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,520
it's always about official affairs.

347
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,359
I wasn't romantic at all.

348
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,479
Today,

349
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,760
let's be romantic for once, all right?

350
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Yanniang,

351
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
the city gate's closing soon.

352
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,080
Get back to the carriage.

353
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,400
Yanniang, where are you going?

354
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,479
Yanniang!

355
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,239
Yanniang!

356
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,320
This is your romance?

357
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,000
That's right.

358
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,760
This is my romance.

359
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,479
This is Congwen's romance.

360
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,719
I can't grant you a stable life

361
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,039
or lifelong promise.

362
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,400
I can't grant you lots of things,

363
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,320
but I just want to make you smile.

364
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,679
But now,

365
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,599
what if I want to change for your sake?

366
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,440
What if I disregard everything else

367
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,679
to redeem you,

368
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,559
make you my wife,

369
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
be with you for the rest of my life,

370
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,840
and have our own offspring.

371
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,719
Just you and me.

372
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,719
For this entire lifetime,

373
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,479
we'll be together forever.

374
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,559
What do you think?

375
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,919
Congwen, you're still so scholarly.

376
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,159
That's good.

377
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,039
You're still the same,

378
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,719
Li Congwen, the scholar whom I like.

379
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,280
You've never changed once.

380
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,400
What had changed is me and society.

381
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
Do you think you can get away from

382
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,760
your family?

383
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,960
Li Family has been
scholars for generations.

384
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,080
And me?

385
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,560
A 24-year-old

386
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,719
courtesan.

387
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm not good enough for you.

388
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,719
Don't you understand?

389
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,319
The Li Congwen in my heart

390
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,959
has high ambitions.

391
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,760
He's going to attend the
imperial examination in the future.

392
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,959
He'll become a great man and
has a bright future ahead.

393
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,040
He's destined to be Li Congwen
who stands at the top

394
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,359
instead of belonging to me.

395
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,520
But what if I don't want to
attend the imperial examination?

396
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,640
What bright future?

397
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,599
I don't care at all.

398
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,280
You have to

399
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,680
because the Li Congwen I love

400
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,959
is always the sincere Li Congwen

401
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
wishing to serve the nation.

402
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,760
I want to see you marry
the daughter of a noble family

403
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,520
which elevates your status,

404
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,319
allowing you to focus on
pursuing knowledge

405
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,160
as well as ways of handling
national affairs

406
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,359
and become a high official eventually

407
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,599
to serve the people.

408
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,760
What I wish to see the most

409
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,199
is the future Chancellor Li.

410
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,239
When he thinks back when he's old,

411
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,719
he still remembers

412
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,880
there was once a woman called
Yanniang at Wujiang Prefecture

413
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,920
who hoped that you'll advance on
the path of becoming an official.

414
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,400
But I

415
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,160
have my own path.

416
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,319
After marrying that man,

417
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,599
perhaps my life will be plain,

418
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,319
but one day,
when I become a grandmother,

419
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,839
if I think of the Li Congwen
whom I once loved

420
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,479
and is now well-known as an official

421
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,079
was willing to give up
everything tonight,

422
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,920
I won't have any regret.

423
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,400
Yanniang!

424
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,400
Yanniang,

425
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,839
where are you?

426
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
My husband's looking for me.

427
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:55,920
Take care.

428
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,359
Yanniang.

429
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,280
Yanniang!

430
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,400
Yanniang!

431
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,239
Path of becoming an official.

432
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,119
Chancellor Li.

433
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,560
Path of becoming an official.

434
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,880
Chancellor Li.

435
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,479
What if I don't want to?

436
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,119
What if all this is not what I want?

437
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,839
Resembling a bird locked
in a golden cage.

438
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,040
My robes are filled with dust.

439
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,040
As if I'm seeing all this from
the outside of my body.

440
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,920
I descended to the mortal world
for a few years.

441
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
Not long ago, eastern winds were here,

442
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,920
and peach blossoms are
as I remembered them.

443
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,119
I return to the county of Wuling.

444
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,880
By the painted window, I shed tears
while staring at the vermilion gates.

445
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,760
Things of the present are right and
wrong, leaving feelings of resentment.

446
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,239
Dreams of ecstasy filled
the old courtyard.

447
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,160
Since we last met,

448
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,520
how much melancholy is there?

449
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,319
Just listen to the raindrops
into evening.

450
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,400
It's strange.

451
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,479
Hanchen,

452
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,760
she might've been delayed by some stuff.

453
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,520
Let's wait for a while.

454
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,400
Come down first. Careful, don't fall.

455
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,479
Who cares if she's coming or not?

456
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
I don't care.

457
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,560
Forget it.

458
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,800
I'll help you to look for her.

459
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,079
Minggu,

460
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,920
I'll go with you.

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,640
No need.

462
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,359
Minggu.

463
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't come after me.

464
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,239
Minggu,

465
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
don't be angry.

466
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
I know I shouted at you earlier.

467
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,839
Look.

469
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,400
Today's a festival.

470
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,079
If you missed this beautiful scene

471
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,239
because you're angry,

472
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,800
it isn't worth it at all, right?

473
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,839
Yan Boyang, do you have
nothing better to do?

474
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,319
Why are you so fierce?

475
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,760
That's how I am.

476
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,119
However fierce I am,
it's still better than you

477
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,400
being all cowardly and indecisive.

478
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,760
Who are you calling a coward?

479
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,479
If you aren't a coward,

480
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,079
go talk to Xu Shu

481
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,760
to take your money and letter back.

482
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,319
Walking back and forth here.

483
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,280
Who are you trying to
be unreasonable with?

484
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,280
You just dislike that

485
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,040
I gave Xu Shu
20 strings of 1000 cash earlier.

486
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,680
All right, wait here.

487
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,359
I'm going to take that
20 strings of 1000 cash back now.

488
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I'll show you that

489
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,319
I, Yan Boyang, am not a coward.

490
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,319
Where are you going?

491
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,800
Where am I going? I'll go and
take the money back from him.

492
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,479
Yan Boyang!

493
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,160
Su Wei,

494
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,119
what's going on with you two?

495
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,160
He's going to look for Xu Shu.

496
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:14,880
Xu Shu?

497
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
Yesterday at brothel,

498
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Yan Boyang and Xu Shu

499
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,319
had a conflict.

500
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,800
Xu Shu blackmailed him.

501
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,880
Just now I bickered with him,

502
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,560
and said he's a coward,

503
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,400
that might've agitated him.

504
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,359
And that fool

505
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,479
insisted to go talk to Xu Shu

506
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
to prove himself.

507
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,880
He doesn't have a weapon

508
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,800
and acts on impulse.

509
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,199
He's going to suffer for sure.

510
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,760
Zhao Xiaoqian,

511
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,719
why don't you go and help him?

512
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,959
Give me back the letter
and 20 strings of 1000 cash.

513
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,319
Or else, prepare to bear
the consequences.

514
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,000
You'll make me bear the consequences?

515
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,439
Boyang has toughened up today.

516
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,839
Let's see

517
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,280
how you'll do it.

518
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,000
Yan Boyang!

519
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,560
Boyang!

520
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Hanchen,

521
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,439
we've found Boyang!

522
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,079
He's right there!

523
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:07,959
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

524
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,400
This is bad.

525
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,359
Lanterns.

526
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,319
Shopkeeper,

527
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,160
how much is this?

528
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,719
10 cash.

529
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,160
This lantern?

530
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,239
Here you go.

531
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,560
I'll take it. Keep the change.

532
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,439
Lady,

533
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,319
I haven't finished talking!

534
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,040
Let me ask you again.

535
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,920
Are you giving it to me or not?

536
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,000
No.

537
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,040
I...

538
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:35,880
Let go!

539
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,560
Boyang!

540
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,160
Are you all right?

541
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,239
I'm fine.

542
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,280
How dare you touch my brother?

543
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,439
Come over here, Xiaoman!

544
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,400
What's going on?

545
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Careful.

546
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,280
Why are they fighting?

547
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,079
Xu Shu

548
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,000
deserves it.

549
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,319
Hide behind my back.

550
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,319
Just watch quietly.

551
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,000
Not bad, Yan Boyang.

552
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,119
You called for backup.

553
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,319
I'm going to read the letter aloud.

554
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,400
Xu... Xu Shu!

555
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,959
What?

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,239
He wrote a letter to a lady

557
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,800
and asked me to deliver the letter.

558
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,359
Is it wrong for me to ask for some fees?

559
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,040
Moreover, Lady Dew

560
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,359
won't accept the letter.

561
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,400
Isn't that right, Yan Boyang?

562
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,719
Let me tell you.

563
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,160
No matter which lady
you fell in love with,

564
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,800
you're just aspiring after
someone you're not worth of.

565
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
It's just your wishful thinking.

566
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,479
It'll never happen.

567
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,719
Shut up.

568
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,719
Minggu.

569
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,599
I'm Lady Dew.

570
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,280
I'm in love with Yan Boyang.

571
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,959
So what?

572
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,920
You're in love with him?

573
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,560
What's gotten into you?

574
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,160
Yan Boyang, what are you
standing there for?

575
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,599
Go!

576
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,400
Hit him!

577
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:34,680
I...

578
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
If Lord Shen doesn't watch

579
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,000
his own underling properly,

580
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,359
and if he goes and bites others,

581
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,959
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

582
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,280
Understand?

583
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:57,800
Scram.

584
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,040
Scram!

585
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,319
All right, that's enough.

586
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,400
Don't watch anymore. Leave.

587
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,119
Leave.

588
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,959
What took you so long?

589
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,160
I've been waiting for
you the entire night.

590
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800
What's going on?

591
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,400
Well,

592
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,199
I was writing my good friend a letter,

593
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,000
and Xu Shu saw it.

594
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
He threatened me with it.

595
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,000
It's just a letter.
What's there to threaten you?

596
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,199
I agree.

597
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,000
It's just a letter.

598
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,920
Could it be a love letter?

599
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,920
There is no need to choose another day.

600
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,599
Why don't we

601
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,079
ask Lady Dew out today?

602
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,560
Talking face-to-face will make things
clear rather than writing a letter.

603
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,280
Forget it. I'd better not.

604
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,800
You have to.

605
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,920
I hate fickle-minded men the most.

606
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,479
Moreover, Zhao Xiaoqian booked
the entire Guizhao Workshop today.

607
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,479
Right, Xiaoqian?

608
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,319
That's right.

609
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,599
Let's go and take a look.

610
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,239
I'm not going.

611
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:57,839
Come on.

612
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:58,560
Let's go.

613
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,359
No, but...

614
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,599
- Come on!
- I don't think I'll go.

615
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,560
- Come on!
- Let's go!

616
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,119
Later,

617
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,280
I have something to talk to you.

618
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,839
Mr. Yu Qilin.

619
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
Dew?

620
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,719
That's right.

621
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:57,640
Have a seat.

622
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,880
How is that a young lady?

623
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,319
It's certainly not.

624
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,599
Well,

625
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,079
have some tea.

626
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,599
All right.

627
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,239
I have something to say to you.

628
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,239
Follow me.

629
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:16,719
Let's go.

630
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,160
Well.

631
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,560
The moon tonight

632
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,640
is quite lovely.

633
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,040
The Ghost Festival is a good
time for viewing lanterns.

634
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,520
Why didn't I see the young lady

635
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,359
mentioned in the invitation letter?

636
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,199
She...

637
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,239
She doesn't know about my feelings yet.

638
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,560
You should let her know.

639
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes.

640
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,520
Every time I see her,

641
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,680
I'd get very anxious.

642
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,479
I don't know how to tell her.

643
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,520
Just tell her

644
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,119
what you've written in the letter.

645
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,479
Ten thousand miles of
rivers and mountains,

646
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,839
you're one in a million.

647
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,880
And I'm the cavalry who guards
the nation's territory.

648
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
All right.

649
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,400
Enough.

650
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,199
Stop reading.

651
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,199
I'm going to vomit.

652
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,880
No, you...

653
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
Why are you staring at me?

654
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:19,319
What you told me

655
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,479
sounded very sincere.

656
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,239
How is it disgusting?

657
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,880
She's a very good lady.

658
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,760
You're very good.

659
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:28,680
Yes,

660
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,239
she's my ideal type.

661
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,000
You don't know this.

662
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,520
She's the only daughter in their family.

663
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,560
She'll become the head of the household
in the future.

664
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,359
Moreover,

665
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,439
she's bold and intelligent.

666
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Anyway, there's nothing bad about her.

667
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,439
Unlike me,

668
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,520
I couldn't even do well in studies

669
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,040
and keep making her angry all the time.

670
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,359
That's not all.

671
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,079
I'd become a coward whenever I see her.

672
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,160
But when it comes to relationship,

673
00:29:57,439 --> 00:30:00,079
there's no such thing as right or wrong.

674
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,119
What matters most is your
feelings at this moment

675
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,439
are true.

676
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,199
That's better than anything.

677
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,839
At our hometown,

678
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,839
there's this method.

679
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,880
If you're afraid

680
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,560
to tell her face-to-face,

681
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,520
you could...

682
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,439
Come here.

683
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,599
I can't hear them.

684
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,000
Is it nice?

685
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,479
Yes.

686
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,560
Do you like it?

687
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,319
Yes.

688
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,680
Back in the capital,

689
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,359
during each year's Ghost Festival,

690
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,439
I'd always ask my brother

691
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,839
to bring me to the city
for lanterns-viewing.

692
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,000
However, we didn't get
to watch it even once.

693
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,479
It's all right.

694
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,239
We're watching it now.

695
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,479
Duke of Yongguo didn't get to
watch it with you,

696
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,719
but I can.

697
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,500
(We're to separate as I know you're
in love with someone else.)

698
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,839
Is it your lantern?

699
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,920
Boyang.

700
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,640
Minggu,

701
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:57,959
I...

702
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,640
I...

703
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,460
(My lover is just across the river.)

704
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,599
Take care.

705
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,880
(Two days later)

706
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,980
(Sleeping Room)

707
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:55,959
Slowly, Your Highness.

708
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,000
Slowly!

709
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,359
Your Highness!

710
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,040
Your Highness!

711
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,479
Your Highness!

712
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,239
His Majesty is at Ruisi Palace,

713
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,680
checking Your Highness' homework.

714
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,439
His Majesty told me to
relay this message

715
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,080
which is, right now,

716
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,760
Her Highness is pregnant,

717
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
so playing a kite is unsuitable.

718
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,000
I even wrote the words
I want to tell my parents

719
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,239
on the kite.

720
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,159
Brother said if it's written
on the kite,

721
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,280
my parents will come and look
for me once they saw it,

722
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,120
but he won't even play with me.

723
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,280
Your Highness,

724
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,439
don't say that again.

725
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,840
Since you entered the palace,

726
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,479
you're now His Majesty's son.

727
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,159
Prince and Princess Consort Pu

728
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,040
are your uncle and aunt.

729
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,439
His Majesty and Her Highness

730
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,080
are your parents.

731
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,679
My parents aren't my actual parents.

732
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,879
You all are lying to me.

733
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,760
Your Highness!

734
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,000
Your Highness!

735
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,239
Your Highness!

736
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,239
The kite's flying.

737
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:46,879
Your Highness!

738
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,800
Your Highness!

739
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,320
Your Highness,

740
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:50,919
flying kite isn't advisable!

741
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,479
Your Highness!

742
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,879
Your Highness!

743
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,280
The string snapped.

744
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,239
Your Highness!

745
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,199
Your Highness.

746
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,560
Her Highness is about to give birth.

747
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,719
These aren't allowed within the palace

748
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,840
since it might distress Her Highness.

749
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,199
Ridiculous.

750
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:28,800
Brother!

751
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,280
Your Highness.

752
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,000
Your Highness, what's wrong?

753
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,800
I'm fine.

754
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,520
You may leave.

755
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,639
Shi Deng'er.

756
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,360
Why aren't you serving His Highness

757
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,760
in his room at this hour?

758
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,959
What are you doing here?

759
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,040
Mr. Ji,

760
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:12,080
what's gotten into His Highness
these few days?

761
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,159
He even wakes up startled at night.

762
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,959
Duke of Yongguo's death
anniversary is in a few days' time.

763
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,679
His Highness is always like this
during this time of the year.

764
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,719
Let me tell you. These few days,
if there's nothing in particular,

765
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,239
don't go near His Highness.

766
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,199
Do you hear me?

767
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,120
This memory of mine.

768
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,919
I forgot.

769
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,399
This is our academy's Dongguan Building.

770
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,760
Come on. I'll show you around.

771
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,760
Usually Jingnv Pavilion
doesn't have visitors.

772
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,639
You're the only exception.

773
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,600
There are so many books here.

774
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,560
Lonely Boat in the Night?

775
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,060
(Chapter one)

776
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,239
It's not worth reading.

777
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,959
Don't read anymore.

778
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,239
Wick told me that

779
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,919
Zhao Xiaoqian's acting
strange again lately.

780
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,919
Even Mr. Liangji was scolded by him.

781
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,639
Are you two having a fight again?

782
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,360
No,

783
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,719
everything's fine.

784
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,360
But ever since he came back
from the Ghost Festival,

785
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,879
he's been acting strange.

786
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,679
That one-of-a-kind temper of his

787
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:39,879
is like June's weather.

788
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:40,879
It changes so easily.

789
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,239
Someone must've angered him.

790
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,639
Oh, right.

791
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,679
I saw your mother this morning.

792
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,239
She told you to make a trip home.

793
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,360
She's going to nag at me again.

794
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,560
I'll borrow this book.

795
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,000
Let's go.

796
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,239
Let's go over there.

797
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,959
This book hasn't been borrowed before.

798
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,080
Are you sure you want to read it?

799
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:21,760
No.

800
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,520
You're making promises again anyhow.

801
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,760
Then

802
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,919
he's going to a wedding
banquet in the countryside.

803
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,959
The dishes served are
going to be unrefined.

804
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,120
He's the Commandery Prince.

805
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,719
There's no way he'll get used to it.

806
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,159
But,

807
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,239
I've already told that family.

808
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,639
Now, the entire village knows

809
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,000
you married to the Commandery Prince.

810
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,600
The couple

811
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
from Liu Family who is
going to get married,

812
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,479
Cheng and Ying,

813
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,560
were your childhood playmates.

814
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:45,239
They're my childhood playmates.

815
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,399
That's why I don't have to

816
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,760
put on airs in front of them.

817
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,199
Think about it.

818
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,679
Liu Family's daughter

819
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,679
gave you a lot of food
when you were little.

820
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,399
Your brother even drank her milk once.

821
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,199
We shouldn't be ungrateful, right?

822
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,000
You're the one who pretends to
be rich whenever you go home.

823
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,679
I don't believe Ying

824
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,679
would make noise just to
see His Highness.

825
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,120
Yes.

826
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,479
I'm pretending to be rich.

827
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:06,520
I'm pretending to be rich.
Are you satisfied?

828
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,760
Now, the entire village knows that

829
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:09,959
we came to Wujiang Prefecture.

830
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,159
They all know that

831
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,159
you married to
the Commandery Prince of Julu.

832
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,959
They're waiting to see how
I'll embarrass myself.

833
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,120
I don't care.

834
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,000
If His Highness isn't going,
I'm not going either.

835
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:26,879
You

836
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:29,239
didn't come back even once,

837
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,360
and make me angry when you do.

838
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:34,760
Your father

839
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,600
had come to work at
Wujiang Prefecture long ago.

840
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,679
I raised the three of you up

841
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
since you were little.

842
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,959
Now that you've grown up,

843
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,639
and know how to anger people,

844
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,159
you'll just make your mother angry.

845
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,159
I guess you'll be happy

846
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,760
when I die from anger one day.

847
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,159
That way, no one will nag at you.

848
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,159
All right.

849
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,760
I'll go talk to him.

850
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,159
But I don't know

851
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,159
if he'll agree or not.

852
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,919
That's my good daughter.

853
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:12,959
I need to return some books.

854
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm going to the academy.

855
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,239
Goodbye.

856
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:15,959
Books.

857
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:16,879
You only know how to read books.

858
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,639
What's the use of reading
all those books?

859
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,360
Can you attend the imperial examination?

860
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,239
Worry about our family more.

861
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,479
Don't you think my mother
has nothing better to do?

862
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,719
She wants Zhao Xiaoqian to go
to the countryside with me

863
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,639
to attend the wedding banquet.

864
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,760
I don't know how to ask him.

865
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,239
Throughout her life,

866
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,719
she had never cared for food
or extravagant clothing.

867
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,760
Now that she's old,

868
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,239
she cares about whether it'll
look good for the family.

869
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,879
It's normal since you're returning
to your hometown in glory.

870
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,479
Besides,

871
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:55,719
her own daughter married to a royal.

872
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,239
Of course she's very proud of it.

873
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:06,760
Ladies.

874
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:09,879
Congwen.

875
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:11,760
Greetings, Congwen.

876
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,760
There's something

877
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:15,600
which I might have to tell you.

878
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,239
I'm leaving Wujiang Prefecture
a few days later.

879
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,520
About the matters concerning studies,

880
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,159
I've asked Teacher Liu to help.

881
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,479
Why?

882
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,760
Congwen, are you leaving us?

883
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,760
I've had some trouble recently,

884
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
so I'm going to meditate
at Mount Kunyan Temple.

885
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,360
In the prose Lang Mengzi
mentioned just now,

886
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,760
although it's talking about
the misery of parting,

887
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
it also mentioned "long distance

888
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:41,159
separates no bosom friends.

889
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,760
I'll be back after some time.

890
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:46,399
And by that time?

891
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,520
Will you leave again when you're back?

892
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:51,959
Ladies,

893
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:53,919
see you.

894
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,439
Congwen.

895
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,760
Are you leaving

896
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,080
because of Courtesan Zhu?

897
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,919
Have I taught you this poem before?

898
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:23,040
Life is like a journey

899
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,520
and I am a traveller.

900
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,360
Since I'm a traveller,

901
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,239
I'll be on the road.

902
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,959
A person's life journey is
ever-changing.

903
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,639
I've also thought before

904
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,239
to travel throughout my entire life

905
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,719
and teach students.

906
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,560
What about now?

907
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,120
Now,

908
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,199
I'm also confused.

909
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,239
Before Yanniang left, she told me

910
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,760
that I shouldn't remain
at Wujiang Prefecture.

911
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:51,479
I should return to the capital

912
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,239
for the exam.

913
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,959
A man should have high ambitions.

914
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:57,760
What do you think, Xiaoman?

915
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,919
No matter what you do,

916
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,239
there's a reason for doing so.

917
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,679
Why am I telling you all these?

918
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:07,919
It doesn't matter.

919
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,399
It's just that, since Yanniang left,

920
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,360
I'm uncertain about some matters.

921
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,479
About the imperial examination

922
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,760
and my future,

923
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,080
it's filled with uncertainty.

924
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:18,399
This time, I'm leaving

925
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,120
to give myself some time

926
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,479
to think it through.

927
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:24,600
No need to worry about me.

928
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,520
Instead,

929
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,600
the lantern you gave to
Yanniang in my place,

930
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,520
I'll ask someone to return
one to you next time.

931
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,080
Never mind.

932
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:33,959
Autumn season is here.

933
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,239
Take care of yourself

934
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,439
and bring more clothing.

935
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,600
What were you talking
to Congwen just now?

936
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,120
Do you know where Zhao Xiaoqian is?

937
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,719
They're having a chess lesson today.

938
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,399
He should be at Tingtao Pavilion.

939
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,360
How did you know

940
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,760
Luming Pavilion's lesson arrangement?

941
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,199
I copied it secretly

942
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,600
from Director Xu.

943
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,959
It's because of Zhong...

944
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:11,919
I know.

945
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,679
The way of chess

946
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,040
is between ego-centrism
and stubbornness.

947
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,000
Find the most suitable timing

948
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:25,919
to understand when to give up

949
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,399
and when to persevere.

950
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:35,239
Zhao Xiaoqian,

951
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,520
what opinion do you have this time?

952
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,679
As humans,

953
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,439
it's quite boring

954
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,000
to have nothing to hold on to.

955
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,239
In that case, take a look at
the set of chess before you.

956
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,360
Half of the black chess pieces
have been captured.

957
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,239
Should you give up one chess piece

958
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,639
or continue to break through?

959
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,239
What if the opponent gives up
a chess piece first?

960
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,080
On the chess board,

961
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,679
look to your own heart,

962
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,159
not your opponent.

963
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:24,080
Zhao Xiaoqian.
