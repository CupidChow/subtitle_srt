=Episode 26=

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(It's cold and passers-by are hardly
seen, there's no point staying here)

21
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:45,279
All the shopkeepers here
have taught me a lot.

22
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,919
You've contributed greatly
to Su Family over the years.

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
Our family

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,080
has decided to start over
in the capital.

25
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,040
I wonder if you all

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,839
are willing to follow us?

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,239
I'm willing.

28
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,319
Lady Su,

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,319
count me in.

30
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,120
Count me in.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,919
- I'm also going.
- I'm willing.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,639
All right.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,919
I'm also going.

34
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,800
When I first arrived in
Wujiang Prefecture,

35
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,639
you two took care of me.

36
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,320
Sister-in-law, if you don't mind,

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,800
when you arrive at the capital,

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,800
even if you ask me to run errands,

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,679
I'll never complain.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Let's go all together.

41
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know how to do business,

42
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,839
but I'm at least capable of chores

43
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,800
like laundry and cooking.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,839
Su Chang Ji

45
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,880
is thankful for everyone.

46
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,080
Since it has come to this,

47
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,479
I just want to ask everyone.

48
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,960
What exactly makes

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,720
Su Chang Ji prosper until this day?

50
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,000
Is it the few shopfronts

51
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,759
which were snatched by that thief?

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,119
No!

53
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,240
Su Chang Ji relied on all of you

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,199
being honest in running the business

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,960
without selling inferior products.

56
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,160
That enabled Su Chang Ji

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,600
to grow into this scale today!

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,360
I, Meng Hanru,

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,279
thank everyone.

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,479
(Winter is here.)

61
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,720
(Grandmother passed away.)

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
(The academy is also shutting down.)

63
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,880
(It seems like)

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,039
(everything's changed overnight.)

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,199
(Sometimes, I keep thinking to myself)

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
(why I went through)

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
(such tribulations this year?)

68
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,240
(The worst of it)

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,160
(is that I met you.)

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,160
(Zhao Xiaoqian,)

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
(how are you doing?)

72
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,520
(Where are you?)

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,679
(When we first met,)

74
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,399
(it was Insects Awaken.)

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,440
(We used to think
winter is still far away.)

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,279
(There's a long way ahead)

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
(and there are many things to be done.)

78
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,440
(But somehow,)

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
(there's no more time left.)

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,959
(Zhao Xiaoqian,)

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
(where are you?)

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,200
(Did you see the snow?)

83
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,359
Zhao Mao,

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
when I meet Fuweng,

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,839
what do you think he'll say?

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,119
If I do my best,

87
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,959
will Xiaoman stay?

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,799
I gave you so much food.

89
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,320
You even had peach blossom shortbread.

90
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,359
You're useless.

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,239
Eat away.

92
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,799
Ladies,

93
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,320
we'll get going.

94
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,760
Take care.

95
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,000
What's wrong?

96
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't cry.

97
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,060
(To Congwen)

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,840
(To Congwen)

99
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:56,880
Congwen.

100
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,480
Xiaoman?

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,760
Xie Ruying gave me this.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,920
She asked me to pass it to you.

103
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,260
(To Congwen)

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,799
Congwen,

105
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,679
are you also leaving?

106
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,600
My father was demoted

107
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,119
and the academy also closed down.

108
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,559
Staying here won't help with anything.

109
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,920
Demoted?

110
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,440
Something happened to your family?

111
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,079
But I've never

112
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,359
been a young master from
an official's family.

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,320
However, going to
the capital this time,

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
I was given cold shoulders.

115
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,160
Before I got to do anything,

116
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,200
I had become the son of
an accused official.

117
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:35,920
Come on.

118
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Let's have a chat

119
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,239
and watch the scenery
of Fengxue Pavilion.

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,920
What do you think?

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
I remember, back in Yuyangli Village,

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,480
we even roasted sweet potatoes together.

123
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,079
Just like today,

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
we like to warm our hands
near the stove.

125
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,880
So it's me who was ignorant for

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,079
asking you to join me
in getting our hands dirty.

127
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,359
But I liked it a lot.

128
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,079
Congwen, you said something happened
to your family in the capital.

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
What happened?

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
My father and I

131
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,399
used to have conflicts.

132
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,640
I thought many things that he did

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
were wrong.

134
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,239
I thought that there's no transparency
when it comes to politics.

135
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,839
But when I went back this time,

136
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,480
I saw with my own eyes that
he built a tall tower

137
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:39,959
and entertained the guests

138
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,839
before the tower collapsed,

139
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,279
only then I realized

140
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,279
many things

141
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,959
don't matter that much

142
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,679
between father and son.

143
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,559
He's my father,

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
not my enemy.

145
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,399
But it's all for good.

146
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,559
In the future, without the burden
of my family background,

147
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,839
I can be a commoner,

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,920
and continue to travel

149
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,440
to walk my path

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,839
and write my books.

151
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,480
Do you agree with me?

152
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,720
I don't know.

153
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,640
But what matters is that you feel happy.

154
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,119
Did Princess Consort Pu make
things difficult for you?

155
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,000
The reason Princess Consort Pu
came this time

156
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,440
was actually to make me
leave Zhao Xiaoqian.

157
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,519
In the beginning, I wasn't willing.

158
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,799
But later,

159
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,239
grandmother passed away,

160
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,559
and Su Chang Ji was also gone.

161
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:39,039
Even my brother was almost put to jail.

162
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,640
So, I agreed to it.

163
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,320
However,

164
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,919
after leaving him, I realized

165
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,159
my true feelings.

166
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,479
Am I really silly?

167
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,760
In the past,

168
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,880
I just thought that
he's a rich man's son.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,760
That I had poor fate for

170
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,799
being forced to marry him
as a concubine.

171
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,679
I kept thinking about leaving.

172
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,080
However, as time goes by,

173
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,080
I began to develop feelings for him.

174
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:30,960
After our farewell,

175
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,799
I then realized

176
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,119
I had thoroughly

177
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,960
acknowledged him as my husband.

178
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,119
I fell in love with him.

179
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,119
However, Congwen,

180
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,400
why didn't anyone

181
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,440
tell me

182
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,559
liking someone

183
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,479
can be so painful.

184
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Why do I think of him

185
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
every single moment?

186
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,719
When the weather gets cold,

187
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll worry if he'd catch a cold,

188
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,359
whether he has eaten enough,

189
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,039
or has a good night's sleep.

190
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,960
I know we won't end up together,

191
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
but I couldn't forget him
no matter what.

192
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,159
But it's already ended, right?

193
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,520
Since it's come to an end,

194
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
if you couldn't forget about him,

195
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
then you should move on,

196
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,440
okay?

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't worry.

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
With me around,

199
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,599
I won't let you feel wronged.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,719
My feelings

201
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
are written in the book.

202
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,679
(Lonely Boat At Night, volume four)
I'll wait for you...

203
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,559
This is bad! Something happened!

204
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,880
Those people are here again!

205
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,400
What are you doing?

206
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,080
Why are you here again?

207
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Who gives you the right
to close our academy?

208
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,880
That's right! What are you doing?

209
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,559
Yes! Who gives you
the right to close our academy?

210
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,380
(Bailu Academy)

211
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,640
Yes!

212
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
Didn't we agree to wait for
the document?

213
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,280
We still have an examination
coming up in a few days.

214
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,719
Let me tell you.

215
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,200
As long as the document is not here,

216
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,200
don't even think of closing our academy!

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,640
That's right!

218
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,599
You can't close the academy! No way!

219
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:15,840
Mr. Yan,

220
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,679
it's bad enough that
other students aren't reasonable.

221
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,559
Why are you taking the lead
in stirring up trouble?

222
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,159
I'm stirring up trouble?

223
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:22,880
- I...
- Boyang.

224
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,919
Calm down.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,919
Let's talk nicely.

226
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,760
Congwen.

227
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
We just want to buy
a few more days

228
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,320
to sit for the last examination,

229
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,440
right?

230
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,679
That's right!
We want to take the examination!

231
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,440
You want to take the examination?

232
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
Yes!

233
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,400
Then take the civil examination

234
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,440
at the imperial college.

235
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,080
What's so great about

236
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,599
a mere academy's examination?

237
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,000
What's there to take?

238
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Ridiculous!

239
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,919
You're saying we're incapable?

240
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,200
Fine.

241
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll show you

242
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
that we're capable!

243
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,200
Boyang!

244
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,919
- Boyang!
- Boyang!

245
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,440
Arrest him!

246
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,159
Boyang!

247
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,039
Let him go!

248
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,000
Bring him away!

249
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Don't you dare touch him!

250
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
You can't arrest him!

251
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,440
You can't arrest him!

252
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,000
Boyang!

253
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
How could you arrest him?

254
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,880
Let go of me!

255
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,440
Boyang!

256
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
- Boyang!
- Boyang!

257
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,000
Yan Boyang!

258
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,320
Why are they arresting him?

259
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,799
Let's go to the magistrate court!

260
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,520
Let's go to the magistrate court!

261
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,080
Let's talk to Yan Nengfu!

262
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,200
Come on! Let's go!

263
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,559
Let's go to the magistrate court!

264
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,919
(Magistrate of Wujiang)
We want to talk to Lord Yan!

265
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,080
We want to talk to Lord Yan!

266
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,679
What are you doing?

267
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,280
What do you think you're doing?

268
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,799
You can't enter!

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,080
We want to take the exam, Lord Yan!

270
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,200
We want to talk to Lord Yan!

271
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,880
Back off!

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,640
Ridiculous.

273
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,400
All we want is to take the exam.

274
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,200
Why can't we?

275
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,039
What's the reason?

276
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,599
I've never seen you being so concerned.

277
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
When it's almost over,

278
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,359
you're causing this ruckus.

279
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,400
What's in it for you?

280
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,719
This is ridiculous.

281
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,599
We don't want the academy to close down.

282
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,679
What does it have to do with

283
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,559
what's good for us?

284
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,960
Besides,

285
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,039
the teachers from Bailu Academy
taught us much more

286
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,640
than you did.

287
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,880
Why should our academy shut
down just because you said so?

288
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,479
You...

289
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,960
You unfilial son.

290
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,479
I'm carrying out my official duty here.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,159
It's not up to you.

292
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,000
Moreover,

293
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,559
if you're really so capable

294
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,200
and have high ambitions,

295
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,799
you should stop

296
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,799
doing this kind of silly stuff here.

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,159
Become one of the top scorers
in the imperial examination

298
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,960
before you negotiate terms with me.

299
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
I'm silly

300
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,960
and I'm negotiating terms with you.

301
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,159
So what?

302
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,039
You...

303
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:27,880
Fine.

304
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
Today, I'll teach you

305
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,559
how to be humble!

306
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,280
Guards!

307
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,840
Yes!

308
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,559
Beat him!

309
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,479
Yes!

310
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,919
If I'm able to take it today,

311
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,960
you'll promise me this once.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,719
Beat him!

313
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,239
We want to take the exam!

314
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:05,919
We want to talk to Lord Yan!

315
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,880
What are you all doing?

316
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,400
Boyang!

317
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,440
Go away!

318
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Boyang, are you listening?

319
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,000
We want to talk to Lord Yan!

320
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,880
We didn't break any law!

321
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,679
We want to take the exam!

322
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,599
Don't push us!

323
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,520
We want to talk to Lord Yan!

324
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,760
Students!

325
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,280
Go away!

326
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,919
Lord Yan!

327
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,359
Students!

328
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

329
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,640
on behalf of all teachers,

330
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,000
we thank you all

331
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,599
for what you've done for Bailu academy.

332
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,719
I'm deeply moved

333
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,159
by what everyone did for the academy.

334
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,520
However, I'm also thinking

335
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,840
while Bailu Academy is
teaching all of you

336
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,760
knowledge and classics,

337
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,760
we've forgotten to teach you

338
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,200
the ways of the world.

339
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,840
As the saying goes,
"think twice before acting."

340
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,119
However,

341
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,599
Lord Yan won't give us

342
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,559
an extension.

343
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,840
Bureaucrat Yan has his own standing.

344
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,599
Even if you have something to say,

345
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,359
you mustn't be rash,

346
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,400
and should choose the right way.

347
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,919
Regardless of what will
become of Bailu Academy,

348
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,280
since you're our students,

349
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,239
please remember the academy's teaching.

350
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:34,880
All right.

351
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,320
Don't talk loudly or shout here.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,039
I'm the principal.

353
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:42,400
I should be the person who
negotiate with them anyway.

354
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,760
Principal.

355
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,400
- Principal!
- Principal!

356
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,719
Let's see if you'll still be stubborn.

357
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,000
You...

358
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,159
Hancai.

359
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,359
Stop! Stop!

360
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,532
Principal,

361
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,039
you're also here.

362
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,320
Look.

363
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,559
He was making a scene.

364
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,039
I...

365
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,559
I'm just carrying out my duty.

366
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,239
I know. I know.

367
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,119
As the Bureaucrat,

368
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,239
official matters are more important.

369
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,719
You have your own challenges and stand.

370
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,320
However, the youngsters

371
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,119
are really reluctant to let go.

372
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,679
Since they're about to graduate soon,

373
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,359
I hope you'll grant this wish.

374
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,000
Principal,

375
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,359
please don't make things
difficult for me.

376
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,799
You were a student of Bailu Academy.

377
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,400
Standing up for broad vision,
righteousness and good faith.

378
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,320
Why?

379
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,880
Now, you only see the law

380
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,559
and become unsympathetic?

381
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,799
Although you're the Bureaucrat,

382
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,479
you're also a father.

383
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,200
Even the youngsters are
doing this for their ambitions.

384
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,479
If you say Zhanzhi's being ridiculous,

385
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,359
to me, this is

386
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,479
Zhanzhi's proudest moment as a youth.

387
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,880
I'm glad.

388
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,119
I'm making this appeal
on my students' behalf.

389
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,880
Lord Yan, please grant us an extension.

390
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,280
Principal!

391
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,640
Don't do this.

392
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,959
All right.

393
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,119
Forget it.

394
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,439
I'll agree to it.

395
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,040
Thank you.

396
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,079
I'll forgive you

397
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,280
for the sake of the principal.

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,959
Focus on the examination properly.

399
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Let's see how you will score for the exam.

400
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:34,680
All right.

401
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,479
See you.

402
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,359
See you.

403
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:50,680
Boyang.

404
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,839
Principal, thank you.

405
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,280
We should thank you instead.

406
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,880
Go home and recuperate,

407
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,400
and prepare for the examination.

408
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,239
Sure.

409
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,000
Principal's here.

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,680
- He's here.
- He's here.

411
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,119
Principal.

412
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,199
- Principal.
- Principal.

413
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:16,880
How did it go?

414
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,599
Everyone,

415
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Lord Yan has agreed.

416
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,079
Go home to prepare for
the examination.

417
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,199
Great!

418
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,760
- Great!
- Great!

419
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,839
Now we can sit for the examination!

420
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,680
Great!

421
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:28,680
Now we can sit for the examination!

422
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,319
Great!

423
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,800
- Great!
- Great!

424
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,760
Now we can sit for the examination!

425
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes!

426
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,719
Great!

427
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,160
Now we can sit for the examination!

428
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,479
We're taking the exam!

429
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
Yan Boyang!

430
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,319
Yan Boyang, are you in there?

431
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,040
Yan Boyang!

432
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,000
Minggu?

433
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
Don't come up here.

434
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,319
I just got spanked.

435
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,000
It's too embarrassing.

436
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,199
Does it hurt?

437
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,479
No.

438
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,239
Boyang, you're so silly.

439
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,199
Why did you take the beating?

440
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,520
I know I'm silly.

441
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,359
I also know there's nothing
I could do well,

442
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,319
and I always make you angry.

443
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,119
And your family's case, too.

444
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,199
I...

445
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,520
I've thought about it these few days.

446
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,199
I can't blame you for that.

447
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,880
It's my fault.

448
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,319
I was too wilful in the past.

449
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,839
Most of the time,

450
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,520
my mother and grandmother

451
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,560
bore it for me

452
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,439
and take care everything for me.

453
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,239
Now, it's different.

454
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,079
Grandmother has passed away

455
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,079
and Su Chang Ji was also gone.

456
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm leaving.

457
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,880
I'm going to the capital.

458
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,239
My mother and I

459
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,719
will reopen Su Chang Ji in the capital.

460
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:01,959
You're leaving?

461
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,839
You...

462
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,319
Are you sure you're all right?

463
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,079
Please don't leave.

464
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm the successor of Su Chang Ji.

465
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,479
I have to be responsible for this.

466
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,560
I thought that

467
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,319
we'll be together forever.

468
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,520
Forever?

469
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,319
Yan Boyang, you're so silly.

470
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
In this world,

471
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,359
nothing will last forever.

472
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
In that case,
bring more clothes with you.

473
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,319
The northern region is
really cold in winter.

474
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,839
Take care.

475
00:20:59,119 --> 00:20:59,839
Yan Boyang,

476
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,839
we're adults now.

477
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,319
At home,

478
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,239
don't upset your parents

479
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,359
or be idle every day.

480
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,359
Girls don't like it

481
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,800
if you do that.

482
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,319
I know.

483
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,280
Don't worry.

484
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,719
Today, you're like

485
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,560
a great hero to me.

486
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,079
I seem to have fallen for you.

487
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,940
(Military Office of Tengzhou)

488
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,000
Your Highness.

489
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,880
Rise quickly.

490
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,119
What happened to your arm?

491
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,439
Was it Her Highness's doing?

492
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,319
Your Highness.

493
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,119
You've suffered

494
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,199
over the years.

495
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,560
What exactly happened back then?

496
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,520
How did you break your arm?

497
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,599
Also, how did

498
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
my brother die?

499
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,199
Your Highness,

500
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:10,040
I remember it was autumn.

501
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,719
Your Highness was flying the kite
in the imperial palace,

502
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,839
hoping Prince and Princess Consort Pu
would see it.

503
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,319
However, it was suddenly very windy

504
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,479
and the kite's string snapped.

505
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Your Highness didn't know that

506
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,239
the kite

507
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,359
landed on Kunning Palace

508
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,640
and right in front of Her Highness.

509
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,560
Her Highness was frightened

510
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,280
and her baby was affected.

511
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,160
She gave birth on that night.

512
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,439
I know.

513
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,760
The baby was dead.

514
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,640
The imperial physician said

515
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,319
the baby was already dead for days,

516
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,920
but Her Highness

517
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,199
couldn't accept it.

518
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:00,959
She thought...

519
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,199
She thought

520
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,760
it's all Your Highness' doing.

521
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,839
Having lost her son,

522
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,079
Her Highness lost her composure.

523
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:14,800
That's why...

524
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,800
That's why Duke of Yongguo

525
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,239
pleaded guilty for your sake.

526
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,000
Her Highness was the one who
sentenced him to death?

527
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,719
That's why she

528
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,319
used Prince Pu's Mansion
as an excuse for years

529
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,800
to monitor me.

530
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,680
To get me to return to the capital,

531
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,160
she sent Lingniang

532
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:41,959
and my mother

533
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,079
so that I...

534
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,000
So that I can't seek revenge.

535
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,719
So I'll

536
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,239
forever be within her control.

537
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,160
Am I right?

538
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,280
Your Highness,

539
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,239
Duke of Yongguo and I

540
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,560
hoped that you'll carry on
with your life.

541
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,439
Your Highness,

542
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,599
don't ask anymore.

543
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,079
What good will it do

544
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,319
even if Your Highness know all these?

545
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,079
Your Highness.

546
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,640
Your Highness.

547
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,239
General.

548
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:39,839
Come on. Cheers.

549
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,359
Sure.

550
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,520
Brothers,

551
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,400
let's take over Baichuankou.

552
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,199
Master, did you know

553
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,880
when my brother passed away,

554
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,439
I was asked to leave the capital

555
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,079
and stay away from the disputes?

556
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,040
I used to think Her Highness

557
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,880
was worried the throne would
fall into others' hands,

558
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,599
so she kept going against me.

559
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,599
I thought my brother

560
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,199
was worried that I would get into
the fight for the Crown Prince's title,

561
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,920
so he asked me to leave.

562
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
After so many years,

563
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,920
this is the first time I've found out

564
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,479
it was all because of a kite.

565
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,119
For so many years,

566
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,680
this is the first time I've found out

567
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
the price for me to leave the capital

568
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,239
was my brother's life.

569
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Life is uncertain and unexpected.

570
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,920
Certain things

571
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,760
aren't your fault.

572
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,119
Not my fault?

573
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,119
I used to think

574
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,839
I could protect everyone around me.

575
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,319
And now?

576
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,040
Fuweng's arm is broken
and brother is dead.

577
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,079
I couldn't protect any of them.

578
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,760
Master,

579
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,959
I just found out today that

580
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,680
I'm just a joke.

581
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,959
That's how the rule of the world is.

582
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,800
Only the strong survive

583
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,400
while the weak perish.

584
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,000
It's the same for the imperial court.

585
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,160
When the corrupted officials
are in power,

586
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,839
only the strong can contend with them.

587
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,839
Hanchen.

588
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,599
I don't believe

589
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,479
staying in Wujiang Prefecture
over the years

590
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,319
has worn out your indignation.

591
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,800
I also don't believe you came
to Tengzhou today

592
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,640
just to meet Fuweng.

593
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,959
I wanted to protect
the people around me,

594
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,199
but I just realized today,

595
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,560
if someone wants to harm her,

596
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
I could

597
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,239
do nothing.

598
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:11,479
Tens of thousands of Xiongjie Camp's
soldiers are rushing to Baichuankou.

599
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:13,520
May I know

600
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,400
if there's a place for me?

601
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,839
You've really considered it through?

602
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,079
Yes.

603
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,239
I want to protect the people around me.

604
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm going to Baichuankou

605
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,280
to establish military merits

606
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,239
and fight for military power.

607
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,319
I can return to the capital,

608
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,880
but I'll do so

609
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,800
victoriously.

610
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,119
Do you mean it?

611
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:02,479
Hanchen,

612
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,640
please fight along with me!

613
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,239
Master, thank you.

614
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,880
Are you not battle-dressed?

615
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,959
Let's share the plate for breast!

616
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,079
We shall go to the front line!

617
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,119
Let's make your lances shine!

618
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,199
Your foe is mine!

619
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,880
Are you not battle-dressed?

620
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Let's share the coat and vest!

621
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,160
We shall go to the front line!

622
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,280
Let's make our halberds shine!

623
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,319
Your duty is mine!

624
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,479
Are you not battle-dressed?

625
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,760
Let's share kilt and the rest!

626
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,839
We shall go to the front line!

627
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's make our Armour shine!

628
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:52,239
March with your hand in mine!

629
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,319
Today,

630
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,040
you're having your last examination.

631
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,400
Each one of you will
write an article with the title

632
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,079
"To Each His Own Ambitions".

633
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,640
I hope all of you will take it seriously

634
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,239
to write your own ambitions and wishes.

(Bailu Academy)

661
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,520
Time's up.

662
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,839
Everyone,

663
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,400
stop writing.

664
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,839
Bailu Academy has been established
in Wujiang Prefecture

665
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,000
for 30 years

666
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,959
to this day.

667
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,680
The passage of time is just
like the flow of water,

668
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,359
regardless of day and night.

669
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,040
In this world,

670
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,760
it's as if a white steed
flits past a crack,

671
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,560
it's a brief moment.

672
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,959
This will be my last lesson

673
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,280
with all of you.

674
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,839
Gentleman respects fate.

675
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:00,959
Think twice before acting.

676
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,719
Since the establishment
of Bailu Academy,

677
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,880
my biggest hope

678
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,520
is for each and every

679
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,679
student of this academy

680
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,239
to be a gentleman who
is upright and just.

681
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,679
Gentleman respects fate.

682
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,840
Be it the world, personally,

683
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,879
or the academy itself.

684
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,080
I've always told you,

685
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,840
as a student,

686
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,760
you must keep in mind that,

687
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,239
we study for heaven and earth,

688
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,800
for the people,

689
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,320
and for the saints of the past,

690
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,800
and safeguard world peace
for all ages.

691
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:46,879
However, in this peace,

692
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,800
more than anything,
what you should explore

693
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,479
is yourselves.

694
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:54,520
Principal!

695
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,600
Principal, this is bad!

696
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,199
Principal! Principal!

697
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,040
Magistrate Xie is here
with the officers.

698
00:34:59,159 --> 00:34:59,919
They're at the entrance,

699
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,080
claiming they're here
to close the academy.

700
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,639
What's going on?

701
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,000
I thought it's not time yet?

702
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,360
That's right.

703
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,320
They're bullying us.

704
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,280
Yes.

705
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,239
This won't do.

706
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,320
They can't shut down the academy.

707
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,840
Silence. Silence.

708
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:17,000
Grass or gravel,
they're just external objects.

709
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,760
We have things which
they can't take away from us.

710
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,719
A gentleman establishes his
heart for heaven and earth.

711
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,879
Although it can contend
with the external realm,

712
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,919
if the aim

713
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,479
is to change the world,

714
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,520
that's a fool's way.

715
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,360
Change what you can change

716
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,919
and establish a person's
heart for heaven and earth.

717
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,080
Accepting what you can't change

718
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,320
is how a gentleman respects his fate.

719
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,159
All protesters

720
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,520
must think twice.

721
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,199
That's a gentleman's way.

722
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,840
Be it boys or ladies,

723
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,000
I hope you'll be broad-minded
and not a partisan,

724
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,719
coexisting harmoniously and
maintaining difference.

725
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,879
Only if our generation
strictly abides by it,

726
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,719
the good fortune of our home country
will last for a long time.

727
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:15,679
The riverbank of five lakes!

728
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,439
An institution of higher education!

729
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,199
Confucius is standing
without peer among the early masters!

730
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:20,879
Continue this tradition
of the sages of the past!

731
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,439
The six Classics, since he
has cast and molded them,

732
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,840
ring out the resonant
music of bronze and jade!

733
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,520
A gentleman with virtue

734
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,159
with extensive knowledge!

735
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,080
Everyone,

736
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,719
you've graduated from studies.

737
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,580
(Jingnv Pavilion)

738
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,159
Xiaoman,

739
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,919
what do you plan to do next?

740
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,360
My family has decided
to go to the capital.

741
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,719
I'm also going with them.

742
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,439
Once we're there,

743
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,199
I might help out at my aunt's shop.

744
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
As for the rest,

745
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,679
I haven't thought about it yet.

746
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,199
What about you, Teacher Liu?

747
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
I plan to go to the capital

748
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,719
to set up an academy for ladies.

749
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,919
Having stayed for so many years
in Bailu Academy

750
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,719
I've come across many
intelligent young ladies.

751
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,919
I realized

752
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,679
there should be a place

753
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,159
for ladies to focus on
studying to change their destiny.

754
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,959
I happen to need an assistant.

755
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,199
If you're also going to the capital,

756
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,840
you can join me

757
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,719
in teaching at the academy.

758
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:02,560
We can also finish compiling

759
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,159
the historical books of women
we've yet to complete.

760
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,159
What do you think?

761
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,719
I've always wanted to be a teacher,

762
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,959
but I'm not knowledgeable

763
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:10,719
and lack experience.

764
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,439
By then, I hope you

765
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,000
will give me a chance
to stay by your side

766
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,399
to handle miscellaneous tasks.

767
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:21,479
This is my address in the capital.

768
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,040
You can contact me when you're there.

769
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,479
Teacher, please wait for me.

770
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:50,520
(Xiaoman,)

771
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:51,719
(I hope this letter finds you well.)

772
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,199
(I'm writing you this letter)

773
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:55,719
(to express my gratitude.)

774
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,199
(I'm sure you're curious,)

775
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,919
(but similarly, you wouldn't know)

776
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,360
(Congwen, who to you,
is capable of doing anything)

777
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,600
(was once lost.)

778
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,080
(It's funny.)

779
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,560
(When Yanniang left,)

780
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,600
(I didn't know what to do in future.)

781
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,879
(I believed that no one
would appreciate)

782
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:15,639
(my writing.)

783
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,040
(While struggling,)

784
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,879
(I lost my original intention.)

785
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,639
(Sometimes, throughout our lives,)

786
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,520
(we're always struggling between)

787
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,560
(others' recognition and our own choices.)

788
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,840
(If our own wish is fulfilled,)

789
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,159
(others might be disappointed.)

790
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,080
(If we're to follow others' advice,)

791
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,639
(we might lose ourselves
in the process.)

792
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
(If it wasn't because of you,)

793
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,679
(how will I find out)

794
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,520
(even if I'm just
a lonesome soul in this world,)

795
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:40,199
(there's someone who understands me)

796
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,600
(and appreciates my talent.)

797
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,639
(This kind of understanding)

798
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,000
(is a dream coming true to me.)

799
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,479
(I've decided to pen it down)

800
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
(and write you this letter)

801
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,840
(because I want you to know)

802
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,360
(you are)

803
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,239
(a good lady who is hard
to find in the world.)

804
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,479
(I like you)

805
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,120
(and I wish you'd feel the same for me.)

806
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:01,080
(I'm not afraid)

807
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:02,479
(of the tribulations today.)

808
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,120
(I hope to share
sorrow and joy with you.)
