Stop crying.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,959
All you do is cry.

24
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,800
What's the point of crying?

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,440
Crying will not bring Xiaoman back.

26
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,519
You're the best.

27
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,279
You know what to do

28
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,519
yet you couldn't come out
from the prison on your own.

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,639
The daughter has to
bear it for your sake.

30
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,199
I...

31
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,639
Xie Li is here.

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Father. Mother.

33
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,639
I've brought sister home.

34
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,000
Father.

35
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,240
Mother.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
Where have you been?

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,160
Why didn't you inform us?

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,839
I'm very worried.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,639
Mother.

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Don't cry.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,199
I'm doing just fine.

42
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,240
Not at all.

43
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,119
You lost weight in a few days.

44
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,839
I'm extremely worried about you.

45
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm very concerned.

46
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,639
Mother.

47
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,440
Man'er.

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
I let you down.

49
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm useless.

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,720
Father.

51
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:52,759
Father.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,520
Father.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,160
That hurts.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm Li Su.

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,399
It's pointless to hit yourself.

56
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,279
She is home.

57
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,960
Look.

58
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,039
I'm Xiaoman's senior from the academy.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,800
We met at Yuyangli Village as well.

60
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,600
Thank you for the cakes and repairs,

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,360
aunty.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Have you forgotten?

63
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,479
Mr. Li.

64
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,279
May I speak to you in private?

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,279
Man'er.

66
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,919
Take a break.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,520
Go on.

68
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,919
Mr. Li.

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,479
What should we do now?

70
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,520
If the Commandery Prince sells her off,

71
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,360
my daughter would suffer.

72
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,479
My daughter doesn't deserve
this mistreatment.

73
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,160
Do not worry, elders.

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,479
Although His Highness
and I do not get along,

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,399
the man he selected

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,199
is bonded with my father.

77
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,559
I came to an agreement with them.

78
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,279
If Xiaoman was sold,

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,759
they'd redeem her freedom for us.

80
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,000
However,

81
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,360
Xiaoman's reputation
would be tarnished.

82
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,039
It's going to be fine.

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,199
My poor child.

84
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
Lady Xie, are you feeling better?

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,600
By the way,

86
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,839
you asked

87
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,440
what happened at
the Commandery Prince's Mansion today.

88
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,200
Shi Deng'er told me that

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,559
Commandery Prince's brother...

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
I don't know what he's called.

91
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,920
Duke of Yongguo.

92
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,480
Yes.

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,119
Duke of Yongguo's birthday is coming up.

94
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,679
Around this time of the year,
the Commandery Prince's mansion...

95
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,959
has to pay memorial to Duke of Yongguo.

96
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,359
Did you know?

97
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,959
After the Qixi Festival

98
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,119
comes my brother's birthday.

99
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,920
Principal Yang once said

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,920
my brother and I are
completely different.

101
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,000
Both of us entered the palace together.

102
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,279
My brother was reliable,

103
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,920
and I was stubborn.

104
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,519
Everyone thought

105
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,760
my brother would emerge
as the next Emperor.

106
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,359
I've never thought of

107
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,720
competing with my brother anyway.

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,480
All I wanted

109
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,440
was after my brother
becomes the Emperor,

110
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll head to the borders

111
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,320
and protect the state for my brother.

112
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,839
Unfortunately,

113
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,640
I was exiled from the capital.

114
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,799
Even worse,

115
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,679
he no longer exists.

116
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:15,959
Lady Xie.

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,320
A student from Bailu Academy
is at the main corridor.

118
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,119
The student calls himself
your classmate.

119
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,079
His name is Wang Weicheng.

120
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,359
What's he doing here?

121
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,959
Are you here to collect the goods

122
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,839
after receiving the deed
from Zhao Xiaoqian?

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,839
No.

124
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,279
That's not true.

125
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,119
I...

126
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,799
I do not intend to purchase you.

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
What are you doing here then?

128
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,519
Let me be honest with you.

129
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,359
I grew up with Lang Mengzi of

130
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,279
Jingnv Pavilion.

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,519
I promised her I'd never
marry a concubine.

132
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,040
Don't

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,519
even dream of entering my household.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,600
Also,

135
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,760
by His Highness' orders,

136
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,000
he wants me to collect your deed

137
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,559
after the polo tournament

138
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
and release you.

139
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,440
He also wants me to
pass you a title deed.

140
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,880
I'm still troubled.

141
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,279
Mengzi misunderstood me.

142
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,720
I can't go on with this anymore.

143
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,640
Anyway,

144
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,920
I'll leave everything to you.

145
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,000
Resolve it among yourselves.

146
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm leaving.

147
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,559
That fool.

148
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,160
Idiot.

149
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Lady Xie.

150
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:35,480
Wick.

151
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
Head to Minggu

152
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,160
and tell her to join me at the market.

153
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,720
Do it now.

154
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,359
He mistreated you.

155
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,679
Are you still going
to buy him something?

156
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,320
Besides,

157
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,640
the Commandery Prince's Mansion...

158
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,399
has no use for these.

159
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,600
Miss, what do you need?

160
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,519
Shopkeeper,

161
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,799
I would like

162
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,040
some cloth and bamboo splint
for kite-making.

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
Do you sell them here?

164
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,640
Yes.

165
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,079
It costs ten cash in total.

166
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,359
Thank you, miss.

167
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,359
I'm repaying the favour.

168
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,600
Repaying the favour?

169
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,719
Let's go.

170
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,799
Take care.

171
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,880
Your Highness.

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,799
Why is Your Highness drenched?

173
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,599
Shi Deng'er, what were you doing?

174
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,320
It has nothing to do with them.

175
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,559
Your Highness.

176
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,200
Do not follow me!

177
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Mr. Liangji.

178
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,080
Where is Mr. Zhong?

179
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,520
Besides Mr. Zhong,

180
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,119
nobody else can persuade His Highness.

181
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,440
Mr. Zhong is at Mount Han Temple.

182
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,880
It's Duke of Yongguo's birthday.

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,000
He's off to light the lanterns.

184
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,479
Let's talk to Zhu Momo instead.

185
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,039
I don't want to be reprimanded.
You go instead.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,400
You, come here.

187
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,599
Tell me.

188
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,880
What's going on?

189
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,239
(Xiaoqian.)

190
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:33,679
Brother.

191
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,799
Brother.

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,880
A partridge flew by the city gate.

193
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,599
(Zhao Xiaoqian at young age)
I asked Fuweng to catch it with me.

194
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
(Zhao Xiaoqian's brother, Zhao Xiaojie)
I'm not allowed to leave Wude Palace.

195
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,559
Otherwise,
the Empress would be upset.

196
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,200
It doesn't matter.

197
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,119
We can have fun here the same.

198
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,799
I want to go out there.

199
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,919
I don't want to drink tea in here.

200
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,640
It's bitter.

201
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,239
We can't do that yet.

202
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,479
Yesterday,

203
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,479
you knocked over Her Highness' tea cup.

204
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,599
Her Highness was enraged.

205
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,799
You should obey and stay put here.

206
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,039
I'll get Fuweng

207
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,479
to have some noodles served.

208
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,799
You should warm yourself up.

209
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,799
Tomorrow,

210
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,000
you shall learn " The Great Learning"

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
with Her Highness tomorrow

212
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,239
to cheer Her Highness up.

213
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:31,840
Is that all right?

214
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,359
Will Her Highness allow us to leave?

215
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,559
She doesn't like me.

216
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,359
I just want to fly a kite.

217
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
I want my kite to fly the highest

218
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,200
to show father and mother.

219
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,479
Once they see it,

220
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,840
would they come to visit us?

221
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,679
If father and mother saw your kite,

222
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,320
they'd lecture you for fooling around.

223
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:54,880
A few days ago,

224
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,760
did you break a wooden sword again?

225
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,760
I hate them for showing me an attitude.

226
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,599
They call me playful and mischievous.

227
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,320
Everyone thinks badly of me.

228
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,119
No one likes me here.

229
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:06,960
I want to go home.

230
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,080
Hide your treasured belongings well.

231
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,559
No matter what happens,
do not break them.

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Despite the contempt they show you,

233
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,359
these things will keep you company.

234
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,239
I'm right here, too.

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,719
I'll not mistreat you.

236
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,200
The wooden swords and kites

237
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,119
will not mistreat you either.

238
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,119
We will always stay by your side

239
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,039
forever and ever.

240
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,599
We'd watch you grow old

241
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,359
as you live a happy life.

242
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,080
Isn't that good enough?

243
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,799
I'll take you there right now.

244
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,119
Come on.

245
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,000
Your Highness.

246
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,640
It's cloudy today.

247
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
Why would anyone fly a kite?

248
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,359
Brother.

249
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,440
Your Highness.

250
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,239
Xingzhou.

251
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,119
Xiaoman came by just now

252
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,919
and left this to me.

253
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,880
She said

254
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,919
she made this kite herself

255
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,960
in hopes to comfort

256
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,320
your yearning for Xiaojie.

257
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,719
It's Xiaojie's birthday today.

258
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,640
I guessed you'd be...

259
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,679
Are you speaking on her behalf?

260
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,599
Like I said,

261
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,239
I do not want you to regret anything.

262
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,760
If Xiaoman was truly sold,

263
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,840
would you be happy?

264
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,559
Would you be able to forgive yourself?

265
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,159
Before Xiaoman left, she told me

266
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:10,880
the Zhao Xiaoqian she knows

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,559
never worried about a single thing.

268
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
Where is Hanchen?

269
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
Why isn't he here yet?

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,919
I stopped him from coming.

271
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,280
What?

272
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
How will we proceed
with the competition?

273
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,120
(Mulan)

274
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,640
The time for the polo tournament
shall begin soon.

275
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,080
We're going to give
a leeway of 30 minutes.

276
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,799
Absentees will be considered
as voluntary withdrawal.

277
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,159
I'm heading over.

278
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,679
Sure.

279
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,039
Ladies of Jingnv Pavilion,

280
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,520
you're all respected opponents.

281
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,119
If I do not show up,

282
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,280
it's a disrespect towards
your effort and ambition.

283
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,119
Xie Xiaoman,

284
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,919
this is your test.

285
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,559
You should see it through.

286
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,559
I'll be right here.

287
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,679
I'm not going easy on you.

288
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,799
Let's get it started, guys.

289
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,679
All right. Come on.

290
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,520
Move it.

291
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,119
Lady Xie,

292
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,599
quit standing around.

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,640
You should head inside.

294
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,680
His Highness is waiting for you.

295
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
What are you doing?

296
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,119
What are you trying to do?

297
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
I'm about to return as

298
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,359
a daughter of nobility.

299
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,479
You went against your words
and harassed me.

300
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,599
Yes.

301
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,160
I've decided not to let you go.

302
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,319
Why not?

303
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,640
We agreed beforehand.

304
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,079
No means no.

305
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,920
You're quite talkative today.

306
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,839
Xie Xiaoman,

307
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,959
are you pretending to be
dumb or are you blind?

308
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't you see

309
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,920
everything I've prepared for you?

310
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,479
That's another matter altogether.

311
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,239
My deed is important.

312
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,199

I shouldn't have said that
I wanted to sell you off.

319
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,280
I found out.

320
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,880
Wang Weicheng told me everything.

321
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,160
You didn't mean to sell me.

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,760
You wanted to free me.

(Prince Pu's Mansion)
About travelling to Wujiang Prefecture,

341
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,400
I already spoke to father and mother.

342
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,920
By the reason of visiting relatives,

343
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll depart tomorrow.

344
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,160
As for the matters at the capital,

345
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,599
I'll have to trouble Your Highness.

346
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,400
Hanchen has always been headstrong.

347
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,599
If he upsets you

348
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,680
after your arrival at
Wujiang Prefecture,

349
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,000
do not worry.

350
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
I'm on your side.

351
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,140
(Brothel)

352
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,400
Yanniang.

353
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,079
What are you...

354
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,560
Congwen,

355
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,880
I've decided to marry Squire Wang.

356
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,880
I invited you here

357
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,199
just to bid you farewell.

358
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,560
Do you remember back then
when we first met

359
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,800
at Yanliu Forest?

360
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,599
The red peach blossoms flutter gently

361
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,560
as the east wind blows.

362
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,000
The heart aches for whom?

363
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,359
The anguish of a woman, forced
to marry a man she doesn't love.

364
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,520
As passion fades,

365
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,400
she was shrouded

366
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,199
by the memories they shared.

367
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,479
It was drizzling that day.

368
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,400
You took shelter under a pavilion.

369
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,680
I was playing the song, The Hidden Moon.

370
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,160
I have three wishes.

371
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,880
One, for my lover to live a long life.

372
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:07,199
Two, for a healthy body.

373
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,319
Three, to be like
the birds of the forest.

374
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,079
I'll meet you in my dreams.

375
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,599
Mr. Li.

376
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,800
Your father and I were
officials of the same age.

377
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,000
We could be considered colleagues.

378
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,520
Today,

379
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,359
let's be honest with each other.

380
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,199
Do you know why Courtesan Zhu's
appeals were

381
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,280
constantly deterred?

382
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:48,839
I know.

383
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,239
Since you're aware,

384
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,479
I hope you will not make
things difficult for me.

385
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:56,880
Lord Yan.

386
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:57,959
Is there

387
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,199
any other way?

388
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,280
As long as you remain

389
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,520
as the guarantor of Courtesan Zhu,

390
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,400
she will not be able to
regain her freedom.

391
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,880
She's just a courtesan at the brothel.

392
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,359
Your father would never

393
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,040
allow you to marry a frivolous woman.

394
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,119
Not to mention,

395
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,400
a man would like to act as
Courtesan Zhu's guarantor.

396
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,040
Mr. Li, consider letting her go

397
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,359
so she could find a man to rely on.

398
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:22,553
(Bailu Academy)

399
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,640
(Jingnv Pavilion)

400
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,119
Stream of Bian flows.
Stream of Si flows.

401
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,959
They flow towards
the ancient port of Yangtze River.

402
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,599
Congwen.

403
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,400
Longing and hatred.

404
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,680
There's no end until your return.

405
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,839
Holding each other under the moonlight.

406
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,160
Although the structure
of this piece is short,

407
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,800
with the form of repetition,

408
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,520
it expresses the endless longing.

409
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,479
The pain of longing and
the agony of separation

410
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,520
were portrayed vividly.

411
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,359
All right. You may all take a break.

412
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,680
Thank you, Congwen.

413
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,160
Don't you think

414
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,520
Congwen is rather strange today?

415
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
(She stands in a daze among
the flowers while swallows fly in pairs.)

416
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,199
You're walking like my father.

417
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,079
Both hands on your back.

418
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,640
I like it.

419
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,319
Right.

420
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,359
The old men are often arrogant.

421
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,199
It's a good thing that
I'm behaving more mature.

422
00:28:58,959 --> 00:28:59,880
Sure.

423
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,839
You're always right.

424
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,079
Actually,

425
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,160
it feels pretty good
to put my hands behind.

426
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,800
Xingzhou.

427
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,719
Try it out.

428
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,839
We went through the entire street.

429
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,560
We've been looking around.

430
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,040
What exactly are you looking for?

431
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,880
I have a confession to
make to Xie Xiaoman.

432
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,359
After contemplation,

433
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,400
I need to buy a gift

434
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,560
and come up with an excuse.

435
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,680
What's the matter?

436
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,959
Are you going to confess your love?

437
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,760
You should consult me in this regard.

438
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm the perfect person to ask.

439
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,680
Fine, enlighten me.

440
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:30,880
All right.

441
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,079
Recently,

442
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,239
a trend has been going on
in Wujiang Prefecture.

443
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,560
A poem is hidden in the lantern.

444
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,839
It's not visible during the day.

445
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,599
However, once it's lit up at night,

446
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,439
the poem would be displayed.

447
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,880
The Ghost Festival is around the corner.

448
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,760
The stream will be filled with lanterns.

449
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,800
You may express your feelings this way.

450
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,719
What do you think?

451
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:50,959
No.

452
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,359
This feels obscure.

453
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,560
It doesn't fit my personality.

454
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,599
As long as it works, am I right?

455
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:56,880
Many gentlemen

456
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
express their love with this approach.

457
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,040
It works for many of them.

458
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,000
How did you know that?

459
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,839
I...

460
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,439
I've been writing

461
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,680
to an old friend of mine.

462
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,640
That's what she told me.

463
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,319
A man like you has a pen pal?

464
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,439
Aren't you worried she
could end up as an old hag?

465
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,199
Don't be ridiculous.

466
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,640
I asked.

467
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,319
She's 16 years old this year.

468
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:22,680
On the day of Ghost Festival,

469
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,119
take me to the lanterns.

470
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,560
The civil examination is coming up.

471
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,160
I need to prepare for it.

472
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,479
Let's do it some other time.

473
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,599
Don't be mad.

474
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,119
Listen to me.

475
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,079
It wouldn't make a difference
to go next time, right?

476
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,359
What's wrong?

477
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,719
Hanchen.

478
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,319
(Lotus Garden)
Stream of Bian and Stream of Si flow.

479
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,319
They flow towards
the ancient port of Yangtze River.

480
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,680
Longing and worries...

481
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,319
What in the world is this?

482
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,439
Read it properly.

483
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,400
I don't understand

484
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,239
a single word.

485
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,800
Congwen always

486
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,959
teaches you difficult materials.

487
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,079
No wonder Courtesan Zhu left him.

488
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
What did you say?

489
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,040
You heard about what
happened between

490
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,800
Courtesan Zhu and Congwen as well?

491
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,439
Yes.

492
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,479
I was out eating noodles in the morning.

493
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,719
The owner of Da'e Noodle House said

494
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,439
Courtesan Zhu is getting married.

495
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,719
She's going to be married to a squire.

496
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,119
Apparently,
he owns tens of hectares of farmland.

497
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,119
He's wealthy.

498
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,319
Could that be true?

499
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
Courtesan Zhu is getting married?

500
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,719
Did they mention Congwen?

501
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,199
I'm not sure.

502
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,719
Well, everyone thinks

503
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,599
Congwen is just a poor scholar.

504
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,839
It's a good thing Courtesan Zhu

505
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,800
isn't marrying him.

506
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,520
I think so, too.

507
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,079
If I get to choose,

508
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,560
I'd marry the squire

509
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,599
and be an owner of land.

510
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,119
Congwen is a poor man
who enjoys poetry.

511
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,319
He gives me a headache.

512
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,000
Don't be ridiculous!

513
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
Did they mention

514
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,760
the courtesan being
forced into the marriage?

515
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,199
What happens if the squire

516
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
seized her by force?

517
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,239
Congwen is a mere scholar.

518
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,079
He will not be able to win.

519
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,359
I haven't heard of that.

520
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:14,880
Do not enter.

521
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:17,959
Enter.

522
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,400
No.

523
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,160
Shi Deng'er.

524
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,680
Enter.

525
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,680
Do I enter or not?

526
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,520
Do not enter.

527
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,319
You...

528
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,239
His Highness is here.

529
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,560
Who's here?

530
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
- Who is it?
- Shi Deng'er.

531
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,479
Shi Deng'er.

532
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,800
His Highness is here.

533
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,239
Why are you pushing me?

534
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,920
His Highness is here.

535
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,660
(Lotus Garden)

536
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,000
What are you doing here?

537
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,359
This is my home.

538
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,239
I can go anywhere I want to.

539
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,880
Your words are hideous.

540
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,319
Zhao Xiaoqian.

541
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,680
I'll teach you Su Calligraphy.

542
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,639
Do you know how to write it?

543
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,080
Of course I do.

544
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,120
Who am I?

545
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,159
The well-rounded Commandery Prince.

546
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,879
You're one lucky girl.

547
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,280
Tell me.

548
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,000
What does holding each other
under the moonlight mean?

549
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
Under the bright moonlight,

550
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,080
two lovers should enjoy it
by holding each other

551
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,639
to properly appreciate its beauty.

552
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,080
You enjoy writing poetry.

553
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,919
Do you like poetry
hidden in the lanterns?

554
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,320
Oh, right.

555
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:55,239
Let me ask you.

556
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,840
Do you think

557
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,679
a man would forcibly

558
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,320
marry a woman of another man?

559
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,840
Should I stay the night?

560
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,919
Lecher!

561
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,040
Your Highness.

562
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:15,479
What do you intend to buy?

563
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,600
We left abruptly.

564
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,840
I haven't finished my rice cakes.

565
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,800
Sir.

566
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,520
Would you like a lantern?

567
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,600
These two are rather exquisite.

568
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
You have a keen eye, sir.

569
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,360
These two

570
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,719
are different from the rest.

571
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,760
Look at this one.

572
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,760
"Cut all ties" is written on this one.

573
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,959
They are

574
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,560
used by the ladies to reject men.

575
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:39,919
What about this one?

576
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,320
This is great.

577
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,120
Look.

578
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,280
"Lover on the other side."

579
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,760
This lantern

580
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,439
is one of our best sellers.

581
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,199
This is the last piece left.

582
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,159
Really?

583
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,439
This one it is.

584
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:58,560
How much does it cost?

585
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,199
Ten cash.

586
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,719
Your Highness.

587
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,159
Wait up.

588
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,820
(Brothel)

589
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,520
I loved the lady for a long time,

590
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,239
but she had no idea.

591
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:18,760
"Dew becomes frost".

592
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,679
"Dew becomes frost".

593
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,239
Tell me.

594
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,760
What exactly is going on

595
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,679
in a woman's head?

596
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,040
"Dew becomes frost".

597
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,000
"Dew becomes frost".

598
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,120
I told you the story of

599
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,239
Minggu and I.

600
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,360
Please advise me.

601
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,940
("Dew becomes frost")

602
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,520
Hold it.

603
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,159
What are you doing?

604
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,719
Let go.

605
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,399
"Dew becomes frost"?

606
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,760
Which lady are you writing to?

607
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,879
Are you thinking about ladies already?

608
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,360
Are you fully grown?

609
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,520
Mind your own business.

610
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:24,959
Give it back.

611
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:25,639
You...

612
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,959
A letter written to a lady.

613
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm sure the letter

614
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,919
consists of things you don't
want others to find out.

615
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,760
How about this?

616
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,000
I'll charge you 20 strings of 1000 cash.

617
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:37,120
and act as your pigeon
to deliver the letter.

618
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,959
20 strings?

619
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,239
In your dreams.

620
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
I don't have money for you.

621
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,560
Fine.

622
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
I'll order a few servants

623
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,080
and have this letter
duplicated in hundreds.

624
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,479
I'll stick them all over Bailu Academy.

625
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,080
How dare you?

626
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,320
Why not?

627
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
I cannot allow Ming...

628
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,679
Ming?

629
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,479
What are you talking about?

630
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,879
Quit yapping.

631
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,239
I have no money for you.

632
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,159
I can't be bothered.

633
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
By noon tomorrow,

634
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,239
at the entrance of Bailu Academy,

635
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,760
if I do not receive the money,

636
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm going to stick your letter

637
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,600
onto the notice board.

638
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,639
Let's go.

639
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:09,760
Xu Shu!

640
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:10,360
You...

641
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,919
You rascal!

642
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:18,560
Qiongqiong.

643
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:27,239
Burn them all.

644
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,220
(From Congwen)

645
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,439
Sister,

646
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,600
I do not understand.

647
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,719
You clearly have feelings
for Mr. Congwen.

648
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,760
Why would you agree to
Squire Wang's proposal?

649
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:41,919
Burn these letters first.

650
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,479
Sister, I can't burn them.

651
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,199
The letters consist of your poetry

652
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,239
written with Mr. Congwen.

653
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,919
You have yet to pass them to him.

654
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,760
You can't burn them.

655
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:49,879
Enough.

656
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:53,000
Congwen and I are over.

657
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:54,800
Since it's over,

658
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:57,120
it's pointless to keep these around.

659
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,959
Sister.

660
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Your heart still yearns for Mr. Congwen.

661
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,399
I've made up my mind.

662
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,639
Do not try to convince me.

663
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,959
Burn the letters.

664
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,439
Tomorrow,

665
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,239
we're leaving.

666
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,780
(Bailu Academy)

667
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,159
Lady Xie, please hold on.

668
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:05,919
Qiongqiong?

669
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,520
Lady Xie,

670
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,760
I have a favour to ask.

671
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:13,239
Take your time.

672
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,280
I'll take a walk at the Shi Alley.

673
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,159
Is this about Courtesan Zhu?

674
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,280
Is she really getting married?

675
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,000
Was it out of her own will

676
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,040
or was she extorted by the squire?

677
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,800
It was out of her own free will.

678
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:35,639
Lady Xie.

679
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,040
Lady Xie.

680
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,280
Lady Xie.

681
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,040
Lady Xie.

682
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,199
You may not have known.

683
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Since the courtesan told Mr. Congwen

684
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
about her marriage,

685
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,399
Mr. Congwen never stepped
foot in the brothel.

686
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm certain

687
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
that she still yearns for Mr. Congwen.

688
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,280
I'm sure Mr. Congwen
feels the same as well.

689
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,520
However, we're leaving tonight.

690
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,040
I just

691
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,040
wanted them to meet for one last time.

692
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,000
Perhaps, things will turn around.

693
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
Even if nothing changes,

694
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,959
at least they could
have bid each other farewell.

695
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,199
Sister kept everything to herself.

696
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm concerned about her.

697
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,679
One last time?

698
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,679
This

699
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,760
was written by her and Mr. Congwen.

700
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,000
It's called the Sapphire Song.

701
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,800
Mr. Congwen wrote the first verse

702
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:20,639
while she wrote the bottom half.

703
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,719
She hasn't shown it to Mr. Congwen yet.

704
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Once he sees this,

705
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,159
he'd definitely come to meet her.

706
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,919
Since Courtesan Zhu has
made the decision on her own,

707
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,439
there's nothing I can do either.

708
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,760
My apologies.

709
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,800
Lady Xie.

710
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,399
It's fine if you wouldn't
pass it to Mr. Congwen.

711
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,280
I

712
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,000
said what I needed to say.

713
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,239
I shall return to pack our belongings.

714
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:43,560
Qiongqiong.

715
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,719
At 9.45 p.m. during
the Ghost Festival tonight,

716
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,959
Squire Wang's carriage
to pick Courtesan Zhu up

717
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,439
will be passing by the market on Leqiao.

718
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,280
I'll be waiting for your reply.

719
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,719
