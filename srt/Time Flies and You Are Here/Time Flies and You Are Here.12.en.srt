=Episode 12=

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Apart from you like stars in the sky)

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,994
(Jingnv Pavilion)

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,800
We're playing polo
against Luming Pavilion?

23
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,440
We're all ladies.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,199
I've never even ridden a horse before.

25
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,319
How are we going to play polo?

26
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,080
That's true.

27
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,199
It's the family affair between
the Commandery Prince of Julu,

28
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,360
and Xiaoman anyway.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,279
If we take part hastily,

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,800
it's not appropriate.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,760
That's right.

32
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,239
We're all ladies.

33
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,160
Could Xiaoman be sold

34
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,000
and someone's happy about it?

35
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,800
In this world,

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,759
there are too much injustice
towards us ladies.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
Are we not going to help

38
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,240
other ladies?

39
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,479
Help her if you want.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,320
I can't do it.

41
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,679
I was angry with him.

42
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,839
Who knew

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,919
it's as if he was born to play polo.

44
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,440
My bad.

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm not as bright as the city people.

46
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,399
I'm such an idiot.

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,479
Xiaoman.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,119
Oh, right.

49
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,080
About what happened before this,

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,360
how did it go?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,679
It's solved.

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,039
Don't worry

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,960
about me.

54
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,000
Since Yanniang has decided to do so,

55
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,559
I should be responsible
for your matters anyway.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,919
You're my junior,

57
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,440
and also the most hardworking
student in Jingnv Pavilion.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm like your teacher.

59
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,839
There's no way I'll ignore you.

60
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,199
Don't worry.

61
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,919
Zhao Xiaoqian can't do
anything to me for now.

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,199
not just a powerless scholar.

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,479
Xiaoman.

65
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,160
Teacher.

66
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,919
I've heard about what happened.

67
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,720
I've disgraced you.

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
How is that disgrace?

69
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,479
As a concubine,

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,919
your fate isn't up to you.

71
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,119
I heard you're going to
have a polo match

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,800
with the Commandery Prince
at the old academy.

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,199
Actually,

74
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,080
I couldn't even ride a horse properly.

75
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,440
I made that decision in a rush.

76
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,759
Please forgive me.

77
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,440
How do I forgive you?

78
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,759
Since such misfortune is set,

79
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,240
compromising

80
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,880
will be unfair for ourselves.

81
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,600
Confucius compared ladies to villains.

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,919
So, as ladies,

83
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,639
all the more we should

84
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,440
always remind ourselves
of the way of gentlemen.

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,080
We must keep our word.

86
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,440
For our own destiny,

87
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,360
we must also achieve
something for our future.

88
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,520
Hopefully we'll have a clear
conscience towards heavens,

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
towards the world,

90
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
and ourselves,

91
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,520
understand?

92
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Teacher, may I ask,

93
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,880
what's the meaning of have a clear
conscience towards ourselves?

94
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
In the past, Lady Hao went to the
battlefield in her husband's place,

95
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,000
and Princess Zhao of Pingyang
guarded Niangzi Pass.

96
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,079
The two of them never relied
on their father or brothers.

97
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,880
People always say

98
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,799
ladies depend on others throughout their
lives, akin to climbers on trees,

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,519
and the tree here means the
male members of her family.

100
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,880
But ladies in this world

101
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,239
are no different from men.

102
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,079
The only difference is
ladies neither compete,

103
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,880
nor dare,

104
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,720
thinking submitting will
mean an easy life in future.

105
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,480
However, easy life or not,

106
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,359
it depends on others.

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Food handed out in
contempt is tasteless.

108
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,119
Heavens help those who help themselves.

109
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,200
Today,

110
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
if you stand forth for yourself,

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,160
even if you failed in future,

112
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,440
you won't regret it.

113
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,519
But if you admit defeat

114
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
or give in,

115
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,359
then your destiny

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,119
is no longer up to yourself.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,239
Teacher, do you mean

118
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,399
I should fight for my own destiny?

119
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,839
A just cause attracts much support,

120
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,519
an unjust one finds little.

121
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,880
If you're firm-minded,

122
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,959
yours will be a just cause.

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,359
I understand now.

124
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,640
Teacher, you're broad-minded and bold.

125
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I'll go and take a look at her first.

126
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,079
Xiaoman.

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,559
Ladies.

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,880
I know.

129
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,440
Perhaps all of you are thinking.

130
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,559
What did Xie Xiaoman do

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,279
to be loathed by the Commandery Prince

132
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,519
and even offered to sell her to others?

133
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,959
In fact...

134
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,279
In fact, I also want to know why.

135
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,679
What exactly happened that

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,000
Xie Xiaoman has to end up in this state?

137
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,359
Today,

138
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not afraid of being
embarrassed anymore.

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,440
I'll tell you the entire story.

140
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,440
I thought about living in
Yuyangli my entire life.

141
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,799
Plant mulberry trees during
peak farming season,

142
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,000
and study during off-peak season.

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,559
Find a good husband,

144
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,440
and lead a stable life

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,559
as long as we're safe and secure
for the rest of our lives.

146
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,440
But the current era

147
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,959
is so harsh towards ladies.

148
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,760
I won't hide it from everyone else.

149
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,839
That day,

150
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,440
I indeed spent the night
with the Commandery Prince.

151
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,559
It was an accident.

152
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
But my entire life

153
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,440
was changed since that night.

154
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,559
The times we're in now,

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,239
ladies have to obey
their father's orders at home,

156
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,000
and after they get married, they'll
obey their husband's orders.

157
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,320
When their husband pass away,
it's the sons.

158
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,160
I've always enjoyed studying

159
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,959
because it'll bring us knowledge.

160
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,279
But if I can't even determine

161
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,399
my own fate,

162
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,279
what good will knowledge do?

163
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,799
If we keep living in the lessons
of "Admonitions for Ladies",

164
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,279
we'll only suffer more and more.

165
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,079
For us ladies,

166
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,559
a concubine like me,

167
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,880
or a female servant,

168
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,279
or even courtesans,

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,160
none of us is an object.

170
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,519
We shouldn't be trampled by others

171
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,640
or thrown around.

172
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
What's the purpose of studying anyway?

173
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,160
I've been thinking about this question

174
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
ever since I joined the academy.

175
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,359
Now,

176
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,239
I seem to have understood a little.

177
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,239
Perhaps it takes this kind of suffering

178
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,480
and tribulations

179
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,079
for us to understand that

180
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,959
like men, we're also humans.

181
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm not afraid to fight with anyone.

182
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,119
I just want Xie Xiaoman

183
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,279
to live on with a sense of pride.

184
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
Today, the person who is
asking for your help

185
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,920
isn't your classmate, Xie Xiaoman,

186
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
but a lady

187
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,600
Xie Xiaoman.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,839
I'll help you.

189
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,920
It's not easy for ladies anywhere.

190
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
We're not those kind of

191
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,399
ordinary short-sighted ladies.

192
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,920
Let's show those guys
from Luming Pavilion

193
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,799
that

194
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,600
we can also play polo with them,

195
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,119
fair and square.

196
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,399
Count me in!

197
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,479
Count me in!

198
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,440
Count me in!

199
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,039
We'll also help you.

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,840
Of course.

201
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,320
I'll help you, too.

202
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,679
Zhao Xiaoqian,

203
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
what are you doing?

204
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,559
All of us are friends.

205
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
In future, when we meet,

206
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,159
it'll only make things
difficult for all of us.

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Jingnv Pavilion has promised Xiaoman.

208
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,200
But even if that's the case,

209
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
it's also very unlikely they'll win.

210
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,159
You shouldn't be doing this.

211
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,640
I agree.

212
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,359
Hanchen.

213
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Don't let yourself regret this.

214
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm already regretting

215
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,840
marrying her.

216
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,640
Master.

217
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,880
This rascal.

218
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,960
What happened to you this time?

219
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,880
Did you come and have a drink with me?

220
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,200
Or you're here for archery?

221
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:16,960
That shot

222
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,880
was full of determination.

223
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
But you've been visiting

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,080
the army camp often lately.

225
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,039
What are you up to?

226
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,919
Are you planning to join Xiongjie Camp

227
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,799
or remain at Wujiang Prefecture?

228
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Master, you've heard of it?

229
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,479
Of course.

230
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,599
Commandery Prince of Julu's
selling his concubine.

231
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,000
Everyone in Wujiang Prefecture knows.

232
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,280
So, Master,

233
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,359
what do you think I should do?

234
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
When I first taught
you horseback archery,

235
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,799
I told you,

236
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,760
for us men,

237
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,599
if you have high ambitions,

238
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,080
you need to be broad-minded.

239
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,520
Attachment to the self
brings about trouble.

240
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
Self-centeredness is
a no-no for soldiers.

241
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,520
If you have high ambitions,

242
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,359
you'll have to let go of certain things.

243
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Master, do you mean

244
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,919
you want me to let go?

245
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,760
Men should be

246
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,479
adaptable to circumstances.

247
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,400
If you want to leave
Wujiang Prefecture itself,

248
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,880
then nothing at this place

249
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,400
should hold you back.

250
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,000
Squire Wang, will you really redeem me?

251
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,840
Certainly.

252
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,039
Then I'm willing to marry you.

253
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,400
I hope you're not lying to me

254
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,239
and are indeed planning to

255
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,719
make me your wife.

256
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,159
You're really agreeing to it?

257
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,640
Yanniang,

258
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,479
don't worry.

259
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,960
I'll definitely treat you well.

260
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,520
I guarantee

261
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,840
I won't get any concubines.

262
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,679
When we get your contract,

263
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,599
I'll make you

264
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,119
my wife openly.

265
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Magistrate Yan,

266
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,640
about redeeming Courtesan Zhu,

267
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,719
I need your help.

268
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,880
(Capital)

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,229
(Kunning Palace)

270
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,260
(Crown Prince, Zhao Xiaoze)

271
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Lady Shen again submitted a
memorial to the palace today,

272
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,039
(Eunuch Wang Xian)
saying she wants to meet Your Highness.

273
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,960
How many times has she done
that in this month alone?

274
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,440
It must be about

275
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,679
(Empress)
Commandery Prince of Julu.

276
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,880
I don't understand

277
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,640
what Shen Zunfu is thinking.

278
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,479
Zhao Xiaoqian got
a concubine in Wujiang,

279
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,640
embarrassing Shen Family.

280
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,280
Yet, he's still thinking of
letting Lingniang marry him.

281
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,080
Maybe Lingniang is the one
who couldn't forget him.

282
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,840
Did you forget?

283
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,840
Lingniang and the Commandery Prince

284
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,119
grew up in the palace together.

285
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
His Majesty

286
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,679
verbally granted their marriage before.

287
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,679
What Commandery Prince has done

288
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,880
is known all across the capital.

289
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,119
Lingniang would rather
compromise her dignity

290
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,159
than change her mind.

291
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,119
Perhaps...

292
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,520
Perhaps she's unwilling to enter
the imperial palace as a concubine.

293
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,880
Lingniang is entering the palace?

294
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,479
His Majesty is here!

295
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,200
You may rise.

296
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
Yesterday, Xiaoze said

297
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
he's almost memorised "Mencius"

298
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,640
by heart,

299
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,119
and yet you still haven't
tested him on it.

300
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,599
What were you writing?

301
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,340
(Emperor)

302
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:59,239
"To be able to celebrate with the people

303
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,719
as one's happiness."

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,080
What does it mean?

305
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:03,840
It's talking about

306
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,880
King Wen of Zhou was
building the astronomy tower.

307
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,840
He said to the people,

308
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,359
"take your time to build the tower."

309
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,080
The people thought King Wen
was concerned about them,

310
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,119
so they put even more effort into it.

311
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,760
However, when it's completed,

312
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,520
King Wen of Zhou was found
relaxing in the astronomy tower.

313
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,119
It was then the people realised

314
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,479
King Wen of Zhou's aim

315
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,799
was to enjoy himself in the tower.

316
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,479
So, this sentence implies that

317
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,479
King Wen...

318
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,679
King Wen wants to...

319
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
Celebrate with the people.

320
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,400
It means the king should apply
the policy of benevolence,

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,880
share weal and woe with the people,

322
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,919
and celebrate together.

323
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,159
It's better to have a solid foundation
when it comes to studying.

324
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,119
Don't be restricted in vision
and shallow in understanding.

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,760
In the past, when Hanchen
studied "Mencius",

326
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,760
it took him great painstaking effort.

327
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Not only must you memorise it by heart,

328
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,440
you have to understand what it means.

329
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,159
Learn from your brother.

330
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,760
I understand.

331
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,799
I received many memorials again.

332
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,080
I need to leave.

333
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
The osmanthus tree at the backyard
is going to bloom soon.

334
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,799
You and your son should go
have a look when you have time.

335
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,359
No need to see me off.

336
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,599
Revise with the Crown Prince.

337
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,440
Take care, Your Majesty.

338
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Take care, father.

339
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,919
Your Highness,

340
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,119
regarding Lady Shen...

341
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,239
I won't meet her.

342
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,159
Entering the palace or not

343
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,559
isn't up to her.

344
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,460
(Residence of the Shen Family, Capital)

345
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,440
Her Highness wants us to send
Lingniang to the palace.

346
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,239
How can I let them ruin our Lingniang?

347
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,320
His Majesty is much older

348
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,679
than Lingniang.

349
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,920
No, this won't do.

350
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,560
I married you

351
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,920
not to let our daughter suffer.

352
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,640
I don't care.

353
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,760
Go to the palace and tell His Majesty

354
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,119
that Lingniang's already engaged.

355
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,880
What are you talking about?

356
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,719
Zhao Xiaoqian has got himself a
concubine in Wujiang Prefecture.

357
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,599
It's an act of humiliation towards us

358
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,880
as well as Lingniang.

359
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,839
You've been

360
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,239
my wife for years.

361
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,760
Why don't you understand
such a simple theory?

362
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,274
(Madam Shen)

363
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,880
Why won't Her Highness meet Lingniang?

364
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:31,959
Do you know why?

365
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,590
(Minister of Bureau of Military Affairs,
Shen Zunfu)

366
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,239
Her Highness has decided

367
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,280
to bring Lingniang to the palace,

368
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,160
but the current situation within
the palace is very complicated.

369
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:45,199
Noble Consort Zhang and Her Highness
are fighting over His Majesty's favour,

370
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
but she has no child.

371
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,479
Her Highness has Crown Prince,

372
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,400
yet Chancellor Xu's clinging
to Crown Prince for his power.

373
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,199
The forces in the capital
are intertwined and complicated.

374
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,400
Our Junfu is coming back next year.

375
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,520
Her Highness' idea

376
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,560
is to let Shen Family settle down first.

377
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,719
You won't let Lingniang enter
the palace.

378
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
Do you want to let her enter
the East Palace?

379
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,560
(Lingniang, Shen Zhaowen)
Do you mean

380
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,199
you want my Lingniang,

381
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,359
to set the path for Shen Family?

382
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
We're a family of high officials,

383
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:24,800
not some unknown people

384
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,520
who climbed up to this status today.

385
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,719
We

386
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
can't afford to fall.

387
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,560
It's the last 15 minutes.

388
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,319
Don't give up.

389
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,319
Hang in there.

390
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,199
Although those from Luming Pavilion

391
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,640
are natural horse riders,

392
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,880
we mustn't lose to them.

393
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,560
I'll remember

394
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,560
the kindness you all show today.

395
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,680
In future,

396
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,400
if any of you

397
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,160
are treated unfairly by the society,

398
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,359
I'll be the first to stand up for you.

399
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,040
Why don't we

400
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,160
recite "The Ballad of Mulan"

401
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,439
to boost our morale?

402
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,439
Sure!

403
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,400
Sigh.

404
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,439
Mulan sat at home weaving,

405
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,319
but the loom's resonant sound
could not be heard

406
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,079
over the girl's sighs,

407
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,959
but my father has no son,

408
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,599
and I have no big brother.

409
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,520
I want to go to buy
a saddle and a horse

410
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,359
to serve in my father's place.

411
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,400
The night air moved
the watchman's rattle,

412
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,079
the cold light glinted on her armour.

413
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,920
A hundred generals died in battle,

414
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,839
in ten years she returned
as a great warrior.

415
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,920
Mulan said, "The male rabbit
normally hops and runs

416
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,800
while the female sits and stares.

417
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,599
But both flee fast
when danger threatens.

418
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,280
How can one tell whether they
are male or female then?"

419
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,199
Sister,

420
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,439
did something happen within the mansion?

421
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Lady Xie,

422
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,400
well...

423
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,880
I still have something on.

424
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,959
I don't know anything.

425
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,800
I don't know anything.

426
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,340
(Lotus Garden)

427
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,719
Wick,

428
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,560
come closer.

429
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,119
Try again once more.

430
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,359
What's wrong?

431
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,040
What's she doing?

432
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:20,640
This afternoon,

433
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,959
she bought a few books on polo.

434
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,119
I guess she's practising now.

435
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,599
Your Highness,

436
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,680
a married couple's fights don't last.

437
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,839
Why don't you just go in?

438
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,040
Maybe if she's happy,

439
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,560
the misunderstanding between
you two will be solved.

440
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,439
What's there to solve?

441
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,119
She's already made her decision.

442
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,959
It's already been said.

443
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,680
If all the misunderstandings
in this world

444
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,959
can be solved so easily,

445
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,880
then I...

446
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Wick, don't sleep.

447
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:50,719
Help me see

448
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,119
if my action just now
was correct or not.

449
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,800
Yes.

450
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:54,959
This is the page.

451
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,199
Why does it feel strange though?

452
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,199
Is that so?

453
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,439
What are you doing?

454
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,640
Leave us first.

455
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,599
What are you doing?

456
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,719
Let me tell you.

457
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,599
Many of the students at Jingnv Pavilion

458
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,560
are skilled in polo.

459
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,199
We won't lose to

460
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,560
you all from Luming Pavilion.

461
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,199
You've been practising polo
the entire evening?

462
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,319
That's right.

463
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,040
It's going well.

464
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,119
Do you want to leave me so badly?

465
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,199
Speak.

466
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,839
What are you doing?

467
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,160
You're the one who
was planning to sell me.

468
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,359
You abandoned me first.

469
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,439
I sold you?

470
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,439
Don't you know why I did that?

471
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,959
Let go of me!

472
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,719
Let go!

473
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,839
You're my concubine

474
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,719
yet you secretly helped Li Su.

475
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,560
What do you take me for?

476
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm the Commandery Prince, you know.

477
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,839
Speak!

478
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,160
Let go!

479
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:33,839
Yes,

480
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,040
that's right.

481
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,400
It's because I was worried something
might happen to Congwen.

482
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,040
That's why I copied the intelligence.

483
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,880
It's because Congwen helped me before.

484
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,359
Be it Congwen

485
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,160
or Teacher Liu,

486
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,479
they're the ones who told me that

487
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,280
ladies can also study and
know the rules of propriety.

488
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,280
Ladies can also have their own path.

489
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,560
And you?

490
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,319
Zhao Xiaoqian,

491
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm thankful for what you did for me,

492
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,439
and I'm also trying to repay that.

493
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,319
However, am I mere nothing to you?

494
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,640
What unforgivable mistake did I make?

495
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,640
When you're unhappy,

496
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,359
you just sold me to others?

497
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,959
Zhao Xiaoqian,
you were going to sell me.

498
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,079
So tell me.
Why should I be in love with you?

499
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,359
Why should I be in love with

500
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,680
a person who decides
my destiny as he pleases?

501
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,800
Let go!

502
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Let go!

503
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,319
Please let me go!

504
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,160
Let go!

505
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
Do you hate me so much?

506
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,319
In future, when you've left my side,

507
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,079
take good care of yourself.

508

Don't try to step up for others anymore.

509
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,199
If you come across someone
other than me,

510

who knows

511
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,199
you might even get killed.

512
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,439
Did you know?

513
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,400
I also hate myself.

514
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,359
There're so many ladies in this world.

515
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,920
Why does it have to be you
of all people?

516
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,520
You heartless Xie Xiaoman.

517

521

Su Family sent someone here

522
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
to bring Lady Xie back.

523
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:13,920
Chase them away.

524
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,640
That'd be inappropriate.

525
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,959
After all, it's Lady Xie's family.

526
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,640
Do I need to teach you all these?

527
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,079
If they cause a ruckus again,

528
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,599
just seal Su Chang Ji.

as well as a deed.

Xiaoman will go with you
after the polo match.

534
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,479
Let her leave

535
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,560
and return the deed to her.

536
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,800

Principal,

00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,599
I guess the polo match will
go on as usual tomorrow.

567
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,000
But if we

568
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,479
don't want things to get more
serious than it already is,

569
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,000
the polo match mustn't
have a final result.

570
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,920
Therefore, I'd like to ask you

571
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,800
to think of a way to
terminate the match tomorrow.

572

to solve the issue.

Since you're solving the issue,

575
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,520
problems shouldn't arise
from it further.

576
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,000

this time's polo match as a test

is a first for male and female
students to fight in opposing teams

584

ever since the establishment
of Bailu Academy.

585

It'll set a precedent.
