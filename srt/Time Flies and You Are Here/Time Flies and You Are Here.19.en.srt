20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Living in a poor environment
makes me lonely at night)

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,639
Take a look at this.

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,680
This was written by my student
in the capital

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
for my entertainment.

24
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,639
Now, it's known across
the entire capital

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,199
the Prince Pu's Mansion

26
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,800
who broke off the engagement

27
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,080
is again connecting with Shen Family
through marriage.

28
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,639
Moreover, an order has been
issued at the imperial palace.

29
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,800
Why did Her Highness agree to it?

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,919
How could Her Highness wish

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,039
me to marry the daughter
of Shen Family?

32
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,559
The balance of interests
in the imperial court

33
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,119
changes frequently.

34
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,679
Shen Family is on Her Highness' side.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,320
If you marry their daughter,

36
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,800
and go to the capital,

37
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,800
you'll be within her control.

38
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,720
I'll reply them

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,559
the same thing.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,800
I won't marry Shen Zhaowen.

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
All I'm thinking is to help Xie Xiaoman

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,960
to be conferred as Noble Lady Wuguo.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
I know that, in Wujiang Prefecture,

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
you're the only person

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
who isn't under the control
of Prince Pu's Mansion.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Please pass this to the Ministry
of Imperial Affairs on my behalf.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't believe that

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
after Shen Zunfu saw this,

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,800
he'll still entrust his daughter to me.

50
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:04,360
So you're going to go against
the Prince Pu's Mansion?

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,360
That's right.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,639
Let me be the Prince Pu's Mansion's

53
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,800
good-for-nothing son until the end.

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
Such a pity.

55
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,639
For this matter,

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,679
(Commandery Prince of Julu's letter)
I'm unable to help.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,399
Principal.

58
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,720
Submitting a memorial

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,759
is beyond my power.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,320
That being said, here's an idea.

61
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,759
Duke Teng of Tongzhou has
resigned from his position,

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,839
so he isn't controlled
by any of the parties.

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,559
If he's willing to help,

64
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,559
you will have a bigger chance.

65
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,080
Thank you for your help.

66
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,479
Take care, Your Highness.

67
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,160
Why did you help His Highness?

68
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,199
Whenever the roc flies into the sky,

69
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,720
thousands of miles will be passed by.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,399
How did it go?

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,200
I don't think I can go
with you to the exam hall.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,799
I have to go to Tongzhou
on a quick horse.

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,640
I understand.

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,119
Don't worry about the exam.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
Take care on your way there.

76
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,380
(The deserter of Shenwu Army, Huang Liu,
will be beheaded in seven days)

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
What exactly happened to you?

78
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,359
He and Shen Zhaowen are engaged.

79
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:57,920
They might

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
get married soon.

81
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,440
Xiaoman.

82
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,900
(Zheng Hai's wife, Ming Yue)

83
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,640
Xiaoman?

84
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:08,480
Ming Yue?

85
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,679
Xiaoman.

86
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,839
Save me, Xiaoman!

87
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,440
Save me, Xiaoman!

88
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,079
Save me!

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,399
She's Ming Yue,

90
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,839
my childhood friend in Yuyangli Village.

91
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,959
We grew up together.

92
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,119
Since the day you left,

93
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,480
our family got poor harvest.

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,959
At the same time, my brother fell ill.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,799
We had no money to hire him a physician,

96
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
so they arranged me to get
married here in Wujiang Prefecture.

97
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
The matchmaker said

98
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,200
it's a wealthy family looking
for a second wife.

99
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,279
I only found out upon arrival

100
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,799
that the man's a local hooligan.

101
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,720
Not only does he not work,

102
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,239
he'd even hit me

103
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,160
whenever things don't go his way.

104
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,519
He even hit you?

105
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,040
Xiaoman,

106
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,519
I want to go back to Yuyangli Village.

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,839
I want to go home.

108
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,839
Get up first.

109
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,359
It hurts.

110
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,079
How can he hit you like this?

111
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,519
All these were his doings?

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,239
Xiaoman,

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,799
I pleaded with him to let me go.

114
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,959
I pleaded with everyone around me,

115
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,679
but as you can see,

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,799
in the end,

117
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,600
I got beaten even more badly.

118
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,519
I've used up

119
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,519
all the cash gift I took from my family.

120
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,040
There's no way I can escape.

121
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,519
I'm trapped here forever.

122
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,320
It won't happen, Ming Yue.

123
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,559
Don't worry.

124
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,079
I'll help you.

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,600
It's not a big deal.

126
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,200
He just wants money.

127
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,880
I have money.

128
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,959
I saved up a lot.

129
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,279
I'll give you all my money.

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
We can't do that.

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,119
He won't let me go.

132
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,839
Nothing is predestined.

133
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,880
Don't worry.

134
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,079
I won't let you live like this.

135
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,320
I resign to my destiny.

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
I'm not like you.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,359
I've always been timid
since I was little.

138
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,799
So what if I leave his side

139
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,799
and return to Yuyangli Village?

140
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,399
I'll still be

141
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,839
an old maid who can't get married.

142
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,119
Xiaoman,

143
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,079
I'll only bring you trouble.

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,200
Just let me be.

145
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:45,880
Ming Yue.

146
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,079
Ming Yue.

147
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
Ming Yue.

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,799
There are really ladies in this world

149
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,279
who will remain at their husbands' side

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,119
even if their marriage is a mistake?

151
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:03,880
I think

152
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,600
that's the majority.

153
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,719
How did it go?

154
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
(The deserter of Shenwu Army, Huang Liu,
will be beheaded in seven days)

155
00:08:58,719 --> 00:08:59,280
Speak.

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,919
Xiaoman...

157
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,440
Xiaoman didn't come.

158
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,200
She isn't willing to help?

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,119
Aren't you two childhood friends?

160
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,679
She...

161
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,520
She's having some trouble lately.

162
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,440
So she won't help you?

163
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:20,359
Maybe...

164
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,479
Maybe it's because we haven't
seen each other for a long time.

165
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,280
She...

166
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,359
What else did she say to you?

167
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,039
Nothing.

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,599
You're useless.

169
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,239
Try again tomorrow.

170
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,799
If it still doesn't work,

171
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,479
I can only use brutal force.

172
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,400
Tomorrow, you all will follow Ming Yue

173
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,880
to Bailu Academy

174
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,520
to kidnap the Commandery Prince.

175
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,320
A life for a life.

176
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,479
I'm going to save Huang Liu.

177
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,080
But Zheng Hai,

178
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,320
last time, he...

179
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,039
Zhao Xiaoqian

180
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,479
doesn't seem to be in
Wujiang Prefecture currently.

181
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,200
He's not in Wujiang Prefecture?

182
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,239
Then we'll get hold of his weakness.

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
What...

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,760
What weakness?

185
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,479
Commandery Prince of Julu's concubine.

186
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,119
But...

187
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:30,880
But...

188
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,960
That's it.

189
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,119
That's it.

190
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,799
Year after year,

191
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,320
we already have four children.

192
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,760
If you don't pass the exam,

193
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,320
how can we carry on then?

194
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
This time it'll be all right.

195
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,919
Just stay at home to
look after the children.

196
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I'll definitely pass the exam this year.

197
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,479
Xingzhou,

198
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,599
don't be anxious.

199
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,479
Just do as

200
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,880
you normally would.

201
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
I agree.

202
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,320
You seem to be more anxious
than Xingzhou.

203
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,840
Go away.

204
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,799
A time will come to ride
the wind and cleave the waves.

205
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,799
I'll set my cloud-white sail
and cross the sea which raves.

206
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:13,840
Xiaoman,

207
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,119
Hanchen is up to something lately,

208
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,239
but no worries.

209
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,640
You two can talk about it

210
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,080
when he's back.

211
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,860
(Wujiang Examination Hall)

212
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,119
Examinees, please enter the hall.

213
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,440
Good luck.

214
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:44,599
Okay.

215
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,679
Xingzhou,

216
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,359
my father said,

217
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,479
bring a cicada with you during exam.

218
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,080
If the cicada sounds,

219
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,359
the examinee will get the first place.

220
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,200
Take it.

221
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,000
Thank you.

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,760
Minggu,

223
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,919
I have to go.

224
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,559
Where are you going?

225
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm going to look for Congwen.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,440
He said he has something to tell me.

227
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,640
Don't you think

228
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
Xie Xiaoman and Zhao Xiaoqian

229
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
have been acting weird recently?

230
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,119
You don't know anything.

231
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,719
It's not for you to gossip.

232
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,039
I don't.

233
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,799
You're the one who's been weird.

234
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
Xingzhou's taking the exam.

235
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,039
And you

236
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
gave him a cicada as a gift.

237
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,119
If the invigilator heard the noise,

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,559
what's our Xingzhou going to do?

239
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,599
Our Xingzhou?

240
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,880
What do you mean?

241
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,799
Xingzhou isn't your son.

242
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,880
Someone's coming.

243
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,599
Xiaoman,

244
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,080
you're here.

245
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,159
Congwen,

246
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,000
you're teaching here?

247
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:12,960
Yes.

248
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,359
I'm teaching general knowledge.

249
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,039
Since you're here today,

250
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,799
you can teach the ladies a chapter
from Examples for Women.

251
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:18,719
Me?

252
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,679
I can't do it.

253
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,080
Who knows.

254
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,479
You'll never know unless you give it a try.

255
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,080
Children.

256
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,359
Today, I invited

257
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,719
a female teacher here to join us.

258
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,919
This is Teacher Xie.

259
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,719
Greetings, Teacher Xie.

260
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,559
Before this, Teacher Li taught you all

261
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,400
"Women's Analects".

262
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
What do you all think of it?

263
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,119
I didn't understand it.

264
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,080
When I was reading at a younger age,

265
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,080
a farmer's proverb from our village

266
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,760
would always come to mind.

267
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,119
Seedling frame tall in the field

268
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,719
vines coiled by itself.

269
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,000
Under the regime of powerful forces,

270
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,679
the disadvantaged will be
suppressed and exploited.

271
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,039
At that time, I thought

272
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,719
the "Women's Analects"

273
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,200
is all about instructions
for the ladies.

274
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,159
In terms of morality, words,

275
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,520
appearance and power,

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
there are demands for
the ladies to follow.

277
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,280
But why

278
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,239
there aren't demands for men?

279
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,320
And we ladies

280
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,960
have to be like the vines
on the seedling frames

281
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,960
to be cooped up at one place?

282
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,599
I also heard that

283
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,840
in the past,

284
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,200
if a woman gives birth to a daughter,

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,359
she'll be given a spindle

286
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,359
to weave all day.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
If she gives birth to a boy,

288
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,719
she'll be given expensive jade

289
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,479
which represents her jade-like virtue.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,359
Spindle and jade

291
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,440
are of course non-comparable.

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,039
However, this goes on to show

293
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,039
the world's contempt for women.

294
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,200
My teacher, Liu Huaiying,
once taught us,

295
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,239
as a human,

296
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,039
we don't need to devote to everything,

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,200
but one must have high ambitions.

298
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,400
Teacher, what do you
mean by high ambitions?

299
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,799
Boys have their own high ambitions,

300
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,919
and girls

301
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,840
also have girls' high ambitions.

302
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,359
Just like my high ambition

303
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,080
is that you all will grow up quickly.

304
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,000
I know.

305
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,400
Boys and girls are both kids.

306
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,000
Boys can attend
the imperial exam in the future.

307
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,679
We girls can also do other things.

308
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I want to plant sweet potatoes

309
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,200
in the field with my father.

310
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,960
If I grow large, tasty sweet potatoes,

311
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,080
I'll be able to make a living.

312
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Isn't that right, teacher?

313
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,239
You're right.

314
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,359
Being poor

315
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,039
doesn't mean we forget
about our ambitions.

316
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
You all need to be like that as well.

317
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,799
Whether it's attending imperial exam

318
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,119
or growing sweet potatoes,

319
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,719
we need to look ahead

320
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,719
to score better in the imperial exam

321
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,239
and grow larger sweet potatoes.

322
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,960
Do you understand?

323
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,880
Yes.

324
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
You did a very good job today

325
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,200
as if you're really a teacher.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Congwen, you're making fun of me again.

327
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,159
I won't become a teacher.

328
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,559
I'm serious.

329
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,919
A teacher

330
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
must have

331
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
something they believe in.

332
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,280
All these years,

333
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,919
I've been to many places

334
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,919
looking for a belief.

335
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,679
I didn't find it,

336
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,000
but you did.

337
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
But I don't understand

338
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,520
what I'm going to be like in future.

339
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,280
These few days, Teacher Liu

340
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
told us to write about our future,

341
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,119
but I couldn't think of anything.

342
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,919
Especially after teaching here today,

343
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,320
in fact, I'm even more confused now.

344
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,200
Although, today

345
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
I talked about "Women's Analects",

346
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,280
if I

347
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,559
really come across
the problems in the books,

348
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,320
I might not be able to
think them through.

349
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,039
Just like

350
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,599
Zhao Xiaoqian and I.

351
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,679
We always worry or fear

352
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,159
over something that has yet happened.

353
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,640
However, future is
like this wheat field.

354
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,599
It may seem far

355
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,520
and vast,

356
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,919
without a direction.

357
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,119
But as you said,

358
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,479
a person's high ambition

359
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,479
doesn't have to be a clear goal.

360
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,560
Sometimes, as you walk down the road,

361
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,400
you'll find another path.

362
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,239
At a secluded temple made of bamboo,

363
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,920
I listen to the speeches
of Buddhist monks.

364
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,599
At the hall in winter season,

365
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,160
I play a game of chess with
the woodcutter for fun.

366
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,000
Wearing slippers made of hay,
I stride across shrubs

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
climb steep cliffs,
cross uneven terrains

368
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,719
in search for seclusion and beautiful
scenery of streams and rocks.

369
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,839
I can reach the furthest place.

370
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,719
When I arrive, I sit down,

371
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,760
have a chat and drink with friends
whom I haven't seen for so long

372
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,800
to get drunk.

373
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,400
When that happens,
I'll climb high and shout

374
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,199
and let the eye travel
over the great scenery.

375
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,359
When I go to sleep at night,

376
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,479
the dream will reflect the same.

377
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:33,959
Could it be...

378
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,520
Could it be

379
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,280
you're "Lunatic of Wild Dreams Hall"?

380
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,359
I have to thank you for this book.

381
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,839
Why?

382
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,800
To be honest,

383
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,760
actually, that day at
Mount Kunyan Temple,

384
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,119
I was going to bring my

385
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,719
broken scroll that no one cares about

386
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,199
to leave Wujiang Prefecture
and return to the capital.

387
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,199
Really?

388
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,000
Back then when I left home,

389
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
I was thinking

390
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,359
to lead the kind of
life I always wanted,

391
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,239
and never muddle with the affairs
of my father's generation.

392
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,319
However, after all these years,

393
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,160
I've somehow forgotten

394
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,479
my intention back then.

395
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,040
My long-time friend
parted ways with me,

396
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,839
and the manuscript I wrote with
passion was despised by others.

397
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,520
Sometimes, I even doubt

398
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,800
whether I chose the right path,

399
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,640
or should I turn around
and choose another?

400
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,040
Luckily...

401
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,319
Luckily, I have you by my side.

402
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,119
You read that book

403
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,479
and you understood it.

404
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,400
Sometimes, even one reader

405
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,880
will become the author's

406
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,280
motivation to keep going.

407
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,400
I'd never thought

408
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,839
I'm the one who made

409
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,319
"Lunatic of Wild Dreams Hall" stay.

410
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,479
I'm still waiting for you

411
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,760
to publish another book.

412
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
Teacher.

413
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,359
Greetings, teacher.

414
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,880
As long as someone by our side

415
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,760
is supporting us,

416
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,880
it'll give us utmost confidence

417
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,280
to move on.

418
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,839
You're that person.

419
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,119
But now,

420
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,239
I also have a friend

421
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,719
who wants to take a step forward,

422
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
but she's afraid of how
people will see her.

423
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,319
Congwen, do you think

424
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,760
I should help her?

425
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,800
What do you think?

426
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,560
Thank you, Congwen.

427
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
(Lonely Boat At Night, volume four)

428
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,319
Lady Xie.

429
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
What do you want?

430
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,400
The nourishment has
been sent to your house.

431
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,359
Is it not enough?

432
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,640
I am not here for that.

433
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,880
I came here to look for you.

434
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
My lady would like to meet you.

435
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
Why did you bring me here?

436
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,800
What exactly are you up to?

437
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,719
To show you something good, of course.

438
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:32,680
Go away.

439
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,079
So clumsy.

440
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:34,880
Wait on the side.

441
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,400
Sorry, sir.

442
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,280
I'm sorry.

443
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,800
Mother.

444
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,719
Didn't you say

445
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,640
His Highness isn't willing to marry me?

446
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,000
Today, I'll show you

447
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,359
even if His Highness isn't
willing to marry me,

448
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,880
you'll never become his wife.

449
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,880
Do you know

450
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,880
the imperial palace has agreed

451
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,239
to grant Hanchen and me marriage?

452
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,119
Someone,

453
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,119
pour me a cup of tea.

454
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:58,640
Coming!

455
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,839
Your tea is here.

456
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,119
What are you doing?

457
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,239
Lady.

458
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,640
You can't blame others
for certain matters

459
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,839
because Hanchen doesn't
belong to you in the first place.

460
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,800
Are you aware of his identity

461
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,599
and your identity?

462
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,319
Are you also aware that,

463
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,280
even without me,

464
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
there'll be someone else.

465
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,239
Commandery Princess of Julu

466
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,719
will never be someone
from your background.

467
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,319
You'll forever be a concubine,

468
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,719
a servant.

469
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,079
Your son

470
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,400
won't call you mother in the future,

471
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,839
and will instead call you nanny.

472
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,119
Your parents

473
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,640
will also be inferior to others.

474
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,880
You don't even know how to pour tea.

475
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,640
You peasant!

476
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,000
Mother.

477
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,359
Is staying in the inner courtyard
for the rest of your life

478
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,400
what you want?

479
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,640
For so many years,

480
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,719
that's what women have gone through.

481
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:47,839
What?

482
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,079
Do you think just because
Zhao Xiaoqian's in love with you,

483
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,880
he'll guarantee your safety?

484
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
Zhao Xiaoqian will take care of you,

485
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,839
but what about Princess Consort Pu,

486
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,599
Her Highness

487
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,079
or the imperial palace in the capital?

488
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Lady.

489
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
I...

490
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Is your hand all right?

491
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,359
I didn't do it on purpose.

492
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,880
Do you know who I am?

493
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,079
My lady is
the Commandery Princess Rong'an.

494
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,520
She'll marry
Commandery Prince of Julu in future

495
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,560
as his wife.

496
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,839
She isn't someone you can offend.

497
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,400
You're Lady Xie's mother.

498
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,599
I'm not mistaken, right?

499
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,239
It's my fault that
I failed to recognize you.

500
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,239
It's my fault.

501
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm really sorry.

502
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,199
What do we do with your hand?

503
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,560
In a royal or nobleman's family,
a concubine

504
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,119
is just a

505
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,880
doll.

506
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:40,880
Lady.

507
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:41,880
Here.

508
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,119
Take this.

509
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,640
When your lady is married
to Commandery Prince,

510
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,719
my daughter will need

511
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,959
your care.

512
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,280
My daughter is kind,

513
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,880
with no underhanded
tricks up her sleeve.

514
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,119
She won't cause trouble for you.

515
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,839
Please

516
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
don't make things difficult for her

517
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,520
and let her stay.

518
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,880
Did you see that?

519
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,199
You'll forever be

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,079
a concubine who's inferior to others.

521
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,920
Even your mother...

522
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,199
This slap

523
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,199
is for my mother.

524
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,719
And this slap is for me.

525
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,520
Lady.

526
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:12,479
(Tongzhou)
Duke Teng.

527
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,119
Good child.

528
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,560
Come and have a seat.

529
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,359
Have a seat.

530
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,680
So,

531
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,400
what brought you here today?

532
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
I'll cut to the chase then.

533
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,040
(Commandery Prince of Julu's letter)

534
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,000
I have a concubine

535
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,280
named Xie Xiaoman.

536
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,319
I'll bring her to meet you next time.

537
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
Lady Xie is gentle,
modest and courteous.

538
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,359
I want to help her get conferred
as Noble Lady Wuguo,

539
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
but people at Wujiang Prefecture
will gossip.

540
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,239
That's why I'm asking
for your help, Duke Teng.

541
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,880
Don't worry.

542
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't have tricks up my sleeve.

543
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,199
I just want the woman I love

544
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,000
to have a status.

545
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,359
I don't plan to marry again either.

546
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,040
Ladies

547
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,319
prefer to never be apart, right?

548
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,439
Duke Teng, if you will agree to it,

549
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,959
and Lady Xie also agrees to it.

550
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,920
Wife, kids and a warm bed.

551
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,719
I'll have everything.

552
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,680
I won't intervene

553
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,119
with what's going on in the capital.

554
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,319
It's fine if you like her,

555
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,640
but will she become your wife?

556
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,040
You know, for someone
with your identity,

557
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,560
you'll have a wife eventually.

558
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,560
Favoring the concubine and
doing away with the wife

559
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,560
are great taboos.

560
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,560
I know.

561
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,359
I won't get a wife.

562
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:39,920
Childish.

563
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,560
Even if you don't want a wife,

564
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,640
but will the Prince Pu's Mansion
allow it?

565
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,079
Will His Majesty allow it?

566
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,920
Do you plan to defy the imperial order?

567
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,640
If you insist on this,

568
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,040
it'll only do her harm.

569
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,359
I'll do anything

570
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,959
for her sake.

571
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,520
Even defying the imperial order?

572
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,599
You're muddle-headed.

573
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,040
Hanchen,

574
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,040
with the forthcoming battles
at Baichuankou,

575
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,079
are you really going to remain at

576
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,839
the tiny Wujiang Prefecture

577
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,520
as the sluggish prince
for the rest of your life?

578
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,280
May I ask

579
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,119
do you know

580
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,199
a lady called Ming Yue?

581
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,599
She lives nearby.

582
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,880
No.

583
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,560
You're looking for Ming Yue?

584
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,640
Yes.

585
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm her friend.

586
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,239
We know where she is.

587
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,040
Come on. Let's go.

588
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:43,400
Let's go.

589
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,920
Who are you people?

590
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,280
Let's go.

591
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,000
Who are you people?

592
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,260
(Zheng's Mansion)

593
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,920
Please let her go.

594
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,560
I'll do anything to repay your kindness.

595
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,959
Shut up.

596
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,560
We'll sort out with you later.

597
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,560
Xiaoman.

598
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,400
You're Xie Xiaoman?

599
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,199
You're Zheng Hai?

600
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,239
That's me.

601
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,719
I've long heard about you

602
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,439
and wanted to meet you this way.

603
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,319
Tell me.

604
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,520
If I slash your beautiful face

605
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,560
with a knife,

606
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,000
perhaps you won't be

607
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,959
so sharp-tongued?

608
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,599
What are you trying to do?

609
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

610
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,000
If it wasn't because of him,

611
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,359
my brother

612
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,959
won't be arrested
by the magistrate office

613
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,400
or set to be executed a week later.

614
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,920
I'm worried about my brother,

615
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,959
isn't that right?

616
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,599
You've got the wrong person.

617
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,319
I'm nothing

618
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,599
at the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

619
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,920
Zhao Xiaoqian won't risk himself for me.

620
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,400
Doing so

621
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
not only won't help your brother,

622
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,160
but bring then more troubles.

623
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,359
Xiaoman, I'm sorry.

624
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:09,680
Xiaoman, I'm sorry.

625
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,000
I brought this onto you.

626
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,479
Shut up, woman.

627
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,239
Inform the Commandery Prince's Mansion
to come and get the hostage tomorrow.

628
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,560
Xiaoman.

629
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,439
You knew he's going to kidnap me.

630
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,000
That's why you tried to approach me,
is that right?

631
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,040
I'm sorry.

632
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,920
I didn't know you'd come.

633
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,880
Come out quickly!

634
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,239
Search quickly! Hurry!

635
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,160
Search carefully!

636
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,340
(Lotus Garden)

637
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,119
She isn't here.

638
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,839
The front courtyard.

639
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,520
Search the front courtyard.

640
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,079
Okay.

641
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,839
Oh, right.

642
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,439
Did you ask Su Family?

643
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,520
Yes.

644
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,880
They said she wasn't
seen the entire night.

645
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,160
It must be Shen Family.

646
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,640
Shen Family must've harmed Lady Xie.

647
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,280
We've asked Shen Family.

648
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,359
They didn't see Lady Xie.

649
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,199
Ridiculous.

650
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,920
Shen Family must've kidnapped Lady Xie.

651
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,640
Mr. Liangji.

652
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,719
Mr. Liangji.

653
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,040
Someone said

654
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,560
she knows where the lady is.

655
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,239
Who is it?

656
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:35,959
Ming Yue?

657
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,719
Is my lady with you?

658
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm sorry.

659
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,719
It's my fault.

660
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,040
What's going on?

661
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,860
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

662
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,199
It's Zheng Hai.

663
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,800
Zheng Hai kidnapped Xiaoman

664
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,880
so he could threaten
Commandery Prince of Julu.

665
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,199
- Your Highness.
- You're back, Your Highness.

666
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,079
What did you just say?

667
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,239
It's Zheng Hai,

668
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,479
a local gangster at Xushui, Wazi.

669
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,319
He kidnapped Xiaoman

670
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,599
to exchange for terms with her life.

671
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,040
It's him?

672
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,640
Quickly inform Arms Instructor Qin.

673
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,640
Your Highness!

674
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,560
Your Highness mustn't go.

675
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,880
They're after Your Highness.

676
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,800
Let me tell you.

677
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,439
Zhao Xiaoqian will never come.

678
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,920
Just give up.

679
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,119
(Zheng's Mansion)
If Zhao Xiaoqian doesn't come,

680
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,839
you and I will have a
good time together.

681
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,719
I'm in need of a lady
to warm the bed, too.

682
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,640
Apart from you,

683
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,479
I still have other ways
to teach him a lesson.

684
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,900
(Zheng's Mansion)

685
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,439
You're here so quickly.

686
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
Zhao Xiaoqian, are you an idiot?

687
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,560
Why did you come here alone?

688
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:10,839
Say it.

689
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,000
What do I need to do
so you'll release her?

690
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,119
Now you're negotiating with me.

691
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:20,959
That day

692
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,280
when you stepped on me,

693
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,800
that's not how you spoke to me.

694
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,040
The tone I'm speaking now

695
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
isn't much better either.

696
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,680
If you act this way,

697
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
our deal

698
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,280
won't be so easy.

699
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,640
If it wasn't because of you,

700
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,319
my fellow brother won't be arrested

701
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:45,400
or set to be executed a week later.

702
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,000
If you want to save her,

703
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,680
the conditions now

704
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,199
are that I'll beat you up

705
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,959
and you'll get my brother back

706
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,800
uninjured

707
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,880
to exchange for her.

708
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:56,760
That's right.

709
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,040
Release Huang Liu.

710
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,640
If it wasn't you,

711
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,640
he wouldn't have been arrested.

712
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,640
Desertion is a capital offence.

713
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,719
The army has ironclad rules.

714
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,439
Justice is military law.

715
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,319
What's wrong with it?

716
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Huang Liu's mother passed away.

717
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,640
He went home for the funeral

718
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,839
which was later blamed by
his superior for desertion.

719
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,880
That's what you mean by justice?

720
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,839
A royal's life is life

721
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,040
and our commoners'

722
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,040
are nothing?

723
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,520
Xiaoman,

724
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,359
close your eyes.

725
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,640
I'll bring you home soon.

726
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Zhao Xiaoqian.

727
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,400
Come on.

728
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
What are you waiting for?

729
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,119
Hit him!

730
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,680
Hai!

731
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,280
Hai!

732
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,560
Hai, are you all right?

733
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,239
Hit him!

734
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:16,880
Hit him!

735
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,079
A bunch of useless people.

736
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,040
Stop!

737
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,000
Let's see who dare move an inch!

738
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,199
Bring them away!

739
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,439
Great.

740
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,119
Come on!

741
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:53,719
Not bad.

742
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,439
You terrible woman!

743
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:54,760
Let's go.

744
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,479
You betrayed me!

745
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,479
Your Highness, let's go.

746
00:33:59,079 --> 00:33:59,719
Xiaoman,

747
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,520
I'm sorry.

748
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,239
You should come with me, too.

749
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,840
Are you all right?

750
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,800
Does it hurt?

751
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,399
In the future,

752
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,399
don't do this on your own.

753
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,600
You have a husband.

754
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,840
I'll help you with everything.

755
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,879
I know you and that lady
are long-time friends,

756
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,199
but now she's been sent to prison.

757
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,639
Do you want to visit her?

758
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,900
(Prison)

759
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:35,560
Ming Yue.

760
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,719
Xiaoman.

761
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,239
Xiaoman,

762
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm sorry for lying to you.

763
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,239
I got you involved.

764
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,159
I'm sorry.

765
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,600
Yes,

766
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,479
it's your fault.

767
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,199
Because of you, my husband was injured,

768
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:57,919
I was kidnapped

769
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,199
and you're jailed.

770
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,479
But at the same time,

771
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,439
you've helped me.

772
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,080
Didn't you defy Zheng Hai

773
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,159
for my sake?

774
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,439
Also, you admitted

775
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,719
your wrongdoing to Zhao Xiaoqian.

776
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:19,959
I blame you,

777
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,800
but more than that,
I want you to be all right.

778
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm not here to seek revenge.

779
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,719
You left the lady at home

780
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,800
to come and meet us here.

781
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,199
Interesting.

782
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:03,760
Which camp is he in?

783
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,320
Third Commander of Shenwu Army,

784
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,639
Huang Liu, a scout under
General Meng Liang,

785
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,320
is here to greet Your Highness.

786
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,479
Shenwu Army is stationed at Gu City,

787
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,959
a part of Zhending Prefecture's
army camp.

788
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,399
It was once led by General Xu Zi.

789
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:26,919
Am I correct?

790
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,320
Yes.

791
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,159
Zhending Prefecture is
situated near our enemies.

792
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,919
Five years ago, there was
the battle at Heyuan.

793
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,280
There was a severe drought in Zhending

794
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,080
and the army lacked food supplies.

795
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,959
However, General Xu Zi

796
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,760
led the soldiers to fight
the enemy for three months

797
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,719
and killed 40,000 of the enemy.

798
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,639
More than 300 of their leaders
were captured as prisoners

799
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,159
along with 3,000 soldiers

800
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,199
and more than 10,000 weapons.

801
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,639
More importantly,

802
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:56,479
they took back Shun City

803
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,439
so the people didn't lose their homes.

804
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,320
Am I correct?

805
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,280
Yes.

806
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,479
Did you know

807
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,679
I've been dreaming of being
a soldier all my life

808
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,280
yet you

809
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,320
deserted.

810
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,320
No matter what,

811
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,120
the battle at Heyuan

812
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:24,959
was a significant battle of the nation.

813
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,800
I respect that.

814
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,479
A true man has nothing to hide.

815
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,760
I won't make things
difficult for you today,

816
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,439
but what lays before you

817
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,120
other than returning to Wazi
to keep on being a gangster,

818
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,320
there's also another way.

819
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,959
Huang Liu,

820
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,360
I'll give you one more chance.

821
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,840
General Xu's going to Zhending
again three months later.

822
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,080
You're allowed to join his army.

823
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,280
A man like you,

824
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,159
hiding your identity
in the black market at Wazi

825
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:03,479
and fighting with others every day.

826
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,239
If you have this kind of energy,

827
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,320
why not return to the battlefield

828
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,399
to carry out a man's duty?

829
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,159
Zheng Hai

830
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,159
doesn't fear power
for the sake of his brother.

831
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:17,919
He differentiates love from hatred.

832
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,879
However, he isn't aware
of the severity of his actions

833
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,439
and acts frivolously towards ladies.

834
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,879
After three years of conscription,

835
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,199
I'll also allow you to join the army

836
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,639
and go to the battlefield
with your comrades.

837
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,399
What do you think?

838
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,479
We wear gold armors to go
through hundreds of battles.

839
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,959
A sparrow cannot understand
the ambition of a swan.

840
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,679
If you two are swans,

841
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:48,239
then don't let me down.

842
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,719
If you're willing to join
General Xu's army,

843
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,479
toss your cup in an oath.

844
00:39:58,959 --> 00:39:59,719
I'm willing to go!

845
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,919
I, Zheng Hai,

846
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,479
have always done things
my own way since I was a kid.

847
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,479
