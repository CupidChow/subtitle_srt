(Studio of Artlessness)

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,919
I'm heading to Zhao Xiaoqian right now.

23
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,599
Do not tell anyone in the mansion

24
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,919
that I'm back.

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,559
Especially Zhu Momo.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,519
Lady Xie, how dare you return?

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,879
Clearly, you have no respect for me.

28
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,239
Servants.

29
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,440
Take Lady Xie away.

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,880
What are you doing?

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
What are you doing?

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,839
Squire Wang.

33
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,039
Squire Wang, you cannot go in there.

34
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,520
The courtesan isn't feeling well.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
Squire Wang.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Let me in.

37
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:24,479
Qiongqiong,

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,320
let Mr. Wang in.

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,880
Yes.

40
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:29,960
Yanniang.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,960
Yanniang.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,119
I was too rash before.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,440
I shouldn't have insulted Mr. Li.

44
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,039
I came just to talk to you

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
about your redemption.

46
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,639
I've been investigating.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,639
Mr. Li sought help from Duke Teng

48
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,559
to redeem your freedom.

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,839
However,

50
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,759
I'm afraid even Duke Teng
is unable to do so.

51
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,119
Yanniang, have you ever
thought about it?

52
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,679
You submitted your
petitions numerous times.

53
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,759
Why were your requests
constantly suppressed?

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,639
It isn't because you're disallowed to,

55
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,320
but it's because of Mr. Li.

56
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,720
If Mr. Li attempts to
redeem your freedom,

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,440
it would never work.

58
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,880
You don't need me to
tell you the reason,

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm sure you're aware.

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,240
Yanniang,

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,679
my feelings

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,119
for you are genuine.

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,880
I may not be educated,

64
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,479
but my family is affluent.

65
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,199
My wife passed away long ago.

66
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,919
All she left behind was
a son and a daughter.

67
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,320
I know

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,919
you dislike me because
I'm uneducated.

69
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,520
However, believe me.

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,759
My feelings for you are true.

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll definitely redeem your freedom.

72
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,679
I'll marry you

73
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,000
with a grand wedding.

74
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,919
Since ancient times,

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
weddings and funerals
hold significance.

76
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,559
I heard

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,399
what you had to say.

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,440
I'll think about it.

79
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
However, I'm not feeling well today.

80
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,960
Please return.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,440
Squire,

82
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,559
your carriage is here.

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,119
As long as it takes,

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,679
I'll wait for your good news.

85
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,359
Another man who
doesn't know his place.

86
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,079
Where's Congwen?

87
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,760
Where is he?

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,239
(About Courtesan Zhu's redemption,)

89
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,959
(I'm unable to help you.)

90
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:44,920
(My apologies.)

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,839
Yanniang.

92
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,359
What should I do?

93
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,119
If I recall it right,

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,959
yesterday, Lady Xie

95
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,839
insisted on returning home at all cost.

96
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,679
However, you intruded
the Commandery Prince's Mansion

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,559
and the Studio of Artlessness today.

98
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,760
What's wrong?

99
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,600
Is the Commandery Prince's
Mansion a place for you

100
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,600
to come and go as you please?

101
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,399
I was wrong for leaving
without permission.

102
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,559
However, I signed a contract
with the Commandery Prince.

103
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,760
As long as the contract remains,

104
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,239
I'm allowed to leave
whenever I want to.

105
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,160
If you're upset,

106
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm willing to receive punishment.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,040
Fine.

108
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:49,480
Since you're willing to be punished,

109
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
I will teach you

110
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,239
the rules of the capital.

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,799
Someone beats her.

112
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,000
Lady Xie's skin is tender.

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,480
The beating will leave her scarred.

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,600
Hit me instead.

115
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,559
It's my fault.

116
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,040
What fault do you have?

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
Everything is my fault.

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,679
Fine.

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Punish the both of them!

120
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,600
Get out of the way.

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,359
Please stop it!

122
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,359
Lady Xie!

123
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm begging you to stop!

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,320
Zhu Momo!

125
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,480
Please stop hitting her!

126
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,640
Hit her hard!

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,279
Please stop!

128
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,079
Hit her harder!

129
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,279
Please! I'm begging you to stop!

130
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,040
Zhu Momo, please stop hitting her!

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,799
She's being punished by Zhu Momo?

132
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,040
Hanchen,

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
you can't go.

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,200
I'll go instead.

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,600
Your Highness,

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,239
you can't be exposed to cold.

137
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,279
Hanchen.

138
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,079
Hanchen.

139
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,000
Your Highness.

140
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,359
You can't expose yourself
to cold right now.

141
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,480
I'm begging you to stop!

142
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,279
Zhu Momo, I'm begging you!

143
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,799
Please stop hitting her!

144
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,359
Go on!

145
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,600
Hit her harder!

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
Please!

147
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm begging you.

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,200
Please stop it.

149
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,480
Are you torturing Xie Xiaoman, Zhu Momo?

150
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,760
Princess Consort Pu sent me
to Your Highness' aid

151
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,239
to discipline

152
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,040
the Commandery Prince of Julu's Mansion.

153
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,839
Lady Xie

154
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,959
left the mansion without permission.

155
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
In regards to the rhino horn hairpin,

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,079
it's going to be another hassle.

157
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,720
Since Lady Xie entered the mansion,

158
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,959
she has never abided by the rules.

159
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,799
Because of that,

160
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,920
I exercised discipline.

161
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,000
Even at your father's presence,

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,799
there's nothing His Highness could say.

163
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,160
You brought my father up against me.

164
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,040
Your Highness.

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Since you are

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,079
establishing order for my mother,

167
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,119
I'm sure

168
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,239
I've violated order in many ways.

169
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,239
Zhu Momo,

170
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,799
I'm a man.

171
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,760
Hit me first

172
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,480
before you hit my woman.

173
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,760
Those who used the ruler,

174
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,840
those who held Xiaoman down,

175
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,000
those who hit her,

176
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,359
you know what to do.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,039
Punish yourselves as fit.

178
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,960
Thank you for saving
Lady Xie, Your Highness.

179
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,520
Put me down.

180
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,200
Shut up.

181
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,760
Where's the ointment?

182
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
Hurry up and fetch the medication.

183
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,159
What happened to His Highness?

184
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,919
His Highness drank some wine

185
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,919
out in the cold

186
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,520
and caught a cold.

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,880
Let's excuse ourselves.

188
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,799
Hold it.

189
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,880
Sit down.

190
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Remove your mantle.

191
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll apply the medication for you.

192
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,440
There's no need.

193
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,400
You fool.

194
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
We're husband and wife.

195
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,840
What are you ashamed of?

196
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,679
You're late from checking on me.

197
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,760
I haven't gotten a chance
to lecture you.

198
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
There's no need.

199
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Did you know I've seen it all?

200
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,679
Back then, you were
working at my mansion.

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,919
You helped me compile
the ways of a gentleman.

202
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,320
I followed you into the chambers

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,320
and you were getting
changed coincidentally.

204
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Why would I

205
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,799
order you to eat more after that?

206
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,559
It's because you're too skinny.

207
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,719
Silly girl.

208
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,320
I'll do it myself.

209
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,320
Don't worry.

210
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm not going to do anything to you.

211
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,159
I'll get your

212
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,320
attendant to apply
the ointment on your back.

213
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,159
I just

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,080
want to talk to you.

215
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,200
Go ahead.

216
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,039
I'm listening.

217
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,200
Last night, after you left,

218
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,039
I was consumed by remorse.

219
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
I had some wine to drink.

220
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,799
Shen Yan was irritating as usual.

221
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,080
I drank as much as I could.

222
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,559
He said, you took the hairpin

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
to the brothel.

224
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,640
I...

225
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
I do not blame you.

226
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,840
I know

227
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,159
you must have your reasons.

228
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,080
I just

229
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,280
had dreams of the past.

230
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,880
You know

231
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,640
how much Xingzhou overthinks.

232
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,880
It's inappropriate to bring it up.

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,200
Forget about Zhu Momo and the rest.

234
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,679
They'd never understand anyway.

235
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,520
That's why I thought,

236
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,280
perhaps...

237
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,960
I understand.

238
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,159
I had a dream last night.

239
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,400
It was about my brother.

240
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,559
Before meeting you,

241
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,200
I'd always dream of
the snowy days in the capital.

242
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,159
I'd dream of the great palace walls.

243
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,960
Snow was gathered on the rims.

244
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,159
I was only seven or
eight years old then.

245
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,239
Brother was concerned that I'd be bored.

246
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,799
So, he took me

247
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,919
to fly kites by the palace walls.

248
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,280
Look.

249
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,080
How could a feeble kite

250
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,559
fly so high?

251
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,159
Did you know?

252
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,440
After the Qixi Festival,

253
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
comes my brother's birthday.

254
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,359
Principal Yang once said,

255
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,359
my brother and I are
completely different.

256
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,440
Both of us entered the palace together.

257
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,719
My brother was reliable,

258
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,440
and I was stubborn.

259
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,239
Everyone thought

260
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:55,359
my brother would emerge
as the next Emperor.

261
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,960
I've never thought of

262
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,400
competing with my brother anyway.

263
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,239
All I wanted

264
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,119
was after my brother
becomes the Emperor,

265
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,599
I'll head to the borders

266
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,960
and protect the state for my brother.

267
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,559
Unfortunately,

268
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,280
I was exiled from the capital.

269
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,400
Even worse,

270
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,239
he no longer exists.

271
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,559
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,440
I lied yesterday.

273
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,080
I did not return to my uncle's house.

274
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,880
I lost the hairpin

275
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,840
because I went to learn
Bian Embroidery

276
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,760
from Courtesan Zhu.

277
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,520
Minggu is grounded.
I wanted to help her,

278
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,440
but

279
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,799
I was afraid you'd reveal this.

280
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,000
The incident with Minggu
would be disclosed.

281
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,880
I dare not tell you that
I went to the brothel

282
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
because I didn't want to enrage you.

283
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,159
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,280
I didn't know you caught a cold.

285
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,159
You were troubled to
stand up for me just now.

286
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,919
Yesterday, I was telling Minggu

287
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,599
how I wish I could hate you.

288
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,760
However, you treat me with kindness.

289
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't bring myself to hate you.

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,119
How can I bring myself to hate you?

291
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,239
As for the Bian Embroidery you need,

292
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,359
I'll order Liangji to have it done.

293
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,520
Get a goodnight's rest tonight.

294
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,239
We shall celebrate Qixi Festival
at the streets tomorrow.

295
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,159
We will stroll through
Xiangqiao and guess riddles.

296
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:28,880
All right?

297

Are there any news

00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,359
about my redemption?

307
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't worry.

308
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,760
Duke Teng has yet to reply me.

309
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,839
It should happen soon.

310
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,359
Did you do this yourself?

311
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,479
All right.

312
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,239
It's the Qixi Festival.

313
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,319
You may go.

314
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,800
However, keep this in mind.

315
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:58,560
Just because

316
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,199
you're the heir of Su Chang Ji,

317
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,760
you can't act like you're above order.

318
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,760
I understand.

319
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,640
This time,

320
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,800
if it wasn't for Yan Boyang's kindness

321
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,800
to keep this incident hidden,

322
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,880
you'd be in deep trouble.

323
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,359
Mother, don't worry.

324
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,280
I'll behave like a respectable lady.

325
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,280
You're one sweet-talker.

326
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:17,760
Go

327
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,079
and show me the spider web.

328
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,079
I'll go.

329
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,640
The web is made exquisitely.

330
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,839
Minggu,

331
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,119
you're in luck.

332
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,719
All right.

333
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,239
You may pack up and go have fun.

334
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
Remember to bring attendants with you.

335
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,199
Do not get into trouble.

336
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,839
All right, mother.

337
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,119
Let me show you something.

338
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,520
Let's go.

339
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,500
(Qixi Lantern Temple Fair)

340
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,640
May my parents be blessed
with great health.

341
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,359
May my brother's civil
examination proceed smoothly.

342
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,599
May Congwen be
filled with happiness.

343
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,800
No harm may come to Hanchen.

344
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,199
May he live in peace for life.

345
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,839
Make way.

346
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,640
Boss.

347
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,359
How many scores in order
to win the white rabbit lantern?

348
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,640
Three.

349
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,439
I'm playing the first round.

350
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,180
(Arrow-throwing)

351
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,959
Another one.

352
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,959
Mr. Jiang threw a hazelnut.

353
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,119
The second place.

354
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,239
The second place.

355
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,479
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

356
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,599
Thank you.

357
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,280
Mr. Niu will fail.

358
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,959
You will have to retake
the examinations.

359
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,479
Mr. Zhong threw a longan.

360
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,800
You're going to emerge
as the principal graduate.

361
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,959
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

362
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,199
Come on.

363
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:18,880
Predict my fortune, too.

364
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,319
Predict my fortune.

365
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:19,880
Here.

366
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,880
Boyang did not show up.

367
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,000
Forget about him.

368
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,119
Xiaoman and her friends are here.

369
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,719
Let's go.

370
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,199
All right.

371
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,280
Zhao Xiaoqian.

372
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,640
Let's check out the fish lantern.

373
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,560
Let's go.

374
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:46,599
Come on.

375
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,439
Why aren't we joining them?

376
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,119
Minggu needs to talk to Zhong Ziyan.

377
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,359
We shouldn't interrupt.

378
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,880
Do you want to

379
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,640
take a walk at the bridge?

380
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,439
Do you enjoy watching
the fish lanterns?

381
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,119
I enjoy looking at

382
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,520
bright, flickering objects.

383
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,040
Back at Yuyangli Village,

384
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,599
I love looking at the stars.

385
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,880
Previously, Mr. Liangji said,

386
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,400
every year, Wujiang Prefecture

387
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,319
would light fireworks
during the Lantern Festival.

388
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,239
Fellow noble households
would compete

389
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,680
to see whose fireworks
were the prettiest.

390
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,119
Does that mean you enjoy fireworks?

391
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,640
The fishes are intriguing.

392
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,359
Don't they resemble the great fish,
Kun, we saw

393
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,599
back at Mount Kunyan Temple?

394
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,800
Give me a moment.

395
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,560
I'll be back soon.

396
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,719
Don't go.

397
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,079
What's wrong?

398
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,760
(Qixi Lantern Temple Fair)

399
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,880
Just now, you prayed to Kui Xing

400
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,359
and earned the principal graduate.

401
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,599
I don't believe in superstition.

402
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,839
I was just joking around.

403
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,359
Courtesan Zhu.

404
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,160
Courtesan Zhu.

405
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,280
Slow down. I'm not going anywhere.

406
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,520
Here's the intelligence I copied.

407
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,599
It's all written in it.

408
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,319
Will Congwen be all right?

409
00:24:59,199 --> 00:24:59,959
He will be fine.

410
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,719
Don't worry.

411
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,000
He will remain as your senior.

412
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:04,959
That's good.

413
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,160
Also,

414
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,040
please do not tell him about
the incident today.

415
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:10,920
He helped me a lot.

416
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,520
This is the least I could do.

417
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Xiaoman.

418
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,199
Are you in love with
the Commandery Prince?

419
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,199
Many marriages are arranged.

420
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,599
Love doesn't mean anything.

421
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,400
You don't have to feel guilty about it.

422
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:39,119
What about Congwen?

423
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,599
You always do your best
to help him and rescue him.

424
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,640
You don't want him to know either.

425
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,400
What are

426
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,040
your feelings for him?

427
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,520
To Congwen,

428
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,599
I only...

429
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Whatever it is,

430
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,119
you don't have to tell me.

431
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,319
I overstepped my bounds.

432
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

433
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,680
It seems like you do not
have feelings for me.

434
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,119
I...

435
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,920
You returned

436
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
for the intelligence.

437
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,040
That's not true.

438
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,800
Did you know?

439
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,560
I,

440
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,680
Zhao Xiaoqian,

441
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,599
have never tried so hard

442
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,040
to win a woman's heart.

443
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,040
You don't want anything to do with it.

444
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,439
Zhao Xiaoqian.

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,319
(On the night of Qixi Festival,
6th year of Fengheng,)

446
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,640
(the fireworks of Wujiang Prefecture
were magnificent.)

447
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,719
(They resembled the stars)

448
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,800
(I saw back at Yuyangli Village.)

449
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,280
(Do I love him?)

450
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:13,800
(I...)

451
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,439
(Zhao Xiaoqian,)

452
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,359
(thank you for all that
you've done for me.)

453
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,280
(I'm sorry.)

454
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,760
(I'm sorry.)

455
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,359
The fireworks

456
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,599
are beautiful.

457
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,439
Yes.

458
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,199
They are beautiful.

459
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,959
By the way,

460
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
what was it that you wanted to ask?

461
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,199
Nothing.

462
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,479
If there's nothing else,

463
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,719
I shall return to my books.

464
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,359
The civil examinations are near.

465
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,599
I have no time to waste.

466
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,319
I refuse to accept this.

467
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,599
Another round.

468
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,920
All right.

469
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,959
Sister.

470
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,040
This is for you.

471
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,439
Let's go.

472
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:26,920
What's going on?

473
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,839
He didn't even hit a single one.

474
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,239
He played for a long time

475
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,160
and couldn't even score a single one.

476
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,280
Let's go.

477
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,439
What do you think?

478
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,319
Sir,

479
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,719
would you like to try again?

480
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,520
Yanniang.

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,959
What are you doing here?

482
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:03,760
Did you send Xiaoman

483
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,000
to retrieve intelligence from
the Commandery Prince's mansion?

484
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,199
I...

485
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,119
I'm just doing this for your own good.

486
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,359
Have you ever considered that

487
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,640
she's a concubine of
the Commandery Prince's mansion?

488
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,239
If she makes a mistake,
and the prince finds out,

489
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:21,920
she'd be severely punished.

490
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,520
Regardless of her explanation,

491
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
none will suffice.

492
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,640
Yanniang.

493
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,719
Since when have you become

494
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,359
someone so unethical?

495
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,839
What about you?

496
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:35,520
Have you ever wondered

497
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,599
why would I resort to such method?

498
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,599
All you care about are
doctrines and loyalty.

499
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,719
If you didn't,
I will not have to stain my hands.

500
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,839
Refusing to help one in trouble

501
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,400
is not the way of a gentleman.

502
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,760
Is keeping one in the dark from truth

503
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,680
your way of a gentleman?

504
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
You knew beforehand.

505
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,439
Duke Teng is unable to
help redeem my freedom.

506
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,560
You still lied.

507
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,400
Why did you lie to me?

508
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,640
I don't need your lies!

509
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:07,800
Yanniang.

510
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,380
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

511
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,280
No.

512
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,719
Without Lady Xie's permission,

513
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,319
no one may take our belongings.

514
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,560
Drag her away.

515
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,400
Stop it.

516
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,400
Zhu Momo.

517
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,439
This is the Lotus Garden.

518
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,479
They are trying to
enter your chambers

519
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,359
to seize your possessions

520
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,479
and your dowries.

521
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,839
You're but a mere student.

522
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,599
How many dowries
could you possibly own?

523
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,959
Why are you trying to seize

524
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,319
my possessions?

525
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,880
The rhino horn hairpin
given by His Highness

526
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,599
is a tribute bestowed
by the Emperor.

527
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,119
You can't just leave it
in someone else's keepsake.

528
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,560
If this goes out,

529
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,800
no matter how fearless

530
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,760
you are,

531
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,800
the Commandery Prince's Mansion
cannot afford the embarrassment.

532
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,599
Zhu Momo.

533
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,640
Although I'm but a concubine,

534
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,160
despite one's status, we're all humans.

535
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,959
Without His Highness' permission,

536
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,280
you led people over

537
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,359
to harass me in public.

538
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,680
Are you trying to embarrass
Commandery Prince

539
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,000
or are you casting me out?

540
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:20,920
You...

541
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,319
Well,

542
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,079
you're an old trustee
of Princess Consort Pu.

543
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,680
You have all the support you need.

544
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,040
The majority of my possessions

545
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,599
were granted by His Highness.

546
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,599
If you insist on seizing them,

547
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,839
I can't stop you.

548
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,640
However, if you lay a finger
on my family's endowment,

549
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,239
the court

550
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,280
will serve the justice I deserve.

551
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,319
Let's go.

552
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,560
How atrocious.

553
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,160
This brat

554
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,079
has gotten cunning.

555
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,359
How did I do?

556
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,199
Did I do well?

557
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:09,920
Yes.

558
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,640
You finally stood up for yourself.

559
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,119
It's my fault after all.

560
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,880
Life will be harsher
for me in the mansion.

561
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,719
Even if they decide to divorce me,

562
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,359
I have nothing to say.

563
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,640
On the contrary,

564
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,079
you should stop opposing them.

565
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,839
Do you understand?

566
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,839
What's going on, Lady Xie?

567
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,160
His Highness left early in the morning

568
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,359
without waiting for you.

569
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,760
Did you guys get into a fight?

570
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:41,880
No.

571
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,280
Everything is fine.

572
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,119
Anyway,

573
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,239
no matter what happens,

574
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,520
I'll not allow you to suffer.

575
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,040
Let's go.

576
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,839
Xiaoman.

577
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,040
Hurry and come with me.

578
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,879
Bad news.

579
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,280
Congwen, it seems like

580
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,840
you're pretty involved
in the affairs of my household.

581
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,919
Are you the Prince Li of the palace

582
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,800
or are you an investigating censor
of the court,

583
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,679
Lord Li?

584
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,439
I'm your senior.

585
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,320
Since I'm your senior,

586
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,239
everything has an order.

587
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,040
I'm obligated to teach you

588
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,199
the right and wrong

589
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,520
of the way of a gentleman.

590
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Do you see me as a gentleman?

591
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,479
Zhao Xiaoqian.

592
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,679
This is Wujiang, not the capital.

593
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,760
Since it's Wujiang,

594
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,760
nobody can order me around!

595
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,159
Listen to me.

596
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,840
She's just a plaything to me.

597
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,159
Even if I sell her off for three cash

598
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,520
just for fun,

599
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,080
what can you do?

600
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:02,719
Gentleman?

601
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,239
Since Your Highness have
made up your mind,

602
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,360
three cash, right?

603
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,040
Xiaoman of Xie Family,

604
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,520
it would be an honour for me to buy her.

605
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:18,399
This is bad.

606
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,719
Selling her to you?

607
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,919
Although she's just a plaything,

608
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,560
you've overestimated

609
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,040
how generous I am.

610
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,719
I would rather sell
her off to a peasant.

611
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,879
I would never sell her to you.

612
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,159
Do you understand?

613
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,280
Three cash.

614
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,639
I'll sell Xie Xiaoman to you.

615
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:56,080
Bring the money and
collect her tomorrow.

616
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,760
But...

617
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:57,239
But I...

618
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,040
Cut the crap.

619
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,919
I'm giving you a toy for free.
Quit the yapping.

620
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,679
Zhao Xiaoqian!

621
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,760
I'm going to sell you off!

622
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,919
What are you going to do about it?

623
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,639
Are you done?

624
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,840
Principal Yang would like
to see all of you.

625
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:51,120
(Principal Office)
Xie Xiaoman signed an agreement with me.

626
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,040
I can sell her off as I please.

627
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,159
It has nothing to do with you.

628
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,760
Xie Xiaoman is not only your concubine,

629
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,719
she's also a student of Bailu Academy.

630
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,840
You did a pretty good job.

631
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:03,919
You stuck

632
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,280
your nose into the student's household.

633
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,639
I have no say in the affairs
of your household.

634
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,879
Your Highness is selling her,

635
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
I only seek to purchase.

636
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:12,919
I didn't do anything wrong.

637
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:13,760
You want to purchase her?

638
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,399
Who do you think you are?

639
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:20,800
Bailu Academy has taught
for many years.

640
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,600
We cultivated plenty of talents.

641
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,439
We produced officers
that served the court,

642
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,040
and benefactors that aided the people.

643
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,919
We produced many individuals
who shared the burdens

644
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,719
of the common folks.

645
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,320
What about you?

646
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,719
What are you fighting for?

647
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,639
The weather has turned warm recently.

648
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm of old age.

649
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:49,719
I constantly reminisced in the past.

650
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,280
During summer back at the palace,

651
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,919
Xiaojie was brewing tea.

652
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,600
Hanchen, you were playing by the pool.

653
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,719
Those were rare relaxation.

654
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,239
Xiaojie's birthday

655
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
is in a few days.

656
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:08,360
That almost slipped my mind.

657
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,159
Do not mention him.

658
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,679
On the year of Xiaojie's death,

659
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,600
I taught you about the way of tea.

660
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,239
I taught you about broad-mindedness.

661
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,879
As the tea boils, the foam
should be as light as snow.

662
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,719
As one pours, it should
flow like the surging waterfall.

663
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,080
Its fragrance evokes
one to ask for more.

664
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,840
One shall sit by and watch
as the sun rises and falls.

665
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,239
You grasped the way of tea
very well when you were young.

666
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,159
You seem confused now.

667
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,439
When there is supply, there is demand.

668
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,439
Congwen would like to
purchase at a bargain.

669
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,919
A gentleman is broad-minded.

670
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,080
You should sell her to him.

671
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,320
What do you say?

672
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,719
I said, do not mention him.

673
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,679
Both of you went on

674
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:53,639
about selling and buying.

675
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,239
None of you considered my feelings.

676
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,719
Yes.

677
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,919
I may be Your Highness' concubine,

678
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,919
but I'm a person.

679
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm not an object.

680
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:06,360
I'm not one to be sold
and bought easily,

681
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,439
or abandoned casually.

682
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,760
Do not forget, Your Highness.

683
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:14,439
Our contract comes with an expiry term.

684
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,719
You may treat me as a plaything,

685
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,040
but I cannot

686
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,439
treat myself as one.

687
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,080
I'm a student of the academy,

688
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:28,840
and a student of yours, Principal Yang.

689
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,439
I'm in a predicament,

690
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,000
I plead for your help.

691
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,120
Who do you think you are

692
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,199
trying to ask for the principal's help?

693
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,159
Do you excel in your studies

694
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,919
or have you earned
honourary titles in civil affairs?

695
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,239
Did you pass the civil examination
and earned a title?

696
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,760
What's wrong?

697
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Your Highness, do you think

698
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,239
only men deserve to study?

699
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,679
Only men deserve the identity
as a student?

700
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,199
Principal,

701
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,600
the polo tournament is commencing

702
00:39:58,919 --> 00:39:59,600
in five days.

703
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,679
Your Highness, since you think

704
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,080
I do not deserve to study here,

705
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,320
I shall prove

706
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,439
that although I'm a lady,

707
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,159
I'm going to attain first place

708
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:18,919
both in literature and martial arts.

709
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,439
I'm willing to participate

710
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:22,919
in the polo tournament.

711
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,919
If I obtain a good grade,

712
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,320
please help me redeem my freedom.

713
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,560
I beg for your approval, Principal Yang.

714
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,280
Xie Xiaoman.

715
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,560
Fine.

716
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,840
Since the ladies of Jingnv Pavilion

717
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,439
deem the polo tournament important,

718
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,919
I suggest for you to take it seriously,
Principal Yang.

719
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,360
I'm willing to help you

720
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,399
in training the ladies
of Jingnv Pavilion

721
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,840
with polo.

722
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:53,919
Principal.

723
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:54,800
Since there's a test,

724
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,919
allow all of us to participate.

725
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,280
Let's see if you'd win

726
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,320
or I would.

727
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,360
See you

728
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,399
on the horse five days later.
