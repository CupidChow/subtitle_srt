1
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,558
They're coming.
That's it, they're near!

2
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,934
Alright!

3
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,949
Oh! Shit! I told you so!

4
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,107
Alright!

5
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,960
Shit! How unlucky!

6
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,695
So, what now?

7
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,695
You're so slow!

8
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,784
I told you, that kid
of yours is useless.

9
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,619
That bastard just got lucky.

10
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:00,995
You just have bad luck.

11
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:02,931
- Is this complete?
- Yes.

12
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,459
Oh, well.

13
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:08,762
Oh, how about that?

14
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,271
You won again.

15
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,524
That's a given!

16
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,842
You doubted me?

17
00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:15,741
Who said I doubted you?

18
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:17,899
Here's more.

19
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,231
You're really cool, man.

20
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,271
This is great.

21
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:22,338
That's complete.

22
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:23,733
Nothing more,

23
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,051
nothing less.

24
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,287
- Here's yours.
- Oh!

25
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,338
Nice!

26
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:30,532
- I can buy softdrinks now.
- Here's more.

27
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:31,793
- Anyways,
- Thank you, man.

28
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,840
I'll go ahead.

29
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:34,506
Already?

30
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:35,969
- Where are you going?
- Yes!

31
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,136
I've still got to drive Mona, stupid.

32
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,451
Wow. Drive Mona?

33
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:41,561
Don't lie to me.

34
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:44,256
After riding your tricycle like that,

35
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,772
I'm sure a chick's riding
you hard next, huh?

36
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:49,299
What are you saying?
I need to go.

37
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:51,417
Man, I can't help but ask.

38
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:53,163
Who will you go to first?

39
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,837
Is it Rayda?

40
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,241
Mona?

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Or Bhe?

42
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,177
- Huh?
- All of them.

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,264
Shit! You're something else!

44
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,262
That's why you're my idol.

45
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,513
- Yeah, yeah.
- Take care.

46
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:09,414
Oh, well.

47
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:11,744
I can buy softdrinks now.

48
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,059
How about you, losers?

49
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,833
I'll go ahead.

50
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,173
Better luck next time.

51
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:23,651
Hello?

52
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,263
Yes. I'm on my way.

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,748
I'm just waiting for my service.

54
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,831
Just wait for a bit.

55
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,545
Stupid, he's not my boyfriend.

56
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,406
Why would I date a tricycle driver?

57
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,843
Oh? He's not even my type.

58
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,720
Huh? Fine, okay. Bye!

59
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,847
Can you come with me inside?

60
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,984
I forgot something.

61
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,189
Okay.

62
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,876
Let's go?

63
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,069
Let's go.

64
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:40,184
Okay, you can go.

65
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,354
I'm late already.

66
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,637
That's a total of 315 pesos, Ms. Loli.

67
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,820
Thank you.

68
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,349
By the way,

69
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:15,085
isn't your husband
working in Dubai?

70
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,278
Yes, why?

71
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:20,016
My son just got
accepted there, too.

72
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,921
You remember Leo?

73
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,811
I hope they get to see each other.

74
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,239
I hope so too.

75
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,061
Here's your change, Ms. Loli.

76
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:29,384
- Thank you.
- Thank you also.

77
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,478
Hi, Bhe.

78
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:39,503
Hello!

79
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,093
You're so naughty.

80
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,168
There are no customers.
Close the shop already.

81
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:54,945
Stop it.

82
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,697
Just close the shop.
Let's go.

83
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,742
Oh, here.

84
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,714
Additional cash for today.

85
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:42,494
Bhe, you're always so kind to me.

86
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:43,548
Oh, please.

87
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,252
Let's make the most of it.

88
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,838
My husband is coming home soon.

89
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:48,551
When he arrives,

90
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:49,933
we'll stop, okay?

91
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,119
Let's see,

92
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,654
if you can.

93
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,679
Just go.

94
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,164
Bye.

95
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,236
Oh?

96
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,496
Perfect timing.

97
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:57,936
Stop it.

98
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,394
Stop it.

99
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,491
Can you wait?

100
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:02,765
I'm about to be late.

101
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,834
I'll get told off again by Domeng.

102
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,250
That can wait.

103
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,860
I'm running late.

104
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,895
So good.

105
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,918
Oh! Thank you, Domeng!

106
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,415
You're late again.

107
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,900
It looks like your ride
is a bit slow nowadays.

108
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,654
Oh, I took care of
something at home,

109
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,481
so, what can I do?

110
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,203
Is that so?
Okay, just go inside.

111
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:08,934
You, get lost.

112
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:11,370
Your tricycle is blocking the way.

113
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Wow!

114
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:14,016
Wow!

115
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,389
Is this yours?

116
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:17,020
Are you the owner of the bar?

117
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:19,189
Maybe you're forgetting,

118
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:20,950
that you're just a bouncer.

119
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:21,976
Do you wanna try me?

120
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,002
Come here!

121
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:24,808
Hey! What's going on?
Both of you stop it.

122
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,616
Talk to your bouncer
about his attitude.

123
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:31,268
He acts as if he owns this bar.

124
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,115
Screw you! You talk too much.
Get down from there!

125
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,715
- What the-
- That's enough!

126
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:36,426
Marco, just leave.

127
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,854
Leave!

128
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,314
- What?
- You got lucky.

129
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,258
- Come on.
- Your time will come!

130
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:43,185
Stop it.

131
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:53,587
Marco is such an asshole.

132
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,795
Are you jealous again?

133
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:04,389
Why would I be jealous?

134
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:08,282
Because you know
that Rayda likes him.

135
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,388
Forget about them,

136
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,766
I'll take care of you instead.

137
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,463
Damn, man.

138
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,924
Domeng is really out to get me.

139
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:47,416
If I don't hold back,

140
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,234
I'll really fight that asshole.

141
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:50,892
What? Calm down!

142
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,225
Just stay calm, man.

143
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,933
He's just jealous of you.

144
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:55,492
How could he not be?

145
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,955
You're badass.

146
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,323
You don't just ride tricycles,

147
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:00,985
you also ride women.

148
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:03,375
Bro, it's just me.

149
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,770
Leave some for me, man.

150
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,045
- It's always you-
- Excuse me.

151
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,056
Where can I get a ride
going to Santa Rosa?

152
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,749
Oh, you can ride with me.

153
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:11,774
Let's go.

154
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:14,614
Okay, but I need
someone who drives fast.

155
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,932
I'm in a rush.

156
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,272
Oh, really?

157
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:19,216
If you need someone
who drives fast,

158
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,959
that's him.

159
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,060
Okay,

160
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,170
but can we go now?

161
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,676
I'm in a hurry.

162
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:26,590
Hey, man.

163
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,219
- She's all yours.
- Oh.

164
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,276
Ah, Miss.
Where are we going?

165
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:31,476
Santa Rosa.

166
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,827
Ah, okay. Come on.

167
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:33,968
Over here.

168
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,390
Take care.

169
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,477
Man.

170
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:45,065
- Man, move aside.
- Wait!

171
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:46,241
Hurry.

172
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,131
- Take care.
- Thank you, man.

173
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,099
She could've been my passenger.

174
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,862
Just drop me off there.

175
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:32,607
Can you wait for me a bit?

176
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:35,365
I'll just do something
inside then we'll leave.

177
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:36,712
Okay, miss.

178
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:38,652
- I'll stay here.
- Okay.

179
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,752
I won't leave you.

180
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,716
Miss, let me take care of that.

181
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:02,916
No, I can handle this.

182
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,898
Ah, Miss. Are we
going somewhere else?

183
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,943
Just straight ahead.

184
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,610
Okay.

185
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:36,285
- Oh, Miss.
- Let's go back to the restaurant.

186
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:37,614
Oh, okay.

187
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,441
What's this?

188
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:08,241
Oh, that?

189
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:10,695
I've been learning about flowers,

190
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:14,061
because my mom is
a florist in Casiguran.

191
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,429
When I return home,

192
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:22,499
I should have memorized all the flowers.

193
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,023
Come on.

194
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,619
- Hi, babe.
- Damn you!

195
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:30,687
Mona, who is that?

196
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:32,454
It's okay.
Don't be shy.

197
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,521
Why is he here?

198
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,731
It's just Patrick,

199
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,941
my playmate.

200
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,567
What the hell are
you talking about?

201
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,568
You're so slow!

202
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,028
Don't you want to
have a threesome?

203
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:41,946
Patrick's kind,

204
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,876
handsome but weak
when it comes to sex,

205
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,878
that's why I want
you to teach him.

206
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:48,363
Wait.

207
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:49,490
Come on.

208
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,383
Marco, you can go now.

209
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,934
I'll just call you
when I need a ride.

210
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:17,590
Wow.

211
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,402
You treat me like I'm your dog.

212
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,878
What did you expect?

213
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,334
I want a tricycle
driver as a boyfriend?

214
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:25,743
That's embarrassing!

215
00:33:29,164 --> 00:33:30,999
You're too harsh.

216
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,177
What do you think of me?

217
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:35,073
An item?

218
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,907
Something you will
just use when needed?

219
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:38,616
My gosh!

220
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,226
You're so sensitive!

221
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,191
We're just playing, right?

222
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,189
- Screw you!
- Go ahead. Bye!

223
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,667
Hi, babe!

224
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,625
Hi, Marco!

225
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,538
Your ride looks like shit, Rayda.

226
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,172
You should be going
home with me instead.

227
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,133
That's nothing compared to my motorcycle.

228
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:13,009
You're so full of yourself, boss.

229
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,468
- Hey...
- What did you say?

230
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:16,440
- Are you deaf?
- Oh my god.

231
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,248
I said,

232
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,740
you're so full of yourself, boss.

233
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:22,266
You're such an asshole, aren't you?

234
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:23,709
- Screw you!
- Screw you too!

235
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:25,421
- What? What?
- Hey.

236
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:26,656
You asshole!

237
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:27,969
Damn you both!

238
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:29,037
Stop it, both of you!

239
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,095
- Screw him.
- Damn you!

240
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:33,464
Let's go home.

241
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,295
Your day will come!

242
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,675
- You too, fucker!
- Hey!

243
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,736
Stop it! We're leaving.

244
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:39,911
- We're leaving.
- Your day will come!

245
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:40,936
Just you wait!

246
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,524
- What?
- I don't want a fight.

247
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,572
Cut it out.

248
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:51,570
- Hey!
- Damn it!

249
00:34:51,604 --> 00:34:52,930
- Get down! Come on!
- Stop it!

250
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:55,151
Damn it! Fine!
Stab him! Beat him!

251
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,803
- Come here, now!
- Why can't you both stop?

252
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,816
He's so full of himself!

253
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,198
Go ahead, try me!

254
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,616
- Get down from there!
- Stop it!

255
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:01,758
Damn you both!

256
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,310
You have no shame!

257
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:16,367
- You'll have your day!
- Stop!

258
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,903
Who does he think he is?
Asshole.

259
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,575
Ah, Miss.
Porridge, please.

260
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:29,839
Oh!

261
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:31,054
Are you available now?

262
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,221
Of course!
Where are we going?

263
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:34,308
On the other side of town again.

264
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,485
Just be fast, I'm in a hurry.

265
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,733
Okay, let's go. Come on.

266
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:39,356
Ah miss, cancel my order.

267
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:40,548
Love you!

268
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,503
Come on.

269
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,682
Ah Miss, I'll take
care of that for you.

270
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:03,707
No. I can do it.

271
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:04,846
Oh, okay.

272
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,114
Ah, Miss, will we
go somewhere else?

273
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:08,641
Ah, no.

274
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,560
Just drop me off
at the restaurant.

275
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,392
Let's meet at the same
time tomorrow there.

276
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:14,445
What?

277
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,722
Can you be my regular service?

278
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,755
I need someone who
can drive fast like you.

279
00:36:20,104 --> 00:36:22,138
Okay, Miss! Thank you!

280
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:23,991
Don't call me miss,

281
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,183
just call me Lucy instead.

282
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:26,704
Marco.

283
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,083
Let's go!

284
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:29,500
Okay, let's go now.

285
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Damn, man.

286
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,869
You have a new regular.

287
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:11,749
Is she okay?

288
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,439
Yeah.

289
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:16,500
Aside from being pretty,

290
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:17,980
she's also kind,

291
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:20,103
and gives huge tips.

292
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:22,398
Wow.

293
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:23,918
Is it actual tips?

294
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:26,353
What kind of tips does she give?

295
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:28,757
Does it taste good?

296
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,707
Damn this jackass.

297
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,292
You're such a pervert,
you know that?

298
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,002
That's why you
can't find a girlfriend.

299
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:36,301
Wow.

300
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,097
How will I get a girlfriend?

301
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:39,701
You're taking them all!

302
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:41,137
Leave some for me!

303
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,553
You're the only one that's happy.

304
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:44,242
Let me have some sauce.

305
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,515
You're crazy.
Here, drink it,

306
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,850
you talk too much.

307
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,977
Who's that?

308
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,979
Pick me up now.

309
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,521
[Copy, Miss.]
- Okay.

310
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:56,059
Okay. I'll go now.

311
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:58,145
You'll just mess around again!

312
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,403
- You're just jealous!
- Don’t lie to me!

313
00:38:14,312 --> 00:38:16,314
Oh, Miss!
We're done for tonight.

314
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,133
It's still early.

315
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,250
Do you want to eat?

316
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,173
It's up to you.

317
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:25,073
- Let's go!
- Okay, get in.

318
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:59,525
Ms. Mercy, can I buy rice cake?

319
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:01,452
Two, please.

320
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:03,521
Yes.

321
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,711
Here's the payment.

322
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:09,858
That's the payment.

323
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,905
- You're gonna like that.
- Is this really good?

324
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:28,169
Of course!

325
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,434
You're right!

326
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,626
I told you so.

327
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:40,986
You know, I wouldn't
mind eating this everyday.

328
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,403
This is my favorite.

329
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,590
I can see that,

330
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,674
but the question is,

331
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,885
are you good at
eating rice cake?

332
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,472
I'm just kidding!

333
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,242
Oh, Lucy.

334
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,242
Don't tease me like that.

335
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,980
Whatever,
let's go home.

336
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,340
Drive fast, okay?

337
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:03,412
Okay.

338
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,027
Ms. Mercy!

339
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,239
For take out, please.

340
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:53,154
Ouch!

341
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:57,769
Did you get hurt?

342
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,182
- Come inside.
- It's nothing.

343
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,291
I'll treat it.

344
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:01,593
It's just a small thing.
It's nothing.

345
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,586
Come on. We need
to treat that wound,

346
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,051
you might get an infection.

347
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,963
Okay.

348
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,507
Thank you.

349
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,280
I'm sorry for bothering you.

350
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,046
It's fine.

351
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,206
It's not your fault.

352
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:33,391
It was an accident.

353
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,713
- Bhe.
- Marco.

354
00:48:17,738 --> 00:48:18,738
Oh?

355
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,630
I'm glad you came by.

356
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,238
My husband is coming home.

357
00:48:24,614 --> 00:48:26,697
Can you not drop by anymore?

358
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,305
- It's dangerous.
- That's okay.

359
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:34,295
Okay, don't worry about it.

360
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:36,113
I understand you.

361
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,541
To be honest,

362
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,960
the reason why I came here,

363
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,670
is to say goodbye.

364
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,381
How do I say this,

365
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:48,932
I've met someone.

366
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,218
That's great!

367
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,762
You have to start
being a good boy, okay?

368
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:53,072
Of course!

369
00:48:53,232 --> 00:48:54,817
I'll be good!

370
00:48:56,836 --> 00:48:58,046
What's that?

371
00:48:58,374 --> 00:48:59,374
Oh, here.

372
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,940
Just a little bit of cash.

373
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,290
I can't accept this, Bhe.

374
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:05,401
You've given me a lot already.

375
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,071
Go on, take it as a remembrance.

376
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:10,595
I don't want to.

377
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,948
Bhe,

378
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,806
thank you for everything.

379
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:17,200
I'll leave now.

380
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:18,661
Okay, I'll walk you out front.

381
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,634
What?

382
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,721
What now?

383
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,217
- I'll go now.
- Okay. Take care.

384
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:50,422
Be good, okay?

385
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,601
You too!

386
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,927
Hello, Marco?
Are you coming?

387
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,869
Sorry, Rayda.

388
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,580
I can't visit you anymore.

389
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:23,046
You also have to find someone
that can bring you to work.

390
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,228
What?

391
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,507
Why?

392
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,486
I am courting someone now.

393
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:33,006
Are you serious?

394
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:37,658
Yes. I got hit hard.

395
00:50:37,923 --> 00:50:39,825
Oh well, whatever.

396
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,081
If you two break up,

397
00:50:42,564 --> 00:50:44,024
just call me.

398
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,595
You're really crazy.

399
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,312
Alright, bye.

400
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,052
Thank you. Take care.

401
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,866
How long have you
been driving the tricycle?

402
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,323
I think,

403
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,090
around 12 years.

404
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,921
I started driving when
I was 15 years old.

405
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,982
Really? You started young.

406
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,343
Explains why you drive fast,

407
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,829
and memorize all the roads.

408
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,930
Sit.

409
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:51,651
Before, I used to steal
my father's motorcycle,

410
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,028
then, I'll use it to race
against my friends.

411
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,454
But then,

412
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,159
when my father got sick,

413
00:52:01,926 --> 00:52:03,802
I stopped studying.

414
00:52:05,265 --> 00:52:08,268
I decided to become
a tricycle driver,

415
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,943
to help with the bills at home.

416
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:12,783
You work hard.

417
00:52:14,822 --> 00:52:16,066
Not much.

418
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,740
I always notice the compass
hanging inside your tricycle.

419
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,678
Oh, that?

420
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,211
My father gave it to me
so I won't get lost,

421
00:52:26,701 --> 00:52:28,879
and so I can find my way home quickly.

422
00:52:29,704 --> 00:52:31,373
What about the speed king sticker?

423
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,822
Where did that come from?

424
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:37,982
I told you I race on the side,

425
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:40,219
and I'm always the winner,

426
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:41,928
that's why I'm the speed king.

427
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:44,345
Wow, you're really fast?

428
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,375
I am really fast.

429
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,632
But you know,

430
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,220
sometimes it's
good to slow down.

431
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,141
To breathe and to think because sometimes,

432
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:09,169
not stopping puts
us in more danger.

433
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,607
You're right.

434
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:15,625
- Okay.
- Okay?

435
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,014
Oh? Where's your cheap service?

436
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,380
There, wiped away
from the face of the earth.

437
00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:52,880
You seem angry.

438
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,888
You know,

439
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,471
whatever's making you angry,

440
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:02,505
forget about it.

441
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:05,195
It doesn't look good on you.

442
00:54:06,054 --> 00:54:07,097
Come with me inside.

443
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,715
I'll take care of you.

444
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:01,503
The food here is amazing.

445
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,377
Right. Get a girlfriend.

446
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,837
Girlfriend.

447
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:06,064
Girlfriend.

448
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,171
You don't want to give me some!

449
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:09,050
Your problem is,

450
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:10,458
you don't know how to court!

451
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:13,558
Damn, man.

452
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:14,870
You're really awesome.

453
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,569
Think about it,

454
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:18,894
you really left your three girls?

455
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,514
I'm really serious about Lucy.

456
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:24,654
Really?

457
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,909
Don't joke around.

458
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:27,757
Really.

459
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,029
I feel different towards her.

460
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,282
She's different.

461
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,197
It's not just lust I feel.

462
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:37,706
There's heart,

463
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,617
like love.

464
00:57:40,359 --> 00:57:42,153
The kind when you're with her,

465
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:44,755
you don't have to go fast,

466
00:57:45,123 --> 00:57:46,792
that you're allowed to slow down.

467
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,964
Shit, man.

468
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:50,919
That's different.

469
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,346
It's no joke.

470
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,398
It seems like you really got hit.

471
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:56,337
But seriously,

472
00:57:56,928 --> 00:57:59,081
it's good that I cut ties with them.

473
00:57:59,238 --> 00:58:00,266
At least,

474
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:02,061
I don't have to think
about them anymore.

475
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:03,744
Shit,

476
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:05,786
can you believe it?

477
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,920
You can take relationships seriously?

478
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,801
I thought having sex
is all you know.

479
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:14,048
It's because you
don't have a girlfriend,

480
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,953
that's why you don't understand!

481
00:58:15,978 --> 00:58:16,993
Damn!

482
00:58:17,018 --> 00:58:18,360
Your words hurt!

483
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:20,291
It seems like you're not my friend!

484
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,856
Get a girlfriend first!

485
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:38,665
What's that?

486
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:40,656
- Nothing, nothing.
- Why do you have so much money?

487
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:42,049
Nothing, this is not mine.

488
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:19,029
I was nothing before,

489
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,891
not until I met Mr. Uy.

490
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:24,919
He's a rich gang leader,

491
00:59:25,514 --> 00:59:28,683
and they made me
into a bag woman,

492
00:59:29,283 --> 00:59:30,834
for a commission.

493
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:33,160
I know it's wrong.

494
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,598
I'm just saving up
and I'll stop after.

495
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,671
Don't worry,

496
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,996
I'm just here for you.

497
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:44,414
I wont leave you alone.

498
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:45,774
Aren't you scared?

499
00:59:48,295 --> 00:59:49,401
I am,

500
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,655
but I have a plan.

501
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,615
Huh?

502
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:55,738
What?

503
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:58,155
Let's run away,

504
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,324
using the money you deliver.

505
01:00:01,675 --> 01:00:05,281
For that amount of money,
we can start all over again.

506
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,937
That's impossible!

507
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:10,088
Mr. Uy will find us.

508
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,376
Trust me.

509
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:17,905
When we leave this town,
he won't find us.

510
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,180
We can change our names.

511
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,869
We can start again,

512
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:24,738
I'll be with you.

513
01:00:25,463 --> 01:00:28,466
We'll build our dreams slowly.

514
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:32,420
Not running after time,
and just taking things slow.

515
01:05:18,638 --> 01:05:21,641
In one night, the turn over is big.

516
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:23,452
Five million.

517
01:05:23,555 --> 01:05:25,349
We can start from there.

518
01:05:28,441 --> 01:05:29,563
How about you?

519
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:31,423
I'm scared for you.

520
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,147
No, no. I can do this.

521
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,168
I know him.

522
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:38,751
He's rich, but not really smart.

523
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,106
Okay, let's do it this way.

524
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,233
I'll text you to pick me up,

525
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:47,491
is that okay with you?

526
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:52,545
Okay, but you need to be careful.

527
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,933
Yes, I will.

528
01:05:54,453 --> 01:05:55,453
Okay.

529
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:10,149
It's a miracle you
chose me tonight.

530
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,677
I thought you only like Rayda?

531
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,530
I still like her,

532
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,548
but I know she won't choose me
as long as Marco is there.

533
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:23,698
Nevermind, I have a plan.

534
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:26,316
What's your plan?

535
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,652
You know the new
girl he's with?

536
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:32,208
She's the bag woman of Mr. Uy.

537
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,763
It's easy to leave an
anonymous tip to the police,

538
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,943
so they can get caught.

539
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,331
You're so evil, Domeng.

540
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:44,691
The speed king, huh?

541
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,169
We'll see.

542
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,313
Marco, I need you. Meet me now.

543
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:19,365
Okay, I'll go there.

544
01:07:20,128 --> 01:07:21,163
- Hey, bro. Move aside.
- What?

545
01:07:21,222 --> 01:07:22,371
Where are you going this time?

546
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,539
Lucy needs me.

547
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:25,137
Son of a bitch,

548
01:07:25,617 --> 01:07:26,928
you'll just be messing around.

549
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:27,953
I have to go.

550
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:34,777
Sir, I'm sure she lives here.

551
01:07:35,203 --> 01:07:36,244
Why is no one here?

552
01:07:38,418 --> 01:07:39,530
Can't you just go in?

553
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,479
Is anybody in there? Just go in!

554
01:07:59,133 --> 01:08:00,398
Oh, Rayda. What's happening?

555
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,117
You need to go, Marco.

556
01:08:02,316 --> 01:08:03,591
What are you saying?

557
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,291
Domeng knows everything.

558
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:07,767
- What?
- But Lucy told me to come!

559
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,188
Maybe she's just setting you up!

560
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,480
- Shit.
- Please, just leave.

561
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:12,758
Okay. Okay.
Thank you, Rayda.

562
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,898
- Okay.
- Leave already.

563
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:14,956
Stay safe.

564
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:42,928
I'll wait for you.

565
01:09:54,521 --> 01:09:55,557
Aurora.

566
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,547
Were you waiting?

567
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,414
Lucy.

568
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:11,016
My name is not Lucy.

569
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,663
Sophia.

570
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,960
Alex.

571
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:41,573
I thought I will never find you again.
