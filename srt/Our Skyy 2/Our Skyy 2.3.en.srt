00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:19,680
Kluen posted a photo of you on Instagram.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,728
I think it's not only you who have feelings for him.

7
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:24,280
I think Kluen feels the same.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,143
I love you, Daonuea.

9
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:29,303
I know.

10
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:47,382
Ever since I've decided to love him,

11
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:51,115
there's not even a single day I forget how I felt that day.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,163
I still feel excited every time I open my eyes and see him sleeping next to me in the morning

13
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:01,861
and we go to bed together every night.

14
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,389
I want to keep telling Daonuea that I love him.

15
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:11,998
Though a year has passed and so many things have changed,

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,469
my feelings remain here.

17
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,117
I still love Daonuea.

18
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:21,459
I love Daonuea,

19
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,684
and I love Daonuea.

20
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,960
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,340
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,610
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

23
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,040
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,230
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,480
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,030
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

27
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,560
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:15,360
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,140
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

30

34
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,800
Hello, everyone.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,834
I'm Sean.

36
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,877
I'm Maitee.

37
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,166
I'm Typhoon.

38
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:53,217
Hello. I'm Daonuea from the Faculty of Fine Arts.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,514
That's the hottest senior from the Faculty of Dentistry.

40
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,025
Please introduce yourself to our juniors.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,726
- I'm Khabkluen, Daonuea's boyfriend.
- Kluen.

42
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:14,444
All right, guys.

43
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:20,040
All the freshy boys and girls, please head to your booth as assigned.

44
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,032
Stand up.

45
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,673
Kluen, what are you playing?

46
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:30,391
Why?

47
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:34,755
I just wanted to make it clear from the start in case some freshmen hit on you.

48
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,817
It's been a year already.

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,499
It's been a year since I met you again.

50
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:59,577
That's since our freshy boys and girls meeting last year.

51
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:03,361
At first, I thought I wouldn't get to meet you,

52
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,214
but after meeting you again,

53
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,278
I knew I must start loving you.

54
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:11,978
There's no way I will let go of you again.

55
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:17,059
That much?

56
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,247
Of course.

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,181
Did you really prove it?

58
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,880
How many times did you make me cry?

59
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,865
How many times did you break my heart?

60
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:39,545
Thank you for bearing with me so I can love you like this.

61
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,710
I'm going.

62
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,563
I'm going to my booth.

63
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,910
You're shy, so you're walking away, Darling.

64
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,140
Kluen.

65
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,803
Don't call me "darling".

66
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:58,720
Darling.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,831
Darling.

68
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,420
Darling!

69
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,041
Darling.

70
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,840
Darling!

71
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,700
Darling!

72
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,717
Darling!

73
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:15,711
My dearest darling.

74
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,368
Hey, how is it going?

75
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,381
Are you tired?

76
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,585
Kluen?

77
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:34,906
I haven't started doing anything yet.

78
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,664
I don't want my boyfriend to feel tired.

79
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:45,399
Hey. Do you think there's nobody else in this university, huh?

80
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,320
You keep being flirty with him, ignoring everyone and every eye watching you.

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,628
He fell for me a long time ago.

82
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:52,320
Fine.

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,701
I'm sorry I misunderstood.

84
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:01,356
Come on. Drink some water.

85
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,745
Hurry up, Kluen. Go back to your booth already.

86
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,093
Go.

87
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:08,665
Well, can I hug you in advance?

88
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:09,581
Don't.

89
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,920
Please.

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,760
- No. There're many people around.
- Please.

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
- Don't.
- Please.

92
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,698
Hey, your booth is just slightly opposite to ours.

93
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,528
It's only a few steps away.

94
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,880
Why are you missing him so much?

95
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,848
Nosy.

96
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,780
Please.

97
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,347
Please.

98
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,363
Darling.

99
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,654
Keep fighting.

100
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:47,554
Darling.

101
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:50,261
Go already. Go back now.

102
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,650
Darling.

103
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,867
Hey.

104
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,457
A year has passed,

105
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:06,988
but why is it still always me who keep seeing this thing?

106
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,859
That's too sweet.

107
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,284
[Nursing]

108
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,687
Pat's shoe is hurting her foot.

109
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,003
Which one?

110
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:32,503
My right foot.

111
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,944
Drink some water.

112
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,888
Thanks.

113
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:09,947
Senior Khabkluen dressed the wound so gently.

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,220
Does every medical student have to look warm-hearted?

115
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:21,656
Are you done?

116
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:23,256
Let's go.

117
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,209
He's hard-working, isn't he?

118
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,635
Hey, are you too hard-working?

119
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,290
Are we going for lunch?

120
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,796
Let's go. I'm done here.

121
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,804
By the way,

122
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,417
you heard it, didn't you?

123
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:19,451
Heard what?

124
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:21,452
What?

125
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:24,360
That junior complimented Kluen.

126
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:35,700
Nuea, are you too innocent?

127
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:39,750
You'd better get jealous already.

128
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,501
Why should I?

129
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,766
Do you still need me to explain it, huh?

130
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,400
Because Kluen touched Pat's foot?

131
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,935
Right.

132
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:01,400
Then, shouldn't I get jealous of him too when he does his dentist job?

133
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,010
When he touches his patients' teeth and so on? Should I keep getting jealous all the time?

134
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:07,607
That's not what we mean.

135
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,534
It's up to you then.

136
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:15,743
You two see that Kluen and I are in love,

137
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,640
but let me tell you...

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,000
We actually love each other more than what you see.

139
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:27,200
Just simply forget about that jealousy stuff.

140
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,600
Noted.

141
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,880
Let's have lunch.

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,083
- Whose motorcycle did he borrow?
- Huh?

143
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,653
He's all dressed up.

144
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,677
Kluen, you have a motorcycle?

145
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,390
I rode it here to pick my boyfriend up.

146
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm afraid he will have to walk.

147
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:59,371
The canteen is just over here, and you rode a motorcycle to pick him up.

148
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:01,971
That's damn annoying.

149
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,280
Go have lunch.

150
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,100
- Do you want to join us?
- Enjoy.

151
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,590
He doesn't know how to get jealous, does he?

152
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,087
I'll make him learn to get jealous.

153
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,358
All right?

154
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:21,039
Do you want to go somewhere after we're done here?

155
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,410
Should I take you to buy watercolors?

156
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:28,197
How did you know I was running out of watercolors?

157
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,197
You shouldn't be surprised.

158
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:34,610
If one day I don't ask, just come and tell me.

159
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:39,295
I love Khabkluen the most.

160
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,461
Kluen, I have something to tell you.

161
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,923
Yes.

162
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:01,565
Sean and Maitee keep provoking me into getting jealous of you.

163
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,727
How?

164
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,399
When you took care of others at the nursing booth,

165
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,616
they kept telling me to watch you and saying this and that.

166
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:14,765
They made me overthink.

167
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,440
And did you get jealous of me for real?

168
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,178
Just thinking about getting jealous already means I'm not trusting you. Right?

169
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:31,801
There's no way I wouldn't trust you.

170
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,300
Dao, you're trusting the right person

171
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,330
because I no longer know how to love anyone else.

172
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,439
You're the only one I love.

173
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:54,071
Noted, Mr. Khanaruj.

174
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,700
Don't overthink because of what others say.

175
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,160
Got it?

176
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,862
I'm not overthinking.

177
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:05,104
I'm just annoyed.

178
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:16,120
Let's do something fun.

179
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,053
That's the couple of the year.

180
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,364
I'll go back to my drink booth.

181
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,965
You go back to yours.

182
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:37,740
- Okay?
- Okay.

183
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,092
- See you.
- Yeah.

184
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,142
Nuea.

185
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:54,872
Look.

186
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:03,038
At first, I didn't even think about it,

187
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:06,005
but after you two told me, I started to observe things.

188
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:11,070
Kluen never looked at anyone like that, except me.

189
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:16,520
Look. He's looking at Pat like that.

190
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,550
He's looking at Pat with that look in his eyes.

191
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,172
Who will bear it?

192
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,910
My boyfriend is about to fall for someone else.

193
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,764
Who will stand it?

194
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,612
Damn it.

195
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,407
Everyone, when we meet next time, don't forget to prepare your talent to show us.

196
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,403
You can sing, dance or do anything. See you soon.

197
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,676
Can we stop this prank already?

198
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:07,800
I almost couldn't hold the laughs in whenever I saw Sean and Maitee's faces.

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,966
You plotted it yourself, and now you're going to stop it?

200
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,993
You should have seen them.

201
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:17,512
Sean and Maitee turned pale.

202
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,980
What are we doing next?

203
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,649
Should we continue pranking them? Or should we just tell them the truth?

204
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:30,443
Freshy welcoming activity will only last for one more day.

205
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:33,418
Let's tell them tomorrow in the evening then.

206
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:38,003
Then, we have to feign tension between us. Right?

207
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,989
I almost can't stand it any longer.

208
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:47,300
It's only for few hours. Don't overact.

209
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,118
Anyway, let me hug you enough in advance then.

210
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,840
You're taking advantage of me.

211
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,825
Please.

212
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,677
Please.

213
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,965
I'll count it as a promise.

214
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,768
Again.

215
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,484
See you later.

216
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,999
Pong is not going to Chiang Mai with us.

217
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,857
When I asked them to join, they all agreed,

218
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,883
but as the day approaches, only a few are still in.

219
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:46,635
Nay, Sean, and Maitee are still going, aren't they?

220
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,436
Sean and Maitee told me the other day they wouldn't go.

221
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,771
Now, I guess only Nay is still joining.

222
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,853
It's all right.

223
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:12,424
Honestly, having you go with me is already enough,

224
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,617
but I'm just upset that they always stand me up.

225
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,234
I know they're free.

226
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:18,354
It's just that they want to be with their girls.

227
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:24,226
Since you're saying this, what are you planning to do?

228
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:33,326
I'll call Prince and tell him not to book a room too large.

229
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,890
Don't.

230
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,370
I know now how to make Sean and Maitee join us.

231
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,745
Prankster, what are you planning?

232
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,545
You'll find out soon.

233
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:46,141
I'll take a shower.

234
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:42,873
Don't pretend you're sleeping.

235
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:44,924
I know you're not.

236
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:48,764
I'm not pretending. I've already fallen asleep.

237
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,923
So, are you sleepwalking now while talking?

238
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,904
Yes, I am.

239
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:56,331
- I am.
- Are you?

240
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:57,612
Kluen, don't.

241
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,752
- Don't.
- Are you sleepwalking?

242
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,653
Don't.

243
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:05,020
Let me hug you enough in advance.

244
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,839
I haven't forgot our promise.

245
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,386
But I forgot it already.

246
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,174
Let me kiss your cheek then.

247
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,020
♫ Thanks to the sky, the stars, and us ♫

248
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,984
Since you're doing this, I will understand that you are already allowing me.

249
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,480
♫ Thanks to the sky, the stars, and us ♫

250
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,680
♫ Lonely nights that are so empty ♫

251
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,090
♫ Are now filled with love and trust ♫

252
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:47,580
♫ You turn the coldest of nights ♫

253
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,552
Can I kiss you?

254
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,855
Of course.

255
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,249
Dao.

256
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:36,556
Dao.

257
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,476
Dao.

258
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:40,737
Are you awake now?

259
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:47,038
I can't wake up if you're waking me up like this.

260
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:49,798
How should I wake you up then?

261
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,813
Kiss my cheek.

262
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:55,108
After I kiss your cheek, you will get up right away. Right?

263
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,420
I will.

264
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,441
Hurry up.

265
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,818
What?

266
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,770
You kissed only one cheek, so I opened only one eye.

267
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,425
What are you doing?

268
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:34,390
Are you fully awake now, Darling?

269
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:37,648
Get up.

270
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,487
I've prepared breakfast in bed for you.

271
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:44,791
Oho. You're serving me breakfast in bed.

272
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:49,967
Will you eat breakfast first or eat me first?

273
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,727
I'll take a shower first.

274
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:11,054
He totally ruined the mood.

275
00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:26,540
Kluen, park the car and hurry here.

276
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,830
Don't forget about our plan.

277
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,780
Do we have to go this far?

278
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,960
Can't we walk side by side?

279
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,161
We can't. That won't make them believe we're arguing.

280
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,070
Hurry here.

281
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,540
Darling!

282
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:01,112
Hurry here.

283
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,984
Be hardworking.

284
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,424
What are you arranging? Lift it, too.

285
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:15,542
Tee, come help me here. It's stuck.

286
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:18,090
Stuck? Stuck in your heart?

287
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,035
Try to lift it.

288
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:23,620
- Daonuea, just now Kluen...
- I don't know.

289
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,809
Is something wrong?

290
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:31,645
Dao, where is Kluen?

291
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:33,393
You didn't come together?

292
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,015
I asked Kluen to drop me off at Fah's condo yesterday.

293
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,054
We didn't come together today.

294
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:43,821
Huh?! You didn't come together?

295
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:46,788
Did you two fight?

296
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:49,046
Can you not ask me now?

297
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,391
I'm not in the mood to answer.

298
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:04,595
Hey, let him handle it.

299
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,523
Don't crowd around her.

300
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:35,254
Kluen, she fainted.

301
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,776
It's probably heat syncope.

302
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:44,222
She should feel better after resting for a while.

303
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:47,598
I'll report it to the professor first, so we can drive her to the infirmary.

304
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:50,448
- Please take care of her.
- All right. I'll handle it.

305
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,225
Does anyone have a fan?

306
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:05,688
Your friend will be all right.

307
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,584
Don't make that face.

308
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,966
Will she really be all right?

309
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:16,612
Though I haven't graduated yet, so I can't call myself a doctor,

310
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:21,123
trust me your friend will be okay.

311
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,148
All right.

312
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,425
Well, Pat and I woke up late this morning, so we had no time for breakfast.

313
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:35,396
After being in such hot weather, I think Pat couldn't endure it.

314
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:38,732
You two didn't have breakfast.

315
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,632
One of you already fainted.

316
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,248
What if the other faints too?

317
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,579
I think you'd better go eat now.

318
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,020
Yes?

319
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,560
I mean, you should have your meal now, so you won't faint like your friend did.

320
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,073
I see.

321
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,057
Sure. I'll go soon.

322
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,728
Hey, Kluen?

323
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,855
I heard that a junior fainted.

324
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,037
How is she now?

325
00:27:30,037 --> 00:27:33,484
She fainted because of the heat. We already took her to the infirmary.

326
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:35,283
It seems you're close to her.

327
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:37,143
Why don't you stay with her there?

328
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:40,158
Why did you say that, Dao?

329
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,991
Why couldn't I?

330
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,784
Chill out. Don't fight.

331
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:47,061
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

332
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:49,216
You're being unreasonable.

333
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:53,135
Kluen, calm down.

334
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:54,852
Don't be nosy.

335
00:27:56,628 --> 00:28:00,363
Thank you to you two for enlightening me.

336
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:03,250
Hey, it's not what you're thinking. You're misunderstanding.

337
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,750
Come.

338
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:08,833
Come!

339
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,189
Damn it.

340
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:14,168
I didn't think what we said would worry Nuea this much.

341
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:26,141
If you didn't drag me here, I would have burst into laughter for sure.

342
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,451
Have you had enough fun?

343
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:32,973
I really want to record a video of the moment we walk hand in hand, telling them the truth.

344
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:35,543
I want to see what their faces look like.

345
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:41,278
Is there anything you haven't told me about?

346
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:45,975
What?

347
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:49,933
Are you doing this just for fun?

348
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,973
Or do you expect something else, too?

349
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:57,717
You can tell?

350
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:59,848
Am I right?

351
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,874
Senior Daonuea.

352
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,431
I'm Min.

353
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:07,649
Yes.

354
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:12,436
I have something to ask you, and would like your help.

355
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:24,410
Damn it.

356
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,999
Why is Min with them?

357
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,299
Or are we too late for this?

358
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:39,357
Hey, if this thing makes them break up,

359
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,346
let's get ordained, shall we?

360
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:44,367
Get ordained?

361
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:48,416
I won't.

362
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,185
We were just kidding about what we said to you.

363
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,094
Right.

364
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:01,253
You're the only one Kluen loves.

365
00:30:01,253 --> 00:30:03,453
There's no way he will fall for someone else.

366
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,087
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

367
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:11,778
Come on. What do we have to do to make you listen to us?

368
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,867
I'm willing to do anything.

369
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,849
You are willing to do anything. Right?

370
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,634
You are willing to do anything. Right?

371
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:20,888
Yes.

372
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:22,537
Everything.

373
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,578
But don't fight.

374
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:27,340
Don't break up.

375
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,169
Right.

376
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:31,248
It wasn't easy at all before you two got to be in love.

377
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,614
Have you forgot it?

378
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,488
Literally anything?

379
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,916
Yeah.

380
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:40,354
Chiang Mai trip.

381
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:41,406
- Noted.
- Noted.

382
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,152
Tickets are booked. No cancellation.

383
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:44,746
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,258
I can't go.

385
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:51,888
I told you already I have a date with a girl.

386
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,092
I'm not free either.

387
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,796
Wait.

388
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:03,358
I think it's looking strange.

389
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:10,568
You two didn't fight, right?

390
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:14,669
That was such natural acting.

391
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:18,539
Kluen, are you a medical student majoring in acting?

392
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:25,619
By the way, Min came to talk to you.

393
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:28,113
She looked stressed. What's happening?

394
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:32,905
Well...

395
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,221
Min has a crush on Typhoon.

396
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:41,099
- Min has a crush on Typhoon?
- Did someone call my name?

397
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:44,328
Dust, I mean.

398
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:51,467
By the way, have you come up with any plans for this holiday?

399
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,765
I haven't.

400
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:56,871
Do you want to join our Chiang Mai trip? Sean and Maitee are going too.

401
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,371
Sure.

402
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:00,300
Nice.

403
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,599
Let's start packing.

404
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,133
- Let's go.
- Packing.

405
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,081
Packing.

406
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:31,547
You're in such a good mood now that your friends have agreed to join the trip.

407
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,741
I asked them to go but they didn't agree to, so this serves them right.

408
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,521
Let's take a shower.

409
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:48,535
You go first.

410
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:49,959
Let's take a shower together.

411
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,495
You go first.

412
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:54,522
- Please. Let's take a shower together.
- Don't be sneaky.

413
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,012
You go first.

414
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,488
- I'm not sneaky.
- Don't be.

415
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:00,584
For how many days haven't you taken a shower with me?

416
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:02,684
- One week.
- See? It has been so long already.

417
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:05,632
Come on, it's not. It's just one week. You go first.

418
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:07,556
If I shower alone, who will rub my back for me?

419
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:08,861
- Do it yourself.
- Huh?

420
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,748
- Do it yourself.
- My hand can't reach it.

421
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:15,068
Throughout your 21 years, how did you rub your back?

422
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:16,846
I did it myself,

423
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:19,766
but after having you, I don't want to do it myself anymore.

424
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,079
- Please.
- Those are all excuses.

425
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,779
Please.

426
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:35,963
Come. Move your face closer.

427
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,098
That's too close.

428
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,961
Do I look handsome?

429
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:50,122
Not at all.

430
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:53,023
Are you sure?

431
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,560
Kluen.

432
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:14,353
Is my face already clean?

433
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,153
Let me check.

434
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,538
It is.

435
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:20,514
But it's no longer now.

436
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:25,942
Share it with me.

437
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,910
What are you thinking about?

438
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:01,974
I'm thinking of Kluen.

439
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,632
I'm here.

440
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:08,198
I'm not talking about you.

441
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:12,139
I'm talking about sea waves.

442
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,877
I'm thinking of the color of the sea when the light changes.

443
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:23,012
Also, I miss everything at the sea.

444
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,175
Follow me inside.

445
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:53,978
What's this?

446
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:58,389
At first, I thought I would show it to you after it was complete,

447
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,795
but after thinking it over,

448
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:04,137
since it's our house,

449
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:06,459
we both must help each other build it.

450
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:09,042
A house?

451
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:11,392
A house by the sea.

452
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,937
It would be nice if you drew the fence.

453
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,332
Can I draw it?

454
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,051
Of course.

455
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:28,671
You can do whatever you want to this house.

456
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:33,621
Let me show you.

457
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:37,118
Here. This is your drawing room.

458
00:36:37,118 --> 00:36:38,686
It will be a mirror fence like this.

459
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:44,400
While you're drawing, you will see the sea all the time.

460
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,900
Oho. It's so beautiful.

461
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,842
Do you like it?

462
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,776
I do.

463
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,175
Here is Mom's café.

464
00:36:55,175 --> 00:37:00,506
I'm thinking about turning this area into your art gallery.

465
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,314
My art gallery?

466
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,976
You've done a lot for me.

467
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:14,908
Can I do something for you, too?

468
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,292
Your happiness is...

469
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,992
You.

470
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,537
I told you before, right?

471
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:35,425
I just want to see your face every morning...

472
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,867
and see your smile every day.

473
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:42,419
That's already enough for me.

474
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:44,483
Well then,

475
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:49,923
let me be your happy zone every day.

476
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:52,944
Yeah.

477
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,347
- Dao.
- What?

478
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:01,627
Hey. Kluen.

479
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:07,587
You like to take a candid photo of me.

480
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,980
[Yeah... that's cute.]

481
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:41,398
No matter how long time has passed,

482
00:38:41,398 --> 00:38:46,192
I still feel as excited as the first day we met.

483
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:48,904
When did you two stop fighting?

484
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,158
Thank you to the sky that cloud belongs to.

485
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,830
Thank you,

486
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,580
to everything that sent this north star to me to take care of.

487
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,070
