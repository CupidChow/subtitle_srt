1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:03,253
We're here to talk to Teacher Tian and you.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,466
We would like to ask for your permission to use your story for my play.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:09,163
Why didn't you tell me you posted it?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,520
I'll never let you use the story.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,846
You can use it.

6
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:16,425
I'm the writer.

7
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:20,242
Are you sure you're going to make them make up in one week?

8
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:23,563
He has to admit that he faked not knowing how to build a mosquito net just to be close to me

9
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:28,062
He must also admit that he intentionally watched me take a shower because he liked me.

10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,455
How about following what's written in the diary?

11
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,605
So we can find out who fell for the other first.

12
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:39,041
Chief wrote in Teacher Torfun's diary that he liked me first.

13
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,710
Where is it?

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,310
At Pha Pun Dao. I buried it there.

15
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:46,455
[Route closed for safety. Don't go up .]

16
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:49,385
What a waste of time.

17
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:51,620
If we can't take this route, we can go another way.

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,251
Dad told me that we can also take the bamboo forest shortcut.

19
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:56,094
This is Pran's watch.

20
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,614
I think they're lost in the forest.

21
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,726
How far is it from here, Kampung?

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,490
I don't know.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,601
How can you not know?

24
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:17,943
Hey, be careful.

25
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,483
Okay.

26
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,318
Be careful, Pran.

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:32,318
You said we'd get there in no time, but we've been walking for a long time already.

28
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:34,458
Are we still not there yet, Kampung?

29
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:39,093
Which way is it?

30
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:47,564
- Unbelievable.
- I guess we took the wrong turn.

31
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:49,078
I don't think so, Kampung.

32
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:51,319
That's the same bamboo tunnel.

33
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,909
We're back at the same spot.

34
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,440
You're right.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,760
What? This is your fault.

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,364
You kept saying, "We're almost there. We've come so far".

37
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,622
Oh, shush.

38
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,212
We'll not go there anymore.

39
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:09,497
I'll take you back to the village. Is that okay?

40
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,121
This way. Follow me.

41
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,933
- Come on, Kampung.
- Yes.

42
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,537
Why are we bringing guns, Chief?

43
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:41,620
Do you know what's inside the forest?

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,512
Looks like I can finally put my military training into practice.

45
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:44,695
I'm ready, Chief. Let's go.

46
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,216
- Who said you can go?
- What?

47
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,020
- You stay here.
- Chief.

48
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,558
Let me go with you.

49
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:53,563
If you go, you'll only be a burden to us.

50
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,379
- Yod.
- Yes?

51
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,383
Are you ready?

52
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:01,772
That bad mouth of yours is why your boyfriend is mad at you.

53
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:08,507
Hey. Once we pass the bamboo line,

54
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:11,786
we'll see a firebreak, then we'll arrive.

55
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,844
Wait.

56
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,414
Why are we back in the same spot?

57
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,388
Like teacher, like student.

58
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,647
What do we do now, Teacher?

59
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,100
I have an idea.

60
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,001
It's all right, Namsai.

61
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,971
Where is this place?

62
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,682
This place?

63
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,775
This place is a magic hut.

64
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:53,000
There's a magic megaphone we can use to call for help.

65
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,612
Pra Pirun Unit, this is Bull Camp. Over.

66
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,095
We found the girl. She's safe, but she's not up to traveling right now.

67
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,373
Send someone to get us quickly.

68
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:13,006
She's probably tired from getting lost in here for a day.

69
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,897
You should get some rest, too.

70
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:19,120
You've been traveling all day.

71
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:30,819
This place seems quite convenient, Chief.

72
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,494
I can't believe it's in the middle of the forest.

73
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:36,729
We call this place Bull Camp.

74
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,800
If you get lost in the forest again, you can come here.

75
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,259
How is it getting lost if I can come here?

76
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,101
Here.

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,660
I made a map for every forest ranger,

78
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,147
and I asked them to make one for you also.

79
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,497
This is Bull Camp.

80
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:03,937
This is our village.

81
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,417
Why did you have one made for me?

82
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,330
In case you come to make trouble here again.

83
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,620
What kind of person do you think I am?

84
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:28,387
Stubborn.

85
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,820
Consistently stubborn.

86
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,562
Get some rest.

87
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:39,375
Get some rest, Tian.

88
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,700
I'm so tired, Chief.

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
Sleep now.

90
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,600
Thank you, Chief.

91
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,023
Teacher!

92
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:05,763
Why did you only tell me that important information just now?

93
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,640
I didn't want his help.

94
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,560
This is not the time to play hard to get, Teacher.

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,480
Where's the map?

96
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,110
I didn't bring it.

97
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:20,487
Ugh, why is everything going wrong today?

98
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,841
Hey, relax.

99
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:27,628
I remember Chief told me that if we get lost in the forest in the morning,

100
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:32,549
we should follow our shadows untilwe find a stream and we'll find a way.

101
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:35,548
- Mr. Tian.
- Hmm?

102
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:37,760
I hear the sound of the water from that way.

103
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,921
- Really, Kampung?
- Yes.

104
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,319
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

105
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,262
Let's go, Pran.

106
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,018
I want to take a shower.

107
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:55,314
Come on. We're almost there.

108
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,006
- Go, Kampung.
- Okay.

109
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,940
"Regret" - 5 U

110
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,580
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

111
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,060
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

112
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,140
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

113
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,680
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,040
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,190
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

116
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,730
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

117
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,200
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:54,910
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

119
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,790
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

120
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,350
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

121
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,060
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

122
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,030
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

123
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,480
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

124
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,960
[Our Skyy2]

125
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:44,081
I'll search the bamboo forest. You search the teak forest.

126
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:47,790
Okay. I'll keep you updated.

127
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,691
Have we arrived, Chief?

128
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:55,581
What did I tell you?

129
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:58,683
This is not a joke. I'm not someone you can play with.

130
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:02,080
Please don't send me back, Chief.

131
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,406
I can't bear to wait and do nothing.

132
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,442
Just like you're worried about Teacher Tian, I'm worried about Pran.

133
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:18,993
If you mess up, I'll leave you there.

134
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,427
Thank you, Chief.

135
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,322
You're the cutest.

136
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:24,597
- Yod.
- Yes?

137
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,699
- Off we go.
- Okay.

138
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,499
I'll keep you updated.

139
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,844
There's the stream.

140
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:47,034
- Be careful, Kampung.
- Okay.

141
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:06,726
Your face is red. Are you okay?

142
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,423
I'm okay.

143
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:15,265
I'm sorry, Pran, for getting you in trouble.

144
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,135
Don't worry about it.

145
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,220
It's partly my fault.

146
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,720
We're in the same boat now.

147
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:37,410
It's funny to think about the first time I came to the forest.

148
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,621
It's a totally different story.

149
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,977
When you saw the hornbills?

150
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:46,801
Yes.

151
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:54,964
Chief said hornbills are monogamous.

152
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,760
Anyone could tell he was hitting on me.

153
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,626
Come on, Teacher.

154
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:06,623
I agree that Chief liked you first.

155
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,852
If you don't believe me, let the audience be the judge when they watch my play.

156
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,755
If I get to produce it.

157
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,045
Don't worry.

158
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:25,745
Chief will come to rescue us.

159
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,752
Come on, Teacher.

160
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,063
Teacher.

161
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,743
Your temperature is very high. Are you okay?

162
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:45,311
Whenever he doesn't take his pill, he's always like that.

163
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,346
Let's get you out of here and find help.

164
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,039
Walk slowly.

165
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,343
Careful.

166
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:03,046
- Let's go, Kampung.
- Yes.

167
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,440
Hey.

168
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,932
Be careful in the water. There are a lot of local mafias around here.

169
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,941
What local mafias?

170
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,551
What's this?

171
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,272
Oh, shit!

172
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:36,597
Shit! What the hell?

173
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:38,197
Chief!

174
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,680
What the hell are these?

175
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,733
I told you.

176
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,630
Let me help.

177
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,086
No need. I can do it myself.

178
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,312
Pulling them out like that will give you big wounds.

179
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,676
You won't stop bleeding.

180
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:06,047
Don't move. I'll do it for you.

181
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,894
What? You're using a lighter?

182
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:15,546
Just stay still.

183
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,020
Chief! Don't burn me!

184
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,699
Chief! It's hot!

185
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,500
Chief!

186
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,797
Chief!

187
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,672
Why is this one hard to remove?

188
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:45,084
Press your wounds to stop the bleeding.

189
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,920
What a cute print, Chief.

190
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:05,210
I didn't prepare them for you.

191
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:10,336
Oh, you have a cute side, Chief.

192
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:13,159
No wonder Teacher Tian is head over heels for you.

193
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:20,141
Get ready and follow me.

194
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,593
Come on, Kampung.

195
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,568
I think once we cross over there, we'll arrive.

196
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:11,060
Teacher, I don't think you can climb it.

197
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:15,459
If we don't, I'm afraid we'll have to take a detour farther away.

198
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,210
I can't do this anymore.

199
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,491
All right then.

200
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:36,615
Pran!

201
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,215
Teacher Tian!

202
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,357
Pran!

203
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:46,974
- Teacher Tian!
- What are you doing?

204
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:49,090
Pran smells so good, Chief.

205
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,220
If he's nearby, I can find him.

206
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:58,026
What? Haven't you smelled Teacher's body before?

207
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,550
I'm not a pervert like you.

208
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,402
That's too bad.

209
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,698
Teacher Tian smells so good.

210
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,456
- How do you know that?
- Eh?

211
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,512
I thought you said you never smelled him.

212
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,499
Easy, Teacher.

213
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:27,105
- Careful, Kampung.
- Okay.

214
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,967
The kid has great energy.

215
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:42,429
Are you okay?

216
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:45,643
Mr. Tian, I see the station.

217
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:49,342
Come on, Teacher.

218
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,496
I'll go first and help pull you up.

219
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,217
Follow me slowly.

220
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:20,541
Slowly.

221
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,416
Pran!

222
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,715
Hey, stop.

223
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,237
What is it, Chief?

224
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:33,037
Footsteps.

225
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,807
Do these belong to those two?

226
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't think so. I think they belong to a tiger.

227
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,020
Stay still.

228
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,844
Stay behind me. Do not run.

229
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:56,068
Come on, Teacher.

230
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,019
Teacher.

231
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:15,100
Chief, it's me.

232
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,651
Kampung!

233
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:19,699
We're almost there, Teacher.

234
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,863
I can't hold on anymore, Pran.

235
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,164
Teacher!

236
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,653
Teacher!

237
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,317
Tian!

238
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:48,908
Chief!

239
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:16,748
I went to get Chief to rescue you.

240
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,881
I almost got shot by him.

241
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,820
Well done, Kampung.

242
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,558
Chief.

243
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:33,284
You kept me waiting for so long.

244
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,785
- Teacher.
- Tian.

245
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,286
We've arrived. This is the place.

246
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:03,887
We'll stay here tonight.

247
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,487
Let's go.

248
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:09,567
Slowly.

249
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,377
Careful.

250
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,668
[Bull Camp]

251
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,960
Pra Pirun Unit, this is Bull Camp. Over.

252
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:41,213
Pra Pirun Unit, this is Bull Camp. Over.

253
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,700
I think we haven't used it for too long.

254
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,193
Why don't we go back by ourselves, Chief?

255
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,598
Teacher is not feeling well.

256
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:02,461
It's dark.

257
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:08,115
It's dangerous outside. Let's sleep here tonight and talk again tomorrow.

258
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,515
Come on.

259
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,216
Chief.

260
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:18,617
Chief, can I get some water?

261
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:24,182
Thank you.

262
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,482
Teacher, I can only find painkillers here.

263
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:30,035
This should help a bit.

264
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,520
Thanks.

265
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,920
Don't worry, everyone.

266
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm okay.

267
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,142
How are you feeling?

268
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:15,570
I'm fine now.

269
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,520
It's him we should worry about.

270
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,673
This place is really nice.

271
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:43,718
We can even stay here for another night.

272
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:45,976
- Right?
- Yes.

273
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,140
Why did you come here?

274
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,772
I just came for a walk.

275
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:03,200
Seriously. Why did you come here?

276
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,213
Chief,

277
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:17,373
we just wanted to get Torfun's diary that's buried at Pha Pun Dao.

278
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:21,376
It's written in there that you liked me first.

279
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,313
Tian,

280
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:29,567
did you want to beat me that much?

281
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,511
Chief, don't blame Teacher Tian.

282
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:40,459
Blame Pran.

283
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:44,022
Hey, why didn't you stop Teacher Tian?

284
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,839
Are you blaming me?

285
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,894
You left me alone and ran off to drink.

286
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,202
You're blaming me back.

287
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:51,767
Yes, I am.

288
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,079
- What's your problem?
- Pat, Pran, no.

289
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,935
Stop.

290
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,288
What do you want?

291
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:58,974
- What's your problem?
- Fight me.

292
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:00,577
Enough.

293
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,629
That's enough.

294
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,740
You guys sleep here with Kampung.

295
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,100
I'll take care of Teacher Tian.

296
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,137
Don't fight again.

297
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:13,809
Thank you.

298
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,660
My acting skills are top-notch. It worked.

299
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,075
Wait.

300
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:25,480
That was my idea.

301
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,070
What? But I started it.

302
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,586
Oh, because you started it, you're taking the credit,

303
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:31,883
and you're saying I can't live without you?

304
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,136
Isn't that true?

305
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,737
Not again.

306
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:36,529
What? How was I wrong?

307
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:37,965
You said that again.

308
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:40,083
- I said the truth. How was I wrong?
- Really?

309
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,781
- What did I say?
- Be quiet!

310
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,011
Got it!

311
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:44,843
Take these.

312
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:47,157
Take care of yourself.

313
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,184
We'll be scolded!

314
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:55,808
You can't come in.

315
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,822
I'm so tired.

316
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:09,124
Why haven't you gone to bed, Kampung?

317
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm sorry for getting you lost.

318
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,394
It's okay.

319
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:21,668
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have found Chief Phu.

320
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:25,267
There's wild ginger in this area. My dad told me they can cure every disease.

321
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:29,001
Let me find some for you so you can get better.

322
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:31,114
It's okay.

323
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:35,376
Hurry up and go to bed so we can go back tomorrow.

324
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:37,300
- Okay?
- Okay.

325
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,989
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

326
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:40,389
Okay.

327
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:09,573
Here's flower tea.

328
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:12,923
Drink it to get a good sleep.

329
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,245
Thank you, Chief.

330
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:21,588
And here's your medicine.

331
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,555
Chief.

332
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,142
I think I should go to sleep.

333
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:53,446
Let me put that away for you.

334
00:27:43,224 --> 00:27:45,282
Am I disturbing you?

335
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,727
No.

336
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:51,472
Please continue.

337
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:38,887
Are you hungry yet?

338
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,953
Yeah.

339
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:44,051
Did you get a good sleep last night?

340
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:47,130
I did.

341
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,929
What about you?

342
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:56,856
Pat, Pran, Kampung. Food is ready.

343
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:01,444
Wash your face and come eat quickly so we can leave.

344
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,524
All right, Chief.

345
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:05,832
So, what score would you give me for last night?

346
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:09,432
Pat, come on. Rate me.

347
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,028
What food do we have here?

348
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,220
- Here.
- Ah.

349
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:22,100
Where's Kampung?

350
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,450
Oh? I thought he was with you.

351
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,067
Kampung?

352
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,517
Is he there?

353
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:36,046
No, Chief.

354
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:39,776
Did he say where he was going?

355
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:48,237
Last night, Kampung said he would pick a herb for me.

356
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:50,643
I think that's why he's gone.

357
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,859
Everyone stays here. I'll handle this.

358
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,498
Let me go with you.

359
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:02,498
It'll be faster if we help each other search.

360
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,488
- I'll go too.
- No.

361
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,990
You stay here. Your legs are hurting.

362
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,690
Take care of Teacher Tian.

363
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,390
Wait here.

364
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:15,209
Let's go, Chief.

365
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,669
Kampung!

366
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:22,877
- Kampung!
- Kampung!

367
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,617
Kampung, where are you?

368
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:27,766
Kampung!

369
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,266
Kampung!

370
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,360
Kampung, can you hear me?

371
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,060
Kampung!

372
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,503
Kampung!

373
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,613
Kampung!

374
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,880
It's already evening and they still haven't come back.

375
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,265
- Pat.
- Yes?

376
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:07,809
I should go and help them search.

377
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,474
You shouldn't.

378
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:12,599
Let Chief Phu and Pran handle it.

379
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,050
I'm a teacher, Pat.

380
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,930
I can't let my student stay lost in the forest.

381
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:21,122
Teacher, trust me.

382
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:22,695
Teacher, trust me.

383
00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:25,610
If we go, things will get even more out of hand.

384
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,270
I can feel it.

385
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,430
We're both hurt.

386
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,393
Then you stay here.

387
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:34,429
I'll go.

388
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,929
Teacher.

389
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:38,200
Gosh.

390
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,417
I'm sorry, Pran.

391
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,858
Teacher is really stubborn.

392
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:48,964
Wait for me, Teacher.

393
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:51,245
Kampung!

394
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:53,007
Kampung, where are you?

395
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:54,962
Kampung!

396
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:57,512
Chief! Pran!

397
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:01,668
What are you doing up there?

398
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:06,918
I was picking wild ginger for Mr. Tian, but some animal was in the bush

399
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:10,969
so I climbed up here to hide but I couldn't get down.

400
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:13,920
All right. Come down. I'll help you.

401
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:18,914
- Kampung.
- Yes?

402
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:20,652
Don't come here alone again.

403
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:21,952
Okay.

404
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:25,657
Pran,

405
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:28,434
I think it's dangerous to go back now.

406
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:31,390
Let's stay around here tonight.

407
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,673
Okay.

408
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:41,062
I hope nothing happens over there.

409
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,549
Let's go, Kampung.

410
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,468
Kampung!

411
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:51,848
Kampung!

412
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:53,248
Kampung!

413
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:56,380
Kampung!

414
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,076
Where are you?

415
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:00,832
Kampung!

416
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,789
Teacher!

417
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:06,973
Are you okay?

418
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:09,541
I'm fine.

419
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,741
I think we should go back.

420
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:16,787
You're sick and my legs hurt.

421
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:28,651
Which way do we go back?

422
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:35,303
Which way?

423
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:36,934
- Teacher.
- What?

424
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:41,113
Don't tell me you got me lost.

425
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:45,756
I warned you, didn't I?

426
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:55,445
What now, Teacher?

427
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,557
Does this area look familiar yet?

428
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,950
Of course, it does. Forests are all the same.

429
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,850
Come on, Teacher.

430
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:09,289
Hey. Are you okay?

431
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:12,923
Your fever is very high.

432
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,499
Let's take a break.

433
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:17,504
No.

434
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:21,368
Don't forget that Kampung is lost.

435
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:26,231
You're stubborn like he said.

436
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,318
You're okay?

437
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:32,201
Hold on to me.

438
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,171
What?

439
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:45,768
I think I smell food.

440
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:46,848
What?

441
00:36:46,848 --> 00:36:49,916
I think I hear people talking.

442
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,248
What?

443
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:56,067
I think you're hallucinating. You're really unwell.

444
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,013
I really feel it.

445
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:06,753
There. See the light over there?

446
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,599
Oh. Maybe they're already back at the station.

447
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,357
Kampung!

448
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:16,842
Kampung!

449
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:18,924
Kampung!

450
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:20,931
Easy. We're almost there.

451
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,531
Kampung!

452
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:26,771
Kampung!

453
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:28,271
Pat!

454
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,408
Where's Kampung?

455
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:41,106
Teacher!

456
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:43,480
Take Teacher to rest, Pat.

457
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,699
Look at him. Take him to rest.

458
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,521
You can't sleep?

459
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:03,957
I just have something on my mind.

460
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:13,966
I can't believe someone like you won't let me produce a play

461
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:16,706
because you're scared people will think you're lovesick.

462
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:20,708
Someone like me?

463
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,771
Someone who spoils his boyfriend.

464
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:34,450
Why do I feel like you're just insecure

465
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,000
and not sure if you're good enough...

466
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:40,047
to tell anyone that story?

467
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,525
You know nothing.

468
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:49,403
Why wouldn't I know?

469
00:38:50,188 --> 00:38:56,903
I know how it feels to be insecure, unsure if I'm good enough,

470
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,695
and if the other person is the only one who's made sacrifices all this time.

471
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:16,392
Go to sleep.

472
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:18,092
Okay.

473
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,493
If I'm not wrong,

474
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:35,323
please finish reading this diary.

475
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:45,149
I won't change my mind.

476
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:48,801
That's totally fine.

477
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:54,660
When you finish reading it,

478
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:59,105
you might understand Teacher's feelings better.

479
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,999
Here, Teacher.

480
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,369
Thanks.

481
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:06,218
Where are they?

482
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,934
I can't get a hold of them yet.

483
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:11,598
But don't worry.

484
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:15,572
Tomorrow morning, Yod will lead the villagers to help search for them.

485
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,261
Teacher.

486
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:25,264
You should go to sleep.

487
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:30,089
Chief is skilled and Pran is super smart.

488
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,606
Everyone will be all right.

489
00:41:41,842 --> 00:41:43,508
I know,

490
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,968
but I can't help worrying.

491
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,140
Fighting over who liked who first

492
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,390
is probably the most nonsensical thing we've done since I've known Chief.

493
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,333
Actually,

494
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:33,775
Pran and I just had a fight before we came here.

495
00:42:35,244 --> 00:42:40,665
I told him he needs my help all the time,

496
00:42:40,665 --> 00:42:43,170
but the truth is

497
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:48,430
I need his help all the time.

498
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:59,210
I just don't want to admit to myself...

499
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,500
that I can't live...

500
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,290
without him.

501
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:32,792
Don't worry, Teacher.

502
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,134
- Let's go.
- No, I won't go home.

503
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:47,405
Let's go home.

504
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:49,385
- The village is so close.
- No, I won't go home.

505
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:50,192
Come on.

506
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:52,800
- Go home to your mom.
- No, I won't go home.

507
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,328
No.

508
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:55,560
Hey, Chief.

509
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,163
- We're in the village already.
- Yes, this is the exit.

510
00:43:58,163 --> 00:43:59,508
No, I don't want to go home.

511
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:00,329
No.

512
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:02,635
Kampung, don't be stubborn.

513
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:03,580
We've arrived in the village.

514
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,963
I'll send you home, then Chief and I will quickly get Teacher Tian. Okay?

515
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:08,604
Don't go, Teacher.

516
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,264
- Don't stop me.
- Calm down.

517
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:13,332
I'm worried about Kampung. I'll help him.

518
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:16,985
- Pat.
- Chief.

519
00:44:16,985 --> 00:44:18,760
How did you get here?

520
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:04,576
True to our concept,

521
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,627
whenever we're together, we end up in trouble.

522
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:14,876
Will you apply this for me?

523
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:32,330
Yod will drop us at the bus station tomorrow.

524
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:36,421
What about your play?

525
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:38,865
Forget it.

526
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,507
I did everything I could.

527
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,853
I have no regrets.

528
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,587
I only regret that...

529
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:59,107
Don't be dramatic.

530
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,283
- Hey.
- I kept it for you.

531
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,887
Like I said, you can't live without me.

532
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:19,904
Oh, yeah?

533
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,682
That's not what you said to the Teacher yesterday.

534
00:46:22,682 --> 00:46:24,370
What did Teacher tell you?

535
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,215
It doesn't matter.

536
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:29,625
I'd rather hear it from you.

537
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:37,567
You already know it.

538
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:42,691
So?

539
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:53,980
I can't live...

540
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,180
without you.

541
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,217
Neither can I.

542
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,590
Eat a little,

543
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,480
then you can sleep.

544
00:49:24,832 --> 00:49:26,387
Chief,

545
00:49:26,387 --> 00:49:31,657
whenever I was sick, my mom would make me congee.

546
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:34,297
She makes really good congee.

547
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:36,945
Do you want to know her trick?

548
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:39,585
What is it?

549
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:45,156
She used normal hot water,

550
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:50,257
but somehow I can't make it as tasty as she did.

551
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:55,923
I wish you could try it.

552
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:12,435
Here. Eat some more before you go to sleep.

553
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,939
I'm full...

554
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:28,673
but I don't want to sleep alone.

555
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:38,730
Tian,

556
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:42,294
don't make me worry like that again.

557
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:45,902
If anything happens to you,

558
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:48,511
how will I live?

559
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,491
Do you understand, you stubborn kid?

560
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:06,186
Are you feeling better?

561
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,454
Yes.

562
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:22,032
Sleep now.

563
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,840
♫ If our love is as different as a cliff and a star ♫

564
00:52:55,844 --> 00:52:57,760
See you.

565
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,779
Safe trip home.

566
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:01,554
Take a bath at the waterfall?

567
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:04,205
The other day, you said I sneaked a look at you.

568
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:05,686
Today, I'm not sneaking.

569
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:07,758
I want to see you clearly.

570
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,796
On a scale of 10, how would you rate me?

571
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:17,040
♫ Will you still love me if you float down ♫

572
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,590
♫ Happy bithday to you ♫

573
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,180
Will you meet my parents?

574
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:28,890
♫ No matter where I am, having you warms my heart ♫

575
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:34,640
♫ No matter where you are, I'm not afraid ♫

576
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,460
♫ No matter how high the sky is or how deep the world is ♫

577
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,240
♫ Wherever I am in the whole world, I just have you ♫

578
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,740
♫ Let's just hold hands, that's all I'm sure of ♫

579
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,170
♫ Wherever, however, I want only you ♫

580
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:01,260
♫ If so, even if I have to climb or soar higher ♫

581
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,490
♫ I'm ready to go up there ♫

582
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:12,890
♫ So that we can be together even though we are far away ♫

583
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:21,080
♫ Our love will be with the stars beside the sky ♫

584
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:33,980
♫ Through many stories ♫

585
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,780
♫ We have proven our love ♫

586
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,860
♫ You have me by your side, what do you have to fear? ♫

587
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:50,430
♫ Well, our hearts have each other ♫

588
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:55,890
♫ Will you still love me if you float down ♫

589
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:01,100
♫ from the sky? Where it's high, are you afraid? ♫
