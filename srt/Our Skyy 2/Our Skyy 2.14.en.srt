1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:02,846
The Architecture guys stole the auditorium for their play.

2
00:00:02,846 --> 00:00:04,761
Engineering also has to produce a play this year.

3
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:08,344
So only one faculty gets to produce a play?

4
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:13,053
Then find someone else accepted by both faculties. Let that person decide.

5
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:16,494
The faculty that's more prepared gets the auditorium.

6
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:17,980
What?

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,084
I know I'll beat you at the presentation.

8
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,810
Shit, Korn!

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,175
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,540
I only have one concern.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,192
- The Architecture's play is based on a true story. Am I right?
- Yes.

12
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:35,420
I don't see any written permission from the story owner.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,208
I'll give you one week.

14
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,240
You must get the story owner's signature.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,212
Are you pranking me?

16
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:44,344
I'll show you that I can get the signaturewithout you.

17
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,600
This young man is looking for Teacher Tian.

18
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:51,026
Hi.

19
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:54,040
Chief!

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,505
- What happened?
- Hey. Are you a doctor or what?

21
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:58,812
My name is Tian. I'm a volunteer teacher here.

22
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:00,971
Who are you?

23
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:09,049
So who are you?

24
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:10,698
What business do you have with Chief Phu?

25
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,602
Well, I...

26
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:16,309
Chief, be careful.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,265
- Did I faint?
- Yes.

28
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,133
Drink some water.

29
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:44,113
Yod told me you skipped breakfast again.

30
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,260
I was about to eat,

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,640
but Yod radioed me to meet this young man first.

32
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,300
So you agreed to skip breakfast to wait for him?

33
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:59,940
Well, it's not like that.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,351
It's because the person I eat with every day likes to eat alone these days.

35
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:08,080
Wait. Calm down.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,035
Don't fight.

37
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:14,059
It's his first time here, so he has no clue.

38
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:17,159
He has something to talk to Teacher Tian.

39
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,116
He wants to talk to you.

40
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:22,530
What business do you have with me?

41
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,576
Well, I would like to discuss with you about...

42
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:27,580
If you would like to be a volunteer teacher here,

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,920
let me tell you we already have a permanent one.

44
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:36,320
That volunteer teacher will probably leave soon.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,474
Teacher.

46
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:41,039
- Teacher Tian.
- He has gone overboard.

47
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,190
Think it over.

48
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,593
Life is difficult here.

49
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:47,852
This place is not civilized as you might expect.

50
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,530
Someone who once told me he could live here

51
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,140
can no longer bear it.

52
00:02:56,618 --> 00:03:00,041
Well, Chief, it's not...

53
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,691
- Chief, I wasn't saying I...
- Chief!

54
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:05,219
What's wrong with them?

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,445
- Yod.
- Yes?

56
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,342
Did they fight?

57
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:13,387
They usually get along well, but I don't know what has been wrong with them recently.

58
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:15,540
There seems to be tension between them.

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,780
I don't know why either.

60
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,982
- Yod!
- Yes?

61
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,302
- Let's go.
- Yes.

62
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,601
I'm off.

63
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:26,322
Yod, I'm going with you.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,299
Let's return to our unit so that we won't be a nuisance to someone around here.

65
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,788
Are you reconnoitering?

66
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:36,590
Can I join you, please?

67
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,400
I could use it as a reference for my play.

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,614
What play?

69
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:45,460
Well, I just want to see if forest rangers

70
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,370
are as cool as those I watched in the play.

71
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:53,050
I'm not cool. I'm just doing my duty.

72
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,170
I think you shouldn't join us.

73
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,200
Our job is tough.

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,280
How is it tough? We just count rice seedlings in the forest.

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,421
Yod.

76
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:07,528
I say it's tough, so it is.

77
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,428
Let's go.

78
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,518
Chief.

79
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:17,431
Teacher Tian, can I visit the school?

80
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:26,209
Teacher.

81
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:30,700
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,370
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

83
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,540
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,890
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

85
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,020
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

86
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,390
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

87
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,900
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

88
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,460
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

89
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:13,120
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,870
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

91
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,470
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

92
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,260
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,260
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:42,170
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

95
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,006
Today, I'm teaching you math.

96
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,172
Last time, I taught you addition. Right?

97
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,054
Let's see if everyone still remembers how to do it.

98
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:54,507
Twelve plus which number equals thirty-five?

99
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:56,065
Namsai, you know the answer?

100
00:05:56,065 --> 00:06:00,554
I don't. I just want to ask who that person is.

101
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:03,996
I know.

102
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:08,769
I think he's Chief Phu's boyfriend. I saw him hugging Chief Phu.

103
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,765
That isn't true.

104
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:10,941
No.

105
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:19,015
- Boyfriend.
- No, I'm not.

106
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:20,594
- Boyfriend.
- Enough, kids.

107
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:23,948
Let's study. Come on.

108
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:29,432
Mr. Tian, Kampung has disappeared.

109
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,859
Kampung, you're doing this again.

110
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,081
Kampung, are you there?

111
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,081
Kampung?

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,710
Again.

113
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:56,741
I know where Kampung is.

114
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,570
You found me.

115
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,100
I should have hidden somewhere else.

116
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,334
It's not time to play, Kampung. Get out of the box.

117
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,043
You've done this many times.

118
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:15,059
I'll punish you today, Kampung.

119
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,923
Please don't.

120
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:18,823
So don't do this again. Got it?

121
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:20,214
Yes.

122
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,470
Go back to your seat.

123
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,639
This isn't fun.

124
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,672
Next time, you won't find me.

125
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:28,876
Hey. You haven't stopped?

126
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,393
How did you know he was hiding in there?

127
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:43,841
Well, other tea boxes are kept in order, but this box is...

128
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,989
Excuse me.

129
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,740
It's different from others.

130
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,593
Someone with OCD like me felt upset seeing such a thing.

131
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,203
Thank you.

132
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,958
I'm Pran.

133
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:21,099
Kampung, pass me an empty plate.

134
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,546
Thanks.

135
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,420
Let's share.

136
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,020
Thank you.

137
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,326
Do you want some more?

138
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:59,008
I think you can be a good teacher, Pran.

139
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,360
But they already have me here.

140
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,650
How about looking for other places?

141
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,090
Teacher Tian, actually,

142
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,310
I'm not here to work as a volunteer teacher.

143
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,186
Eh? Then why did you come to see me here?

144
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:21,770
Well, I came across A Tale of Thousand Stars diary

145
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,460
that you posted online.

146
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:32,449
I just wrote it to inspire others to become volunteer teachers.

147
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,040
It's excellent.

148
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,624
It's so excellent that I would like to turn it into a play.

149
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:39,213
But I couldn't reach you at all.

150
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:42,041
That's why I'm here to ask for your permission in person.

151
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,103
You don't have any problem with that, do you?

152
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,297
I'm totally fine with that.

153
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:49,511
I'm actually glad because people will get to know this place more.

154
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:50,760
That's nice.

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,080
Could Chief and you sign this consent form for me?

156
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:59,217
Chief has to sign it, too?

157
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:00,364
Yes.

158
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,930
This story is about Chief Phu and you,

159
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,680
so both of you must sign it for me,

160
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,992
or else, I can't proceed.

161
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:13,372
But I can't guarantee that Chief will sign it for you.

162
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:18,930
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

163
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,570
Get home safe.

164
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,954
Goodbye.

165
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:26,254
- Don't be naughty again. Got it?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:27,808
Yay.

167
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:30,722
Let's go home and play hide and seek.

168
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:35,362
This is what a volunteer teacher's life is like.

169
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:39,545
Excuse me, Teacher.

170
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:44,097
May I ask you this?

171
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:50,179
What conflict is going on between Chief Phu and you?

172
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,119
It's not a big deal, actually.

173
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:00,940
Every year, I go home to celebrate my birthday with my parents.

174
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,182
I always asked him to join me, but he won't agree.

175
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,178
He isn't going with me this year also.

176
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:09,342
Why?

177
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,613
That's what he's like.

178
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:17,093
He doesn't like it when there're many people around.

179
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:21,257
It sounds like a trivial matter, right?

180
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:25,696
But since this happens so often, it tires me out.

181
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:30,866
I feel like I've been trying to adjust myself to him,

182
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,486
while he doesn't have to do anything.

183
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:41,403
Has Chief ever read the diary you wrote?

184
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:46,163
He doesn't even know I wrote it.

185
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:50,550
If he got to read it,

186
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,590
I think he might understand you better

187
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:57,255
because you wrote about your thoughts and feelings.

188
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,275
Are you cooking this to spoil Chief?

189
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,581
Well, you wrote in the diary that fried Chinese pork sausage is his favorite food.

190
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:23,832
Who said so? I cook it for myself often.

191
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:35,044
There he is. Speaking of the devil.

192
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,937
Let's go.

193
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,844
I found that he lost his way.

194
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:05,193
He said he's your friend.

195
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,125
Hey, Pran, my buddy.

196
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,815
I thought we wouldn't see each other.

197
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,578
Well, if it isn't my buddy, Pat.

198
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,690
I'll be right back.

199
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,515
Why are you here?

200
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,141
Why did you even ask?

201
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,792
I came to help you get their signatures.

202
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,157
I told you already I can handle it alone.

203
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,475
Really?

204
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:44,019
But I trickily asked Chief.

205
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,260
It seems there's still tension between them.

206
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,140
Do you think they will agree to sign it that easily?

207
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,275
I have my way to deal with it.

208
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,630
Do you?

209
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,572
How?

210
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:59,346
Don't be nosy.

211
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm sorry. I didn't know Pran's friend would be here too,

212
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,213
so I didn't cook more for you.

213
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:15,600
Let me know if you aren't full.

214
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,253
It's totally all right. Don't worry.

215
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:20,729
I'm a good little boy. I'm not picky about anything.

216
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,000
Am I right? Pran, my buddy.

217
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,759
Just eat quietly.

218
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:37,993
Thanks.

219
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,981
Teacher Tian cooked his best.

220
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,201
Chief, it's your favorite. Right?

221
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,676
How did you know?

222
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,860
I saw that you keep taking it from the plate.

223
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,750
Delicious, isn't it?

224
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:13,047
Forest rangers must be able to eat anything.

225
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:22,160
Tian, can I have more rice?

226
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,156
- Pat, how about you?
- Yes?

227
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,936
Do you want to work as a volunteer teacher here, too?

228
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,600
Well, actually, we aren't looking for a volunteer teacher job.

229
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:48,660
We're here to talk to Teacher Tian and you.

230
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,731
We would like to ask for your permission to use your story for my play.

231
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,597
My story?

232
00:15:56,405 --> 00:16:01,706
Yes. I came across the diary Teacher Tian posted online.

233
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:07,187
I really like it, so I want others to watch it too.

234
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,200
Tian, why didn't you tell me you posted it?

235
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,789
Well,

236
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:26,808
I want everyone to know that Pha Pun Dao isn't only known for teas,

237
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:30,148
but a selfless forest ranger is also living here.

238
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:32,262
That's right.

239
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:35,094
The story is so touching.

240
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,387
If you don't believe me, you can read it.

241
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,829
I printed it for you.

242
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,580
Please check it out.

243
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,127
[A Tale of Thousand Stars by Teacher Si Tian]

244
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,056
Tian...

245
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:07,365
The story isn't right.

246
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,863
Where is the story about me doing my job?

247
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,160
Who would know?

248
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,980
I only met you when you came to take care of me.

249
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,446
I think this isn't right.

250
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,760
It sounds like I don't do anything else but be madly in love.

251
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,750
But that happened for real, didn't it?

252
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,730
Why would a good guy come to watch me take a shower?

253
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,900
Your dad asked me to do that, so I had to.

254
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:38,080
Did my dad also ask you to look sweetly into my eyes when I fainted?

255
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,222
I must help anyone who is fainting, mustn't I?

256
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,743
It's you who did that.

257
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:44,738
Did you see how you yourself looked at me?

258
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,071
Don't let me talk about it.

259
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:49,932
You kept talking about a ranger's wifeand setting up a mosquito net.

260
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:51,641
You threw yourself at me first.

261
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,496
You did.

262
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,119
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

263
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,233
I'll never let you use the story.

264
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,763
Well, Chief.

265
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:05,560
Chief. Chief!

266
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,509
Just forget about him.

267
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:08,770
You can use it.

268
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,290
I'm the writer.

269
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,383
Pat. Pran. Let's eat.

270
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,083
Yes.

271
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,758
- Eat.
- Yes.

272
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:34,032
- Here's your blanket.
- Thank you.

273
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,985
Don't worry. Teacher Tian keeps changing his sleeping place.

274
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,828
Sometimes he sleeps at Pra Pirun Unit, sometimes he sleeps at Khama's place.

275
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,262
All right. Get some rest. It's already late.

276
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:44,672
Sure. Thank you so much. Goodbye.

277
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:47,606
Take some rest. It's already late.

278
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:49,539
Don't reach me if you have any trouble. Okay?

279
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:50,774
Sure.

280
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,647
I live many kilometers away. I won't walk here.

281
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,733
- I'm going home. All right. See you in the morning.
- Sure.

282
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,148
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

283
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,680
Teacher Tian already signed it for you.

284
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,650
Should we go home tomorrow morning?

285
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,588
Don't you understand that it needs to be signed by both?

286
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,308
If Chief doesn't sign it, I can't use the story.

287
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,150
How about I talk to Chief Phu for you?

288
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,320
I've already tried to befriend him.

289
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,840
Don't do that. I told you already I can handle this alone.

290
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,667
Can you?

291
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:23,044
Are you sure you're going to make them make up in one week?

292
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:24,640
Really?

293
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,521
I agree to let you help me, then.

294
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:32,870
How? Tell me.

295
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,569
Please help by being quiet. Okay? You're annoying me. I need to sleep!

296
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,725
Well then,

297
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:44,180
keep fighting, darling.

298
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,551
- Good luck to you.
- Ow!

299
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:47,794
Pat!

300
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:49,814
Keep fighting.

301
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,480
Pat!

302
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,142
- Why can't you see?
- I'm wearing an eye mask.

303
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,723
Remove it for me.

304
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,203
- Your eye mask is cute.
- I can't fight.

305
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,260
- Let me have it then.
- Give it back to me.

306
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,154
Hey. Give me.

307
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,572
- I need to wear it when I sleep.
- How do I look?

308
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:04,272
So-so.

309
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,290
You can't be as cute as I am.

310
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,125
Come on. You're flattering yourself.

311
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,918
Sleep already.

312
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,338
Sleep.

313
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:24,634
Let's wait for Chief first.

314
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:25,912
Here he is.

315
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:27,312
Hello, Chief. Hello, Yod.

316
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,209
Hello, Chief.

317
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:31,423
I'm bringing this to make a palanquin. I think this is enough.

318
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,920
Thank you, Chief.

319
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,322
Why didn't Teacher Tian come with you?

320
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:41,514
He's been busy recently. Let me know if you need anything.

321
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:45,719
Chief, do you know how to start making a palanquin?

322
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:49,907
I think we should start by...

323
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:54,183
Should we start by choosing a chair for the bride?

324
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:56,529
Choose the one that is not too high.

325
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:01,821
Well, Teacher Tian wrote this suggestion in the diary.

326
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,905
Do you think I'll yield if you do this?

327
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:09,058
No, Chief. I just want to talk to you.

328
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:10,435
You're misunderstanding.

329
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:16,027
This diary doesn't only talk about you being madly in love.

330
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:21,044
It also mentions you helping villagers and doing beneficial tasks.

331
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:23,265
He wrote these in the diary, too.

332
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:30,756
What did he write?

333
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:31,951
He wrote...

334
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:36,575
He wrote that his idea came from when he studied Engineering.

335
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:40,103
Chief only brought wood scraps to please him.

336
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,373
How could he write that? That's so mean.

337
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:47,926
He can write whatever. It's not true anyway.

338
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:49,690
Chief.

339
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,330
Yod, measure this.

340
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,660
Use the pencil.

341
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,680
- This is how you want to play. Right?
- Play what?

342
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,843
I'm not playing. I just spoke the truth.

343
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:02,543
Am I wrong?

344
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,515
All right, kids.

345
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:22,633
Today, we'll draw a portrait. Pran will be our model.

346
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:25,170
- Do your best.
- Yeah.

347
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,115
Good job.

348
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,070
Strike a handsome pose.

349
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,257
Like Hercules.

350
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,359
- Teacher.
- Hmm?

351
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,754
Since I'm helping you here,

352
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,438
please talk to Chief Phu into signing it for me.

353
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:09,042
Please. You're probably the only person he listens to, at least.

354
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,822
I told you not to care about him.

355
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:13,126
Just do it.

356
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:16,921
- Brother, can you not move? I can't draw.
- I'm sorry.

357
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:21,128
Mr. Tian, we want to draw someone with a sturdy body. Like a giant.

358
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,768
Sturdy? Like a giant?

359
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,602
How about drawing Chief Phu?

360
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:29,843
Yes.

361
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,266
- I want to draw Chief Phu.
- Mr. Tian, bring him here.

362
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:34,720
- Chief Phu, right?
- Yes

363
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,744
In this case, could you please bring Chief Phu here?

364
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,435
- Am I right, everyone?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:53,535
- Teacher Tian.
-Teacher Tian.

366
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,792
It's all right, kids.

367
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,360
Chief Phu isn't here.

368
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,230
Can you draw Chief Pat instead?

369
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,735
I'm fast and furious, you know.

370
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,708
Touch it.

371
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,455
How is it? Why are you laughing?

372
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,401
I'll show you both sides.

373
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:36,425
Chief, nobody will say that you're madly in love.

374
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,160
I'll sign it for you

375
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,200
if you can make him admit that when we first met,

376
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,960
he feigned fainting because he threw himself at me.

377
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,708
That's what Chief said.

378
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,995
All right. I admitted throwing myself at him.

379
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:57,502
So he must also admit that he intentionally watched me take a shower because he liked me.

380
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:02,097
He has to admit that he faked not knowing how to build a mosquito net just to be close to me.

381
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:04,360
All right.

382
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,366
He poked my hand with his finger while we were sleeping together.

383
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:08,296
Why did he do that, huh?

384
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:17,734
Why have they been arguing this much?

385
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:21,956
How is it going?

386
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:25,953
Do you feel you need my help now?

387
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:27,118
Don't do anything.

388
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,558
If it weren't because of you, he would already agree to sign it for me.

389
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,120
Why have they been arguing this much?

390
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,070
It's simply about who made a move first and who fell for the other first.

391
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,659
That shouldn't have been the cause of their fight.

392
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,634
Have you forgotten?

393
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:50,148
We fought because of these things, too.

394
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:51,848
Don't you think it's familiar?

395
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:55,326
You're right.

396
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:01,820
I'm upset.

397
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:06,532
I longed to put up a tent, stargaze, and play in the waterfall.

398
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,724
This totally ruins the mood.

399
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:10,230
Here's the waterfall.

400
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,820
Let's play in the water together.

401
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,120
Let's go.

402
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,282
Nope. I'm not in the mood.

403
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:18,107
Come on.

404
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:27,822
Hey. How about following what's written in the diary?

405
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:30,844
So we can find out who fell for the other first.

406
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,912
You're just asking me to play in the water with you.

407
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:37,659
Don't beat around the bush. Okay?

408
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,794
That's because my boyfriend likes to overthink.

409
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:41,314
Let's go now. Let's play in the water.

410
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:42,814
Hurry up.

411
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:45,133
Come here.

412
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,164
Come.

413
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:49,456
Hey. All right. I'm joining you.

414
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:50,681
- Hurry up.
- Wait.

415
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:52,350
Hurry up.

416
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,389
Right. I'm going.

417
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,377
- Hey.
- Be patient. Okay?

418
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:03,292
♫ Did you think you were just a friend? ♫

419
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,640
♫ Is it okay if I don't have you? ♫

420
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,889

00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:10,811
♫ But every time we're far apart from each other,

433
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:06,634
Do you think Chief Phu secretly watched Teacher Tian in the water because he had feelings for him?

434
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,316
Of course, he did.

435
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:11,193
Just like you who like to secretly watch me taking off my tee.

436
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:14,498
Nonsense. When did I do that?

437
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:16,454
Now, at least.

438
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:21,559
How is it?

439
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,574
I'm doing exactly like what's written in the diary.

440
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,336
Do you like it, Teacher?

441
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:36,165
I don't. Chief Phu's body looks a lot hotter than yours.

442
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:42,793
Hey, wait. When did you see his?

443
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,183
You're catching them one by one. There's no way we can get rid of all.

444
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:00,423
Help me set up the mosquito net now.

445
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:07,421
What are you laughing at?

446
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:08,828
Don't you think he exaggerated?

447
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:13,100
Teacher Tian wrote that they had a spark while they were setting up a mosquito net.

448
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,779
Do you think that's even possible?

449
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,802
Heat of the moment, probably.

450
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:22,904
How do we do this?

451
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,834
That's the corner.

452
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:31,924
Go there.

453
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,719
What's up, Chief?

454
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,208
Try imagining.

455
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:54,830
I think they kissed.

456
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,943
- Agree.
- They certainly did.

457
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:58,546
I agree.

458
00:30:58,546 --> 00:31:00,524
I'm not talking about you!

459
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:02,069
- I'm talking about Chief.
- Really?

460
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,004
I'm getting into my character. Sorry.

461
00:31:04,004 --> 00:31:05,895
You're always sneaky.

462
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:07,795
Sleep.

463
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,280
- Hey.
- Hmm?

464
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,354
Since we're here in the North,

465
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:36,581
should we make it our honeymoon trip?

466
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:41,468
Honeymoon? Our mission hasn't been completed yet.

467
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,608
Come on.

468
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:47,083
I'll help you. You didn't ask me to.

469
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,164
I just want to help my boyfriend.

470
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:55,484
But your faculty won't get to produce the play then.

471
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,721
I told you already.

472
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:04,550
If I win, but that puts my boyfriend in trouble,

473
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,814
what's the point of winning?

474
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:21,929
What's wrong with you?

475
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:23,787
Nothing.

476
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,465
I just feel cold. Don't you feel cold?

477
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:32,190
It's 18 Celsius here.

478
00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:44,227
Why are you laughing?

479
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,859
You're tickling me.

480
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,415
I'll breathe softly then.

481
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,270
Hey.

482
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,710
You're studying Architecture.

483
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,770
Have you ever wondered

484
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:15,410
how much this house can withstand a shake?

485
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:22,289
I haven't. I'm not curious.

486
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:25,611
But I want to know.

487
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:28,623
Since I'm studying Engineering,

488
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:30,403
let me prove it tonight.

489
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:33,364
I don't want to know! Pat! I want to sleep!

490
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:37,574
Pat!

491
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,645
[Pha Pun Dao School]

492
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,980
All right, everyone.

493
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,000
I'll read it out for you. You write it down. Okay?

494
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,095
Ma na ma.

495
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,951
Ha ta pu.

496
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:54,778
Do dee dee.

497
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,042
Let me see. Can you write it correctly?

498
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:01,620
Ma na ma. Ha ta pu. Do dee dee.

499
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,450
Good job.

500
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,517
Did you get it right?

501
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:09,556
Why did you write "Ta sue"?

502
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:11,573
- How can we make them make up?
- It must be "Ta Si".

503
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:13,420
Can you write it correctly?

504
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:18,225
I think we should create a romantic moment for them.

505
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,925
Wanna drink it?

506
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:27,851
Hey. Do you remember that scene?

507
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:32,262
When you secretly held my hand under the desk?

508
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:36,456
Nope. It's that legendary tea bag scene.

509
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,456
You ruined the mood again.

510
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,290
I see. Is it the scene when Teacher found a tea bag inside Chief's car?

511
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,440
Yeah. That's the one.

512
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:52,157
Chief,

513
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:56,346
since you dried the tea bag like this, its smell has all gone.

514
00:34:57,384 --> 00:34:59,421
Let me smell it.

515
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,718
That's my hand.

516
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,513
It smells good.

517
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,447
Can I smell it, too?

518
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:13,640
Kampung?

519
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,415
Kampung, why aren't you in class?

520
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:21,399
I heard you two talking about making Teacher Tian and Chief Phu make up.

521
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,760
I know how to do that.

522
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,315
Do you? How? Tell us.

523
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:38,872
It's easy. Just find something for them to do together.

524
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,455
We already knew that. Is there any other way?

525
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,155
You want some more?

526
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,234
Let's see what you will say this time.

527
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,515
Teacher Tian mentioned that there's one thing he really enjoys doing with Chief Phu.

528
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:10,702
Karaoke?

529
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:14,234
Yes. Yod said they will be having a karaoke party.

530
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,000
Join them. Chief Phu is going, too.

531
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,934
If he goes, then I won't go.

532
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,629
But Chief asked me to invite you.

533
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:36,508
- Did he?
- Yes.

534
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:37,776
That's right.

535
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:43,218
Chief Phu said he hasn't sung a song with you for some time already.

536
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,363
He misses doing that.

537
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,556
Since he tried this much to invite me, it will be so rude if I reject.

538
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:00,634
Let me think it over.

539
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:02,134
Sure.

540
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:16,290
Great job. I'll buy ten bottles for you.

541
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,046
I'm not going. I'm not free tonight.

542
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:24,867
But Yod told me you're free all night.

543
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:28,874
I'm the chief.

544
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:32,049
I have to handle tons of work Yod doesn't known about.

545
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:37,167
What a regret.

546
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,752
I guess I have to go back and tell Teacher Tian this bad news.

547
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:43,752
He asked me to invite you.

548
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,280
Oh, he also told me that if I hear you sing,

549
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,420
I'll be so surprised.

550
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,127
Actually, my singing is just so-so.

551
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,074
Let me think it over.

552
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:07,859
I can't guarantee I'll go.

553
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,450
Hey. It's a good day today.

554
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,750
Let's pour some more. Let's drink together.

555
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,892
Pour more for Chief.

556
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:27,350
There you go.

557
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,167
Pour some for our newbie, too.

558
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:32,205
Enjoy.

559
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,973
I'll get more glasses. Teacher Tian is here.

560
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:36,981
Sure.

561
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,454
Take a seat.

562
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:41,374
- Come.
- Take a seat.

563
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:44,154
Take a seat.

564
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:48,453
Take a seat. We've been waiting for you.

565
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:49,890
Nice.

566
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:50,965
What are we having?

567
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,814
We have a lot.

568
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:57,244
These are local dishes for real mountain people like us.

569
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:00,489
You must try them.

570
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:03,498
This is fried cricket. Fried beetles.

571
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:05,343
We have so many dishes.

572
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,082
This one is our signature dish.

573
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,148
Hello.

574
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,513
Hello, hello, hello!

575
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,000
Today is a good day,

576
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,300
so we must have an important ceremony.

577
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,306
The heads of the party must give their opening speech.

578
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:29,492
We have two of them today, Chief Phu and Teacher Tian.

579
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,780
Please give them a round of applause.

580
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,238
- Please come here.
- Please go, Teacher.

581
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:37,409
Everyone is waiting for you.

582
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,427
Please.

583
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,880
Say something nice to mark the start of this party.

584
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,929
- Please, Teacher Tian.
- We need the heads for our opening ceremony.

585
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,204
Please, Chief.

586
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:47,771
Join me here.

587
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:49,003
Here they are.

588
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:51,580
Please give them a round of applause.

589
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:53,663
You finally made me do this, Yod.

590
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:56,769
Of course. We need the heads of the party.

591
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,842
How about singing a couple of songs together? To open the dance floor.

592
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:01,297
Please.

593
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:04,189
Hello. Mic check.

594
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:05,656
Hello.

595
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,541
Hello.

596
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,663
Hello.

597
00:40:08,663 --> 00:40:09,953
It isn't working, Yod.

598
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:11,671
Let me check.

599
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:12,909
Wait.

600
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,314
Hello. Hello. One, two, three. It's working now.

601
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,336
Try again.

602
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,639
Hello.

603
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,854
It's not working again.

604
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:26,752
Well, let Chief sing alone then.

605
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,966
No, Tian.

606
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,956
- You sing.
- I won't.

607
00:40:31,956 --> 00:40:36,399
- You sing.
- You sing.

608
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:40,647
Well, Chief, Teacher, let's not argue.

609
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,588
You sing then.

610
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,040
Take care of it.

611
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,723
I was about to turn the music on.

612
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:53,151
What should I do?

613
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,385
Well...

614
00:40:55,944 --> 00:40:58,013
- You can play the guitar. Right?
- Yes.

615
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:00,663
- Can you sing?
- Yes.

616
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:04,217
Okay. Nice. Here we go. No problem.

617
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,304
Can you please hold the mic for me?

618
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:09,304
Excuse me.

619
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,781
Hello.

620
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:18,551
Hello, everyone. I'm Pran.

621
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:24,683
Actually, my boyfriend and I also fought about who fell for the other first.

622
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:27,768
But in the end, it isn't important.

623
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:31,576
What matters more is that we love each other.

624
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,834
That's why I wrote this song.

625
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:37,108
Check it out.

626
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:53,689
♫ So what if you catch me looking at you ♫

627
00:41:53,689 --> 00:41:58,770
♫ Isn't it you who liked to look at me first? ♫

628
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:03,540
♫ No need to wonder why I take care of you ♫

629
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,525
♫ Well, isn't it you? Don't you remember? Who liked me first ♫

630
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:11,227
♫ Don't think that you can hide it well ♫

631
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:13,737
♫ I can hear your thoughts by your eyes twinkling ♫

632
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:16,334
♫ If you feel the same, just give me a signal ♫

633
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,764
♫ Just come closer without saying a word ♫

634
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:21,280
♫ If you feel it, I'm down with it ♫

635
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,797
♫ Come on, don't be shy. Don't have to come close ♫

636
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:28,374
​♫ Well, let's just say I'll keep it a secret ♫

637
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:33,106
♫ Okay, I won't tell anyone that you had feelings for me first ♫

638
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:38,700
♫ Okay, I won't tell anyone that you liked me first ♫

639
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:41,520
♫ I'll keep it just between us, it's a secret that only we'll know ♫

640
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,425
♫ Top secret just for the two of us ♫

641
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:53,173
♫ I won't tell anyone that you liked me first ♫

642
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:59,313
♫ Just making eye contact like this makes it feel so good ♫

643
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:01,682
♫ This kind of thing is known to only two people ♫

644
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:07,416
♫ It's a love that only you and I know ♫

645
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,670
♫ Just you and me ♫

646
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,044
Let's go home, Teacher.

647
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:13,490
- We'll walk you home.
- You're too drunk.

648
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,877
- I can drink more.
- You can't. Let's go.

649
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,511
I'll take him home.

650
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:23,764
- Come.
- Please do.

651
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,995
Are you all right?

652
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:30,746
That looks like a good sign.

653
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:32,227
Wow.

654
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:34,448
Your song worked.

655
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,759
Let's follow them.

656
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:42,793
Hey, go.

657
00:43:46,753 --> 00:43:49,340
Who allowed you to get this drunk?

658
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,903
I thought about our past days when we still sang together.

659
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:58,474
Who would know we wouldn't get to sing together anymore?

660
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,841
Who said that?

661
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,936
We have a lot more time together if you still want to sing with me.

662
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:06,371
Do you want to?

663
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:10,501
Hey, let me ask you something.

664
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:12,041
What is it?

665
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:15,577
When you sang that rosy cheeks song that day,

666
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:18,378
you tried to hit on me. Right?

667
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:25,667
You're right. I did.

668
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,367
Pomeranian.

669
00:44:29,147 --> 00:44:32,794
What about you? Did you like me then?

670
00:44:34,184 --> 00:44:37,245
I threw myself at you that much. Couldn't you tell?

671
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:51,755
I think you should sleep here tonight.

672
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,815
Look at you now. I don't think we can continue to my house.

673
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:57,424
Thank you, Chief.

674
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:02,589
Chief,

675
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:06,090
set up a mosquito net...

676
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,610
in the house for me today.

677
00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:16,183
Should I do that, Tian?

678
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:19,129
Pat and Pran will be back soon.

679
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:21,070
They're enjoying themselves there.

680
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:23,500
They won't be here that soon.

681
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:33,170
Tian,

682
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:35,682
what's that letter?

683
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:39,966
Where?

684
00:45:42,855 --> 00:45:43,990
[Mailbox]

685
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:50,666
It's from my mom.

686
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:56,169
I think she's asking me to go back and celebrate my birthday as she does every year.

687
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,357
I guess I have to go alone again this year.

688
00:46:15,604 --> 00:46:17,968
I'm going back.

689
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:23,601
Fine. Go back and drink with your friends.

690
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:26,943
I won't sleep.

691
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:31,300
I'll pack tonight and leave early in the morning to see my mom.

692
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,686
What?

693
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,895
Why does Teacher Tian have to be sulking now?

694
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:47,054
Let's do this.

695
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,818
You go talk to Chief Phu. Do whatever you can to calm him down.

696
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:52,470
I'll talk to Teacher Tian.

697
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,980
Go.

698
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:07,795
I drank it up.

699
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,331
This one is still full.

700
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:15,498
Yod.

701
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:16,630
Enough.

702
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,633
You're too drunk. I'll walk you home.

703
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,337
Let's go.

704
00:47:21,337 --> 00:47:23,250
- I won't go back.
- Hurry up.

705
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,108
Wait, Chief.

706
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,692
Where are you going?

707
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:28,935
Stay here and drink with me first.

708
00:47:28,935 --> 00:47:31,611
Can you stop messing with me already?

709
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:34,942
I will have someone send you home tomorrow.

710
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:37,715
All right, then. Let's do a challenge.

711
00:47:37,715 --> 00:47:40,670
If I lose, I agree to go home,

712
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,980
and I won't bother you anymore.

713
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:45,793
What if you win?

714
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:47,616
If I win,

715
00:47:49,023 --> 00:47:52,292
you must sign the form allowing me to use your story for our play.

716
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,090
I knew you were going to say this.

717
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,990
I won't join the challenge.

718
00:47:56,378 --> 00:47:58,078
Why?

719
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:00,759
Or are you afraid of losing?

720
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,533
But that's understandable, Chief.

721
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:06,502
Everyone knows I'm the Engineering top-notch.

722
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,649
You probably don't know yet that I'm the Pha Pun Dao top-notch.

723
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:15,280
Pha Pun Dao.

724
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,196
We'll see who the real top-notch is.

725
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,629
- Yod.
- Yes.

726
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:25,923
Come. I'll be the judge.

727
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:30,401
Hey, pour the drink for him.

728
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:33,694
You do it.

729
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:37,537
For Chief, too.

730
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:39,537
Let's find out today

731
00:48:39,537 --> 00:48:45,460
if an Engineering student or a Pra Pirun ranger will win.

732
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,960
All right.

733
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:54,581
Drink it up!

734
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,878
Teacher, calm down. Okay?

735
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:06,514
Chief Phu probably has his reason why he isn't going with you.

736
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,047
What reason?

737
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:11,226
I've been yielding to him all the time.

738
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:14,376
He hasn't done that for me even once.

739
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,527
Both the thing about my parents and about who had feelings for the other first.

740
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:21,743
He's still trying to beat me.

741
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:24,556
I'm discouraged. I'm already tired.

742
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,871
Teacher, love is about feelings.

743
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:34,006
There isn't evidence to prove who feels it first.

744
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:36,366
Damn it.

745
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:39,411
I shouldn't have written it in the diary.

746
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,883
Evidence?

747
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:51,849
Evidence?

748
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,411
I have evidence.

749
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:04,370
Chief wrote in Teacher Torfun's diary that he liked me first.

750
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:10,206
In Teacher Torfun's diary?

751
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:12,900
Where is it?

752
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,798
At Pha Pun Dao.

753
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:17,782
I buried it there.

754
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,320
We must get that diary.

755
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:22,418
Teacher.

756
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:24,607
Teacher!

757
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:26,403
Stop!

758
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:28,490
Calm down for now.

759
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,682
If you have to go up there to get it,

760
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:33,389
how about going tomorrow instead?

761
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:35,889
- Nope.
- It's already late.

762
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:38,249
If you go now, you'll certainly get lost.

763
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:39,449
I'll go today.

764
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:41,396
- Hello, there.
- What?

765
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:45,369
Kampung?

766
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:48,914
Why do you keep showing up at this kind of moment? Are you a ninja?

767
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:51,530
I'm worried about Mr. Tian, so I'm here to see him.

768
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,684
You want to go to Pha Pun Dao. Right?

769
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:57,025
I can accompany you. I know the direction.

770
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:58,890
- Really?
- Yeah.

771
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,232
- Let's go. What are we waiting for?
- Teacher. Seriously?

772
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,147
- Teacher.
- Let's go now, Kampung.

773
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:10,847
Teacher.

774
00:51:22,397 --> 00:51:25,674
I think we've had enough, youngster.

775
00:51:25,674 --> 00:51:28,653
How many points did I get last night?

776
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:37,109
Shit!

777
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:38,709
Chief!

778
00:51:44,054 --> 00:51:46,345
Does this mean last night...

779
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:51,730
- Last night, we...
- Chief.

780
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,878
Let me prepare myself for it first.

781
00:51:58,259 --> 00:52:00,367
Let's do this, Chief.

782
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,065
I'll count from one to three, and we look under at the same time.

783
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,204
One.

784
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:07,804
Two.

785
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:10,353
Three.

786
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,462
Have you got up?

787
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:22,438
Oho. It's already morning.

788
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,985
Have you sobered up?

789
00:52:24,985 --> 00:52:29,009
Last night, all of us were wasted.

790
00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:35,691
We danced all out before coming back here.

791
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,039
Does that mean we tied last night?

792
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:44,389
I guess we did, Chief.

793
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:48,119
Or should we do another challenge tonight?

794
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:52,330
I have work to do. I'm not free as you kids are.

795
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,056
You said that again.

796
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,798
You keep saying I'm a kid.

797
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,691
Where is my tee?

798
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:02,751
Where is it?

799
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:05,870
You can't remember?

800
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:09,422
Last night, you took off your tee and went all out dancing.

801
00:53:09,422 --> 00:53:13,307
Your tee was at the party. You didn't bring it with you.

802
00:53:13,307 --> 00:53:15,931
Take it. Put this on.

803
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:17,721
You put it on first.

804
00:53:20,216 --> 00:53:22,073
Isn't this a forest officer's T-shirt?

805
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,188
It's illegal to wear this, isn't it?

806
00:53:24,188 --> 00:53:25,720
What are you afraid of?

807
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,640
The officers' wives here wear them all the time.

808
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:29,769
I'm not your wife.

809
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,360
I didn't hear anything.

810
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:39,026
He keeps talking about being a kid and a wife.

811
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:45,421
Please spread the news.

812
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:48,822
Search for them around the village. Take care of it for me.

813
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,206
Chief.

814
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:54,792
- Chief.
- What's going on, Yod?

815
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:57,267
Villagers told me Kampung had disappeared since last night.

816
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,861
He said he was going to Teacher Tian's place, but we can't find him there.

817
00:54:00,861 --> 00:54:02,361
What?

818
00:54:07,826 --> 00:54:09,368
Pran.

819
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:11,068
Kampung.

820
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:14,242
Pran. Pran.

821
00:54:17,478 --> 00:54:18,978
Pran!

822
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:22,842
Pran is gone too, Chief.

823
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,886
Or did he return to Bangkok with Teacher Tian?

824
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:35,705
Not yet.

825
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,593
His heart disease pill is still here.

826
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,787
I think they just went nearby.

827
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:46,719
Chief!

828
00:54:47,926 --> 00:54:50,314
I searched for them all around the village, but couldn't find them.

829
00:54:50,314 --> 00:54:52,554
I asked others, but nobody saw them.

830
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,550
Or...

831
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:02,744
You three go that way.

832
00:55:02,744 --> 00:55:03,916
You two go there.

833
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:06,438
Okay. Keep me updated.

834
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,520
How is it going, Yod?

835
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,638
They aren't at the waterfall.

836
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,873
If they aren't at the waterfall,

837
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,878
the only place they could be at is...

838
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,641
Pha Pun Dao.

839
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,680
You must be right.

840
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,520
Pran said he wanted see it with his own eyes.

841
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:33,798
I hope what I said isn't true.

842
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:35,727
Why, Chief?

843
00:55:36,257 --> 00:55:40,226
The route is in poor condition now. Nobody has gone up there recently.

844
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,322
Kampung, how far is it from here?

845
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:51,781
It won't take long.

846
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,138
Teacher, walk carefully.

847
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:56,130
Teacher, be careful.

848
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:04,158
[Route closed for safety. Don't go up.]

849
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:14,226
What a waste of time.

850
00:56:14,226 --> 00:56:16,260
What should we do?

851
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:20,667
Let's go back now, Teacher. We can come to get it tomorrow morning.

852
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:24,712
Nope. We're already here.

853
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:29,248
If we can't take this route, we can go another way.

854
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:30,532
Can we, Kampung?

855
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:34,205
Dad told me we can also take the bamboo forest shortcut.

856
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:35,683
Let's go.

857
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,683
Go.

858
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:49,210
I think this place looks familiar.

859
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:55,474
Chief told me that the hornbill is a faithful animal here.

860
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:56,985
Come on.

861
00:56:56,985 --> 00:57:00,309
I could tell from the start that he was obviously trying to hit on me.

862
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:04,329
Teacher!

863
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:14,192
Bro, be careful.

864
00:57:14,192 --> 00:57:16,451
Teacher.

865
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,880
Gosh!

866
00:57:21,778 --> 00:57:23,770
So who is actually drunk?

867
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,710
You didn't walk carefully.

868
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:29,853
Let's go now, Kampung.

869
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:32,223
We're taking a bamboo forest shortcut.

870
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:35,424
We'll arrive at the entrance to Pha Pun Dao in no time.

871
00:57:35,424 --> 00:57:36,824
Really?

872
00:57:41,522 --> 00:57:44,536
- Which way, Kampung?
- This way.

873
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,311
Pran.

874
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:48,428
Tian.

875
00:57:48,428 --> 00:57:50,657
- Pran!
- Tian!

876
00:57:50,657 --> 00:57:52,257
Kampung!

877
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,217
Pran!

878
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:56,388
Tian!

879
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:58,239
- Kampung, where are you?
- Pran!

880
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:00,819
Let's go in different directions to search for them.

881
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:02,989
- Pran!
- Tian!

882
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:05,307
Pran!

883
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:09,898
Yod, I'll go down there to check.

884
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:11,707
Okay.

885
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,768
- Pran.
- Tian

886
00:58:13,768 --> 00:58:15,368
Pran.

887
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:16,689
Kampung.

888
00:58:16,689 --> 00:58:18,289
Pran.

889
00:58:20,449 --> 00:58:21,716
- Kampung, where are you?
- Pran!

890
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:23,490
[Route closed for safety. Don't go up.]

891
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,990
Pran!

892
00:58:30,013 --> 00:58:31,613
Pran!

893
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:34,797
Kampung!

894
00:58:34,797 --> 00:58:36,397
Pran!

895
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:40,736
Pran!

896
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:55,098
- This is Pran's watch.
- Let me see.

897
00:58:59,426 --> 00:59:01,306
This is Pran's watch.

898
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:06,119
This means Teacher Tian and Pran walked past this area.

899
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:10,421
I think they headed to Pha Pun Dao for sure.

900
00:59:11,777 --> 00:59:14,193
But the main route is worn out.

901
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:21,451
Pran!

902
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:29,326
I think they're lost in the forest.

903
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,949
Do you know what's inside the forest?

904
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:43,464
If you mess up, I'll leave you there.

905
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:45,218
Chief, you're the cutest.

906
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:46,356
Why are we back here?

907
00:59:46,356 --> 00:59:50,077
I made a map for every forest ranger, and I asked them to make one for you.

908
00:59:50,077 --> 00:59:52,437
Where's the map?

909
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:54,216
Teacher!

910
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,028
Ow! Chief!

911
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:58,670
Don't move. I'll do it for you.

912
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,064
Don't worry.

913
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:02,276
Chief will come to help us.

914
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:09,112
Teacher, hang in there.

915
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:14,182
- Do these belong to those two?
- I don't think so.

916
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:16,445
I think they belong to a tiger.

917
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,030
"One Word" - Ohm Pawat

918
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:34,910
♫ If you didn't have me around, you'd still be miserable ♫

919
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:39,990
♫ If you didn't miss me, who would you miss? ♫

920
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:44,870
♫ If I don't take care of you, you'd be sad ♫

921
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,680
♫ If you didn't love me, who would you love? ♫

922
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,690
♫ Did you think you were just a friend? ♫
♫ Is it okay if I don't have you? ♫

923
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:59,700
♫ But every time we're far apart from each other,
I'm the one who feels like dying ♫

924
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,650
♫ I know how important you are ♫
♫ Without you, I can't live ♫

925
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,140
♫ I love you to death ♫

926
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:14,390
♫ Don't get bored just yet, having to look at the same person ♫

927
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:19,470
♫ Because truly, I can't be without you ♫

928
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:24,230
♫ I really can't live without you ♫

929
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:28,190
♫ I give up and surrender to you ♫

930
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:34,460
♫ Don't get bored just yet, having to hear the same old words ♫

931
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:40,760
♫ Because I really can't think of anything that really needs to be said ♫

932
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,760
♫ The words I really want to say ♫

933
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:51,920
♫ Are nothing but the words of love ♫
