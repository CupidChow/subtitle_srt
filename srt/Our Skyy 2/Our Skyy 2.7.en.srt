00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,271
Are you Puen?

2
00:00:01,271 --> 00:00:04,440
Congratulations on your international film.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,722
Lay, don't go too far. It's dangerous.

4
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:10,600
Do you believe in reincarnation?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,805
You're not Tess. You're someone else.

6
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:16,673
You had an accident and woke up in a stranger's body in a world

7
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:19,176
that looks familiar, but is not really home.

8
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:21,711
It took you so long to come back, Tun.

9
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,420
You're not Tun, are you?

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,330
To our universal-traveling friendship.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,507
Do you think I will?

12
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:31,670
Even if I wake up one day and go back to my old life,

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,400
that's still my life, isn't it?

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,497
When you go back to your universe, your life won't be the same.

15
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:37,954
But I have you.

16
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,961
Do you know what's the first thing I'll say to you if we meet in our universe?

17
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:42,121
What?

18
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,249
Dang!

19
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:44,749
Dang!

20
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,679
I won't leave you again.

21
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,571
I promise.

22
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:53,271

32
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:42,673

[16 hours ago]

50
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,040
Since we returned to this universe,

51
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,251
this is already the fifth year Talay and I have been living together.

52
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:35,113
What's this script about? Zombie-related, huh?

53
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:40,005
Look at you. You've been up all night working on this script for a week already.

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,190
Here. I really want to drink the coffee made by you, Talay.

55
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,330
We have been camping in another province today,

56
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,520
celebrating my birthday as Talay had planned.

57
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:55,692
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

58
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,620
But it's all because of me.

59
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,800
I haven't finished writing the script.

[X Producer]

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,160
Also, Talay was just been assigned the project for the film festival he has been waiting to join,

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,302
so he needs to quickly finish all his work.

63
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,322
Sure.

64
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:19,046
So, my birthday day trip ends up as a small dinner at home tonight.

65
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,775
[I'm working. Do not disturb.]

66
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,760
Talay, are done working? It's nearly 9:00 p.m. now.

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,072
- Huh? It's nearly 9:00 p.m?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,761
Shit.

69
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,841
I still need to edit my work a bit.

70
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,474
Arrange the table while you wait for me.

71
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:51,532
Come on. I finished that a long time ago.

72
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,615
That's for wasting your time.

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,485
Happy now?

74
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:10,835
Not yet. I want more.

75
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,835
My time is so costly.

76
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:14,364
You're too demanding.

77
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:16,063
Go wait inside the house.

78
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:19,300
I'll finish it quickly. I'll be there real soon.

79
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:24,649
Wait, Puen.

80
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,960
I ordered the cake.

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,500
Go get it for me. The delivery man is already here.

82
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:02,960
I thought you wouldn't give me a surprise.

83
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,866
You're waiting for a surprise from us?

84
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:10,781
[I'm working. Do not disturb.]

85
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:36,514
Hasn't Talay come out to eat anything?

86
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,360
He hasn't finished his work yet.

87
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,279
He told me he would finish it since the evening.

88
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,979
Are you two having a conflict?

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,865
There's nothing much, actually.

90
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,960
It's just that we both have too much work to handle recently,

91
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,520
so we don't have time to talk to each other.

92
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,081
Though we're living in the same house, we rarely see each other.

93
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,929
He's working in there, while I'm working in my room.

94
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:02,871
Today is my birthday.

95
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:05,872
We initially wanted to go on a trip, but it didn't go as planned.

96
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,300
We end up staying home.

97
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,503
But it's lucky for you two anyway,

98
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,343
or else I wouldn't be here when you came to surprise me.

99
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:19,060
But it should have been me who's lucky, shouldn't it?

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,161
I even stayed up all night, finishing my work this whole week

101
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:24,191
to go on a trip with him.

102
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:27,151
Sounds like you're not having that many problems.

103
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:31,978
Puen, I actually want to keep you company,

104
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,347
but I have an appointment with my sister.

105
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:39,403
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

106
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:43,249
Yeah.

107
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,155
That's fine. Go ahead.

108
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:48,078
Are you all right?

109
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:50,326
Thank you so much, guys.

110
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,213
You can stay here, right?

111
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,173

Yes.

114
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:20,120
I sent it just now.

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,020

Puen, I'm really sorry.

123
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:25,671
From now on, I'll manage my schedule better.

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,171
Are you tired? Aren't you hungry?

125
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,223
Don't be like this.

126
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,155
It's my fault.

127
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,169
To be honest, Talay,

128
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:57,363
I didn't want you to leave your work for my birthday dinner,

129
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:03,079
but have you noticed that we haven't talked much recently?

130
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:13,938
Even though we're living in the same house, I rarely see you some days.

131
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:16,823
I'm really sorry.

132
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,761
Just forget about it.

133
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:26,525
Well then,

134
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,150
I will come up with a new excuse.

135
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,689
How?

136
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,749
Well,

137
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,398
I couldn't celebrate your birthday on time,

138
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:48,720
so let's change from a birthday to a hug day.

139

From now on,

140
00:10:56,338 --> 00:11:01,422

How is it?

143
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,763
Does my idea sound like I'm so madly in love?

144
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,311
Just this? You call this madly in love?

145
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:26,555
Let's wait and see who will be more madly in love.

Sure.

355
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:12,855
That sounds good.

356
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,970
Jigsaw, let's go out.

357
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,987
Aww. You're so cute. What's your name?

358
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:32,875
Jigsaw?

359
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:45,824
Hey. What's wrong?

360
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,586
Puen and I just settled our problem.

361
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:51,880
And now what? A kid suddenly showed up.

362
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,957
Hey, come on. You'd better turn a crisis into an opportunity.

363
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,511
Puen and you can take care of the kid.

364
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:03,233
You will become such a happy family. Don't you like it?

365
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:05,103
Things will keep getting better.

366
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:08,218
I'm afraid a crisis will turn into a disaster.

367
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:12,375
I'm already having problems balancing time with Puen and work.

368
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:19,461
Anyway, his parents must be looking for him.

369
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,542
Jigsaw probably won't stay with me long.

370
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:26,201
Jigsaw is back.

371
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,687
Go. I can't carry you any longer.

372
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,258
Come. Let's eat. Are you hungry?

373
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:36,216
What did the police say?

374
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,978
They haven't been informed of any missing children recently.

375
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:41,842
They recorded it in their incident report.

376
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:43,949
I think we must look after Jigsaw for a while.

377
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,782
Wait until someone contacts us.

378
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,540
Can the two of us handle him?

379
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,620
It's not that we haven't raised any kids before,

380
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:55,389
but how can we find time for him?

381
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,394
We'll manage to find time for him.

382
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:00,286
Plus,

383
00:32:01,824 --> 00:32:05,198
I don't want him to feel that he's alone.

384
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:13,363
You know what I mean, don't you?

385
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,225
Yeah.

386
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,254
You bought a lot of stuff, so you're well-prepared.

387
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:31,752
Hey. Come and eat mookata with us.

388
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:34,816
We're almost done eating all of it while you stand there talking.

389
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:41,220
Hurry up. It's super delicious.

390
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,738
Let's grill them all.

391
00:32:43,738 --> 00:32:45,641
Do it yourself.

392
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,921
- Are you full?
- Full already?

393
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:53,180
I'm eating pork, not vegetables.

394
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,620
Why are you dumping vegetables in?

395
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:00,626
Everyone has to wait for you while you eat.

396
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:02,691
I like it medium rare.

397
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,544
- Dip into the sauce.
- Sauce into the dip.

398
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:08,020
Dip into the sauce.

399
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,260
That's mine. Mine.

400
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,360
Grill the new one.

401
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,860
Five-year-old kids enjoy drawing,

402
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,240
so I bought a lot of colored chalk for Jigsaw to use.

403
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,629
It seems he really enjoys it.

404
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,786
He keeps drawing and coloring, like what I did as a kid.

405
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,141
Wait.

406
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,595
Two suspects you secretly had a kid.

407
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:39,234
Did you do it?

408
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:41,528
What nonsense are you talking about?

409
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:43,492
I told you I never did that.

410
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:44,985
Why? Or did you?

411
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,808
Nope.

412
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,118
You said Jigsaw is five years old.

413
00:33:50,118 --> 00:33:52,312
When he was born,

414
00:33:52,312 --> 00:33:54,808
we were not back to this universe yet.

415
00:33:56,194 --> 00:33:58,194
Shit.

416
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,921
Why are you searching for the news about me?

417
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:15,723
What if this kid's dad isn't you but Pakorn?

418
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:17,252
Isn't this a coincidence?

419
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:22,121
A five-year-old boy suddenly showed up in front of our house, calling us Papa.

420
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:24,744
The timelines match.

421
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:29,840
Talay, how could you imagine things this far?

422
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,585
See? I was always busy with work back then.

423
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:46,160
If someone like me was flirting with anyone,

424
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,100
I would certainly be on tons of news.

425
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:52,042
Pakorn took such good care of my body.

426
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:55,162
Wait. Look at this news.

427
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:57,543
Sounds possible?

428
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:00,157
"Puen on a luxurious dinner date with a famous leading actress."

429
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:02,740
"Or are they a real couple off-screen?"

430
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:06,310
That's the news from a long time ago.

431
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,780
It was even before I traveled to that universe.

432
00:35:10,097 --> 00:35:12,437
You told me you had never been in a relationship, didn't you?

433
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:15,674
I had never been in a relationship.

434
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:20,868
Do you think someone like me would date whoever was sitting next to me? Huh?

435
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:34,780
Also, I don't think Pakorn is that type of person.

436
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:37,835
It could be Tess.

437
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,718
"Manager to part ways from an actor."

438
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:58,307
"Rumor has it that she's having a child, so she will resign to start a family."

439
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,443
That manager?

440
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:06,819
Or...

441
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:10,020
was it Tess's doing?

442
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,331
It's really Tess.

443
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:28,442
Does this mean Jigsaw is my son?

444
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,419
I don't have any savings.

445
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,676
How can I raise him?

446
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:43,616
Shit. I need to call my mom.

447
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,037
Hey. Calm down.

448
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,440
Listen to me carefully.

449
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,094
The manager mentioned in this news is Belle.

450
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,233
He's my former manager.

451
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:07,897
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I was so shocked.

452
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,160
Papa.

453
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
Yeah?

454
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:16,742
Whoa. It's so lovely.

455
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,605
Who's this?

456
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:26,480
Papa.

457
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,660
- This one is also Papa, right?
- Yep.

458
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,525
What about this one?

459
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,325
Jigsaw.

460
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:44,987
Airplane!

461
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:49,470
What? Why don't you eat it?

462
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,659
Papa Puen isn't eating.

463
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,562
Whoo-hoo.

464
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:01,926
I'm eating now.

465
00:38:06,877 --> 00:38:10,371
Good job. You finished it before Brother Puen.

466
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,328
Who did you call Brother? I'm Papa Puen.

467
00:38:13,328 --> 00:38:14,928
Right?

468
00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:25,799
Give me one airplane.

469
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,004
How old are you now?

470
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:31,259
Papa Talay.

471
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,137
Give Baby Puen an airplane.

472
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:38,771
Please. I want it, Papa.

473
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:41,221
Our feeding day has passed.

474
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:43,481
I'm sorry, Puen.

475
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:46,344
But you fed Jigsaw.

476
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:49,480
Please. Give me one airplane.

477
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,576
Please.

478
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,180
Here.

479
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,385
Yours must be a rocket.

480
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:09,521
Since you're spoiling me this much, it must be snowing in this universe.

481
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:16,864
Papa Talay is this kind, so I guess I must give him a prize.

482
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,640
Don't. The kid is here.

483
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,775
- He won't see it.
- Don't.

484
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,565
Papa!

485
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:27,465
- Yes?
- Yes!

486
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,740
Oh. Let me see what you're doing.

487
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:44,505
Do you remember the first day Jigsaw came to our house?

488
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:49,361
Ever since Jigsaw came, we got to do things together almost every day.

489
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:51,598
What a happy family.

490
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,840
It's your turn to rest.

491
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
What? Damn it.

492
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,400
Jigsaw doesn't listen to us.

493
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,219
Raising a kid is not easy at all.

494
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,519
If we figure out a solution together, everything will get better.

495
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,952
My plan of surprising you that day hasn't been completed yet.

496
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,547
I will take us back to where we were.

497
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,550
♫ Thinking about and reviewing our story ♫

498
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,960
