1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,120
How did we end up here?

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm as confused as you.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,240
Right now, we need to play along. We need to play our roles.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,291
Make it convincing.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,860
♫ Is it just me ♫

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,590
♫ Or is hard to agree ♫

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,080
♫ What you're trying to explain ♫

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,730
♫ I don't mind feather wings nor dia— ♫

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,583
Nueng.

10
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,640
I don't want to wake up yet. I was having a good dream.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,443
What good dream? We are living a nightmare.

12
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:44,260
We are still stuck in the past.

13
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:54,579
It was just a dream?

14
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,352
We are still in this world?

15
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:57,600
Yes.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,737
Everyone here wakes up early. They wake up when roosters start to crow.

17
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,761
It's almost noon now, but you are still sleeping.

18
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,288
I don't care.

19
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:07,080
Here, I am a lord.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,036
I can wake up any time I want. No one would say a thing to me.

21
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,974
Even now.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,113
I want to hold you.

23
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:16,713
Palm.

24
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:24,154
If Petch walked in and saw us together, it would be a problem.

25
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,954
He still believes that I cast a love spell on you.

26
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:33,741
You don't need to cast any spell on me.

27
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:36,031
I'd fall in love with you anyway.

28
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:38,461
You are this cute.

29
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,728
How could I resist your charm?

30
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,719
You need to go out and talk to your servants from time to time.

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,601
They are wary of you.

32
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,230
You need to earn their trust back.

33
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:58,481
I think I need to make Nueng become beloved.

34
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,754
So other servants will not bully you.

35
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,004
Until we can go back to our world.

36
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:04,504
How?

37
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,767
Do you want to know it?

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Palm.

39
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:17,402
I think I have to make you my wife.

40
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:19,444
Have you ever watched a period drama series?

41
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:24,022
In many dramas, the lord makes the servant his wife.

42
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,325
Palm.

43
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,100
Palm.

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,654
Palm.

45
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,893
Palm, that's enough.

46
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:33,622
Stop it.

47
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:36,640
You can't do that. I'm a man.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,040
It's because of viewers like you

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,430
that these dramas display a warning for "viewer discretion advised".

50
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:46,523
Then I think...

51
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:50,145
I need to assign a more important role to you.

52
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:55,520
So other servants will love you like I do.

53
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:58,789
How will you do that?

54
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,260
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,730
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

56
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,890
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,380
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,480
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,860
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,380
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,960
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

62
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:55,470
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

63
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,330
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

64
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,990
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

65
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,830
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

66
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,780
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:24,500
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

68
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:33,210
From now on, I assign Nueng

69
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,520
to teach all the servants how to read.

70
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:41,583
I have taught everything that I know to him.

71
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,464
So he can pass the knowledge on to you.

72
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,451
You will become educated.

73
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:51,527
In the future, it will be useful to you.

74
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:56,266
I order him to teach both Thai and foreign languages to you.

75
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,404
From now on, you should think of him as your teacher.

76
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,993
For those who have a problem with this, you can come to talk to me.

77
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't ever touch Nueng again.

78
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:18,866
Let's start learning a foreign language.

79
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:22,713
The first word is "'hello".

80
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:25,360
Hello.

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,410
Don't be shy. Try to say the word out loud.

82
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,796
Hello.

83
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,827
Hello.

84
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:33,874
"Hello" is the word that foreigners use to greet each other.

85
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,394
When they see each other, they say "hello."

86
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:38,440
The second word is...

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,424
"How are you?"

88
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,681
How are you?

89
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:45,145
Say it again. How are you?

90
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,109
How are you?

91
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,726
"How are you?" means how you are doing.

92
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:53,396
The last word is "thank you".

93
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,967
Thank you.

94
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,406
This word means "thank you".

95
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:01,531
Why don't you try to write them down?

96
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:04,111
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

97
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:45,180
Palm, what are you doing here?

98
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,816
I'm here to play in the water with you,

99
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:49,377
just like we did when we were living in the South.

100
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,912
But this is a canal, not a sea.

101
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,387
It's okay. I don't mind.

102
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:56,854
I focus on the atmosphere.

103
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,932
Do what you want.

104
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,703
Let me wash your hair.

105
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:04,898
This is a boyfriend's duty.

106
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:16,944
Do you know why I came back to Thailand this time?

107
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:19,844
I came back to throw a surprise birthday party for you.

108
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,657
During the past three years,

109
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:26,194
I could only wish you a happy birthday via a video call.

110
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:28,454
This year, I wanted to spend the day with you.

111
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:34,596
Do you know that right now is already your birthday?

112
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,553
That's right.

113
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:43,723
I'm not thinking about celebrating my birthday right now.

114
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:47,670
The most important thing is to find a way to go back to our world.

115
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,257
I get it, but I can't help feeling bummed.

116
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,340
I prepared a lot of things for your birthday,

117
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,460
and I also bought you a gift.

118
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:02,443
It's okay.

119
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:06,682
Having you with me is the best gift.

120
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,972
Hey, Nueng!

121
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,757
Nueng.

122
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:20,898
Where are you? Hey, Nueng.

123
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,317
- Hey, Nueng.
- Yes.

124
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,162
I've been looking for you.

125
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:29,476
I want to ask you about the thing that you taught me today.

126
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,200
The foreign word used for apologizing.

127
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,214
Sor... What is the word?

128
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,980
Sorry.

129
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,794
Sorry.

130
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,952
It means I apologize.

131
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,280
- That's right.
- Sorry means I apologize.

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,852
Thanks a lot.

133
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:49,045
I'll use it when I talk to foreigners at the market.

134
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:52,110
I'm leaving. Thanks again.

135
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,768
Nueng, Nueng, Nueng. I have another question.

136
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,880
What are the foreign words used for expressing our love?

137
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,235
I'm going to say it to Daeng.

138
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:13,130
It will make him fall in love with me.

139
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,870
What are the words?

140
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,100
"I love you."

141
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,720
I love you.

142
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,933
Do I need to do the hand gesture?

143
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,554
It helps emphasize your words.

144
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,709
- Show three fingers like this, right?
- Yes.

145
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,775
All right, I will do it.

146
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:32,885
Thanks a lot. Daeng will fall in love with me because of this.

147
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,791
Thanks a lot.

148
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,205
Daeng, where are you?

149
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:46,976
Palm, you can come out now.

150
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,075
Palm.

151
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,112
Palm.

152
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:05,445
You scared me. I thought something happened to you.

153
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,345
Sorry.

154
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:15,780
Why are you smiling?

155
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,510
I can push your head under the water.

156
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,316
I love you.

157
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,675
Forget it. I'm mad.

158
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,375
I won't help you. Step up by yourself.

159
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,791
I don't get why she has to interrupt us.

160
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,063
We were having a romantic moment.

161
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,379
So? Are you going to continue taking a bath?

162
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:46,532
We are alone now.

163
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,705
I can help apply soap to your body.

164
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:03,418
Where are you going?

165
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,722
That's my business.

166
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:09,565
I saw you kissing the Lord under a tree.

167
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,299
So what?

168
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,225
Are you going to gossip about it with other servants?

169
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,568
Your Lord will be in trouble.

170
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,955
Are you looking for this?

171
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,373
Where did you find it?

172
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:34,940
I saw you and the Lord searching for something under the big tree.

173
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:48,256
I guess it must have been this bracelet.

174
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:54,089
It's mine. Can you give it back?

175
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,689
No.

176
00:11:56,986 --> 00:12:01,809
You need to tell me first why this bracelet is important to you.

177
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:04,070
What do you need it for?

178
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:10,656
It's my family's inheritance. My father gave it to me.

179
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:15,054
You are lying. I know.

180
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,568
Why do you want to know it?

181
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,060
The bracelet is mine and it's important to me.

182
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,155
I want it back. That's it.

183
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:23,140
If it's so important to you,

184
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,520
you need to give me something in exchange.

185
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,876
Petch found the bracelet.

186
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,826
We need to take it back right away.

187
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:37,108
We can't do that. You can't force him to give it back to you.

188
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,452
Why not?

189
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:40,610
He's a servant. I'm his master.

190
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,980
- If he refuses to give it to me, I'll lash him.
- Palm, are you drunk with power?

191
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:49,142
Is the Lord back in your body?

192
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,780
I'm sorry. I just want to go back to our world.

193
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:00,799
I get it, but you cannot do that.

194
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,699
His request is not a big one.

195
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,031
What does he want?

196
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,563
About that...

197
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:14,772
Can you teach me how to make a move on someone?

198
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,339
Who?

199
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,153
The jewelry vendor at the market.

200
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,556
- So you like...
- Yes.

201
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:33,437
I like men, just like you.

202
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:38,120
But I'm not as brave as you to be open about it.

203
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:41,598
I really respect you and the Lord.

204
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:43,996
You both are open about it.

205
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,770
I'm worried if I come out of the closet,

206
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,420
I may be lashed, punished, and accused of doing an immoral act.

207
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,620
I get it.

208
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,480
If you help me,

209
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,810
I promise I will give this bracelet back to you.

210
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,066
Don't worry. I can help you get what you want.

211
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,566
Really?

212
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,709
Is that true?

213
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,659
I feel sorry for him.

214
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,644
We should help him, like we helped Woo and David.

215
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:20,751
That's right.

216
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:25,135
We not only get the bracelet back, but we also help two men to fall in love.

217
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,710
As the old saying goes,

218
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,350
"The greatest good is to help people to fall in love".

219
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:38,004
If we help him, we may get some reward.

220
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:42,842
Our fate may be different from what the fortune teller has predicted.

221
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,831
I hope so.

222
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:47,331
I want to go back and celebrate your birthday with you.

223
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:55,923
I brought paper and a box.

224
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,855
What are you doing?

225
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,266
I brought them from the manor.

226
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:05,441
I want us to write down the reasons why we love each other.

227
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,986
I'll put it in the box and bury it near the tree.

228
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:12,385
If we can go back to our world,

229
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:16,194
I want to come back here again and open the box to read it together.

230
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:22,308
It will be proof that what happens here is real.

231
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,548
Sure.

232
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:31,072
This tree will be a witness to our love vow.

233
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:34,420
Whether it's this or any other lifetime,

234
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,130
I will always want to be with you.

235
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:53,706
♫ Look up to the sky where there are many stars ♫

236
00:15:55,972 --> 00:16:03,943
♫ It can't compare to the love I gave you ♫

237
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:13,311
♫ If the wind and rain were to carry away my love away ♫

238
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:22,070
♫ No matter how far, my love will find you ♫

239
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,033
Is that the vendor?

240
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,762
Yes, sir.

241
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:33,041
You have pretty good taste.

242
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,576
Why, sir?

243
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,180
Am I not a good match for him?

244
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,974
I can't like him?

245
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:40,371
No.

246
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,847
We all have the right to dream.

247
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,307
Dare to dream and you will achieve.

248
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:50,162
I also fell in love with someone who was out of my league.

249
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:53,368
In the end, I could bring him to be by my side.

250
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,436
Who is he?

251
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:57,236
You don't know him.

252
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,510
Forget about it.

253
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,122
Anyway, you need to pretend to be interested in his shop.

254
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:06,264
Ask him about the jewelry.

255
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:09,333
That's a good start. Trust me.

256
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:12,563
Will he know that I like him?

257
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,883
He may think that I'm there to buy the jewelry.

258
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:17,566
You need to give him a flirting sign.

259
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:22,213
Flirting? What does it mean?

260
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:26,394
Give him flirting signs through your eyes, words, and touches.

261
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:29,280
He will be able to feel it.

262
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,873
I used to send flirting signs to someone,

263
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:34,838
but it took him forever to pick up on the signs.

264
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,691
He was stupid.

265
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:41,382
Why don't you walk to him and pretend that you can't put a bracelet on?

266
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:43,434
Then you can ask him to help you put it on.

267
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:45,295
Won't that be too obvious?

268
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:49,354
No. You need to give him a clear sign for him to understand it.

269
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:52,230
If he touches you and does not pull his hand away,

270
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,620
and he looks into your eyes for longer than seven seconds,

271
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,025
it means he likes you.

272
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,651
Lord, sir. Take the umbrella.

273
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,690
Your jewelry is beautiful.

274
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,020
Did you make it yourself?

275
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,925
Yes, I made it myself.

276
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:25,616
Do you like it?

277
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:29,751
Yes. I really do.

278
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,732
Do you like jewelry?

279
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,209
Yeah.

280
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:40,379
Feel free to look around and see what you like.

281
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,488
Don't just stare at me.

282
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,599
One.

283
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,339
Two.

284
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,291
Three.

285
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,140
Four.

286
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:10,781
That's too bad.

287
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,111
I think this one will look good on you.

288
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,222
I can't put it on. Can you help me?

289
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:29,022
Sure.

290
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:44,244
If he touches you and does not pull his hand away,

291
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:47,914
and he looks into your eyes for longer than seven seconds,

292
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:50,491
It means he likes you.

293
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,894
One.

294
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,675
Two.

295
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,222
Three.

296
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:06,665
Four.

297
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,465
Five.

298
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:12,738
Six.

299
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,178
Seven.

300
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,238
I'll take this one.

301
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:30,115
Do you think it looks good on me?

302
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,679
Yes.

303
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,912
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

304
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:09,931

305
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:15,677

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

307
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:25,527
Who taught you this Happy Birthday song?

308
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:29,102
Neung taught us to sing this foreign language song.

309
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:32,726
He said foreigners sing this song on birthdays.

310
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,529
Today is your birthday,

311
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,668
so we, the servants, made these desserts for you.

312
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:40,929
We hope you will like it.

313
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:44,041
Thanks, everyone.

314
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,107
Please make a wish.

315
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,125
For your birthday this year, the wish that you make

316
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,707
or the thing that you want may come true.

317
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,284
Why don't you say your wish out loud?

318
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:05,720
So God will hear it.

319
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,622
Are you teasing me, Nueng?

320
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:10,782
I won't fall for your words again.

321
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:28,059
Palm, I have a birthday gift for you.

322
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,639
What is it?

323
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,838
Do you remember that I wrote a song for you?

324
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:40,322
But there is no piano here, so I wrote a poem for you.

325
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:43,400
It goes well with the atmosphere.

326
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,085
Like an endless beach at night,

327
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:57,234
Like a river stretching out to the mountains and horizon,

328
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:02,197
Your eyes stare into my heart.

329
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:06,954
Whether in the sea, the city, or the mountains.

330
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:11,731
Anywhere you go, I will stay by your side like a shadow.

331
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:16,885
No matter how many rainy seasons or winters have passed, I will stay loyal to you.

332
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:20,857
My heart will remain unchanged in every lifetime.

333
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:28,810
It's beautiful. Thank you.

334
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,290
I have nothing else to give to you.

335
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,730
All I can do is write a poem for you.

336
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,672
It's okay. I fell for you already.

337
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,153
This is a bonus.

338
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:02,564
Actually, I have something to give you.

339
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:06,348
I think it's something that you want.

340
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:15,302
If we put the bracelet on, we should be able to go home.

341
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,438
Let's try it.

342
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:28,181
If we hold each other like that time, will we be able to go back?

343
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,836
I think so.

344
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:33,344
Are you ready?

345
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,898
Yes. I no longer want to be a lord.

346
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:40,563
I no longer want to be a servant.

347
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,043
Why did nothing happen?

348
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,766
Let's try it one more time.

349
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:10,473
This time, we should hold each other tighter.

350
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,050
So tight that our faces are against each other.

351
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,650
Let's try it.

352
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:36,760
Why is it not working?

353
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:40,555
Are we going to be stuck here forever?

354
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,205
Nueng.

355
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,499
If we build a sand pagoda together,

356
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:59,059
we will get to be together again in the next lifetime.

357
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,876
I don't want to stay in this lifetime anymore. I'm sick of it.

358
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:05,316
Can we fast forward to the next lifetime?

359
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:14,364
At least, we did a good thing for someone in this lifetime.

360
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,606
Look there.

361
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:22,647
They are having a sweet love.

362
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,178
Don't you like watching people being in love?

363
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:27,695
I don't want to see it anymore. I want to go home.

364
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:32,280
Who would have thought that a bully like Phum

365
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,860
would have no flirting skills in this lifetime?

366
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,504
I'm curious. If we go back, what will happen between them?

367
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,744
Will they have a sweet relationship like us?

368
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:03,664
Nueng.

369
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:06,308
There.

370
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,168
Those are the thugs that we got into trouble with at the market.

371
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,178
What should we do?

372
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,212
I have a plan.

373
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:19,112
But it's very risky.

374
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:20,766
What plan?

375
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:24,704
We need to create a situation similar to the one that brought us here.

376
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,074
We will pick up a fight with them, so they will come after us.

377
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:32,627
Are you crazy? That's suicide.

378
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:34,720
What else do we have to lose?

379
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,124
I can't take it anymore. This whole interclass love.

380
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:41,673
I've been through a near-death situation before. I'm not afraid of it.

381
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,279
Palm!

382
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:02,742
Hey, asshole.

383
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:06,362
Palm.

384
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,292
What are you doing?

385
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:12,089
We are building the sand pagoda peacefully. Why are you trying to cause trouble with us?

386
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,855
For bad people like you, it's useless to make merit.

387
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:18,367
Who are you? Why are you trying to pick a fight with us?

388
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:20,686
You don't need to know who I am.

389
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:22,799
I need to take revenge on you.

390
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,082
Because you are the reason why we are stuck here.

391
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:28,360
What are you talking about?

392
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,577
What do you mean by stuck here? I have never met you.

393
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,264
How could we have a fight with you?

394
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:36,964
If you really want to have a fight, you can come at me.

395
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:39,064
Don't do it.

396
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,280
Today is a good day.

397
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,960
We came here to make merit. Don't cause any trouble.

398
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,804
I think you remembered the wrong people.

399
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:48,704
It's okay. I'll forgive you.

400
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:50,676
I don't want to commit a sin.

401
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:54,524
You don't want, but I do.

402
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,276
You are not backing down, are you?

403
00:29:08,404 --> 00:29:10,264
You are not backing down, are you?

404
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,075
Nueng!

405
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,925
Run!

406
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:26,925
Palm.

407
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,184
Let's go.

408
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,935
You looked for trouble yourself.

409
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:58,022
You tried to pick a fight with me.

410
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:02,404
Those who obstruct my merit-making will all be sent to hell.

411
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,153
Nueng, are you okay?

412
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:14,625
They are lovers.

413
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:18,138
For heretics like you, I'll give you a chance to be reborn.

414
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:19,920
You can go love each other in the next lifetime.

415
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,332
There's nothing wrong with us being in love.

416
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:24,931
You are just close-minded.

417
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:28,850
No matter how many times you are reborn, you are still an asshole.

418
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,602
Then I hope that in my next lifetime, our paths won't cross again.

419
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:40,685
I'll curse both of you to die together.

420
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,460
Are we back to our world?

421
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,700
Are we home?

422
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:50,831
I'm not dreaming, am I? This is our body. Right?

423
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,411
It was so real.

424
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:59,736
I still remember that we were running away from them in the woods.

425
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:01,736
Feel my heart.

426
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:03,842
It's still beating fast.

427
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,386
Does it mean that our curse is reversed?

428
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:10,565
I will get to be with you. Right?

429
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,246
To be honest, I'm not sure.

430
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:17,964
We found a way to come back to our world.

431
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:20,724
I'm not sure we did reverse our curse.

432
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:30,673
Do you remember the fortune teller told us to go back to where we made our love vow?

433
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:32,457
The big tree.

434
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:35,670
If we find the tree and the box that we buried,

435
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,860
everything should be fine.

436
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:42,110
It's not easy to find the big tree.

437
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,626
The forest.

438
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:52,413
The forst is close to the Thai traditional house.

439
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:56,555
If we can find the house, it will be a good start.

440
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,510
Hey, Palm, I found it.

441
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:18,614
Found what?

442
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:20,424
Your house.

443
00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:22,709
I mean the Lord's house.

444
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,209
Let me see.

445
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:27,366
That's right.

446
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:31,636
That's the stairs where the Lord first met Nueng.

447
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:37,100
This is the ground floor which Nueng used as a classroom for the servants.

448
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:42,724
This is the dock where the Lord and Nueng played in the water together.

449
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:49,335
This is the bedroom where the Lord and Nueng shared intimate moments.

450
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:53,752
You seem to be good at remembering this kind of thing.

451
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:57,718
It's not like that. I'm just curious.

452
00:33:57,718 --> 00:34:02,421
I wonder what happened between Lord Poramet and Nueng after we left.

453
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:06,942
Do you think they got to be together?

454
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,996
According to the fortune teller's words,

455
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:19,457
they would be parted by death.

456
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:50,053
I feel like we just came here a few days ago.

457
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:52,098
Everything is the same.

458
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:55,974
More than 100 years have passed.

459
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,071
The owner must take good care of the manor.

460
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,229
Do you think there is a ghost here?

461
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,710
What ghost? Ghosts don't exist.

462
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,120
Like the ghost in dramas.

463
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,848
I watched it with Aunt Nid.

464
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:32,456
Ghosts stayed in a traditional house to take revenge.

465
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:34,009
They refuse to reincarnate.

466
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,480
You watched too many dramas.

467
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,056
Palm.

468
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:51,741
Palm, what's wrong?

469
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:53,175
Palm.

470
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:56,512
Are you that scared of ghosts?

471
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,212
Palm.

472
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:03,096
It's nothing. I just wanted an excuse to hold you.

473
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,158
You.

474
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:07,887
You always have a way to scare me.

475
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,846
Nueng. Palm.

476
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:14,656
Petch!

477
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,511
Petch?

478
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:22,043
Who is Petch?

479
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:25,419
I'm Phum. Don't you remember me?

480
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,736
I remember.

481
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:32,120
But I...

482
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,621
Your voice sounds similar to the voice of someone I know, so I was surprised.

483
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,202
What are you doing here?

484
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:41,796
The manor is mine.

485
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,700
It's my family's inheritance.

486
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,533
My dad told me that my ancestor was a close servant of Lord Poramet.

487
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:50,392
The first owner of the manor.

488
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:53,774
My ancestor worked for the Lord until he passed away.

489
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:55,692
He didn't have any descendants.

490
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:59,976
He gave the manor to my ancestor and it was passed down to me.

491
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:03,625
Didn't Petch and Kla get to be together?

492
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,691
I don't think it was possible at that time.

493
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,826
I think they got married to a woman and had a family.

494
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:11,415
Wait.

495
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:13,333
What are you talking about?

496
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,766
Petch. Kla. Who are they?

497
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:20,644
What are you doing here?

498
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,960
You are acting suspiciously.

499
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,624
I'm interested in buying this manor.

500
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:29,066
I saw the ad that it's on sale.

501
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:31,956
So I came to check it out.

502
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:36,111
Since we are friends, I'll give you a discount.

503
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:38,714
- Really?
- Yes.

504
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:42,190
How did the Lord die?

505
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:48,814
My grandpa said my great-grandpa told him that the Lord died due to old age.

506
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:51,798
Do you know why he didn't have any descendants?

507
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,344
I heard that...

508
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,133
his lover was one of his male servants.

509
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,486
But their love was forbidden.

510
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,750
Anyway, they were taking care of each other,

511
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,665
until one of them passed away shortly before the other.

512
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,137
Phum.

513
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:25,243
This is Kan, my boyfriend.

514
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:29,320
These are Palm and Nuengdiao, my friends from high school.

515
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,156
Hello. Nice to meet you.

516
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:34,814
You have a good taste in men.

517
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:37,031
Don't tease me.

518
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,406
He is an eligible bachelor.

519
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:41,642
His family has a jewelry export business.

520
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:43,818
I'm a realtor.

521
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:47,384
I had to muster my courage to ask him out.

522
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:50,416
I was waiting for a long time for him to approach me.

523
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:03,049
So this is the beginning of our story.

524
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:07,928
Do you think the messages that we wrote and put in the box are still here?

525
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,565
Let's find it.

526
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,256
I'll search over there.

527
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,071
Is this the spot?

528
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,471
Where?

529
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,075
This is the mark I left.

530
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,316
Here it is.

531
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,260
Let's read each other's messages.

532
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,660
Sure.

533
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,333
"From Palm to Nuengdiao."

534
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:10,913
"Why do I love you?

535
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:13,607
Your smile brightens the world.

536
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:15,953
Although your life is full of unfortunate events,

537
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:19,064
you try to overcome them.

538
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:25,426
You easily trust people because you believe in human goodness.

539
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:27,517
You want people to love you.

540
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:29,466
You eat what other people want you to eat,

541
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,883
though you don't like it.

542
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:34,513
When you eat spicy food, your cheeks turn red.

543
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:36,063
You look cute like a cartoon character."

544
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:37,683
What the hell did you write?

545
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,503
"You like seeing people falling in love.

546
00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:43,157
You are good at singing.

547
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:46,692
When you ride a horse, you look so cool like a prince.

548
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:50,890
You like to have skinship, hugs, and physical touches.

549
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,516
I like it when he does that to me.

550
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:56,572
I admire that you're not afraid to say what you want."

551
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:58,642
Will you be my boyfriend?

552
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:01,981
"I like everything about you."

553
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,590
Are you a writer? I'm moved by your words.

554
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,581
To be honest, there were many other things I wanted to write down,

555
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,841
but I only had one piece of paper.

556
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,561
Now, it's my turn.

557
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:16,056
"From Nuengdiao to Palm."

558
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:22,810
"You changed my world.

559
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,503
I like watching you.

560
00:41:24,503 --> 00:41:26,415
I like looking into your eyes.

561
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:29,151
I like the mole under your eye.

562
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:32,154
I think it's your charming point.

563
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:35,312
I like it when you fight to protect those who are weaker.

564
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:39,720
I like when you play lame jokes.

565
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:42,589
It's your unique characteristic.

566
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:45,530
You pay attention and remember small details.

567
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,230
I like when you wear a Hawaiian shirt.

568
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,503
I like your hairstyle when you worked as my bodyguard.

569
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:54,936
I admire the love that you have for your mom.

570
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:59,324
I like that you are a boyfriend who lets me hug and touch you the way I want,

571
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:01,762
without showing any sign of annoyance."

572
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:07,057
Why didn't you tell me that you liked my hairstyle when I was your bodyguard?

573
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,816
I'll do that hairstyle forever.

574
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:11,499
If I ask you to do that hairstyle, will you do it?

575
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:14,719
For you, I'll do it anytime.

576
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,137
It's so windy as if it will start to rain soon.

577
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:33,340
But it's still sunny.

578
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:38,460
Maybe we successfully reversed the curse.

579
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:45,043
I don't know. We did everything the fortune teller told us to do.

580
00:42:45,785 --> 00:42:48,005
There's nothing else we can do.

581
00:42:50,937 --> 00:42:53,357
Maybe this is the end for us.

582
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:54,830
I don't know.

583
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,520
I think we should focus on today and right now,

584
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,240
and try to take care of each other as best as we can.

585
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:04,334
I hope that we can grow old together like the Lord and his servant.

586
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,716
[Two weeks later]

587
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:54,187
I want to buy this manor to keep as a memory.

588
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,432
My boyfriend is filthy rich.

589
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,168
To be honest, you don't need to go and send me off at the airport. My departure time is late at night.

590
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:18,000
Don't you have to give Tam a ride to buy supplies for the restaurant at 4:00 a.m?

591
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,525
It's okay. I want to send you off.

592
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,575
Because I don't know when I'll get to see you again.

593
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:30,101
About my master's degree plan, have you made up your mind?

594
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:34,853
I'm okay with any choice you choose.

595
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:38,454
I want you to choose the thing that will make you happy,

596
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:42,196
not the thing that you think will make me happy.

597
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,180
I'm sorry.

598
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,652
I have a plan for myself.

599
00:44:55,084 --> 00:44:57,946
It's okay. I understand.

600
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:10,456
What is that?

601
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:13,720
It's my plane ticket. I'm flying with you tonight.

602
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,869
Are you serious?

603
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:19,539
Yes. I'm going to spend time with you for a couple of months.

604
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:22,406
About my business here, I talked to Tam.

605
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:24,623
We will hire some help.

606
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:27,456
I want to get experience living in a new country.

607
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:31,856
I'll find a job as a waiter to earn work experience.

608
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,448
Are you sure?

609
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:40,867
Are you worried about the prophecy?

610
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:42,922
It has nothing to do with the prophecy.

611
00:45:42,922 --> 00:45:44,881
I made up my mind.

612
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:49,056
I think this is a good thing for us.

613
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:53,114
Do you know that I have never traveled abroad?

614
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:55,019
This is my first time.

615
00:45:55,973 --> 00:45:57,711
Don't worry.

616
00:45:57,711 --> 00:46:00,511
I will hold your hand throughout the flight.

617
00:46:04,714 --> 00:46:06,564
Do you feel better?

618
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:10,424
Very, very, very much better.

619
00:46:10,424 --> 00:46:13,534
At first, I wondered how many times I would need to travel through time,

620
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:19,120
or how many lifetimes I would have to live to be able to hold you every day.

621
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:28,438
If I could choose, I would want to go back to 1956.

622
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:32,455
Do you remember that the fortune teller said we were enemies in that lifetime?

623
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:36,358
Why? Are you going to bring your gang members to attack me?

624
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,529
No. I want to have a cool hairstyle like Dang Bailey.

625
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:46,180
Don't you know the phrase "Being my wife means you have to be patient"?

626
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,479
But I don't want to be patient anymore.

627
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:50,519
I have been running for life too many times in this lifetime.

628
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:56,028
If I could go back to the past, I would want to go to war.

629
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:59,284
I want to stab you and the enemies.

630
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,666
Let's just focus on our lives in this lifetime.

631
00:47:09,461 --> 00:47:13,458
I'm glad that in the end, we get to be together.

632
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,619
