Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,200
Let me propose my idea.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,484
Should we talk about a person who's so obsessed with himself

7
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:23,073
that he ignores others around him?

8
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:26,800
But I think we should talk about a person who cares about others too much,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,320
and that violates others' rights.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,950
Do you have that space now?

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,550
Of course.

12
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,642
Can I kiss you?

13
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,792
Who's stopping you?

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,660
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:59,140
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,120
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,750
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,910
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,260
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,870
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,380
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:35,050
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

23
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,670
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,380
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,250
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,220
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,410
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

28
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:06,736
That's enough.

29
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,411
Where are you going?

30
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:13,709
Back to my room. What's the matter with you?

31
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,905
Stay with me.

32
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,328
Please?

33
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:19,828
- Please?
- Beg me some more.

34
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:21,669
Pretty, please?

35
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:24,687
Fine. I'll keep you company as a friend.

36
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,251
But you must let me lie on your lap because I'm sleepy.

37
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,751
Okay?

38
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:36,405
What did you just say?

39
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,232
Why? You won't let me lie on your lap?

40
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:42,446
I will let you lie on my lap,

41
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,652
but you're keeping me company as a what?

42
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,552
As a friend.

43
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,441
What kind of friends kiss each other like that?

44
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,937
Say it again.

45
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,863
What's our relationship?

46
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,931
We're...

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,507
What should we be?

48
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,107
We're...

49
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:07,582
We're friends.

50
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,646
You still won't answer me?

51
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:19,489
Fine, we're boyfriends. Happy now?

52
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,889
Okay.

53
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,065
What's the matter with you?

54
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:30,001
I answered correctly. Why did you kiss me again?

55
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,780
I wasn't punishing you.

56
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:47,682
I was doing my duty as your boyfriend.

57
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,069
Shit, Aye! It's morning.

58
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,440
It's morning?

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,649
We should hurry back to our rooms.

60
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,590
Akk, that's my guitar.

61
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,311
Are you two good now?

62
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,681
- No.
- No.

63
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:32,262
We just ran into each other this morning...

64
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,384
and we talked about the script. Right?

65
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:35,541
Yep.

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,342
Really?

67
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,966
Why didn't I hear you two argue?

68
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:43,481
Normally, your arguments can be heard from kilometers away.

69
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,194
You're exaggerating.

70
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:52,908
Kan.

71
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,703
You forgot your phone.

72
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,860
What are you guys doing so early in the morning? You're such early risers.

73
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,314
Please start the discussion without me. I need to go to the bathroom.

74
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:07,864
Wait, Kan.

75
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:10,333
Your phone.

76
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:16,676
Hey, Kan.

77
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:19,400
Is my phone in my room?

78
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,442
Let's discuss work.

79
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:25,376
See you later.

80
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,247
See you.

81
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,601
So what do you think, Wat? Which team's idea will you choose?

82
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:42,800
I think I'll choose...

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,597
Choose...

84
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,485
Choose...

85
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,366
I choose...

86
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:58,432
If you don't choose now, I'll kick your legs.

87
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,991
- I can't choose.
- What?

88
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:08,282
So I'll combine the scripts from both teams.

89
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,038
Why?

90
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:15,091
Your scripts actually talk about the same thing.

91
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:18,280
Just from different angles.

92
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,244
That's true.

93
00:06:21,244 --> 00:06:25,383
Akk wants to talk about someone who only cares about themselves and nothing else.

94
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:29,612
Our team wants to talk about someone who cares too much about others.

95
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:34,024
Combined with the original plot, it's still the same story.

96
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,259
Who will you cast this time?

97
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:40,986
How about me? I'm available.

98
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:45,640
Thanks, but I prefer someone who's passionate about this topic.

99
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,449
Us two again?

100
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,534
And action!

101
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:07,893
I know there's a thin line between caring and crossing the line.

102
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,899
But I think we should care about other people sometimes.

103
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:15,102
We're humans. It's easy for us to feel and become sensitive.

104
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,808
Think about it. If you're with someone,

105
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,133
and the person you're with never knows what you like or don't like,

106
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,601
how can you stay together?

107
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,280
Don't actions speak louder than words?

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
At least it's better than people who are all talk but no action.

109
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,898
I think caring about others too much

110
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:39,181
and trying to live up to their expectations all the time is too exhausting.

111
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,308
Cue.

112
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,450
If you still have good feelings for each other,

113
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,290
please hug each other tightly.

114
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:08,867
But if you don't want to, you can just walk away.

115
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:44,692
Do you need anything else, Wat?

116
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:48,174
I think I got everything.

117
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,572
This is good, isn't it?

118
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,733
Yeah, it's good.

119
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,975
- Cut!
- Awesome.

120
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,073
Amazing.

121
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:16,231
I really want you to see them hug.

122
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:19,250
They're like two people who truly love each other

123
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,920
but believe in different things.

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,260
It's so touching.

125
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,977
That sounds great, Wat.

126
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:28,580
I don't know if this addition will make it turn out well,

127
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,557
but I can tell from your voice that you're enjoying it.

128
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:34,289
I'm really enjoying it.

129
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,504
Once I finish the editing, I'll send it over so you can take a look.

130
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,204
Of course.

131
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:44,322
By the way, are you sure you won't change your mind about your studies?

132
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,767
I won't.

133
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,263
What did your family say?

134
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:59,997
So, Wat, what are you going to do next?

135
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:06,204
Teacher Sani told me it's fine.

136
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,881
If it doesn't work out, I can start over.

137
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,900
If we still have hope,

138
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,278
we can always start over.

139
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,844
That's true.

140
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:22,180
Anyway, six years flew by, didn't it?

141
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:25,104
Before we knew it, we graduated.

142
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:28,544
When I was still in school, I thought about wanting to graduate every day

143
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,244
so I could wear a university uniform and look cool.

144
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:33,798
But when I really graduated, I felt so empty.

145
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,449
Me too.

146
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,610
But really, I don't think

147
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,820
I could have made it without you guys.

148
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,532
Thank you so much.

149
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:47,785
You don't have to thank me.

150
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,012
You kept me on track, too.

151
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:52,012
Otherwise, who knows where I would have ended up?

152
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:56,239
Thank you so much for helping out with my film,

153
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,502
even though both of you really hate indie films.

154
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:04,160
Come on, Wat. I never said I hated indie films.

155
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,705
I used to not like it

156
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:09,065
but once I started to understand what they were about, I thought they were okay.

157
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,870
I think people hate or are afraid of something...

158
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,191
because they don't really understand it.

159
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:28,387
My mom calls my short film a stupid dream.

160
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,892
Honestly, that's a cool name.

161
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,282
Besides, however stupid that dream might be,

162
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:43,240
if it's your dream we're always willing to support you.

163
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,750
We're so happy...

164
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,500
to be a part of your stupid dream.

165
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:03,321
You guys are ruining my handsome and cool image.

166
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:07,536
That image has been ruined since you came to sit here alone like a sad dog.

167
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,507
- Sad dog?
- Lonely dog.

168
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,612
What's wrong with you? Shut up.

169
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,838
- Akk.
- Yeah?

170
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,238
Come here.

171
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,032
Wear this.

172
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,809
- Let's go out.
- Go where?

173
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,020
I won't tell.

174
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,440
Is this pretty?

175
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,040
Yes.

176
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,145
Let's go.

177
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:04,337
Come on.

178
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,320
I already talked to my mom.

179
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,521
She's okay. Just tell me when you're ready.

180
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:32,651
My mom will pay for everything. We can go study there together.

181
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:40,340
I think...

182
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,366
I want to continue my studies in Thailand.

183
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,526
I'm thinking of applying to universities in the North.

184
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:48,050
But we agreed that you'd come with me

185
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,280
and I already talked to my mom about it.

186
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:56,275
Honestly, if I were to go, my parents would have no objection,

187
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,936
but they wouldn't let your parents pay for me.

188
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,179
I don't want to burden them more.

189
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,207
Akk.

190
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,793
You should go.

191
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:11,309
Go where you want to be. Don't worry about me.

192
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,622
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?

193
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,620
Please, Akk.

194
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,600
- Just go. Don't worry about me.
- Go.

195
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,326
We can talk about this later. There's still a lot of time.

196
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,329
Eat your popsicle. It's melting.

197
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,376
Your mouth is a mess.

198
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,872
Yours too.

199
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,363
Akk!

200
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:39,721
Wipe it for me.

201
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:42,153
- With what?
- Your mouth.

202
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,732
Then we should make it a little messier.

203
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,091
So good.

204
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:25,122
See that broken bridge?

205
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,822
Yes.

206
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:29,313
I see it.

207
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,209
Yes.

208
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,509
What's gotten into you?

209
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:41,112
I just want to hug you and keep this memory. I don't want to forget it.

210
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,196
Then hug me tightly.

211
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,580
- Tighter?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,790
Akk!

213
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,532
- Tight enough now?
- Akk!

214
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,668
Akk, there's a star.

215
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,450
Is there?

216
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:07,420
- Here.
- Yes.

217
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,005
Does it still hurt?

218
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,505
Let me see.

219
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,023
You don't have to take this good care of me.

220
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,823
Don't you like it?

221
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:35,740
It's not that. I like it.

222
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:40,137
But it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes.

223
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,668
So you don't like me taking care of you.

224
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:49,956
Okay. From now on, I'll try not to annoy you.

225
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,589
Can you stop sulking now?

226
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,311
That should help.

227
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,542
You don't know anything.

228
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,173
Come here. I'll show you how it's done.

229
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,933
That's enough, Kan.

230
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,633
That's enough.

231
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:30,534
What did you tell me about us?

232
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:41,148
I think we shouldn't care what the future holds.

233
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,596
Just having each other now is good enough.

234
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,543
That's great.

235
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,839
I really don't want to go back.

236
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,405
Let's go.

237
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,813
Let's show the world The Eclipse.

238
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,981
It's time for the Suppalo Boys to shine.

239
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,316
Let's go.

240
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,418
Happy birthday, buddy.

241
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:34,127
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

242
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:37,619
But, Thua, how can our birthday message be meaningful to him?

243
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,400
It must be a message from that someone.

244
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,229
What did Aye say?

245
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,140
Has he wished you a happy birthday yet?

246
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,327
Just general stuff.

247
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,576
The big director is here!

248
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,706
How are you feeling, Wat? Have you stopped being nervous?

249
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,879
You wish.

250
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:59,420
I'm even more nervous now.

251
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,124
Guys, don't forget that we're going to celebrate both Akk's birthday

252
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:06,760
and your film's win today.

253
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,799
We'll go all out.

254
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,607
No one can skip drinking.

255
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:15,736
Teacher Sani is here. I'll go get her.

256
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:17,120
Okay.

257
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:20,922
I'm excited for him.

258
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:31,704
Sorry. I had to do some errands for my mom.

259
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:37,031
What's wrong?

260
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:39,397
Nothing.

261
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:41,646
- Shall we go in?
- Let's go.

262
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,723
- Let's reserve our seats.
- I'm so tired.

263
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,223
Let's go.

264
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,544
- Aye.
- Yeah?

265
00:19:54,394 --> 00:20:00,616
- Tonight, there will be a party celebrating Wat's win and...
- Shit. I forgot.

266
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:05,233
I have an appointment with my mom. We need to discuss my university admission.

267
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,033
What should I do?

268
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,475
If you have somewhere to be, you can go.

269
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,895
If you have somewhere to be, you can go.

270
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:14,037
But tell Wat your reason.

271
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:16,096
I'm sure he's a reasonable person.

272
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,055
Sure.

273
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,593
Wait, Akk.

274
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,837
I want to talk about our song.

275
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:33,744
Can we postpone it?

276
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:36,290
Can we continue writing it when I'm free?

277
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,616
Of course.

278
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,000
If you have something to do, you can deal with it first.

279
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,439
Anything about me can wait.

280
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,415
My boyfriend is the best.

281
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,915
Let's go.

282
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:09,247
Excuse me for a moment.

283
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,219
Where are you going? Wat's film is about to start.

284
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,970
I'll be right back.

285
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:14,903
What's going on with him?

286
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:17,513
Hey, Kan. What's going on with him?

287
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:20,480
I have no idea. He didn't tell me anything.

288
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,073
- I'll get him back.
- Okay.

289
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:25,790
- I'll come with you.< br> - What?

290
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,173
Don't do this. Can we talk first?

291
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm not okay with you breaking up with me over text.

292
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,421
Let's talk.

293
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,184
Are you okay?

294
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:02,071
This is the longest I've talked to someone. Three days.

295
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,165
This person just broke up with me and blocked me on LINE.

296
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:07,196
Not even an explanation.

297
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:12,949
How about you try to let it go?

298
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:15,329
It's not that easy.

299
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:19,939
I keep getting hurt the same way that I've lost my confidence.

300
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:23,200
Maybe because I'm not as good as you.

301
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,896
I'm not that good.

302
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,120
I did bad things before,

303
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,662
but I think what's important is how you live among the eyes of your haters.

304
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:38,230
I know it's hard, but you have to do it.

305
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,664
Well said.

306
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:43,496
- Aye!
- What?

307
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,415
You said it so well. I had to give you a reward.

308
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:47,922
Why do I feel redundant here?

309
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:50,858
Come on. Ignore him.

310
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,871
Let's go watch Wat's film.

311
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:10,789
Still feeling stressed?

312
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:13,876
Not at all.

313
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:16,899
My hands are just cold and my heart is beating fast.

314
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:18,648
I'm unapologetically fierce.

315
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,661
The fact that you're joking means you're okay.

316
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:24,891
I hope I'm still okay when this is over.

317
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,976
Did your family come?

318
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,524
It'd be a surprise if they came.

319
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:41,256
We had a horrible fight last night when I invited them.

320
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,258
Give them some time.

321
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:51,364
You have quite a mind of your own.

322
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,720
We should go inside.

323
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,252
Akk and the guys have reserved our seats.

324
00:23:58,252 --> 00:23:59,552
Okay.

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,599

[A short film directed by Wasuwat Kongkiat]

330
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,452
How are you feeling, Wat?

331
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:00,130
Good.

332
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,241
Seeing my own film on a big screen feels so amazing.

333
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,466
I'm happy for you.

334
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,812
What do you think?

335
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:13,136
I think Memory Number 2, Leaving Monkhood, or Unknown Shadow.

336
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,655
One of those three will win this year. Don't you agree?

337
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:18,424
Yeah, I was spying on the teachers' reactions when those films were showing.

338
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:21,209
They were all stunned.

339
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,487
I have to go.

340
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,288
I think I'm doomed.

341
00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:29,296
Come on, Wat.

342
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:33,533
Getting to follow your dream is cool enough.

343
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,233
Let's go.

344
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,963
If you don't win, who will?

345
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:46,936
It is now time for the important announcement:

346
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:54,345

Little Kid From Non Sa-Ard by Siwasit Ponrongnok from Niyomsil school.

350
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,249
Congratulations. I'd like to invite the judge to present him with the award.

351
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,453
Please give a round of applause.

352
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,300
Thank you, Judge.

353
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,001
Congratulations. Please say something about winning this award today.

354
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:44,688

I'd like to invite the judge to present him with the award.

359
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:40,060
Congratulations.

360
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,864
Thank you, Judge.

361
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:43,340
Congratulations.

362
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,330
Please say something about winning this award.

363
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:56,666
This is my first short film.

364
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,292
Sorry.

365
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,992
Our first.

366
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:05,259
It's a story of what we face in real life.

367
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:10,529
Thank you to all my friends for always supporting me.

368
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:12,832
Thank you to my advisor,

369
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,910
Teacher Sani. If you hadn't asked me that day,

370
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:21,106
I wouldn't have made it here today.

371
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:29,413
I also want to thank my family.

372
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:32,733
Even though they don't really approve of me making movies,

373
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:37,814
they secretly transferred me money in the end.

374
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:43,747
Thank you.

375
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,441
Thank you so much. Congratulations.

376
00:28:53,738 --> 00:28:55,986
Yes, yes, yes!

377
00:28:56,924 --> 00:28:59,498
Bravo!

378
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:01,985
He's my friend, guys!

379
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:06,955
Nice speech on the stage.

380
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,083
Thank you.

381
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,249
He's shy.

382
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,883
Can I talk to you?

383
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,481
Of course.

384
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:19,281
Let's wait over there.

385
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:28,946
Even though your movie is not very perfect,

386
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:33,553
I could see the power and sincerity in it.

387
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,753
Thank you.

388
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:39,767
Keep making films. Don't give it up.

389
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,267
I won't.

390
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,750
Your style...

391
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,860
makes me want to introduce you to another filmmaker.

392
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:55,281
P'Nut?

393
00:29:56,513 --> 00:29:58,100
I'm his big fan.

394
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,923
No wonder why your film reminded me of his.

395
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:10,870
Let me tell him about you, then you can reach out to him.

396
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:14,542
I think you guys should know each other.

397
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,035
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:26,785
Thank you.

399
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:32,067
There is our Mr. Director!

400
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,367
We have to celebrate tonight.

401
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:40,181
Guys, I forgot to tell you.

402
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,481
I have an errand with my mom later. Count me out tonight.

403
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:45,211
- But today is...
- I'm sorry.

404
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,431
I'll catch up with you as soon as I'm done.

405
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:50,176
Okay?

406
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:57,241
Yeah. Hurry, go see your mom.

407
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:58,398
Okay.

408
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,998
See you later.

409
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,687
What's wrong with him?

410
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,331
Why didn't he reschedule with his mom?

411
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,620
It's Akk's birthday.

412
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:14,984
Cheers to Wat!

413
00:31:14,984 --> 00:31:17,288
Cheers!

414
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,816
Cast me in your next film.

415
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:26,355
Sure, I'm planning to cast you as a main character.

416
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:28,246
I'm really grateful to you, Teacher.

417
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:30,785
Hey, Akk. Do you want anything else?

418
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,430
I'll order for you.

419
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:35,925
I'm good. Don't worry about me.

420
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:46,035
Hey, Akk. Look at this.

421
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:48,925
Did you see where Aye checked in 20 minutes ago?

422
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:51,868
Why is he there?

423
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:57,618
- I thought he was meeting...
- Maybe he needs to take care of something first.

424
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,971
Probably.

425
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,511
He wouldn't be meeting someone else, would he?

426
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:10,115
I'm just talking nonsense. He wouldn't do that to you.

427
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,238
♫ Who's on your mind right now? Answer me, I wanna know ♫

428
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:57,419

♫ Just because I have you ♫

439
00:33:46,962 --> 00:33:49,129
It's your verse now, Akk.

440
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:02,309
Did you all know about this?

441
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,477
Go up there.

442
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:06,199
Hurry.

443
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,139
Hurry, Akk.

444
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,880
♫ Actually, it's good to have you beside me ♫

445

♫ Say you love each other without me having to ask. That's enough for me ♫

451
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,736
Ma'am. Sir.

452
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:52,365
We are boyfriends.

453
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,327
Last time, you were the only one that pinned it for me.

454
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:00,678
This time, we do it for each other.

455
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:06,484
Do you know how much I like it when the sky is clear like this?

456
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:11,855
But I like it more when you're next to me, Akk.

457
00:35:11,855 --> 00:35:15,059
♫ Just because I have you ♫

458
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:31,814
That's our song. Do you like it?

459
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:33,546
Yes.

460
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,517
Can you give me a reward?

461
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:37,320
What are you talking about?

462
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,519
♫ Just because I have you ♫

463
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,034
No, there are a lot of people here.

464
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:45,637
Just a little peck.

465
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:48,720
Do you want me to kiss your cheek in front of other people?

466
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,844
Ouch. That hurts.

467
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:54,089
We're not "other people".

468
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,500
What do you say?

469
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,970
Do you want me to kiss you in front of them instead?

470
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:05,339
No. I'll kiss your cheek.

471
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,760
Happy now?

472
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,560
I gave you a very special gift.

473
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,711
Can I get more?

474
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:17,730
You're being greedy.

475
00:36:18,414 --> 00:36:22,750
Guys, please excuse us.

476
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:29,515
♫ Just because I have you ♫

477
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:57,115
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

478
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:02,444
♫ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♫

479
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:07,940
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

480
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,002
- Let's sit down.
- I want to eat cake already.

481
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:21,086
Could you give us a graduation blessing?

482
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,329
Of course.

483
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:28,310
People say that life is like a journey.

484
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,510
I want you to keep going forward

485
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,600
to reach each of your destinations or goals.

486
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:41,200
Keep going forward...

487
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,270
without knowing if there's light at the end of the tunnel?

488
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:46,063
Of course.

489
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,046
You guys have done it before.

490
00:37:49,972 --> 00:37:52,540
You have walked out of those dark shadows.

491
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:34,360
If you hadn't posted a picture of the sky that day or written a sad caption,

492
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:37,329
I wouldn't have had the courage to say hi.

493
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:46,329
Even with that courage, you pretended to be Bruce Wayne for a long time.

494
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:50,062
I needed some time, all right?

495
00:38:56,469 --> 00:39:01,110
I never thought that the sky picture I posted...

496
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,640
would lead us so far to this day.

497
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:08,791
I know, right?

498
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:24,928
My heart is sinking a bit now that we really graduated.

499
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:31,015
Thank you for always helping me, Teacher Sani.

500
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:35,339
I must thank you guys too.

501
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,852
Seriously, I've learned a lot from you guys.

502
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:42,152
Yeah.

503
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,126
Happy birthday.

504
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,126
I thought you forgot.

505
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,142
I was acting.

506
00:39:57,142 --> 00:40:00,862
I told you I loved seeing you get pranked.

507
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:04,125
When you make an angry face, you look so...

508
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,386
Don't say the word cute.

509
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:08,330
You can't stop me.

510
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,322
In my eyes, you're so cute.

511
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,769
- Stop it or I'll punch you.
- Go ahead.

512
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,400
Same rule.

513
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,900
You punch, I kiss.

514
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,201
Have you stopped being mad at me?

515
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:27,086
Why wouldn't I? Our song is that beautiful.

516
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,826
Hug me, will you?

517
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:34,760
I love hugging you.

518
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,804
I love hugging you, too.

519
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:02,229
Thank you for never letting go of my hand.

520
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:05,332
How could I?

521
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:07,847
You're my space.

522
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:14,168
You once asked me where my space was, right?

523
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,244
It's right here.

524
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,520
You remember it, right?

525
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,570
Of course, I do.

526
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,457
Do you want to know where my space is?

527
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,767
Where?

528
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,745
Right here.

529
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't know how much further we have to travel before we find our space.

530
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,828
We may have to pass difficult curves

531
00:41:43,828 --> 00:41:46,887
and crossroads we have to guess whether to go left or right,

532
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:49,958
or how many times we'll choose to turn back.

533
00:41:50,987 --> 00:41:55,691
I won't deny that I'm still afraid,

534
00:41:56,616 --> 00:42:00,776
but just having him makes me feel a lot more at ease...

535
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:04,904
because I know he's my safe space.

536
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:06,984
You've been taking a shower too long.

537
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:09,630
Let me join you.

538
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:36,086
Aye!

539
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:46,007
Sleep here tonight. You can leave tomorrow.

540
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:49,606
Sure. I think it's too tiring to leave tonight.

541
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:52,783
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

542
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:11,084
Aye.

543
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:20,196
Will you be annoyed if I ask you for something?

544
00:43:21,323 --> 00:43:23,856
Ask away. What is it?

545
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:29,031
Will you say you love me once?

546
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:45,475
You're addicted to hearing the word love, aren't you?

547
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:48,529
It's okay if you can't.

548
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:51,165
I'm going to sleep now. Good night.

549
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:10,061
You keep imagining things.

550
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,833
I don't want to annoy you.

551
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:22,581
Aye!

552
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:26,220
Aye!

553
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:43,970
♫ Who's on your mind right now? Answer me, I wanna know ♫

554
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:49,066
♫ In case you think the same, because I'm thinking about you ♫

555
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:54,348
♫ If you have a lil time, I'd like to share it with you ♫

556
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:58,874
I love you.

557
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,252
Thank you.

558
00:45:16,143 --> 00:45:18,364
Aren't you going to say it back?

559
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:22,240
Do I have to?

560
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,120
Okay.

561
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:39,888
I love you too,

562
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,821
Shortstop.

563
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:49,251
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

564
00:45:49,251 --> 00:45:51,859
♫ There is no one else, you're number one ♫

565
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:56,809
♫ My world is you, your world is my world ♫

566
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:59,611
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

567
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:02,401
♫ It's so good to have you by my side ♫

568
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:06,566
♫ That's enough. That's all I ask ♫

569
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:09,949
♫ Just because I have you ♫

570
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:15,120
♫ Just because I have you ♫

571
00:46:17,006 --> 00:46:20,006
♫ Just because I have you ♫

572
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:25,120
♫ Just because I have you ♫

573
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,220
From now on, I'll find an excuse

574
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,040
to turn an ordinary day into a special one.

575
00:46:30,047 --> 00:46:32,504
Thank you for doing crazy things with me.

576
00:46:32,504 --> 00:46:36,606
I want us to spend more time together from now on.

577
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:38,896
Papa.

578
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,177
You didn't secretly father a child anywhere, did you?

579
00:46:41,177 --> 00:46:44,408
If the person who fathered a child and left him behind isn't you but Pakorn.

580
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:46,847
I don't think Pakorn is that kind of person.

581
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:50,010
Or could it be Tess?

582
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,630
♫ Loud, just say it loud ♫

583
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,070
♫ Say it loud, just say it loud ♫

584
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,920
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

585
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,630
♫ There is no one else, you're number one ♫

586
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:09,500
♫ My world is you, your world is my world ♫

587
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,450
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

588
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,050
♫ It's so good to have you by my side ♫

589
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,320
♫ That's enough. That's all I ask ♫

590
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,610
♫ Just because I have you ♫

591
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,770
♫ Just because I have you ♫

592
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:34,940
♫ Just because I have you ♫

593
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:40,160
♫ Just because I have you ♫
