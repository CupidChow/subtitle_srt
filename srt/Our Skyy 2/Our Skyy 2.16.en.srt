00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:05,355
Once we pass the bamboo line, we'll see a firebreak, then we'll arrive.

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,755
Wait.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,559
Why are we back in the same spot?

4
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:12,218
Have we arrived?

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:14,125
Just like you're worried about Teacher Tian.

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,756
I'm worried about Pran.

7
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:19,652
If you mess up, I'll leave you there.

8
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:20,840
Thank you, Chief.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,630
We're almost there, Teacher.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,351
Teacher!

11
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:28,840
Tian!

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,540
Chief!

13
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:40,002
You're just insecure and not sure if you're good enough.

14
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:45,907
When you finish reading this diary, you might understand Teacher's feelings better.

15
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:49,571
Tian, don't make me worry like that again.

16
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,793
If anything happens to you,

17
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,209
how will I live?

18
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:59,180
I can't live without you.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,770
- Good morning.
- Morning.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,083
What's that?

21
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,395
Omelette?

22
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:22,933
It is.

23
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,183
What? Why's our last meal here so bleak?

24
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:29,235
What do you mean by "bleak"? This is what Teacher Tian had before he left this place.

25
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,303
This is perfect.

26
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:33,643
Fine.

27
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,520
Come to think of it, this trip is...

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,580
It's kinda like a film-inspired trip.

29
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:51,501
Swimming in a waterfall and cuddling in a hut...

30
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,395
It sure is perfect.

31
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,502
Wanna act out every scene... Chief?

32
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:04,000
Why not, Teacher?

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,109
Do I have to strengthen my back when I sit, like Chief does?

34
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,153
I don't know.

35
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:12,593
It feels like he only sits like that because his back hurts.

What are you two doing?

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,281
Just taking some selfies. It's our keepsake.

56
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,975
When I left for Bangkok, I wasn't anywhere near as lovey-dovey as you guys.

57
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:03,421
Just a bit.

00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,200
Yes, it is.

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,388
All right. Chief and I will load it on the truck.

61
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:12,331
- Please.
- Thank you.

Let's go, Chief.

63
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:21,121
Well, the children were picking tea leaves.

64
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,960
Here's a tea bag from Pha Pun Dao.

65
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Thank you.

66
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,207
Here's a souvenir from me.

67
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,800
It's herbs from our mountain.

It'll cure anything.

69
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,066
- Oh, from that day when you were picking herbs.
- Yes.

70
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,964
All right. I'll make sure I try it.

71
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,218
- Thank you.
- Yes.

72
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:46,007
I'm sorry Chief won't sign it.

But well... thank you for trying your best.

This, then.

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,310
Think of it as a memento.

78

No problem.

- Bye.

- Careful on your way back, Kampung.
- Yes.

107
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:54,319
Chief, you hungry?

108
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,504
I'll make something.

109
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,445
I'm not hungry.

110
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,820
Oh, fine.

111
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,990
I'll admit I fell first.

112
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,630
I'm sorry I ran into the woods.

113
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,681
Can you stop pouting now?

114
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,876
You think an apology will make up for it?

115
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:18,905
Oh? What do you want me to do, then?

116
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:22,649
You know what? I'll do anything.

117
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:26,493
I'll hold you to it.

118
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:31,635
You have to come again next time.

119
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,958
Of course.

120
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,732
How long will it take?

121
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,010
Oh, 10 hours, at least.

122
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,577
10 hours? Really?

123
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:43,092
- My back already hurts.
- Bear with it for a bit.

124
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,147
Come again, all right?

125
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,621
Definitely.

126
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:50,029
Oh. My phone's dead.

It's in your bag.

129

Grab it for me, please? I don't want to.

130
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,240
- What?
- You took this with you?

131
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:09,989
I remember giving it to Chief.

132
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:15,997
Look.

133
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:19,347

136

What's going on?

137
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,490
Are you serious?

138
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,260
You want to take a shower here at the waterfall?

139
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,882
You said I sneaked a peek last time.

140
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,590
Well, I'm not sneaking today.

141
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,720
I'm taking an eyeful.

142
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:08,214
Quit playing.

143

Fine.

145
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:19,611
All right. I get it.

146
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,183
Are you happy now, Chief?

148
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:01,019
Stop hiding.

149
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,539
Chief!

150
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,321
Are you getting back at me?

151
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:20,792
No. I just want to swim, too.

154
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,943
Do you really want me to?

155

Well?

157
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,678
I'm giving you a closer look.

158
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:50,456

159
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,574
No, don't.

160
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:55,122
You pervert.

161
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,502
- You're no different.
- How so?

162
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,024
You pinched my nipples.

163
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:01,638
Because you were being ridiculous.

Play with me.

No way.

171
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,007
Still am.

172
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,438
Give it back.

- It is.

Okay.

- Yes.

00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:39,901
All right. Leg is lifted.

184
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,715
- What else?
- Lean forward.

185
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:42,746
Why?

186
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,833
Lean forward.

187
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,324
Okay, okay.

188
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:50,465
But I think it won't be fun drawing just one person.

189
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,053
- Do you guys want to draw the Green Giant?
- Yes!

190
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:55,518
There. Go grab him. The Green Giant is here.

191
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,714
Come.

192
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:01,674
Get him out here.

193
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,243
You started this, you know?

194
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,580
Green Giant, please stand here and protect Mr. Tian.

195
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,477
- Protect him?
- Yes.

196
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:10,713
Now hug him.

197
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,895
Hold him tight.

198
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,200
- All right.
- Let's draw.

199
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,748
- All right.
- Let's go.

200
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,268
Can you please stay still?

201
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,380
I can't draw.

202
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,672
You started it.

203
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,680
- Stay still.
- This is a school, you know?

204
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,657
- You're ruining their drawings.
- We're in school.

205
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:44,834
It's for Art class.

206
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,760
You're just the model for their drawings now. Right?

207
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,536
Please stay still.

208
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,603
I'm starving.

209
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:10,483
Almost done. Wait a minute.

210
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,676
Done. There you go.

211
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:31,770
Are you going to keep getting back at me for everything?

212
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,715
I just miss the good old days.

213
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,468
Way back when you weren't such a pain to deal with, that is.

214
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,967
Unlike you, who have always been so mean to me.

215
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,117
Am I mean?

216
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,699
Tian,

217
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,787
will you feed me?

218
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,464
Please stop. You're giving me goosebumps.

219
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:08,070
Please, Tian?

220
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:19,522
Take a bite.

221
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,465
Just do it yourself.

222
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,795
I'd love to try it, too.

223
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,903
It's good.

224
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:03,980
How about we sleep here tonight?

225
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,709
Why?

226
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,622
I want to know...

227
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,002
if you forgot how to set up a mosquito net.

228
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,502
Oh, you...

229
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:50,292
Will you please get out of the way, Chief?

230
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,667
Chief.

231
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,426
Chief.

232
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:15,594
It's morning.

233
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:41,915
How would you rate my performance last night?

234
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:48,584
What are you even asking?

235
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,474
Where did you remember that from?

236
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,879
Well?

237
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,842
On a scale of 10, how would you rate me?

238
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,747
This.

239
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,143
And this.

240
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:40,775
Happy now?

241
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,992
11?

242
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:51,940
Chief?

243
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,213
Chief! Chief, are you up?

244
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,719
Chief, I'm bringing you breakfast!

245
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,896
Just put it there. I'll go get it.

246
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,249
Let's go.

247
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:22,817
I'm borrowing this.

248
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:25,413
It's a forest officer's t-shirt...

249
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,713
Aren't you afraid that it's illegal now?

250
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,200
Why would I be?

251
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,080
The officers' wives here wear them all the time.

252
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,075
Isn't that right?

253
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,059
Chief! Teacher!

254
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,230
Chief! Teacher!

255
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,490
Yod, you're early.

256
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,620
My wife made some piping hot curry for you guys.

257
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,776
Be careful. It's hot.

258
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:48,458
- Thank you, Yod.
- Sure.

259
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,580
Oh, Teacher.

260
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,737
Pran asked for that photo of you in traditional costume.

261
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,656
He wanted it for his play.

262
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:58,764
What play? I thought Chief didn't sign the consent form.

263
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:03,636
But you signed it, didn't you, Chief?

264
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
Hey.

265
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,954
So you're really no longer mad at me? Hmm?

266
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:16,230
Then what's with all this punishing?

267
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,353
We need to talk.

268
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:20,740
Hey, Chief! Chief!

269
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,694
You were brooding and teasing me for days, you know that?

270
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,519
Chief, we need to talk.

271
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,104
Come here and talk to me.

272
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:30,171
Stop messing with me.

273
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,886
Stop it.

274
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:36,888
Aren't they always looking for excuses to get close, these two?

275
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,296
- Thank you, Yod.
- Of course. Is that all your stuff?

276
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,682
- Yes.
- All right.

277
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,855
Chief, are you sure you don't want to come celebrate with me?

278
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,936
I'm sorry, Tian.

279
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:04,230
I was joking.

280
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,690
I know you're busy.

281
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,693
Next time?

282
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:13,462
I'm telling you, you don't have to worry, Chief.

283
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:16,867
I'll drop him off right at his doorstep.

284
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,996
I happen to have some errands to run in Bangkok, too.

285
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:20,470
- Are you ready to go, Teacher?
- Yes.

286
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,281
Well, then, hop in.

287
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,081
See? He'll keep me company.

288
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:30,571
Give me a hug?

289
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:37,327
Have a safe trip, Tian.

290
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,163
I'm off.

291
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:49,653
Oh, this is great.

292
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:52,715
Let's get going.

293
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:53,717
You ready, Teach?

294
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:55,422
- Hit it, Yod.
- All right!

295
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:58,602
See you later, Chief!

296
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:15,724
Darn it, Yod.

297
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,975
I really am so sorry, Teacher.

298
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,780
I really want to drop you off at home,

299
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,550
but something suddenly came up.

300
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:28,933
It's all right. I'll find my way.

301
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,990
Oh, no can do.

302
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,100
I've already got you a ride home.

303
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:37,117
You just have to wait here. Do not go anywhere.

304
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:40,257
- What ride do you mean?
- Just wait here.

305
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:41,656
- Deal?
- What?

306
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:46,068
Stay here. I've got you a ride. Just wait.

307
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:49,090
- I'm off, Teach.
- Sure.

308
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:13,373
Did you call for a ride?

309
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,433
Chief?

310
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:31,378
Wow.

311
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:35,063
Cool car.

312
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,147
How did you get here?

313
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,943
Don't tell me you came here with me.

314
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:54,543
Did you?

315
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:56,097
But...

316
00:26:57,727 --> 00:27:02,985
Yod was gone for so long because he was waiting for you, wasn't he?

317
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:08,850
Aren't you tired?

318
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,030
Why don't we talk in the car?

319
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:34,881
Well? What are you doing here?

320
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,170
I just remember I had something to do here,

321
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,880
so I thought I might take a break as well.

322
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,209
Where would you like to go?

323
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,245
It's your hometown. How'd I know that?

324
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,921
What do you people do on your days off?

325
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,557
I'll be your guide.

326
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:10,159
We're here, Chief.

327
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,159
What do you think?

328
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,560
Is it bigger than it was the last time you were here?

329
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,255
It is quite big.

330
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:27,960
Do you think the buildings here are as tall as the mountains there?

331
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:31,661
- They make the mountains look tiny.
- Really?

332
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,461
Nope.

333
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,978
Hey, Chief.

334
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,020
- Are you hungry?
- Are you?

335
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,489
I am.

336
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,477
Lead the way.

337
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:49,287
Let's have dessert.

338
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:50,384
Dessert?

339
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:52,847
That's right. Dessert.

340
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,127
We don't have it often enough, don't you think?

341
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:01,122
Thank you. Please wait a moment.

342
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:08,411
The price for one dessert can feed us for a whole week back home.

343
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,992
It's the price for the place as well.

344
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:16,378
But just forget about that. Because it's my treat today.

345
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:23,008
Oh, it's here.

346
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,853
Excuse me.

347
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,986
Hey, hold on. What are you doing?

348
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:32,880
- Wait a sec.
- Why?

349
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,221
People around here let their camera feed before they do.

350
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:41,817
Let me snap a shot.

351
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:44,968
We don't get to do this kind of thing every day, you know?

352
00:29:58,128 --> 00:29:59,206
What are you doing?

353
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:01,256
Taking photos of the food.

354
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:05,118
- Can I dig in now?
- Yes.

355
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,575
Here.

356
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:12,815
- What?
- I'm feeding you.

357
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,668
We're in public.

358
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:18,768
We are in public, and what about it?

359
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,116
All right, I'm serious.

360
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:36,956
Chief, let's take some photos.

361
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:39,476
- No.
- Please. Please. Please.

362
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:40,939
- Let's take some photos.
- No.

363
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,839
It's just every once in a while, please?

364
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:43,977
Please?

365
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,144
Come on.

366
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:50,596
One, two, three.

367
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,185
Look at my face.

368
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,523
What else should we do?

369
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:10,723
It's up to you. You said you were going to be my guide.

370
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,535
I know now.

371
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,836
Let's go shopping.

372
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,814
But I already have more than enough clothes?

373
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:20,814
See?

374
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,286
You can have a little more. Let's go.

375
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:26,309
- I picked out the best outfit for this occasion.
- Sure. Come on.

376
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,673
I'm not changing my clothes, Tian.

377
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:34,091
Hello.

378
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:40,943
Take your pick, Chief.

379
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:45,112
What's wrong with my clothes?

380
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,133
Nothing is wrong.

381
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:51,993
It's just I don't get to buy you clothes all the time.

382
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,550
So will you just please indulge me? Please?

383
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:06,293
I doubt I should, Tian.

384
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,032
It's all right.

385
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:10,489
I'll take care of this.

386
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:13,273
Sorry, can we try this on?

387
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:14,957
Is this the one you like?

388
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:17,744
See? It looks cool.

389
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:20,457
- And this one, please.
- Yes.

390
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:22,973
And these pants.

391
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,353
What do you think?

392
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:32,377
♫ Wherever I am in the whole world, I just have you ♫

393
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:35,802
♫ Let's just hold hands ♫

394
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:38,897
♫ That's all I'm sure of ♫

395
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:44,361
♫ Wherever, however, I want only you ♫

396
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:49,280
♫ If so, even if I have to climb or soar higher ♫

397
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,199
♫ I'm ready to go up there ♫

398
00:32:54,199 --> 00:33:01,021
♫ So that we can be together even though we are far away ♫

399
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:10,121
♫ Our love will be with the stars beside the sky ♫

400
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:13,862
You're so handsome. You got a boyfriend?

401
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,811
I am your boyfriend.

402
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:36,420
See? You in this outfit sure get people's attention.

403
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,274
Are you trying to embarrass me?

404
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:40,721
Of course not.

405
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:46,366
We changed to honor the play.

406
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:54,106
Whoa! They're the actors themselves.

407
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,693
Chief actually signed it!

408
00:33:57,693 --> 00:33:59,508
[Conditions are on the back page.]

409
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,614
[It has to be you two who play the parts.]

410
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:06,275
Is he for real?

411
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:08,260
[1000 Stars]

412
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,948
I guess they didn't even think they'd do it.

413
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:16,766
No one gets us better than these two.

414
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,880
So what changed your mind?

415
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,240
You finally let them do the play.

416
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:32,840
I first thought a story of a minor forest officer

417
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,733
wouldn't be interesting enough to tell.

418
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:39,086
Until I read your diary.

419
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:41,209
I got the answer then.

420
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,430
Come on. Let's get inside.

421
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,440
Let's get inside.

422
00:34:57,508 --> 00:34:59,114
This row.

423
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:02,257
- Right here, Ink.
- Okay.

424
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:12,535
Are you excited?

425
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:15,719
Lots of people here.

426
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:35,701
My name is Tian.

427
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,933
I have heart disease.

428
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:41,770
But I could live on because of her death.

429
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:50,666
And these are the stories of my life.

430
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,059
Looking good.

431
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:59,099
No, not like you at all.

432
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:02,569
Chief.

433
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:10,368
This is Mr. Tian, the new volunteer teacher.

434
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:21,522
Hey!

435
00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:22,956
Mr. Tian!

436
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:24,170
Mr. Tian!

437
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,773
Yod, go get help.

438
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:28,930
- Yes, Chief.
- Mr. Tian!

439
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,608
Ink, do you think Mr. Tian intentionally threw himself at him?

440
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:51,190
The chief though, why does he have to poke his face so close to him?

441
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:55,959
Sorry.

442
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,167
Chief,

443
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:07,256
there is something I want to tell you.

444
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:10,543
- I...
- What?

445
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:12,990
Are you going to confess your love to me?

446
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:25,398
Oh, come on.

447
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,023
Chief.

448
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:35,616
Honestly, did you pretend to sleep?

449
00:37:40,732 --> 00:37:43,932
917, 918...

450
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:46,396
919...

451
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:48,156
Damn it.

452
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:50,029
1, 2...

453
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:52,829
Tian, stop it.

454
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:56,296
I can't do it, Chief.

455
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,769
I can't get this done for her.

456
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:03,359
Tian, you have done enough.

457
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,145
Listen to me.

458
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:07,989
No one should use their whole life to repay anyone else's life.

459
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:13,821
I know that Torfun could see this and forgive you.

460
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:16,979
Chief.

461
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,460
♫ If a star could hear my prayer ♫

462
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:36,120
♫ No matter how many thousands of times,
I still wish to keep my heart close to yours ♫

463
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:41,197
You threw water at me once.

464
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:44,497
Now, you aim your gun at me?

465
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:47,693
Tian, do you remember?

466
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,766
You missed one star...

467
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:53,487
that night when you counted.

468
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:55,335
I found it.

469
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,460
The last star.

470
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,403
It is you.

471
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,311
You are the star that fell to me.

472
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:05,011
No.

473
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,345
It is you.

474
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,040
The guiding star that led my way out of the darkness.

475
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:14,501
I knew it since the first day,

476
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,846
the day you held me in your arms.

477
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:28,233
It's the right moment to kiss!

478
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:38,718
The play has ended, hasn't it?

479
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,529
Why is the curtain not closed?

480
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:45,670
Wai! The curtain?

481
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,944
Come on. Serve the audience.

482
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:50,603
- That's the way to end it.
- What?

483
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:53,841
- What are you waiting for? Do it.
- Do what?

484
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:03,754
This.

485
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:05,971
Don't think so.

486
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,549
We have no choice.

487
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,296
I never thought my brother could act.

488
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,994
He's great.

489
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,617
Thank you.

490
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,295
Thank you so much.

491
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:43,135
Congrats.

492
00:40:43,135 --> 00:40:45,730
I didn't think you could pull it off.

493
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,268
Of course, I could.

494
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:49,330
I loved it so much, but it's just too short.

495
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,050
I need 10 more episodes.

496
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,036
Please. We barely got this one to happen.

497
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,150
I got a question.

498
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,811
Is Mr. Tian this saucy in real life?

499
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:00,574
Watch your mouth.

500
00:41:00,574 --> 00:41:02,712
- You wanna know?
- Yes.

501
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:04,912
Ask him yourself.

502
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,076
You look so cool in person.

503
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:13,013
You look great just like Pran said.

504
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,260
It's too late.

505
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,352
Okay.

506
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:24,618
You in this outfit look even better than the original.

507
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:31,930
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

508
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:37,259
Thank you, Chief, for letting us make this play.

509
00:41:37,974 --> 00:41:42,270
Thank you guys too, for giving me a chance to finish the diary.

510
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:52,902
Ah... should we take photos?

511
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:54,110
Let's capture the moment.

512
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,970
Why are you stuttering?

513
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,317
Let's do it.

514
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:59,688
Ink, you're the photographer.

515
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:04,120
Get closer.

516
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:06,911
All right.

517
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:11,248
One, two, three.

518
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,463
One, two, three.

519
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,540
Hold on.

520
00:42:21,323 --> 00:42:23,623
Yes, Mom.

521
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:26,712
Sorry. The play just finished.

522
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:28,979
Okay. I'm on my way.

523
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,779
Yes.

524
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:35,582
I need to go, Chief.

525
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:40,835
I'm asking you one last time.

526
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,674
Will you come and meet my parents?

527
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,711
I'm sorry, Tian.

528
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:56,751
I have something important to get to.

529
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:01,772
That important?

530
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:07,693
I'm meeting seniors, but I can drop you off.

531
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:13,722
It's okay. I can manage.

532
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:15,522
I'm off then.

533
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:40,123
Look. We got some food support here.

534
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:43,023
The tiredness is just gone, huh, Chief?

535
00:43:59,364 --> 00:44:01,156
What are you watching?

536
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,610
The videos of the play people are sharing.

537
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,190
Look at you watching yourself and blushing.

538
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,042
Oh, will your dad be okay with this?

539
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,808
The videos are everywhere.

540
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:22,308
My dad?

541
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:25,288
No. He isn't on social media.

542
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,758
Your family though.

543
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:30,041
Your mom likes every photo of yours.

544
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,171
Is she really happy about it?

545
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,299
She is.

546
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:42,245
She knows it's just a play.

547
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:44,292
Nothing serious.

548
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:49,774
Now that we're behind the curtain.

549
00:44:50,716 --> 00:44:53,030
Can we kiss as Pat and Pran?

550
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:20,158
Pran, I forgot my key. Can I use your bathroom?

551
00:45:20,158 --> 00:45:21,531
Please, I can't hold it.

552
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:22,751
Cover your ears.

553
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:25,000
- What?
- Cover your ears.

554
00:45:34,324 --> 00:45:36,555
Go get your sister.

555
00:45:36,555 --> 00:45:38,374
Are you going to just sit here?

556
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:39,440
I am.

557
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,640
He's here.

558
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:47,879
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

559
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:50,838
I missed you guys.

560
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:53,629
We missed you too.

561
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:59,822
Don't you look skinnier?

562
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:01,937
No way. I can't get bigger than this.

563
00:46:01,937 --> 00:46:03,341
I've been eating well.

564
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:05,937
What about you two?

565
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:09,717
I'm good. Worry about your mom. She's on her phone all day.

566
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:13,317
I love reading your diary.

567
00:46:14,383 --> 00:46:15,577
Let's take a seat.

568
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,218
Come. You hungry?

569
00:46:17,218 --> 00:46:20,550
Wait. Did you come alone?

570
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:23,918
Yes.

571
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:30,363
[Chief Phupha]

572
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,925
Hello.

573
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:41,282
Happy birthday, Tian.

574
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,235
That's all?

575
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:54,580
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

576
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,553
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

577
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:04,162
♫ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♫

578
00:47:04,162 --> 00:47:09,747
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

579
00:47:09,747 --> 00:47:14,048
Oh, come on. Look at how disappointed you are.

580
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:16,064
I'm not.

581
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:18,460
Happy birthday, my dear friend Tian.

582
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,650
Whatever you want, wish for it.

583
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,655
Thanks.

584
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,545
Happy birthday.

585
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,817
So? Your wish has been granted, right?

586
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:20,350
Sorry, I'm late.

587
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,240
It's okay. It's good enough you came.

588
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,500
I was keeping my fingers crossed.

589
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:26,369
Come more often.

590
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,598
Yes, sir.

591
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,905
Let's sit down.

592
00:48:31,803 --> 00:48:34,803
Sit with me, Tul.

593
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:14,163
I heard your father was a forest officer too. Right, Phupha?

594
00:49:14,163 --> 00:49:15,177
He was.

595
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:17,470
He loved Pha Pun Dao so much.

596
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,340
That's why I chose to work there.

597
00:49:20,342 --> 00:49:22,937
So I could carry on his work.

598
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:35,557
And what if I'd like to leave one thing I love the most in your hands?

599
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:39,102
Will you do it?

600
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:50,197
That'd be my honor.

601
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:53,749
Please take care of him.

602
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,557
Sir, ma'am, I think I should run home now.

603
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:05,557
- Goodbye.
- Sure.

604
00:50:05,557 --> 00:50:07,137
- Get home safe.
- Yes, ma'am.

605
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,837
I'll see you later.

606
00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:14,370
Chief, please help my friend here.

607
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,230
He said he wanted a six-pack abs like you.

608
00:50:16,232 --> 00:50:18,232
Go away.

609
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:20,778
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

610
00:50:21,642 --> 00:50:23,477
Well, we should get going too.

611
00:50:23,477 --> 00:50:24,581
All right.

612
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:26,745
We're leaving now.

613
00:50:28,032 --> 00:50:29,038
Goodbye.

614
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:34,097
I'll see him off first and follow you home later.

615
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,946
Sure.

616
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:37,446
Let's go.

617
00:50:45,763 --> 00:50:47,398
What were you guys talking about?

618
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:49,636
It looked quite serious.

619
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,211
Tian,

620
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,552
can we not go home just yet?

621
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,361
In the mood for a walk, huh?

622
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:42,229
I just wanted to take you to see the stars.

623
00:51:43,989 --> 00:51:46,022
The stars?

624
00:51:50,585 --> 00:51:55,361
Pha Pun Dao's sky is much more beautiful, Chief.

625
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:01,806
But if you want me to see the stars,

626
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:03,762
I will do it.

627
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:12,556
I'll even count them just for fun.

628
00:52:15,128 --> 00:52:16,828
1...

629
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,368
2...

630
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,653
3...

631
00:52:32,005 --> 00:52:34,598
That's all we have, Chief.

632
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,150
4.

633
00:52:41,582 --> 00:52:43,320
Where is 4?

634
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:13,251
Seriously?

635
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:26,947
So this was your important matter?

636
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,953
All those times I refused to come down here with you...

637
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,853
because I wanted your parents to be sure first...

638
00:53:49,078 --> 00:53:52,078
that I could take care of you.

639
00:53:53,740 --> 00:54:02,050
A special thanks to our wonderful team!

♫ And I was not exactly the one you thought of ♫

651
00:56:00,628 --> 00:56:05,037
♫ But we just met like we had met in our dreams ♫

652

♫ We had met before in a dream ♫

653
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:13,844
♫ My heart fluttered just when you came closer ♫

654
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:20,403
♫ With a split second of being close to you, my world turned upside down ♫

655
00:56:20,403 --> 00:56:26,821
♫ To have you by my side is all I desire ♫

656
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:33,867
♫ I do not have a reason and nothing can be confirmed ♫

♫ Everything between us does not need an answer ♫

658

♫ A story tale remains unchanged no matter how many times it is retold ♫

659
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:52,800
♫ Just like the love I have for you, it will never change ♫

660
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:59,353
♫ If a star could hear my prayer ♫

661
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:05,261
♫ Even for thousands of times, I would still wish ♫

662
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:10,922
♫ For my heart to be close to yours ♫

663
00:57:18,748 --> 00:57:24,927
♫ If a star could hear my prayer ♫

664

♫ For my heart to be close to yours ♫

666
00:57:59,846 --> 00:58:03,537
Chief, I told Mom I'd crash here tonight.

667
00:58:03,537 --> 00:58:08,018
Actually, you could've spent the night at my house so you didn't have to pay.

668
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:12,944
This is my friend's hotel.

669
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:15,280
It's budget-friendly.

670
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,884
This is where we always stay when we come here.

671
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,243
So what are you doing?

672
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:27,049
Writing a diary.

673
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:28,949
Almost done.

674
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:35,708
"Finally, the chief put the 1000th star on my finger.

675
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:39,663
The most romantic night of ours ended there."

676
00:58:41,672 --> 00:58:44,312
Are you sure tonight has already ended?

677
00:58:52,109 --> 00:58:54,644
What are you saying?

678
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:56,473
You cheeky.

679
00:58:58,756 --> 00:59:01,950
You don't know if it's already ended.

680
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,802
Let me take a shower first.

681
00:59:09,802 --> 00:59:11,402
Okay?

682
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,897
And what if I say no?

683
00:59:15,897 --> 00:59:17,581
You're aggressive tonight.

684
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:19,415
Don't you like it?

685
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:25,743
Tian!

686
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:34,181
You really think you're the only one who can play it cool?

687
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:37,353
- You think I can't be aggressive too? Huh?
- Tian, what are you doing?

688
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:39,153
Tian!

689
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,548
All right. I surrender.

690
00:59:41,548 --> 00:59:43,148
Don't.

691
00:59:43,148 --> 00:59:44,764
Don't you get up.

692
00:59:44,764 --> 00:59:48,037
Tian, what are you doing?

693
00:59:49,138 --> 00:59:50,113
Chief!

694
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:52,258
Come here.

695
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,258
Tian.

696
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,456
I'm sorry, all right?

697
00:59:57,456 --> 01:00:00,522
- Come here.
- Tian. Ow!

698
01:00:02,804 --> 01:00:06,294
You're not the only one who can do it.

699
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:07,849
Tian.

700
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,109
Chief.

701
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:11,340
Chief, what's happening in there?

702
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,769
- Tian, Yod can hear us.
- An earthquake in there?

703
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:16,241
- I don't care.
- He can hear us.

704
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,566
- It's okay.
- Tian.

705
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:20,466
Please.

706
01:00:25,558 --> 01:00:28,410
- This is how you want it?
- Yes. So?

707
01:00:38,866 --> 01:00:40,779
Chief.

708
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:48,544
No!

01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:25,100
♫ Our love will be with the stars beside the sky ♫
