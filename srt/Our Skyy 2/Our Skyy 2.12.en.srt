1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:01,873
Are you jealous of that intern?

2
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:03,920
- No, I'm not jealous.
- Not at all?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,997
I'm off now.

4
00:00:04,997 --> 00:00:06,897
Cher asked to join us, sir.

5
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:09,095
What's wrong with you guys today? Your preparation failed big time.

6
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:11,477
I told you to adjust.

7
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:16,283
How about I become a boss and you become an intern?

8
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,793
You become me for 24 hours.

9
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:23,219
If you think you can run the company, I'll let you try.

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:25,180
It's a deal.

11
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,251
Should we start now?

12
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:34,537
Harder.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,477
Cher, don't make that sound.

14
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:45,084
Why? It's satisfying.

15
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:48,898
Intern, you're skillful at this too, aren't you?

16
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,113
You could open a salon.

17
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:54,316
You'd probably name it "Let's wash our hair".

18
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:56,002
How is it?

19
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:59,363
We've already got the salon name. Cool, isn't it?

20
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:01,619
But I don't think I'll be ready for many customers,

21
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,619
because taking care of this VIP customer alone already gives me a headache.

22
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,954
Hey, don't talk too much, Intern.

23
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:11,302
Since you're washing my hair, massage my neck too.

24
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:13,735
Don't let Laem repeat it.

25
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:17,455
Sure, Boss Laem.

26
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:20,546
Massage your neck, right?

27
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,346
Here, also.

28
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,897
Where did you learn it from?

29
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:28,879
YouTube.

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,590
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,180
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,790
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,830
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,940
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,290
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

36
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,790
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,330
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

38
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:16,950
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,820
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,370
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,230
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,140
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:45,980
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

44
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,473
Why are you dressed up like that?

45
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:57,488
We agreed to switch our roles, didn't we?

46
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,577
Don't pretend to be sleepy and forget about it.

47
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:00,971
I didn't forget.

48
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,510
I was just asking.

49
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,060
I thought you were just kidding.

50
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,883
Someone like me wouldn't kid.

51
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:11,700
From today, you're an intern.

52
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,412
Please take a shower and get dressed.

53
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:24,365
Hey, this is your first day.

54
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,840
Don't be late.

55
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,998
Let me warn you now that this boss is very strict.

56
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:36,327
Is he?

57
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:46,446
- Hey? Where are you taking my car key?
- Who said it's yours?

58
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:49,124
This belongs to the boss.

59
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,444
I'm leaving. Bye.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,351
[Don't try to find your suits. I've already hidden all of them.]

61
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,695
What a mischievous boy.

62
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,915
Why is it this small?

63
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,112
I'll book via an app then.

64
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:31,076
Why aren't there any taxis, huh?

65
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:36,625
Young boy, do you want me to take you there?

66
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,888
Well, I think I'll wait for a taxi first.

67
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:44,807
It's early morning, so there's a lot of traffic.

68
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,767
You're in a hurry, aren't you?

69
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:55,534
All right. I'll go.

70
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:03,000
Go to the...

71
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:19,039
Hello, all my lovely employees.

72
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,050
Laem, are you possessed by a ghost or something?

73
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,261
Jack, before you say anything,

74
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:28,431
do show respect to my necktie.

75
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,778
Why are you dressed up unusually neat today?

76
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,101
It's because today I'm not little Brother Cher,

77
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,273
Cher, or Laem.

78
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,093
- But I am...
- You are...

79
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,491
The CEO.

80
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,427
What are you doing, Brother Cher?

81
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:57,420
Don't play here. Go and play somewhere else.

82
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,697
I'm really the CEO.

83
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:04,484
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

84
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:15,495
- How much is it?
- 80 baht.

85
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,747
I'll transfer it to you. Please give me your account number.

86
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't have one. I only accept cash.

87
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,519
I don't have any cash with me now.

88
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,872
Are you cheating, huh?

89
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,629
I'm not.

90
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,172
I'm transferring it to you.

91
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,939
You can't do this. Don't cheat.

92
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,618
What era are we living in now, bro? Money transfer is possible anywhere.

93
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:34,758
You're cheating.

94
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,615
I'm telling you I'm not.

95
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,515
Hello, Mr. Gun.

96
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,680
Is something wrong?

97
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,170
He is not paying me my taxi fee of 80 baht.

98
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:47,567
Why are you wearing this outfit, Mr. Gun?

99
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,722
Please pay for me. I'll transfer it to you.

100
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,340
I'll hurry inside.

101
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,140
Mr. Gun?

102
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:04,912
Why are you late?

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,232
- I'm only two minutes late.
- That's late anyway.

104
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:12,557
No excuse.

105
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:14,240
Got it?

106
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,754
Laem, what damn joke are you playing with the boss, huh?

107
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:21,854
Jack, I've always been serious.

108
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:24,798
Let me introduce him to you all then.

109
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:29,859
This is Brother Gun, our company's new intern.

110
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:38,522
Today, if you want to ask Brother Gun to do anything, you're welcome to.

111
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,906
Don't be shy.

112
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:44,580
It's the order of Boss Cher, this man right here.

113
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:48,402
Here's the first task for you.

114
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,731
Buy me some coffee.

115
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,680
Make it quick. I want to drink it already.

116
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,218
Brother Gun.

117
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,215
Yeah, Brother Gun.

118
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,020
Come in.

119
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:25,216
What business do you have with me?

120
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,345
I brought you coffee.

121
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,120
Come closer.

122
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,480
Say that again.

123
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,900
Who did you bring coffee to?

124
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,090
I brought you coffee, boss.

125
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,310
Who did?

126
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:04,477
I did.

127
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:05,988
- I? Who?
- Gun.

128
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:07,201
And what is Gun's position?

129
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,101
Wait.

130
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,346
You ordered coffee, and I brought it to you.

131
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:18,243
I ordered extra whipped cream, just how you like it, Cher.

132
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,477
- I don't eat whipped cream anymore.
- Because?

133
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:23,343
Because I'm the CEO now. And...

134
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:27,254
Hey, why aren't you the same type of boss as I am?

135
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:30,054
Why are you being a nonsensical and unreasonable one?

136
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:33,002
Oh, wow. This is how you are. Exactly.

137
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:35,925
- I think I'm already such a good boss.
- How confident you are.

138
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:38,574
Sometimes, you're reasonable, but sometimes you aren't.

139
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:41,695
Sometimes, you're super cool, but sometimes you overthink whatever.

140
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:47,023
If you were a fruit, you must be either a custard apple or a pomegranate.

141
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:53,708
- I don't get it.
- They're extra.

142
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,406
I still don't get it.

143
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:02,041
You'll soon discover how painful it is to be an intern who is treated like a slave

144
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,578
and is the boss's punching bag.

145
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,790
Does it hurt a lot?

146
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,600
It hurts.

147
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,698
I'll tell the housekeeper to bring you first aid.

148
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:20,895
Why don't you, an intern, go get it for your boss?

149
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:22,734
That's because we have the housekeeper to do the job.

150
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:25,048
But I want this intern to do it for me.

151
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:27,221
It's an order.

152
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:39,332
Yes, Boss.

153
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,521
Here's the first aid.

154
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:58,482
Let me do it for you.

155
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,899
Don't touch me.

156
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,780
Who are you? Who am I?

157
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,530
You'd better know your place.

158
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,435
Sure, Boss.

159
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:10,901
Wait.

160
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:13,964
Where are you going?

161
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:19,540
I haven't drunk the coffee I ordered.

162
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,241
You haven't?

163
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:25,263
There's something on your mouth.

164
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:35,260
Boss, what do you want to eat? This intern will find it for you.

165
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,102
Two Thai-style hot black coffee with milk, 2 spoons of condensed milk, 1 spoon of sugar.

166
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:44,546
You can only get it from Mrs. First on 4th street. Can you remember that?

167
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,100
- I'm confused.
- So why don't you note it down? Huh?

168
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,260
That's not necessary.

169
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,000
Everything you said is already in my head.

170
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:58,183
Okay. What a talented and clever guy you are.

171
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:59,300
It's good you remember it.

172
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,990
Hurry up and order it for me.

173
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,910
I want to drink it already.

174
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,404
Sure.

175
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,509
What are you complaining about? I saw that.

176
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,209
I didn't.

177
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,977
Yummy.

178
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:24,211
Thai-style hot black coffee?

179
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,005
Two?

180
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:30,048
Two spoons of condensed milk. Four spoons of sugar.

181
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,314
Is it from Mrs. First on 4th Street, or Mrs. Fourth on 1st Street?

182
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,409
Fourth or First?

183
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,020
First or Fourth?

184
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,088
Which street is it?

185
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:40,700
Four times one equals four.

186
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,777
Four times two equals eight. Four times three equals twelve.

187
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,654
Hey, what are you saying? Huh?

188
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,830
You're memorizing the multiplication table, aren't you?

189
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,192
I'm helping you.

190
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:51,792
By the way,

191
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,669
can you remember everything about the coffee I ordered?

192
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,726
Yeah. I can look for it. I did memorize it.

193
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,468
- Great job.
- Um.

194
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,180
Wait.

195
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,575
Come here.

196
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:24,039
Guys, Brother Gun is going out to buy me coffee.

197
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,030
Does anyone want to order anything?

198
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,892
Aoi and Jack, do you want anything?

199
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,541
Just tell him.

200
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:40,730
Brother Cher, I'm not hungry yet.

201
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:44,769
I'm not either.

202
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,149
Don't be awkward. Okay?

203
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,817
Let me make it clear to you now.

204
00:14:55,817 --> 00:15:02,298
Brother Gun and I have already agreed that

205
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:05,750
today, I'm the boss,

206
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,028
and he's an intern,

207
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:11,793
who is willing to do all the work as much as assigned.

208
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:14,323
But everything will end today.

209
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:16,564
There won't be any revenge later.

210
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:18,740
Am I right, Brother Gun?

211
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,843
Yes. I certainly won't take revenge.

212
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,311
That's great.

213
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:35,609
So, let's do it.

214
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,859
Well, then. I'll go with something simple.

215
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:46,121
Mixed berry smoothie, which includes strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries.

216
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:47,621
One for me, please.

217
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:49,460
- Simple, isn't it?
- Yeah.

218
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,020
Can you repeat it, Brother Gun?

219
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,372
Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, mixed berry, less sweet.

220
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:55,354
One. Am I right?

221
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,825
That's wrong. Give me a second.

222
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:03,584
Keep going. I'm rooting for you.

223
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,143
So, everyone ordered?

224
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:12,025
This is mine, Brother Gun.

225
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,733
Brother Gun?

226
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,951
Thanks.

227
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,912
Thai milk tea, low sugar.

228
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,131
Samyan congee, extra size, with minced pork, liver and, egg.

229
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:27,081
Please pack the egg separately. No ginger.

230
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,544
Yaowarat egg noodles with roasted red pork in the market opposite to...

231
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:32,421
A set of Thipsamai Pad Thai and free orange juice. Nang Loeng Market's chive dumplings.

232
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,781
Oho. Can't you order from shops that are in the same place?

233
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:37,707
These are all from different locations, far from each other.

234
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:41,456
Who is yelling in front of my office?

235
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,810
Brother Gun.

236
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,070
You're still not going out to buy your boss coffee?

237
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,764
Well, I've just finished accepting everyone's order, Boss.

238
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:55,865
Oh, wow. What each of them wants is from different parts of the city.

239
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:59,293
That's great. That's why you'd better hurry up.

240
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:00,779
Go.

241
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,927
Wait.

242
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:08,895
Well, I want to eat Thai fried sweet potato balls.

243
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:13,821
I want them fresh and hot.

244
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,724
Serve them with the coffee I ordered.

245
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,815
From which shop?

246
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:22,100
How about asking Justice Bao?

247
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,620
It's his favorite.

248
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,915
How about buying them yourself?

249
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,484
Fine. You can buy them from any shop.

250
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,658
Hurry back. I want to eat already.

251
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,333
I'll be right back.

252
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,760
Thanks, Boss.

253
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,021
No worries.

254
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,388
For everyone, I can do this.

255
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:53,388
Hey, I'm older than you.

256
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:58,396
If we don't fight for it, we'll be treated as slaves.

257
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:01,187
I think this sentence sounds familiar.

258
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:03,187
I'm just kidding.

259
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,849
Bring it on.

260
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:09,686
Come on! You suck.

261
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,920
Thai-style iced black coffee with milk and Thai fried sweet potatoes balls served hot, as ordered, Boss.

262
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:24,926
Why did you come back so early? It's been only 30 minutes.

263
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,811
Samyan congee.

264
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:27,910
Pratu Nam chicken rice.

265
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,208
Thipsamai Pad Thai.

266
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,839
Yaowarat eggs noodles with roasted pork and dumplings.

267
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,140
Nang Loeng Market's chive dumplings.

268
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,148
Ms. Ern's papaya salad and Chokchai 4 beef noodles.

269
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,588
I bought everyone's order without missing any.

270
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,203
How could he do that?

271
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,001
I used the food delivery app.

272
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,762
Why would I trouble myself by going out to buy them?

273
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:48,247
Being an intern is super easy.

274
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:54,228
It's hot.

275
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:55,617
I told you already.

276
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:58,022
Is this how you want it, huh?

277
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,455
Photocopy all of these for me.

278
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,445
These purchase orders?

279
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:19,976
- Yes.
- Why?

280
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,802
(This is your boss's order.)

281
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,694
Sure.

282
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,518
It's as simple as that.

283
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,310
How do I use it?

284
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,299
The paper is coming out.

285
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,797
What? Isn't it automatic?

286
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,953
Boss, what are you doing?

287
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,850
It won't print. I don't know what's wrong.

288
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,343
Please turn it off first.

289
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:32,404
Don't help him, Aoi.

290
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:36,509
Intern, what did you do?

291
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,045
Why is the machine like this?

292
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,390
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

293
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,280
- Aoi.
- Yes?

294
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,729
Handle him.

295
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:56,424
Why can't you do such a simple task?

296
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:57,980
It's just photocopying.

297
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,924
You also damaged the machine.

298
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,604
We'd better teach him a lesson, Aoi.

299
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:04,934
But I think...

300
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,130
Everything is over within today, Aoi.

301
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,220
There won't be any revenge later.

302
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:15,200
Hey, Brother Gun. I told you already, didn't I?

303
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,675
If you don't know how to use the photocopier, you must ask.

304
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,216
You messed it up, so the machine is broken now.

305
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,655
What if there's an electric shock and you die?

306
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,995
Someone here would be in sorrow.

307
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,198
How could we live?

308
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:26,963
Also, it takes ages for the spare parts to arrive after we order them.

309
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:29,313
Waiting can discourage me. Okay?

310
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:34,033
Don't think that you're already talented, cool, and knowledgeable about everything.

311
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,060
Is her last sentence too harsh?

312
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,113
Aoi, your last sentence is lit.

313
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:41,513
Yeah.

314
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,948
Anyway, I want these documents within 10 minutes.

315
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,848
Got it?

316
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:53,041
I'm in a hurry.

317
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,290
I just went with the flow, you know.

318
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,700
Don't be mad at me.

319
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:07,363
Boss, you press that to turn it on.

320
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:09,807
That's for black and white, and that's for color. That's a WiFi button.

321
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:12,134
Just press it, and there you go. How simple. You can do it, Boss.

322
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,634
Sure.

323
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,399
Print.

324
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:30,838
9 minutes and 55 seconds. You're on time.

325
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:33,883
But I forgot that I don't need it anymore.

326
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,060
I can read it in my email.

327
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,890
Hey!

328
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,310
Why?

329
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:44,032
Is there a problem?

330
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:49,483
Wait!

331
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,233
You can't leave like that.

332
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:10,982
If others see you, they could accuse me of forcing an old man to work.

333
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:12,384
Hey.

334
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,334
I forgot. You're an intern today.

335
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,979
Being a boss is so easy.

336
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:20,681
You think?

337
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,340
Soon you'll understand.

338
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:26,834
Why?

339
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:37,971
Boss, the client has arrived.

340
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:40,740
He's waiting in the meeting room.

341
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,139
The client?

342
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:46,728
What client, Aoi? He's not on my schedule.

343
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:50,428
The client requested a meeting on short notice, so I didn't put it on the schedule.

344
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,677
Do you want to cancel it? I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it.

345
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:57,077
It's no big deal to stand him up, right?

346
00:23:57,822 --> 00:23:59,991
I can do it.

347
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:02,611
It's just talking to a client.

348
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:05,351
This is Mr. Patrick, a friend of Mr. Porsche.

349
00:24:05,351 --> 00:24:08,951
He wants to discuss developing a game with Phenomenal.

350
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:15,598
Say hi to him.

351
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:20,958
Hi.

352
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,716
Hello. Nice to meet you.

353
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:24,716
Actually, I'm a game caster.

354
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:27,045
Oh, a game caster.

355
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,860
Nice to meet you.

356
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:36,620
And I'm interested in developing a game with users' AR.

357
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,026
Same as Pokemon.

358
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:41,052
I want to go out and have fun with it.

359
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:45,435
And if possible, all ages should be able to play this game.

360
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,523
That would be perfect.

361
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,128
What do you think? Do you have any ideas?

362
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:01,336
Do you want me to help translate it?

363
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,686
There's no need. I understand what he said. I'm thinking.

364
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,572
Okay.

365
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,577
Play for All.

366
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:22,399
It must be an AR multiplayer game.

367
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,640
Let players connect together...

368
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:43,609
Can't wait for our treasure hunt.

369
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,692
Thank you.

370
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:46,292
See ya.

371
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:51,648
That was amazing, Boss.

372
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:54,877
That was your plan, wasn't it?

373
00:25:56,195 --> 00:26:01,689
The client was already in the deal. I just rescheduled him for today.

374
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,506
That's a risky move.

375
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:06,585
What if I messed it up?

376
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:09,957
I'm here. I wouldn't let it flop.

377
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:13,414
Besides, I just wanted you to understand that being a boss isn't easy.

378
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:16,414
I have many things to carry on my shoulders.

379
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,363
I know.

380
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:22,358
You keep reminding me of that.

381
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:24,134
And what about you?

382
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:27,193
Have you come to understand how employees feel?

383
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:36,286
I should go.

384
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,155
- Aoi.
- Yes?

385
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:42,508
Your boss is here.

386
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:43,790
Sorry, Boss.

387
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,906
This way, please.

388
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:53,333
Guys.

389
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:57,397
Good news for our company today.

390
00:26:57,397 --> 00:26:59,397
As you all know, this afternoon,

391
00:26:59,397 --> 00:27:03,035
a client from overseas asked us to develop a game for him.

392
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,000
The project is valued at 30 million baht.

393
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:15,470
To celebrate signing a 30 million baht deal,

394
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,609
the company will hold a party for every employee.

395
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,333
That's not all.

396
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,080
The special treat is

397
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,750
our boss will take care of all the party expenses.

398
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,190
Wait.

399
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:41,591
What?

400
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:43,811
Aren't you going to pay for your employees?

401
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:58,301
Gun,

402
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:03,718
I'll be broke if you make me pay for everyone.

403
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,457
Why not? You should show your spirit.

404
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:09,857
I pay for my employees too.

405
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,840
You know, I always use my own money.

406
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,137
I never use the company's money.

407
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:18,970
But our financial status is different.

408
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,262
Different how?

409
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:24,403
You're a boss now. Show some spirit.

410
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,201
You want me to understand what it's like to be an employee. Right?

411
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:30,066
Then you must learn what it's like to be a boss, too.

412
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:32,287
Are you talking back to me?

413
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:35,011
No, I'm not.

414
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:36,511
Gun.

415
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,940
All right, I can let them know that you won't treat them.

416
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,237
- Everyone...
- No.

417
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,760
Fine, it'll be my treat.

418
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,243
Enjoying the food?

419
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:14,362
It's all my money.

420
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,306
Laem!

421
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,418
Jack, did you forget that I'm your boss?

422
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:26,678
You crossed the line by slapping my shoulder.

423
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,034
Why don't you smack my head too?

424
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:30,026
You asked for it, Laem!

425
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:31,190
Wait.

426
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,289
I was being sarcastic, bro.

427
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,679
By the way, you're bullying the boss so much.

428
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,779
Aren't you scared he'll get back at you?

429
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:46,405
Don't say that. I'm scared.

430
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:52,986
On second thought, it's not time to switch our roles back yet.

431
00:29:52,986 --> 00:29:55,452
So I'm going to enjoy the moment.

432
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:57,765
Isn't that cool?

433
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:58,793
Very cool.

434
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:01,741
- I know, right?
- Cheers!

435
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:07,646
Everyone, please hear me out.

436
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:12,640
Boss is about to scold and expose you for bullying him.

437
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,380
All this time,

438
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:21,444
I may have been power crazy, too hard on everyone,

439
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:26,945
and made the work environment too stressful.

440
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:29,719
I promise that from now on,

441
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,995
I will improve myself...

442
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,464
and I won't let that happen again.

443
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,197
Please accept my sincere apologies.

444
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:49,536
Oh my boss.

445
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,595
Let's clap.

446
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,260
I must give credit to the one

447
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,480
that made me realize it.

448
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:11,652
Cher.

449
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:30,346
I guess I really have been too serious about work.

450
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:34,777
When the vibe changes, everything changes, Gun.

451
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:36,277
Come on.

452
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,816
Your muscles must be all stiff.

453
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:46,345
If you go to an old lady masseuse, they will scold you.

454
00:31:46,345 --> 00:31:51,323
They'll say, "Your muscles are very tense. What have you done?"

455
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,923
I'm sure of it.

456
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,525
Thank you, Cher.

457
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:08,199
Thank you for staying by my side.

458
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:15,467
I must thank you too, Gun,

459
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,986
for putting up with my craziness.

460
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:24,192
Come on, let me continue massaging you.

461
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,870
But you're a boss, not an intern.

462
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,250
Why are you giving me a massage?

463
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,510
A boss.

464
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,611
Not an intern.

465
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,238
- That's right.
- What's going on with you, Phi Gun?

466
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:44,575
You started shouting out of the blue.

467
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:47,386
This can't wait. I must call everyone for a meeting immediately.

468
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,436
Stop.

469
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:51,036
Sit down.

470
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,694
What? Why are you pulling me?

471
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,494
This is not the time for a meeting, Gun.

472
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:59,662
But I'm so inspired right now.

473
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,165
No.

474
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,036
Look.

475
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,262
Your employees are enjoying themselves.

476
00:33:06,262 --> 00:33:08,962
Are you going to take that away from them?

477
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:15,480
But I'm worried I might forget my idea.

478
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,030
Then note it down.

479
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,360
You can note it down on your phone.

480
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,397
But I want to work.

481
00:33:22,397 --> 00:33:23,897
No.

482
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:26,499
I won't let you.

483
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,117
Listen, Phi Gun.

484
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:33,057
Phi Gun.

485
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,551
Listen, Phi Gun. You must learn to stick to work hours.

486
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:42,181
You can't order people to do things you come up with outside office hours.

487
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:47,190
Besides, I'm your boss today.

488
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,670
Do you understand?

489
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,966
Yeah. I get it.

490
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:54,404
When will you stop playing with my face?

491
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:57,018
You have been playing it for some time.

492
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,265
I won't stop.

493
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:01,921
Your face is funny.

494
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:14,613
I have a new idea for the game we're creating.

495
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:18,528
Let's say our game is set in a restaurant world.

496
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:22,091
What are the roles in a restaurant? Chef and servers.

497
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,980
What makes this game fun is

498
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,559
everyone in the restaurant will randomly switch roles.

499
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,381
Chefs will get to be servers

500
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:33,112
so they can understand why servers rush them so much when food is late.

501
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,300
As for the servers...

502
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,685
Stop.

503
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:49,009
Don't move. Don't make a loud noise.

504
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:50,609
Understood?

505
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,090
- What are you playing?
- I'm not playing.

506
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,060
I'm serious.

507
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,639
Do you realize that you're guilty?

508
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:01,341
Guilty?

509
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:06,082
You didn't give credit to the person who gave you the idea for your game.

510
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,936
Let go of me.

511
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,406
What's this? Are you mad at me?

512
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:22,398
No. I'm not mad.

513
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:25,112
I've never been mad at you.

514
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:27,698
Then what's with the high-pitched voice?

515
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:39,639
Hey. Don't tell me you're mad at me for something so trivial.

516
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:46,155
I just want a little reward for inspiring your idea.

517
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,544
Sure. What do you want?

518
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,660
Can it be anything?

519
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:57,240
As long as it's not stars or something out of my reach,

520
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,520
I can get it for you.

521
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:04,305
I won't ask for anything out of your reach.

522
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,568
We've been together for a long time.

523
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:27,495
Don't you know what I want?

524
00:36:34,337 --> 00:36:36,311
Of course.

525
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,137
You got it.

526
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:46,942
Do you like it, Gun?

527
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:48,747
I like it very much.

528
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,355
This is too much.

529
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,136
This is too spicy.

530
00:36:58,136 --> 00:37:00,470
If you can't finish it, I will.

531
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,477
Slow down. It could get stuck in your throat.

532
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:13,749
Water.

533
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:15,349
Water.

534
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:19,408
I just warned you. Unbelievable.

535
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:29,297
Thank you for ordering me this yummy stuff.

536
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,617
Consider it a thank you for your idea.

537
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,843
I must thank you too for allowing me to experience being a boss.

538
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:39,829
You understand me a little better now. Right?

539
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:45,931
Being a boss is not easy at all.

540
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:52,461
To make it fair, you can order me to do anything.

541
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:53,664
How does that sound?

542
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:56,560
You're no longer my employee.

543
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,424
Why would you want me to give you orders again?

544
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,782
Come on. It's just for fun.

545
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:02,482
It's just for fun.

546
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:07,543
All right. How about we take turns giving orders?

547
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,390
Five orders each?

548
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,331
Deal?

549
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:15,524
To make it fair.

550
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,367
Deal.

551
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,038
Oh my god.

552
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:46,727
I'm ordering you to drop me off every morning.

553
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,625
Of course, Boss.

554
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:52,218
♫ Warm like the morning light ♫

555
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:57,432
♫ You are a cool breeze when I am burning up ♫

556
00:38:57,432 --> 00:39:01,168
♫ We hug each other until the fire was extinguished ♫

557
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:03,884
Why did you stop? I was enjoying the ride.

558
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:08,006
I'm ordering you to shout that you love me in the middle of the road.

559
00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:08,810
What?

560
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,974
♫ You are worth more than anything. I will not lose you ♫

561
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:15,185
♫ Because you are the only one who has meaning ♫

562
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,779
I love Gun!

563
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,232
Do you hear me?

564
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,870
I love him so much!

565
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,940
Are you happy now?

566
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:30,045
Not yet. You were a bit too quiet.

567
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,326
Shout it yourself.

568
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:40,063
Food made with love always tastes good.

569
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,440
Lie still.

570
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,950
You're tickling me.

571
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,514
Lie still. I don't want to hurt you.

572
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,640
Thank you for coming into my life.

573
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,609
Thank you for staying by my side and reminding me to do the right things.

574
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:01,850
You make me realize that you're not just a lover, Cher.

575
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:05,502
You're my life partner.

576
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:17,011
Cher,

577
00:40:18,703 --> 00:40:21,067
I'm ordering you to lie down.

578
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:53,393
That's my last order.

579
00:40:53,393 --> 00:40:55,910
Now you can give me your last order.

580
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:59,090
I'm ordering you...

581
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,460
to love only me forever, Gun.

582
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:12,030
You got it, Boss.

583
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,346
My babe.

584
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:42,584
Your babe is right here, Gun.

585
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:01,129
♫ I'm probably luckier than anyone else ♫

586
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:04,817
♫ My heart says you are the one ♫

587
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:08,359
♫ Once I have you, I can connect with you ♫

588
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,228
♫ Having you is good for my heart ♫

589
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,493
♫ You turned an ordinary day into something that meant a lot to me ♫

590
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,521
♫ You turned an ordinary day into something that meant a lot to me ♫

591
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:21,772
♫ That has never been found from anyone ♫

592
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,543
♫ Without you, I wouldn't be able to do it again. It's my luck to have you ♫

593
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,298
♫ Without you, I wouldn't be able to do it again. It's my luck to have you ♫

594
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:37,986
♫ Without you I can't be ♫

595
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:40,831
♫ Without you, I wouldn't be able to do it again. It's my luck to have you ♫

596
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:48,563
Do you think those eyes will make me give in, Dimples?

597
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:49,867
Whoa, Pat started it?

598
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,535
The Architecture guys stole the auditorium for their play.

599
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:53,920
Engineering also has to produce a play this year.

600
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,520
The faculty that's more prepared gets the auditorium.

601
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,510
All right. Deal.

602
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:05,511
I want to eat shrimp.

603
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,607
- Happy now?
- Not yet.

604
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,380
"I've Changed My Mind" - Force & Book

605
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,400
♫ I've changed my mind from just liking you ♫

606
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,740
♫ I've changed it to loving you ♫

607
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,230
♫ The closer we get to each other ♫

608
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,200
♫ The more I feel like I love you more every day ♫

609
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,180
♫ I've changed my mind from just liking each other ♫

610
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:54,020
♫ to wanting to use the word "I love you" just for you ♫

611
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,660
♫ Are you the only one who knows? ♫

612
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,380
♫ I want to be the one to take care of you every day ♫

613
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,480
♫ Are you okay with this? ♫
