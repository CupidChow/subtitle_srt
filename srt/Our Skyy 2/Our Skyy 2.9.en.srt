Hello to all my juniors.

We welcome everyone to the Music Club.

00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:39,449
I'm Tinn, head of the club.

14
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,555
This club doesn't welcome those who play only to get girls' attention,

15
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:47,843
Here, we only want people who enjoy playing music.

16
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,593

Don't be so noble.

22

Everyone knows that our club is where losers gather to do lousy stuff.

Not lousy!

- Shut up.

- You help me first.

30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,018
This year, I won't let you, you, you, and you

31

This year, we must win the Hot Wave championship!

Hey, keep it down.

43
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,176
We will be stricter with school clubs' activities.

He's even taller than me now.

47
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:34,225
He still has that pair of bunny teeth.

48
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:37,735
But he's a lot cuter.

From now, the clubs that do not benefit the school within one week

52
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:55,122
will be terminated.

53
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,268

54
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,556
Mr. Yotee has something to say.

55
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,348
According to the school rule,

56
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,186
the sole authority to terminate school clubs is the school president.

57
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:14,694
Then, I hope the new school president is kind to your club.

58

I'll run for the school president then.

Hey. The principal is here.

218
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,604
Let's go.

219
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:50,975
Hurry up.

220
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,442
Good news. The guard is not at the guardhouse.

221
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:03,255
We're good to go.

222
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:06,087
Why?

223
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:23,288
Hello, Ma'am.

224
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:25,088
Hello.

225
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,965
Ma'am, these are the petitions submitted.

226
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,437
This pile is from the Gifted Class.

227
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:34,773
This is from the Academic Prodigy Class.

228
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:40,568
They say your son played music and disturbed their classes.

229
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,567
Mom, we were just doing our club activity to benefit the school, as the principal requested.

230
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,665
The principal doesn't understand us,

231
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:52,260
so she thinks we caused trouble.

232
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,504
What's with that thought?

233
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:56,684
Right. What's with that thought?

234
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:01,105
- I mean, what's with your thought, huh?
- Ouch, Mom!

235
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:03,362
I needed to close the shop to handle you here. You keep causing trouble.

236
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,757
I told you already, didn't I? Do whatever you want, but don't get me in trouble. Huh?

237
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:08,320
Won't you fight for me, Mom?

238
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,774
I won't. I'm not as kind as those moms on TV.

239
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:15,150
Professor, make them learn a lesson. Give them a harsh punishment.

240
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,340
I want to return to my shop already.

241
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,960
If we add up all the trouble you've caused so far, I can already terminate your club.

242
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,166
But since you did that with good intentions,

243
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,817
I'll lessen the punishment.

244
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,642
The punishment is just...

245
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,603
closing your club for one year.

246
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:36,070
What?

247
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,898
One year?

248
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:40,246
No way.

249
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,500
By that time, we'd have graduated already.

250
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,050
It's no different from terminating our club.

251
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,635
Where can we go then?

252
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,236
The punishment is effective from now.

253
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:51,325
I hope you understand.

254
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:54,145
Mom, help me.

255
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:55,314
- Ma'am, please.
- Please.

256
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,114
I won't!

257
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,435
Why?

258
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,820
Tinn should be joining the music competition at Tao Ngoi Temple.

259
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,734
I'll give him banknote garlands until he wins.

260
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,770
I'll save his club.

261
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,920
I'll use my power as the school president to help him, so he can join Hot Wave.

262
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,402
After he wins, I will date him, according to his club's rules.

263
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:21,498
After I get to date him, according to his club's rules,

264
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:23,474
what I will do, which is very important,

265
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:26,538
is announcing that I'm his boyfriend in our graduation ceremony.

266
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,302
Graduation ceremony...

267
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,104
But why has everything turned out like this?

268
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,548
Why are you imagining things this far?

269
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:37,300
To be optimistic, I think others won't criticize you

270
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,259
for using your privilege and power

271
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:44,151
as the principal's son to help your boyfriend, your baby.

272
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:48,480
Why are you so eager to speak in English?

273
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,183
Why? I can do so. I'm good at it. What's your problem?

274
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,868
You get over him. Okay?

275
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:57,680
That's why they say love while lighting the candle

276
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,310
is like going to school in the rain.

277
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:05,975
It's supposed to be, "High school love is like a lit candle in the rain."

278
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:10,087
It's the same. I just said it backward. Not a big deal.

279
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,650
It's a mix of languages, you know.

280
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm not good at Thai. I'm not fluent.

281
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,545
So many people want to be with you.

282
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:20,425
Seriously, why him?

283
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,684
It was my birthday, but my mom was in a meeting,

284
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:34,004
so I didn't know who to celebrate with.<

285
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:38,323
I just wandered around aimlessly, feeling lonely.

286
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:42,256
Before I realized it, I was standing in front of that shop.

287
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,811
Here.

288
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:57,059
Shaved ice is served!

289
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,764
But I didn't order this.

290
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:03,561
It's my treat since you're my classmate.

291
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,841
Thanks.

292
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:16,260
How is it? Yummy?

293
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:20,888
Mom, this is Gun.

294
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,900
He's the head of the class.

295
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,104
I'm befriending him so I can copy his assignments later.

296
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,717
You wicked thing.

297
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,238
Make yourself at home.

298
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:37,176
You go. The customers are waiting.

299
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,132
Hurry up.

300
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,906
Yeah. Okay.

301
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,793
Eat it up.

302
00:21:55,261 --> 00:22:01,104
Hello, everyone. Welcome to our shop's mini-concert.

303
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:07,662
Today, I'll sing the song I like listening to when I'm alone.

304
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:12,525
If you are feeling lonely, share this song with me.

305
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,950
♪ A bustling bullfrog ♪

306
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,797
♪ On its way to wait for the rain ♪

307
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:28,334
♪ A cutie naughty bullfrog ♪

308
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:31,606
♪ A bustling bullfrog ends up getting bashed by a car ♪

309
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:35,976
Bill, please.

310
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,564
I was joking.

311
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,722
Please take a seat.

312
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:43,478
It must be this song.

313
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:45,961
I was just kidding.

314
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:50,364
♫ There you are ♫

315
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:53,047
♫ Standing next to me ♫

316
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:58,986
♫ I never even dreamed that I would meet you ♫

317
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,992
♫ in a city of millions of people ♫

318
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:07,453
♫ without having to search for anyone ♫

319
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:12,212
♫ when you get hold of me ♫

320
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:23,502
♫ I used to be another person ♫

321
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:28,475
♫ in this city of loneliness ♫

322
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:34,363
♫ who never existed ♫

323
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:41,171
♫ until you came to take over my heart ♫

324
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:46,340
♫ It's as if my room has changed its color ♫

325
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,445
♫ It’s so beautiful that nothing else can compare ♫

326
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:56,165
♫ Oh, the time has stopped moving ♫

327
00:23:56,165 --> 00:24:00,204
♫ This city isn't lonely anymore ♫

328
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:04,055
♫ Because I have you today ♫

329
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:06,714
♫ There you are ♫

330
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,407
♫ Standing next to me ♫

331
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:15,360
♫ I never even dreamed that I would meet you ♫

332
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,342
♫ in a city of millions of people ♫

333
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:23,746
♫ without having to search for anyone ♫

334
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:28,001
♫ when you get hold of me ♫

335
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:43,056
After that song ended,

336
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,524
I felt he was the only one I wanted to stay beside for my entire life.

337
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,424
Gosh.

338
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:55,403
I'm sorry, bro.

339
00:24:55,403 --> 00:24:58,003
I'm sorry for telling you to get over him.

340
00:24:58,003 --> 00:25:01,988
All right. If high school love is like a lit candle in the rain,

341
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:06,704
I, Por, will hold an umbrella for you.

342
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,630
Umbrella.

343
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:13,940
Thanks a lot.

344
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:20,106
Tonight, you must beg your mom to allow the Music Club to reopen.

345
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:07,933
Why are you here?

346
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,759
Don't be shocked.

347
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,058
I'm just your imagination.

348
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:23,077
Whether we'll get to date or not depends on you.

349
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:39,872
- Mom.
- The admission exam is next month.

350
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:42,051
Are you done studying?

351
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,051
Not yet.

352
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:51,598
I'll go and study now.

353
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:58,387
Don't you want to be my boyfriend?

354
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:01,971
We'll get to date at the water park.

355
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,713
Water park.

356
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:05,654
Water park.

357
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,820
Water park.

358
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:22,791
Mom, I think you should give the Music Club another chance.

359
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:27,230
If the Music Club wins Hot Wave,

360
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,047
they will earn our school so much fame.

361
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:34,316
But according to the rules, those who do wrong must be punished.

362
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:36,443
Fight for it.

363
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:40,806
During the pre-contest activity, we'll get to stay over together.

364
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:44,194
Stay over.

365
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,216
Stay over.

366
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:47,909
Stay over.

367
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,123
Mom, I think you should give the Music Club another chance.

368
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:06,945
They already feel remorse for what they did.

369
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:11,283
Gun, do you want me to break the rules?

370
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:17,507
You keep talking about rules and rules.

371
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,079
Please think about our future, will you?

372
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,867
You're a teacher, aren't you? Why are you being too much?

373
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,530
But after thinking it over, maybe...

374
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:39,415
I should give them another chance.

375
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:41,115
Really?

376
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,623
Thank you.

377
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:52,372

379
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,640
The principal mentioned that if we pass every subject on the mid-term exam,

380
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,620
she will allow our club to open.

381
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,439
That's because she knows there's no way we can do it.

382
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,211
Just disband.

383
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:17,968
Well, I forgot that it now looks like we've already disbanded.

384
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,496
Hey, let's fight for it.

385
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,978
When it comes to studying,

386
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:29,945

387
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:35,878
Nice. I'll tutor them.

388
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,491
Holy Lion.

389
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:50,109
Please help us guess the correct answers and pass every subject.

390
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:53,983
Please.

391
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:58,843
- There are no surprises as to why their club is doomed.
- I feel at ease now.

392
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:01,293
I somehow feel like we're getting a full score.

393
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:03,710
- We will pass, trust me.
- What a relief.

394
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,761
We must use the second plan.

- What? We never did that. We're just talking among ourselves.
- Right?

420

00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:04,272
You don't need to thank me.

431

- It's your home.
- We've been sitting like this for long.

Find something for us to eat, okay? Anything will do.

Don't tell me you don't know how to ride it.

474
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:20,256
What? I learned how to ride it since the day I was born.

475
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,889

I checked what we have in the refrigerator.

This is all we have to make soup.

Well, I think it's done now.

Wait. Do you want to taste it?

506
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:06,542
Use the spoon.

00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:01,081
I wasn't used to finishing early, so I reviewed it.

531
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:05,693
Oho. That's my boss!

532
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
- Absolutely.
- You nailed it.

533
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,713
I did it!

534
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,517
We all passed! We did!

535
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:31,806
Yay! We passed.

536
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,778
- Tiw.
- Huh?

537
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:37,915
Sound.

538
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:40,385
Good job, Win.

539
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:43,945
Pat, should we hug too?

540
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:46,397
Of course.

541
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:51,148
Lion!

542
00:41:51,148 --> 00:41:53,143
The written exams should be okay.

543
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,183
It's now down to whether you're ready for the ballroom dance exam.

544
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:58,576
Are you ready?

545
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:02,220
I'm ready.

546
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,151
Tonight, I'll ask him to be my dance partner.

547
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,017
Give it a try.

548
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,626
Lion!

549
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:32,046
Why don't you sleep in the room?

550
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:38,265
Sound is snoring. I couldn't sleep, so I came here.

551
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:44,497
Por is snoring too, so I came in here to get away from him.

552
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:49,172
Can I sleep here with you?

553
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,274
This is your house. You can sleep wherever you want,

554
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:58,669
but this sofa is mine.

555
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,619
Tinn, have you fallen asleep?

556
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,133
Not yet.

557
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,353
- You...
- Do you want to be my partner?

558
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:43,498
Didn't you say we must wait until the Hot Wave contest is over?

559
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:49,750
What are you talking about?

560
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,763
How is this related to Hot Wave?

561
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:54,201
I'm talking about our ballroom dance exam.

562
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,787
I was about to ask you that.

563
00:44:01,787 --> 00:44:03,387
Were you?

564
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,926
Can you dance?

565
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:09,709
Show me.

566
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:11,801
Come. Let's dance.

567
00:44:12,461 --> 00:44:13,861
Come.

568
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:17,096
Stand up.

569
00:44:58,017 --> 00:44:59,680
What?

570
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:02,996
I can't do this.

571
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:07,241
I'm too sleepy. I will sleep now.

572
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:15,479
What's wrong with him?

573
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:18,650
Fine. I'll sleep.

574
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,299
Come on.

575
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:39,644
Tinn,

576
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,020
your heart is beating fast like mine, isn't it?

577
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:55,168
How could you fall asleep so easily?

578
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,868
[Ballroom dance exam day]

579
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:11,239
So have you stopped being shy when he's around?

580
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:15,335
Not yet.

581
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:19,504
But I just want to pair up with him,

582
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:21,471
stay close to him,

583
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:23,675
and look into his eyes.

584
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,109
That's enough.

585
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:36,884
No matter how fast my heart beats, I'm already happy.

586
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:40,118
That's my friend.

587
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:45,013
- Good.
- Next group, please.

588
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:55,426
Tinn, can you pair up with me instead?

589
00:46:56,715 --> 00:46:58,215
Why?

590
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,050
Sound sucks at this.

591
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,236
You two are good at it. Help me.

592
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,620
But I...

593
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:15,095
All right. I'll dance with Sound.

594
00:47:16,578 --> 00:47:18,429
You two can pair up.

595
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,557
If you're ready, here's the music.

596
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:11,648
♫ Meeting you ♫

597
00:48:11,648 --> 00:48:16,386
♫ Seeing you makes my heart flutter ♫

598
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:20,005
♫ It trembles ♫

599
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:23,720
♫ Since the first time our eyes meet ♫

600
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,668
♫ My heart flies ♫

601
00:48:27,668 --> 00:48:32,454
♫ Is this what I'm meant to find? ♫

602
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,595
♫ Dancing under the starlight ♫

603
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:36,606
♫ On a terribly cold night ♫

604
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:39,856
♫ You keep my heart warm ♫

605
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:43,312
♫ When you lead ♫

606
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:47,673
♫ My whole world follows ♫

607
00:48:47,673 --> 00:48:51,493
♫ Everything beautifully glows ♫

608
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:55,552
♫ I think it's because of you ♫

609
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,891
♫ I long for your words ♫

610
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:02,650
♫ Whispering those sweet words ♫

611
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:06,478
♫ If you only knew when I first saw you ♫

612
00:49:06,478 --> 00:49:08,196
♫ You're all I dreamed of ♫

613
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:13,874
♫ My heart skips a beat when you're near ♫

614
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:17,962
♫ When you're by my side ♫

615
00:49:17,962 --> 00:49:22,622
♫ When you look into my eyes ♫

616
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:25,867
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

617
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:29,044
♫ To hear my love ♫

618
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:37,585
♫ So unfamiliar ♫

619
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:42,720
♫ I had never understood this new feeling ♫

620
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,602
♫ Until the day I met you ♫

621
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:53,684
♫ The rhythm of my heart ♫

622
00:49:53,684 --> 00:49:58,349
♫ Follows the beat that you play ♫

623
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:00,306
♫ Everything feels so right ♫

624
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:06,036
♫ Is there a way to tell you how I feel ♫

625
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:09,314
♫ When you lead ♫

626
00:50:09,314 --> 00:50:13,969
♫ My whole world follows ♫

627
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,450
♫ Everything beautifully glows ♫

628
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:23,911
♫ I think it's because of you ♫

629
00:50:23,911 --> 00:50:26,543
♫ I long for your words ♫

630
00:50:26,543 --> 00:50:28,676
♫ Whispering those sweet words ♫

631
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:32,622
♫ If you only knew when I first saw you ♫

632
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:34,211
♫ You're all I dreamed of ♫

633
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:39,932
♫ My heart skips a beat when you're near ♫

634
00:50:39,932 --> 00:50:43,951
♫ When you're by my side ♫

635
00:50:43,951 --> 00:50:48,325
♫ When you look into my eyes ♫

636
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:51,910
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

637
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,849
♫ To hear my love ♫

638
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:02,048
♫ Even just a brief moment we're together ♫

639
00:51:02,048 --> 00:51:07,905
♫ I hope it stays in your heart forever ♫

640
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:01,965
♫ I long for your words ♫

641
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:04,048
♫ Whispering those sweet words ♫

642
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:08,454
♫ If you only knew when I first saw you ♫

643
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:10,010
♫ You're all I dreamed of ♫

644
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:15,871
♫ My heart skips a beat when you're near ♫

645
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:20,029
♫ When you're by my side ♫

646
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:24,329
♫ When you look into my eyes ♫

647
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:27,940
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

648
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,051
♫ To hear my love ♫

649
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:36,238
♫ In your heart if there's no one ♫

650
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:40,183
♫ Can I be that person? ♫

651
00:52:40,183 --> 00:52:43,969
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

652
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:48,565
♫ To hear my love ♫

653
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:56,526
♫ Love me, would you love me, I wonder ♫

654
00:52:56,526 --> 00:53:01,169
♫ Please tell me ♫

655
00:53:32,206 --> 00:53:33,706
It's okay.

656
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:57,510
Is this why you changed your partner?

657
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:10,238
I know there's no way a perfectionist like you would want to change your partner.

658
00:54:13,991 --> 00:54:16,052
What happened to your leg?

659
00:54:17,835 --> 00:54:19,309
I fell down the stairs.

660
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:25,782
So you paired up with Tinn

661
00:54:25,782 --> 00:54:28,422
because you were afraid you would make me fail the exam?

662
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:32,088
Why didn't you just tell me?

663
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:35,274
Why did you have to act cool?

664
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,775
I'm already cool without having to act.

665
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,961
If you don't have anything more to say, I'll go home now.

666
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:45,194
Wait.

667
00:54:54,744 --> 00:54:56,412
My motorbike is here.

668
00:54:56,412 --> 00:54:58,331
I'll give you a ride home.

669
00:55:02,706 --> 00:55:04,206
You don't have to.

670
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:16,450
Don't be stubborn. Okay?

671
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:19,873
Come.

672
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:24,392
I'll be your leg.

673
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:39,126
This is unbelievable, Principal.

674
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:43,844
We passed all the subjects on the mid-term exam.

675
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:49,139
That means...

676
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,731
Thank you.

677
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,272
The principal shouldn't have been too easy on them.

678
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,349
I'm going. Goodbye.

679
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:23,849
Bye.

680
00:56:28,015 --> 00:56:30,696
Hey, aren't you happy?

681
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:33,562
The Music Club is back.

682
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:41,323
But from now on, my duty is over.

683
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:47,636
He and I can just remain classmates.

684
00:56:48,745 --> 00:56:54,558
I can only look at him from afar, but he never looks at me.

685
00:56:56,757 --> 00:56:58,157
Gun,

686
00:56:58,813 --> 00:57:01,690
I can hold an umbrella for you,

687
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:05,989
but in the end, you must light the candle yourself.

688
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:11,634
What can I do about it?

689
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:14,533
I can't sing.

690
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:16,537
I can't play music.

691
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,543
But you're the school president.

692
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:23,080
If you can help them with Hot Wave and make them win,

693
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,460
you can finally get to date him.

694
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,416
Or you can just choose to hide yourself in the student council room.

695
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,200
That's up to you.

696
00:57:46,554 --> 00:57:50,315
Hey, since our club is back to life,

697
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:53,006
let's...

698
00:57:53,006 --> 00:57:54,735
eat hotpot!

699
00:57:54,735 --> 00:58:01,532
Hotpot!

700
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:03,065
Let's go.

701
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:07,358
You guys go first. I'll be there soon.

702
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,014
We'll eat it up.

703
00:58:09,014 --> 00:58:10,285
If you're late, we'll eat it up.

704
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:11,671
Hurry up.

705
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:12,713
You pay for us.

706
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:13,843
Let's go.

707
00:58:13,843 --> 00:58:18,083
Hotpot!

708
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:25,723
Congrats.

709
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:38,115
I got something for you.

710
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:43,059
To return the favor for tutoring me.

711
00:58:44,236 --> 00:58:47,987
When you tutored me, your hair kept covering your eyes.

712
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:50,529
Use this so that it won't cover them anymore.

713
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:56,957
Thanks a lot.

714
00:58:56,957 --> 00:58:58,840
I'm going back.

715
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,494
Hey, wait.

716
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:06,158
I have wanted to ask you something for so long, but haven't had a chance to ask you.

717
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:12,684
I wonder why you helped our club.

718
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:19,088
Well, I'm the school president, so it's my duty to help people.

719
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:23,430
Nope. Everyone knows you hate my club.

720
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,249
Be frank with me.

721
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:27,828
What do you want?

722
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:36,370
Well, I...

723
00:59:37,749 --> 00:59:40,001
I...

724
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:45,903
Well, I want you to win Hot Wave.

725
00:59:49,546 --> 00:59:53,963
If you win Hot Wave, you can earn a good reputation for our school.

726
00:59:53,963 --> 00:59:56,591
Our school will be famous.

727
00:59:56,591 --> 00:59:58,445
Am I right?

728
00:59:58,445 --> 01:00:00,519
Yeah. That's right.

729
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:26,245
For some matters, a lion must rely on a mouse.

730
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:38,488
I'll stay by your side. I promise.

731
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:21,268
We're one step closer to success.

732
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:24,241
Now, we just have to wait until they start dating,

733
01:01:24,241 --> 01:01:27,300
so we can let everyone know we're dating.

734
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:34,556
The world will finally know that TiwsonPor is real.

735
01:02:05,565 --> 01:02:08,040
Have you decided which song to use in the contest?

736
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:12,510
Win proposed that since we're joining the contest, we should make our own MV.

737
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:15,604
Do we need to be this serious about shooting the MV?

738
01:02:16,176 --> 01:02:21,587
If you don't look at me, how do you know I look at you?

739
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,487
I won't shoot the MV. Let's cancel it.
