Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,371
Every chaos that happened was caused by you two.

6
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:26,333
The punishment is either a one-semester suspension or expulsion.

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,871
See you later, my friend.

8
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:31,539
What brings you all here?

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,707
My film is done.

10
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:38,660
I really like it when the sky is clear like this.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,800
But I like it more when you're next to me, Akk.

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,020
"Regret" - 5 U

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,610
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,880
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,370
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,850
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,930
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,240
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,850
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,290
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:35,010
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,710
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

23
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,500
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,150
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:55,230
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

26
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:02,250
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

27
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,667
I thought you wouldn't come.

28
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:32,566
Of course, I would.

29
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:34,832
I promised you.

30
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,480
What a nooby.

31
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:47,424
Am I still a nooby?

32
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:55,650
Action speaks louder than words. Have you ever heard that?

33
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,280
Are you awake already, Shortstop?

34
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,569
Shortstop, my ass. You are.

35
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,675
Yeah, Big Foot.

36
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:31,516
How was it? You watched the movie Wat recommended again, didn't you?

37
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:36,501
- What were you in your dream this time?
- A cowboy.

38
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,838
Brokeback Mountain?

39
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,161
Damn it. That's cool.

40
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,600
It is, but the ending is too sad.

41
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:49,041
But our story won't end like that.

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,531
Come. Wash your face.

43
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:57,970
I've prepared breakfast for you, but today is your turn to wash the dishes.

44
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,664
What?

45
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:16,958
I'm just feeling good...

46
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:21,226
to be the first person to see you wake up.

47
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,809
If someone else saw you first,

48
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:32,047
they would certainly be so shocked...

49
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,400
How come you were drooling during sleep, huh?

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,690
Wipe it.

51
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,972
- I'm going.
- Get out real quick!

52
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:54,467
Just thinking about the next two weeks

53
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:58,482
when I'll be celebrating my birthday with my boyfriend, Aye, for the first time

54
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:01,403
already makes me feel super happy.

55
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,912
I can't wait for that day to arrive.

56
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,492
- Hey.
- What?

57
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:12,205
The leading guy dreams of owning a land and living together happily,

58
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,800
but it's a regret his wish isn't fulfilled.

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,681
I think it's also because of the difficult period in the story.

60
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:21,287
I do agree that owning a place is important,

61
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:25,135
but what's more important is a space.

62
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,885
Do you understand the different vibe between "place" and "space"?

63
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:32,194
A place is what you can own,

64
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:38,210
but a space is where you feel comfortable to be in.

65
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,157
Ah, I see.

66
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,563
Do you have that space now?

67
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:44,963
Of course.

68
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,047
Where?

69
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:50,253
Right there.

70
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,853
Over there, too.

71
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:58,331
And right here.

72
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:07,056
You're shy, aren't you?

73
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,276
Honestly, anywhere with you is fine for me.

74
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,976
It's the space I always feel comfortable to be in.

75
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,273
You're talking too much.

76
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,711
Have you already made yourself free in the next two weeks?

77
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,121
What's happening then?

78
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,687
- It's...
- Oh, I see.

79
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,687
You'll be submitting your portfolio. ight?

80
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,181
Submitting your grade for university admission.

81
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,349
That's happening next month.

82
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,416
Is it?

83
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,360
So, what day is that?

84
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,557
Is it a full moon day?

85
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,466
A Buddhist Holy Day?

86
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,261
Are we making merit?

87
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,501
- Huh?
- Just forget about it.

88
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:57,643
It's just another typical day. Just make sure you're free.

89
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,608
Hey. Akk, I'm not full yet.

90
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,510
It's my turn to wash the dishes today.

91
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,211
Or do you want to wash it yourself?

92
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:16,400
Hey, Akk. Akk.

93
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:27,044
Drink it, so you will grow up fast.

94
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:35,769
I'm feeling fresher now.

95
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,469
Yeah.

96
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:40,092
Where do you want to go?

97
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,823
Hey, Aye!

98
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,963
We agreed last night that we'd go to take photos there, didn't we?

99
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:49,398
Did we?

100
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:56,961
I thought you weren't serious about it, so I didn't think of it as our plan.

101
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,464
Learn how to care about others, will you?

102
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:02,872
Why are you being harsh? I just forgot a bit.

103
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:04,743
You shouldn't have been like this.

104
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,843
You should pay attention to everything about others, shouldn't you?

105
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,170
Like what you've been doing?

106
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,508
You keep caring about others so much that you're in trouble yourself.

107
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,133
Hey, Aye.

108
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,570
I'm serious here, Akk.

109
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,860
You can't care about others all the time.

110
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,760
Also, caring about others without them asking for it means you're crossing the line.

111
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,978
But you should care about some matters, too.

112
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,781
For example? What should I care about?

113
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,666
Like the day...

114
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,166
Which day?

115
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,918
The day we'd arranged to meet up with Wat.

116
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,298
You're worried I'll forget our appointment?

117
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,034
Of course, I remember.

118
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,216
We already made an appointment with Wat, so how can I forget about it?

119
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:49,384
Let's go. Let's take photos.

120
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,846
- You stand here.
- Okay.

121
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:01,524
Though we already finished grade 12 final exam, graduating from high school,

122
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:05,289
I feel there're so many things I still don't know about,

123
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:08,600
for example, being in a relationship with him.

124
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,500
Hey, Aye!

125
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,750
Catch me!

126
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,250
- Aye!
- Come on!

127
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,148
Hurry up.

128
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,505
We're on time.

129
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:45,768
I already texted Wat, telling him my car is broken,

130
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:48,006
so I have to ride my family's motorbike.

131
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,204
It's good you've found out it was broken since you were still home.

132
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,868
But coming by motorbike is good, isn't it?

133
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,829
Yeah. We didn't have to risk getting stuck in the traffic.

134
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:58,450
But what's also good about it is that you hugged my waist so tightly.

135
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:01,768
I didn't want to hug you. It's just that I was afraid I would fall.

136
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:07,148
Shall we use this motorbike again next time when I need to go somewhere with you?

137
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:08,959
Sure. I'm fine with that.

138
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,479
But next time, let me be the rider, and you sit on the back.

139
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,631
Sure. I'm totally fine with that.

140
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,331
Let's go.

141
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,132
Are you acting cool, filming a music video here?

142
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,132
You teased me as soon as you arrived.

143
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:31,840
You hang out with Thua often,

144
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,513
so I thought you took in some of his good personalities.

145
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:38,540
Who told you so? It's Thua who took in mine.

146
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:40,646
I'm filtering them, Wat.

147
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:44,048
Don't worry. I won't take in bad ones.

148
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,920
Thua, it's me.

149
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm just kidding.

150
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,422
Wat, where are the others?

151
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:54,439
I haven't seen them yet. They probably haven't arrived.

152
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:57,169
- Should we go in first then?
- All right.

153
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,689
Hey. We're here.

154
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,000
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,251
All right. All of us are here.

156
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:07,712
Let's take a look around first, shall we?

157
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:11,248
Then, after senior Mork arrives, I'll separate from you guys.

158
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:14,221
Wait!

159
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,988
Did you all forget me again?

160
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,268
Namo?!

161
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:22,724
Wait. I don't recall asking you to join.

162
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:26,590
You didn't. I invited myself.

163
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,750
Well, I chatted with Akk the other day, so I knew you guys would come here.

164
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,727
What a big mouth you've got, Akk.

165
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,993
What are you taking us to see, Wat?

166
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:39,300
Guys, this is the movie called The Red Eagle.

167
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,660
The leading actor is Mitr Chaibancha.

168
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,470
It's a legendary Thai movie.

169
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,459
That's cool.

170
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,741
Are there also other movies?

171
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:51,185
- Let's check them out.
- Let's go.

172
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,365
- Wat.
- Hmm?

173
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:58,140
What's the purpose of this Thai Film Archive?

174
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,900
It's similar to a library, a museum, or an art gallery.

175
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,860
It's for storing films.

176
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:11,057
It's also the venue for the short film competition where you're submitting your film, The Eclipse.

177
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,557
Right.

178
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,023
Guys, I'm excited.

179
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:27,108
Well, let's take a look around and meet here after one hour.

180
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:29,778
I have to go and wait for senior Mork now. Okay?

181
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:32,041
- Yeah.
- See you soon.

182
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:40,308
Thua and Mo,

183
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,668
have you ever watched this movie?

184
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:43,891
[Ong-Bak]
He's super cool.

185
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,691
I want to try being this character once in my lifetime.

186
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,229
Ting, the way you fight now doesn't prove your dignity at all.

187
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:07,388
- I'm afraid you'll get hurt.
- Ting, you slipped up.

188
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:12,444
- Are you serious here?
- Of course, I am.

189
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,232
That was close.

190
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,243
If I really made you fall down, you would certainly get hurt.

191
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:22,770
What if I make you fall down?

192
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,540
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

193
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,694
I'm not.

194
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,750
I feel good that I can protect you.

195
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,490
Just being born here for me to take care of is already enough.

196
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,194
What are you guys doing?

197
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,639
Stay away.

198
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,974
Damn you!

199
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:51,188
Why are you here?

200
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:52,788
How come?

201
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:02,033
Yes, Teacher. I've already arrived.

202
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,225
I contacted him already.

203
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:06,273
Good.

204
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,172
Ask him if you have any questions.

205
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:11,891
He's is an indie type like you are. I guess you will understand each other well.

206
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:16,543
By the way, overall, he likes the film you submitted,

207
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:19,224
but it seems something still needs to be added.

208
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,335
That's why he wanted to see you today.

209
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:26,653
Thank you very much for always helping me with everything.

210
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,453
My pleasure.

211
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,363
I graduated from high school already,

212
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:34,651
so I guess I won't get to see you anymore.

213
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:39,453
That sounded like we're living in Y2K era when it's difficult to keep in touch.

214
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,631
These days, it's so easy to keep in touch.

215
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,827
I'll be there to root for you on the competition day.

216
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,501
Yes.

217
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,215
Please come, Teacher.

218
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,815
Yeah.

219
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,751
You've already graduated from high school.

220
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,631
Will you start making a move on her now?

221
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:01,070
What move are you talking about? Huh?

222
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,286
What? I'm talking about Teacher Sani and you.

223
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,132
You jerk.

224
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,521
I don't think of her that way.

225
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,086
Really?

226
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:16,079
But it's also fine if you do because you graduated from high school already.

227
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,107
You won't stop, will you?

228
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:22,509
By the way, you have been using a dating application recently, right?

229
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,028
I'll curse you to keep swiping right all the time.

230
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,490
Hey, don't.

231
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,965
You can't curse me like that

232
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:34,209
because my new year resolution this year is finding myself a girlfriend.

233
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,012
I was just teasing you, dude.

234
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:40,408
I'll go pee.

235
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:54,370
[Behind the Painting]

236
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,368
This place is so beautiful, Nopporn.

237
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,785
Yes, Lady.

238
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:39,367
One day, I'll let someone draw a picture of this place.

239
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,067
Why?

240
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:49,040
To keep our beautiful friendship as the memory behind the picture, Nopporn.

241
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:53,391
There's no way I will forget this beautiful friendship.

242
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,121
Akk,

243
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,266
why are you walking in such a hurry?

244
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:12,435
This is how I usually walk. You're the slow one.

245
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:14,935
Can't we just talk nicely for a minute?

246
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,119
Why are you being sarcastic?

247
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:24,035
Did you see the poster of that Thai superhero movie?

248
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,346
The Red Eagle we just walked past?

249
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,237
Yeah. Actually, there's a movie called The Golden Eagle, too.

250
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:34,041
It's like us two.

251
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,991
Since we came back from camp, we have been fighting all the time.

252
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,873
What's wrong with you, Golden Eagle?

253
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:10,700
There's no need for me to answer your question, Red Eagle.

254
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,375
You're cheating.

255
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,188
You know full well, ouch,

256
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,533
that I can't resist those sparkling eyes of yours.

257
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,617
Pull yourself together, Red Eagle.

258
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,897
Wait.

259
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:33,038
If you don't stop, I won't stand it anymore.

260
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,341
What will you do if you don't stand it?

261
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,248
Golden Eagle.

262
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:04,275
I think something still needs to be added.

263
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,557
How, Senior?

264
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:10,430
First, it's too short.

265
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,612
Second, I feel like something is missing.

266
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:20,777
You can add something that could be both a private matter and a public matter.

267
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:24,811
Is that so?

268
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:28,626
Honestly, I think your short film is intriguing.

269
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:32,264
If you add a bit more of something to it, its concept will become clearer

270
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:37,325
and that will increase your chance of advancing into further rounds.

271
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,278
All right, Senior.

272
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:44,535
Give it a try.

273
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,135
Sure.

274
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,041
Reshoot?

275
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,989
We need to shoot more scenes.

276
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,035
Senior Mork told me we should add a subject matter to the story.

277
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:59,128
What did he tell you to add?

278
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:00,570
He didn't tell me,

279
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:06,140
but it should be both a private and a public matter.

280
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:08,212
That's pretty challenging.

281
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:09,612
True.

282
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,230
It's harder than Teacher Waree's exam we took to graduate from high school.

283
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:17,293
Wat, when are you going to shoot then?

284
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:21,353
How about after coming back from our river camp trip?

285
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:24,874
We don't have that much time left.

286
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:27,235
Well, just forget about it.

287
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,740
I'll just submit this version.

288
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,035
Hey, how about shooting during this trip?

289
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:33,797
Wait. But we're going tomorrow.

290
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:36,428
Right. How can we shoot it? We haven't written scripts yet.

291
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,499
We haven't figured out which subject matter to talk about either.

292
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,122
Let me propose my idea.

293
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:42,640
Should we talk about a person who's so obsessed with himself

294
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,069
that he ignores others around him?

295
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:47,760
Hey. That's a good idea.

296
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,102
People these days only care about themselves. They don't care about others.

297
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:57,476
But I think we should talk about a person who cares about others too much,

298
00:21:57,476 --> 00:22:00,076
and that violates others' rights.

299
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:03,656
Should we?

300
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,935
I think this one is good.

301
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:08,582
People these days like to claim they mean well while messing with others' business.

302
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:10,190
But I think my idea sounds more interesting.

303
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,312
You're rambling.

304
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:13,144
You are.

305
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:14,315
Mine is more interesting.

306
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:15,661
Shit.

307
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,447
Why does this situation look familiar, Wat?

308
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:19,659
Right.

309
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:23,105
It's two vs. two.

310
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:27,919
Now, it depends on your vote, Namo.

311
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:30,909
You guys are making it too tough for me.

312
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,629
Why are you giving me the evil eye?

313
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:34,233
I can't decide.

314
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:38,375
To be honest, both ideas are good.

315
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,078
Hey, let's put it this way.

316
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:43,526
We divide into teams to write our scripts.

317
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,431
Akk, you're with Kan.

318
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,624
Aye and Thua are on the other team.

319
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:52,281
Then, we vote to decide which team is better.

320
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:53,781
Deal?

321
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,355
Yeah.

322
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,182
Mine is better.

323
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,782
You wait and see my team's script then.

324
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,781
Akk, what are you up to these days?

325
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,102
Nothing much.

326
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,149
What about you? How do you like golfing?

327
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:20,440
It's fun, but my skin has become a lot more tanned.

328
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Sure.

329
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:30,026
Well, I see that you guys have been fighting.

330
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:32,270
Oh, I mean you have divided into teams to write scripts.

331
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,882
Let's share the rooms based on the team then.

332
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:38,322
Akk and Kan, you sleep in the same room.

333
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:42,995
Thua and Aye will share another room.

334
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,595
Okay?

335
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:48,753
Is there any problem?

336
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,253
Or do you two want to sleep in the same room?

337
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:58,204
To be honest, I'm worried about Thua,

338
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,570
but, anyway, work matters more.

339
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:09,010
Just sleeping separately for a couple of nights is all right, isn't it?

340
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,475
Don't overact.

341
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:13,124
Aye,

342
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:14,622
don't touch Thua.

343
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:17,230
I won't mess with your boyfriend.

344
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,888
But you must be careful.

345
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:24,300
At night, something will be wriggling next to you, and that will wake you up.

346
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,515
Then, when you wake up in the morning, you'll experience something scary,

347
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:31,618
such as a person whose cheek is covered in drool while sleeping.

348
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,290
Be careful.

349
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,901
Thua,

350
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:37,740
you must endure tonight.

351
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,975
The person sharing the room with you likes to talk in his sleep,

352
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:42,956
and, at night, he will snore so loudly that you can't sleep.

353
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:44,689
Prepare some earplugs.

354
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:45,777
That much?

355
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,967
- Yeah.
- Thua, don't believe him.

356
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:52,195
Wat, I'm sharing the room with you.

357
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:54,515
There won't be anything scary like those two rooms. Right?

358
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,375
Take it.

359
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:05,246
So what did Aye and you argue about?

360
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,063
We didn't.

361
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:11,701
You think I can't tell?

362
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:14,715
You proposed your idea for Wat's short film because you tried to be sarcastic towards Aye.

363
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:17,727
We've been friends for many years. I can tell, of course.

364
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,915
It's nothing.

365
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:22,978
I think there must be something.

366
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,380
I told you there isn't.

367
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,161
What about you? How was your trip with Thua?

368
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,047
It was nice,

369
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:33,516
but I think Kan takes care of me too much sometimes.

370
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:37,459
I want to make him feel that I can take care of myself too.

371
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,558
Did you try telling him that?

372
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,475
It's probably easier than you thought.

373
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,058
I'm not sure.

374
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:51,343
Usually, Kan understands everything easily,

375
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:54,704
but I'm not sure if he will be okay about this.

376
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:57,335
Give it a try.

377
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,436
Don't talk about my issue anymore. How about yours?

378
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,368
Will you really leave what's going on between you two like this?

379
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:08,935
You both will go to university soon. Things will probably go too far.

380
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,700
I don't think so.

381
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,657
I think Akk likes it.

382
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,117
Who the hell will like it, huh?

383
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:16,280
Recently, he has been getting on my nerves.

384
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,555
We can't talk properly for even five minutes, and then we fight again.

385
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,517
I know what you mean.

386
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:24,849
Though Thua and I haven't fought with each other,

387
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:29,637
I feel there has been some tension between us recently.

388
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:35,356
I think Thua and Aye are similar.

389
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:38,803
They only focus on themselves, especially Aye.

390
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:40,775
He is so damn obsessed with his own thoughts.

391
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:42,779
Sometimes when I started a conversation,

392
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:47,476
he pretends to be listening and his face shows no feelings.

393
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:49,350
After a while, he bounces off.

394
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,650
He was like, "What did you say?"

395
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,870
I asked him questions, but he didn't answer.

396
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,708
He's obsessed with his own thoughts.

397
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,326
Aye and Thua are so damn similar.

398
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,826
That's why I'm thinking about using this short film's script to make him realize that he must care about others, too.

399
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:03,499
He can't only focus on himself.

400
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,891
Just talking about this makes me furious.

401
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,480
Chill out. Relax.

402
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,867
I know you're furious for real.

403
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,460
Let's go. It's our meeting time.

404
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,500
Let's play in the river to calm down a bit.

405
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:28,775
Akk and Aye, so you two really are not going to reconcile. Right?

406
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:33,259
- We're not going to.
- We're not going to.

407
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,907
That was crystal clear, dudes.

408
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:38,576
Well, then. That's up to you both.

409
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:43,616
But now, I'll go play in the river. Okay?

410
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:00,410
It's so cold in here.

411
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,594
It's a bomb!

412
00:28:29,192 --> 00:28:32,343
One, two, three.

413
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,146
Whoa. Superb.

414
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,344
You all look handsome. This photographer is talented.

415
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:41,273
Honestly, playing in the water is fun, but is damn exhausting.

416
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,537
By the way, I took photos of you guys.

417
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:48,189
I'll send you the link later in case you want to check them out.

418
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:51,897
But it's a regret you weren't in the photo with us.

419
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,146
Next time, you'd better set the camera up and join us.

420
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:56,903
Sure. But you know this, don't you?

421
00:28:56,903 --> 00:29:00,890
When I'm not in the photo, that means I'm the photographer.

422
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,642
I know, but I want you in the photo too.

423
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,816
Hey, don't make me get emotional.

424
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:07,858
We graduated from high school already.

425
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:10,615
I don't know if I'll meet you all again.

426
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:14,426
After you go to university and make new friends,

427
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,916
will you forget me?

428
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,885
We will.

429
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:20,115
Damn it.

430
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,853
I'm kidding.

431
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,571
There's no way we'll forget each other.

432
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:31,275
Wat will that short film competition announce the result right away?

433
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,473
They said they will.

434
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,574
I think your film will certainly win an award, Wat.

435
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:40,783
I don't know, but it will be nice if I win.

436
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:43,376
But I'm not expecting much anyway.

437
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:48,941
I just hope there will be viewers who watch and understand my film.

438
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:53,627
I think you should prepare a celebration party. You'll surely win.

439
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,035
- Me?
- Yeah.

440
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,435
But the award ceremony day is on the same day as Akk's birthday.

441
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,665
Let's do this then.

442
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:19,920
Let's celebrate his birthday and the award Wat wins on the same day.

443
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,767
Wait. My film hasn't received the award yet.

444
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,783
Aye.

445
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:35,745
Who phoned you in the evening? Did something happen?

446
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,440
It was my mom.

447
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:41,018
There's a bit of a problem.

448
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,556
Are you all right?

449
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:50,930
That's because my script writing team will beat yours,

450
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,450
Darling.

451
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:55,556
Was that your acting?

452
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,015
Yeah.

453
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:59,047
You're Aye, majoring in acting, aren't you?

454
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,754
I've been practicing recently.

455
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:02,055
Have you ever heard this?

456
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:06,119
It's said that if the scriptwriter understands how to act,

457
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,510
his script will become livelier

458
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,880
and the cast team will act more smoothly.

459
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,747
That sounds reasonable.

460
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:19,353
But I think you shouldn't work too hard.

461
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:21,393
You're worried about me, aren't you?

462
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:25,240
I'm afraid it will be a waste of effort

463
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,656
because my team will win, no matter what.

464
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,050
You should keep practicing your acting skill...

465
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,110
and remain Aye, majoring in acting.

466
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,237
Senior Aye, acting major.

467
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,175
Hey. I've found it.

468
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:51,161
Those who don't care about anything are called ignorants.

469
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,701
This word is mostly used to call those who ignore problems in Thailand.

470
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:59,994
It's used more clearly among Twitter users who support using social media beneficially,

471
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:02,820
instead using it to only vent feelings about their life problems

472
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,162
and workplace issues, discussing what they like or dislike,

473
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:09,944
and expressing what's on their minds without boundary.

474
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:14,212
I used to be like that.

475
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:19,476
But recently, using social media makes me even more stressed out.

476
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:22,784
That's true. I agree.

477
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,013
But I think Thua and Aye should also do something for common interest.

478
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,494
They aren't that obsessed with their own lives, are they?

479
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:32,158
Right. I know that, Kan.

480
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,232
I'm not writing this film script just to insult them.

481
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:37,831
If I did that, it would mean I used my feelings over anything else.

482
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,171
I want to talk about it as a big picture.

483
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,370
Let's continue.

484
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,469
I like what this person wrote.

485
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:48,654
"For some matters, we can't over PC."

486
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:53,426
"If you're looking for the idealistic world, wait for 5,000 to 6,000 years."

487
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:55,913
"I'm rooting for you."

488
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:58,198
That's the bomb.

489
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,826
But I like this one.

490
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:03,894
After reading it, I'm like, yeah, he's right.

491
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:11,699
It says, "What's miraculous about netizens is that some people are so over PC

492
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:16,351
that I wonder if they have ever been satisfied with anything in their life."

493
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:18,034
Someone quoted this message, saying

494
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,490
"Aha. Right. Over PC.

495
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,740
"Your ego is so big that you overlook your own mistake."

496
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:27,382
That's a quick-witted response.

497
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:33,840
Do you think people who care so much about others

498
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,060
that they accidentally PC everything are happy?

499
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:43,547
I think there's nothing wrong about it.

500
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:48,027
It's similar to when you did that to the school and talked to me.

501
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:53,640
Sometimes, that can lead to a better change. Right?

502
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,650
Well then,

503
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,600
I just want to write about those who care about others all the time

504
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:09,249
and expect others to be what they think they should be.

505
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:13,766
Then, when they can't be like that, those people feel hurt.

506
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:15,419
How do you like it?

507
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:18,090
You're talking about Akk.

508
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,070
That's right.

509
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:25,324
You know Akk feels slighted often.

510
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,963
Are you still going to keep being like this?

511
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,463
Yeah.

512
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:32,889
You're super stubborn.

513
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:04,310
[Have you gone to bed yet? Should we meet?]

514
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:18,561
[Don't you miss me at all?]

515
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:23,170
[Are you too mean?]

516
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:51,660
[Come see me. I want to ask you about composing a song.]

517
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,267
Kan?

518
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:58,112
Why are you here?

519
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,720
I can't sleep.

520
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:05,003
I'm used to having you sleep next to me.

521
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,140
Same here. But I don't want to trouble Aye.

522
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,383
You don't have to feel like that. He's not in the room.

523
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,965
He sneaked out to talk to Akk.

524
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,602
Isn't Akk sulking with Aye?

525
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,781
Can you stop asking already?

526
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,133
Why?

527
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,203
If you don't stop talking,

528
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,417
how can I kiss you?

529
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:53,933
How much have you practiced? Show me.

530
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,770
You must start at C chord.

531
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:49,245
Be honest with me.

532
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:00,986
Are you toying with my feelings?

533
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:10,085
One minute you stir up my anger,

534
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:12,800
and then the other minute you make me feel good.

535
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,856
So, do you want me to love or hate you?

536
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:18,890
I want you to love me, of course. You're my boyfriend.

537
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,161
Why do you like to stir up my anger then?

538
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:25,153
When I texted you, why did you ignore it? Why didn't you reply?

539
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:27,230
When I need your attention,

540
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,150
you prioritize games and show no concern for me.

541
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:32,000
Why are you digging up those old stories?

542
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,447
You've changed. Do you know that?

543
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,811
I'm still the same, Akk.

544
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,852
Do you need me to point out what has changed?

545
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:41,390
Come on. Shh.

546
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,926
You know I can't resist you when you're angry.

547
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,969
I'm telling you in case you don't know.

548
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:07,838
When you sulk and look at me with those sparkling eyes,

549
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:11,514
you're super cute.

550
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:14,300
You're doing this again!

551
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,660
Sometimes you treat me well, and then you stir up my anger.

552
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,354
Come on. Let me kiss you.

553
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,846
Kiss.

554
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,446
Kiss.

555
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,827
One more.

556
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,513
Are you still sulking?

557
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,942
Can I kiss you?

558
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:44,908
Who's stopping you?

559
00:41:54,891 --> 00:42:01,082
And the last award goes to the short film called...

560
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:03,729
How can our birthday message be meaningful to him?

561
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,958
It must be a birthday message from that someone.

562
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,258
Tonight, there will be a party celebrating my...

563
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,670
Shit.

564
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,414
I have an appointment with my mom.

565
00:42:10,414 --> 00:42:11,721
What should I do?

566
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:13,138
You remember it, right?

567
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:15,182
Of course, I do.

568
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:18,446
Do you want to know where my space is?

569
00:42:18,446 --> 00:42:20,326
You've been taking a shower too long.

570
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:22,653
Let me join you.

571
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,400
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

572
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,040
♫ There is no one else, you're number one ♫

573
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,140
♫ My world is you, your world is my world ♫

574
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,710
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

575
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:40,390
♫ It's so good to have you by my side ♫

576
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,860
♫ That's enough. That's all I ask ♫

577
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,770
♫ Just because I have you ♫

578
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:55,730
♫ Just because I have you ♫

579
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,710
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

580
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,290
♫ There is no one else, you're number one ♫

581
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,130
♫ My world is you, your world is my world ♫

582
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,120
♫ Listen carefully, I'll shout it out loud ♫

583
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,690
♫ It's so good to have you by my side ♫

584
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,210
♫ That's enough. That's all I ask ♫

585
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:21,380
♫ Just because I have you ♫

586
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,580
♫ Just because I have you ♫
