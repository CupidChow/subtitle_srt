5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,640
Sean and Maitee didn't agree to the trip.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,149
I think we should do something fun.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,759
Nuea.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,299
It seems you're close to her. Why don't you stay with her?

9
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:31,487
Come!

10
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:33,626
We were just kidding about what we said to you.

11
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:36,253
I'm willing to do anything, but don't fight.

12
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,855
Chiang Mai trip. Tickets are booked. No cancellation.

13
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:40,655
Yes, sir.

14
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,740
Yes! We're finally here!

15
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:51,849
Hey. Will we get a nicer view if we go higher?

16
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,359
I'm begging you not to. I'm dying over here.

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,480
I can't go on. Let's stop here.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,610
Right. I don't want to see a nicer view.

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,680
You don't want to see or don't want to walk?

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,379
Doc!

21
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,957
Yes, we're tired.

22
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:13,235
Mr. Know-it-all.

23
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:17,231
Should we camp out here tonight?

24
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,526
Do you like it here?

25
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:22,482
I do, sir.

26
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:31,329
Kluen, let's check out the view. It's stunning.

27
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,647
Come on. Follow me.

28
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:41,263
Being lovey-dovey right after they got here.

29
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:45,325
Let's go, guys.

30
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,554
We're exhausted.

31
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,035
We can't move.

32
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,321
Come on.

33
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,920
Sean, up.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,713
Let's go. Come on.

35
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:00,752
I can't even feel my legs right now.

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,140
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,540
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,720
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,220
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

40
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,450
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,780
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,340
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

43
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,800
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:50,500
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,380
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,920
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,670
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

48
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,650
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:19,480
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

50
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,981
Are you cold?

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,334
I was at first, but I'm warm now.

52
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:47,082
I told you to wear warm clothes.

53
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:52,142
Well, I want you to hug me more.

54
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,346
You smell nice.

55
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,923
Please.

56
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm all sweaty. How can I smell nice?

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,900
You're too whipped.

58
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
That's true.

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,012
I guess I'm too whipped.

60
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:23,310
I'm not blushing anymore. No more teasing.

61
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,599
I'm not. I'm telling you the truth.

62
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:32,255
Come on. I want to draw. Can I draw you?

63
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,465
Haven't you had enough of drawing me?

64
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:37,925
I haven't. Let me draw more of you.

65
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,947
- Please.
- No.

66
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,152
Ask for it.

67
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:50,989
Khabkluen,

68
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:54,907
please be Dao's drawing model.

69
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:06,424
See? You asked for it and now you're blushing.

70
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:08,989
How weak, Khabkluen.

71
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,421
I'm weak only for you, Daonuea.

72
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:17,330
All right. Stand right here.

73
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,289
Legs crossed.

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,053
- Turn this way.
- Doc. Help me set up a tent...

75
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,101
You still can't move on, huh?

76
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,895
You don't need to know everything.

77
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:44,489
Is that a polite way of saying I'm nosy?

78
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,001
It's been two years.

79
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:53,041
Maybe you're taking too long to get over him.

80
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,498
You can't be heartbroken forever.

81
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,344
I don't have feelings for Daonuea anymore.

82
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,581
Sounds so convincing.

83
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:04,207
I believe you.

84
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,359
I'm telling the truth.

85
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,524
I'm starting over.

86
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,172
With who?

87
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:15,889
Someone who came just at the right time.

88
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,666
I think she's the right one.

89
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,992
Damn.

90
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:22,018
I'm happy for you.

91
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,140
As for Daonuea,

92
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,672
I still want to have him in my life.

93
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,372
Phoon.

94
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,612
We can walk past each other.

95
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,872
It's fine that we don't get to walk side by side.

96
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,839
That's good.

97
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:44,205
If you get an operation, you feel the pain once and for all.

98
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,319
But if you let your wound get infected, the pain will last much longer.

99
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,410
Don't make me teach you, Doc.

100
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,700
My operation is done. I'm in the process of recovery.

101
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:00,128
Great.

102
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,175
They're so sweet.

103
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:26,970
You don't have to sneakily draw him anymore.

104
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,050
Nice, isn't it?

105
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:32,377
Sean, what are you saying?

106
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,697
- Wait.
- What? So you saw...

107
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:40,445
Hey. I didn't mean to take a peek.

108
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:44,611
But you put your sketchbook everywhere in the dorm.

109
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:49,535
Once the wind was blowing, I saw Kluen's picture that you sketched.

110
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,987
Shit. You must zip it.

111
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:57,106
You two are boyfriends now. You don't have to be shy anymore.

112
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,300
What are you two talking about?

113
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,100
You come here.

114
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,980
Don't butt in other people's business.

115
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:18,231
Don't poke your nose in their business. Help me set up the tent.

116
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,325
You two don't just flirt.

117
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,359
Help me with dinner.

118
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,961
Okay.

119
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:36,724
Look my way, Kluen. I'm resuming now.

120
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,024
Right.

121
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,016
Cheers.

122
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:54,178
This trip reminds me of our Chiang Mai trip last year.

123
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,323
True.

124
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:58,317
One year has gone by so quickly.

125
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:00,414
Right.

126
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,356
What game did we play there?

127
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:05,814
Ah, that game... "What's your first impression of this friend?"

128
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,444
How about we change it this time?

129
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:11,800
Let's do...

130
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,769
"How do you feel towards this friend after knowing him for a year?"

131
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,692
Let's do it.

132
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,255
Let's start with the softest answer here.

133
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:22,867
Doc.

134
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,696
Make it soft, okay?

135
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,520
Of course.

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,377
You're so handsome.

137
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,235
That's right. He is.

138
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:35,700
Once I saw him, I knew I was never gonna get the title.

139
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:39,907
The next one, Daonuea.

140
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:43,563
I love him even more.

141
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:45,324
Every day.

142
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,951
I'm done playing.

143
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,961
- Let's just cheers.
- Right.

144
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:13,196
Cheers!

145
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:31,009
Isn't this the right time to sneak out and enjoy your moment?

146
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:47,894
He stole my friend again.

147
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:51,148
Chill, man. They're boyfriends.

148
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:10,420
Why did you say you love me in front of everyone?

149
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:18,676
Why? Because I love you.

150
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,576
That's why I did.

151
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:23,450
I know you love me,

152
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,210
but you don't have to say it all the time.

153
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm compensating.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
I didn't tell you enough back then.

155
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,369
Have you ever thought how we'd have been

156
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:41,150
if I hadn't come back to Thailand

157
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,890
or if we hadn't met again? What would the two of us been like?

158
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,483
I might still be waiting for you.

159
00:11:57,006 --> 00:12:00,700
How long can you possibly wait?

160
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,485
I have no idea. Never thought of it.

161
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,356
Would you wait 10 years?

162
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:15,090
10 years might be too long.

163
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,072
What?

164
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,748
Because I'd go look for you after five years.

165
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,867
As if that's true.

166
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:30,593
I think you'd be with someone else already.

167
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,582
No one else can be as cute as you.

168
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:44,046
Or I might have been with someone new already.

169
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,270
Then I'd be happy for you

170
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:57,260
that my friend found good love.

171
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:03,402
That means you must be happy for me now.

172
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:06,062
Why?

173
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,560
Because I found my very good love already.

174
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:15,964
What?

175
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:25,276
Very good.

176
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,704
You know what?

177
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,659
I can love you even more.

178
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,900
More and more every day.

181
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:54,201
♫ are now filled with love and trust ♫

182
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:58,302
♫ You turn the coldest of nights ♫

183
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:02,958
♫ Into lovingly warm delights ♫

184
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,086
Guys, let's drink.

185
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,569
Come on.

186
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,920
Cheers.

187
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,154
Sean, try the meat I cooked.

188
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,289
- Yeah, the doc here cooks meat so well.
- Yeah?

189
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,640
My mashed potato is good too.

190
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,202
You want a Bologna sausage?

191
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,600
Here.

192
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,364
All right. I'll show you how good it is.

193
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:37,257
Here. Try this.

194
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,783
He made it with his heart.

195
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:41,697
He made the pasta himself.

196
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,775
I don't like spaghetti.

197
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:46,370
It's too cheesy for me.

198
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,775
- Try the ham then.
- Hold on.

199
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:52,005
What I want to know more than the taste of this dish is

200
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,605
when did you guys stop fighting?

201
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,353
There.

202
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:09,220
- Something fishing is going on.
- Fishy!

203
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,786
Kluen.

204
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:44,437
You kiss me too often.

205
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:48,265
So?

206
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:52,184
Your cheek is mine.

207
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,983
This cheek as well.

208
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,116
This forehead as well.

209
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:03,818
These are mine as well.

210
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,049
I'm all yours, Kluen.

211
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,110
You know what, Dao?

212
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,352
No matter how long time has passed,

213
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,989
I still feel as excited...

214
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:30,315
as the first day we met.

215
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,907
Do you think you're the only one with that excitement?

216
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:49,842
If I say I love you many times,

217
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,004
will you get tired of it?

218
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,006
You can say it hundreds of times,

219
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:03,838
thousands of times.

220
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:07,725
You can always do it.

221
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,226
You can say it every day.

222
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,960
Then...

223
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,207
what if I ask for more?

224
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,598
Can I?

225
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,003
I told you.

226
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,254
I'm all yours, Kluen.

227
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:55,189
Yours and yours only, Kluen.

228
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,825
And I'll do my best to keep you.

229
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,366
I promise.

230
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,649
Hey! What are you doing?

231
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:06,010
Help me store the tent.

232
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,804
Where are Kluen and Nuea?

233
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:11,054
No idea. I haven't seen them yet this morning.

234
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,681
Sean, go wake them up.

235
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,576
Why me?

236
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:18,047
Nay, they're your friends. Go get them.

237
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,300
We're all friends.

238
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,830
You should go. You fit the job.

239
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,463
What?

240
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:28,157
Because you're used to seeing them being lovey-dovey.

241
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:32,312
We don't want to see something explicit.

242
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:34,743
I don't want to see that either.

243
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,114
We can just all go.

244
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:40,277
I don't want to go.

245
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:45,889
Kluen. Nuea.

246
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,297
Daonuea. Nuea.

247
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,510
Kluen and Nuea, wake up.

248
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,635
Daonuea. Khabkluen.

249
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,508
Maybe we can just unzip their tent.

250
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,806
What if we see something we think we might see?

251
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,098
Will that be awkward?

252
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:09,974
Come on. I've seen them being sweet many times.

253
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,944
No awkwardness.

254
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,187
It's fine.

255
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:17,794
Okay then. If you say it's fine, you unzip it.

256
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:19,294
Of course.

257
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,920
- Ouch!
- Not this zipper. I meant the tent.
- You do it.

258
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,454
You hit me. It hurts. I can't do it anymore.

259
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:31,367
I'm not doing this.

260
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,310
Maitee, you do it.

261
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,527
Me? No way.

262
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,527
Phoon, do it. You're standing nearest.

263
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,827
What?

264
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,664
We're just supposed to wake them up.

265
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,567
You said you'd do it.

266
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,794
You open the tent.

267
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:48,306
I thought we would just call them out.

268
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,775
What's going on?

269
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,246
I thought you were cuddling.

270
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:14,046
Cuddling?

271
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:18,156
Why didn't you guys respond to us then?

272
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:21,390
We were listening to your conversation.

273
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,050
It was fun.

274
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:25,322
All right then.

275
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:28,486
I thought we'd see something explicit.

276
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:30,644
Something explicit?

277
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:33,159
Maitee said you guys—

278
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,447
Since you're awake, gather your stuff.

279
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,927
We'll be waiting over there.

280
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:39,938
Why did you cover my mouth?

281
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:42,214
- Maitee...
-What?

282
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:44,240
- You said it yourself.
- Stop talking.

283
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,141
Get your things, guys, before it gets too hot.

284
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,841
We'll be right there.

285
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:06,652
Wow. Prince's hotel is nice as always.

286
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:11,340
It's a shame he's not here with us.

287
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,111
Typical Prince. He's either abroad or up on the mountain.

288
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:21,806
Let's go then. Let's find an activity to do.

289
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,358
Let's just split.

290
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:34,519
If you want alone time, don't invite us along next time.

291
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,119
Right.

292
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,287
Phoon.

293
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,375
Come here.

294
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:52,352
Let's go, Nay.

295
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,130
Only me left?

296
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:08,897
Okay. I will just chill out, too.

297
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,561
I like the weather here.

298
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:28,942
I want a house in a cold climate.

299
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,138
You like that?

300
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:34,207
Should we get one?

301
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:36,819
Up on the mountain or in the city?

302
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:43,377
Kluen, I was just kidding.

303
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,698
Whenever you want to come, let me know.

304
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:50,496
Prince's hotel always welcomes you.

305
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,742
You're saying like this hotel is yours.

306
00:23:55,317 --> 00:24:00,232
Kluen, Prince, and Noel are so close that we can just do anything.

307
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:03,770
So close that you scare people. Right?

308
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,170
Scare people?

309
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:12,739
Don't you know what other people think of you guys?

310
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:15,938
What?

311
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:24,043
They say you guys act like you're so cool.

312
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,940
You're spoiled...

313
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,170
and unapproachable.

314
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:36,165
It might be true at the unapproachable part.

315
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:40,989
But once you've approached me, it's so hard to stay away.

316
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,403
Kluen.

317
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,840
Why are you guys here?

318
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,871
To watch a movie.

319
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:35,923
Isn't there a TV in your room?

320
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,031
There is, but we want to be with our friends. Why?

321
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:42,756
Yeah. What's the problem?

322
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:44,349
Yeah. What's the problem?

323
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:48,089
Just enjoy it. You're acting like we're interrupting something.

324
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:53,213
No, you're not.

325
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,719
You're not interrupting anything.

326
00:25:56,969 --> 00:26:00,989
- There, there.
- Seriously.

327
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:04,395
Sure!

328
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:08,648
Dao,

329
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:12,988
let's just come by ourselves next time.

330
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,669
So we will not interrupt their time.

331
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:22,289
We're coming too.

332
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,101
We're having fun.

333
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,715
We're loving it.

334
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:33,334
All right then. Give me one.

335
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,134
Here, Kluen.

336
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,245
Eat something tasty.

337
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:47,107
Good?

338
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,021
Slow down.

339
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,172
Kluen, you go ahead.

340
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:19,350
I'll talk to Typhoon for a bit.

341
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,272
Please be quick.

342
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:41,795
I thought you'd rent a car and travel alone like that time.

343
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,543
Only someone weak would do that.

344
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:53,539
Is there someone as weak as Typhoon from last year?

345
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,526
So how's it going with Min?

346
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,296
Gotcha.

347
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,326
What?

348
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:09,319
You're the one who gave Min my number.

349
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,355
She was begging me and I didn't know what else to do.

351
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:21,055
Thank you.

352
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,151
What?

353
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:26,662
Thank you.

354
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:28,855
We just started talking.

355
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,093
Really?

356
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:33,746
Yeah.

357
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:37,277
I thought I wasn't ready to date anyone yet.

358
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:39,594
I wanted to focus on studying first.

359
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:43,790
I was afraid I wouldn't have time for her and we'd not make it.

360
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:50,364
What changed your mind?

361
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,880
Min is a medical student too.

362
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,118
We should get each other easily.

363
00:28:57,118 --> 00:29:01,939
And after we've talked for a while, I see we have things in common.

364
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:07,127
We should be able to get along without having to try so hard.

365
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,808
That's good.

366
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,025
I'm happy for you.

367
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,961
Thank you, Daonuea.

368
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,686
For everything.

369
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:22,775
What? I didn't do anything but gave her your number.

370
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:25,429
I mean for everything.

371
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:28,542
Everything from the start up until now.

372
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,429
It's so great we can still be friends.

373
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,245
I'm glad to have you as a friend too.

374
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,801
Give me a hug.

375
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,739
- Should we go eat?
- Sure.

376
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:51,639
Let's go.

377
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:59,106
I'm starving.

378
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:07,675
Wow. This is so good.

379
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,247
Eat more then.

380
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,750
Aw, you care about me?

381
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,627
No. Eat, so you can shut up.

382
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:23,866
Eat more.

383
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,864
You can have this piece.

384
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:29,748
How can I finish this?

385
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:31,612
Get that for me.

386
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,446
You're up.

387
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:57,522
Been up for a while.

388
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:02,894
You've been up for a while, but you haven't showered yet.

389
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:12,267
I want to look at someone so cute in the morning.

390
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:16,414
Do you realize how cute you are?

391
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:19,048
Even when I sleep,

392
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:22,176
I'm still cute?

393
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,463
Very much so.

394
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:33,412
And is this cutie getting up yet?

395
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,355
10 more minutes, please.

396
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:45,000
10 minutes...

397
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,602
for two kisses.

398
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:57,341
Well...

399
00:31:58,112 --> 00:32:00,196
20 minutes then.

400
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:03,590
You're cunning.

401
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:10,361
I'll go take a shower.

402
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:00,101
I'm up.

403
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,446
Do you want to go anywhere today?

404
00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:06,686
Anywhere.

405
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,881
With you.

406
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:16,862
Don't show this kitty face to anyone.

407
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,388
It's cute.

408
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:19,929
I'm jealous.

409
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,670
This face is for Khabkluen only.

410
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:36,920
I'll go take a shower then.

411
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:38,998
Sure.

412
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,120
Kluen.

413
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:47,321
What are these, Kluen?

414
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:55,851
Come here.

415
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,598
What's the occasion?

416
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,020
I just want to say I love you.

417
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,744

No, Kluen.

435
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:33,341
I love you, Daonuea.

436
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,830
Thank you.

437
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:46,108

I love you, Khabkluen.

442
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,650
I love you too, Daonuea.

443
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:21,407
Hey, Kluen. No!

444
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:24,018
Hey! What?

445
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:26,804
We missed the official explicit shot.

446
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:28,101
Kluen, come back out.

447
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:31,143
Nuea, I've been rooting for you since high school.

448
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:33,043
Come on.

449
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:36,559
Should we just go to their room?

450
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,363
Let's go.

451
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:48,415
I love you more than anything.

452
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,624
I love you more than anything too.

453
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:57,487
You know?

454
00:37:57,487 --> 00:38:01,983
Nothing is better than having you by my side.

455
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:51,033
They said there'd be a shooting star tonight.

456
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:54,931
Do you think we'll be lucky enough to see it?

457
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:02,680
Based on your luck, we might.

458
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:08,071
My luck, I don't think so.

459
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,261
Why not?

460
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:17,657
Because I've traded all my luck...

461
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:22,103

462
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:27,724

All of it.

00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,255
