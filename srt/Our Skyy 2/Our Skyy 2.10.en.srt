Time and reality are more than just straight lines,

6
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:29,006
but a multiverse of endless possibilities.

7
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:34,155
Everything we choose may branch out into unrestricted truths

8
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:38,957
and turn into a parallel universe, different from the one we know.

9
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:47,001
Welcome to My School President in the Multiverse of Cuteness.

10
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:54,548
♫ I saw someone say that love makes the heart flutter ♫

11
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:58,383
♫ The more I hear it every day, seeing people love each other ♫

12
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,646
♫ It makes me even more suspicious ♫

13
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:03,400
Hey. Hey!

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,314
Mr. School President,

15
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,000
you've been listening to that Lion song hundreds of times already.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,513
Have you found any weaknesses?

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,368
No weakness.

18
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:14,144
I could only find cuteness.

19
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:17,752
He's so damn cute.

20
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:19,630
When I listen to his music,

21
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,620
I see his face popping into my mind.

22
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,901
Even now,

23
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:31,703
I'm seeing him standing there looking so cute in front of the room.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,257
I want to pinch his cheeks.

25
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:37,220
So cute.

26
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:40,013
Who are you talking about?

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,940
How long has he been here?

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,510
A while ago.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,814
What's up?

30
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:55,241
You said you'd help my club.

31
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,026
Yes.

32
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,860
We want to stay overnight at school.

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,185
Because we want to practice for the Hot Wave contest.

34
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:03,920
- Can you approve it?
- Sure.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,723
Not so fast.

36
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,713
All right.

37
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:15,244
We and the council will approve your request to stay overnight...

38
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:19,485
on one condition.

39
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,357
What condition?

40
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:24,339
One condition.

41
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,160
Yes.

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,880
"Regret" - 5 U

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,370
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,440
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,140
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,460
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,490
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

48
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,870
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,480
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,930
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

51
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:20,630
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,420
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,060
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,850
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

55
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,810
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

56
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,430
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

57
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,658
Hey, thank you so much.

58
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:53,661
Thanks to your plan, I get to stay overnight with Tinn.

59
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:57,330
I paved the way very nicely. The rest is up to you.

60
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,357
Ask him to join you for a late night walk

61
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:06,114
or if he gets hotheaded, invite him to go swimming.

62
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:09,980
Just don't let him run into your mom.

63
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,497
Come on, who would catch me?

64
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:16,966
Gun, I'm ready.

65
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,852
Ready for what?

66
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:23,537
For catching the music club red-handed.

67
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:26,182
I told them we'd have a meeting until 10:00.

68
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,664
It's now 9:00 p.m. I bet they're partying.

69
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,409
Well...

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Well done. I would expect nothing less from my secretary.

71
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:41,020
Let me give you a hug. Come on, little brother.

72
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,965
You can hug me all you want.

73
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:48,187
Don't worry. If you leave the school...

74
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,667
The council is coming at you.

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,681
They're here. Calm down, Kajorn.

76
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,600
Kajorn.

77
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:07,205
Don't touch me, Win. I'm not drunk!

78
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,860
I'm not Win. I'm Sound!

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,307
I'm here.

80
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:17,149
Hello, Mr. Handsome President.

81
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,299
Put your hand down.

82
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,740
Hey.

83
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,437
This is liquor.

84
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,770
How could you drink at school?

85
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,424
Liquor, my ass. That's sake!

86
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,319
I'll punch you.

87
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,259
Don't!

88
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,261
Calm down, Tinn.

89
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:44,140
This is sake we add to the soup.

90
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,680
Tinn was worried you guys wouldn't believe it, so he took a little sip.

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,221
Just a tiny sip.

92
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,606
Come on. Who would be stupid enough to believe that?

93
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:53,060
He could've just emptied the bottle.

94
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,870
There's no need to drink it.

95
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,409
Shut up or I'll hit you!

96
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,156
Don't.

97
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:06,331
Piss off!

98
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,473
What the hell has gotten into you?

99
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:14,650
Damn it. Everything is out of control.

100
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,039
Let's just disband.

101
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,414
Kajorn, let's talk.

102
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,198
Kajorn.

103
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,334
Kajorn, drinking at school is a serious violation,

104
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:33,951
- but...
- Gun and Por, please don't punish Music Club.

105
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,792
I beg you.

106
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,600
Why not?

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,402
Well...

108
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,753
I'm going to admit it.

109
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,350
- I like Pat.
- What?

110
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,420
You like Pat?

111
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,177
I like when he speaks in an Isaan accent.

112
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:02,324
Like when he says, "Oh."

113
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:05,936
It's pretty cute.

114
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:09,352
But why have you been finding fault with Music Club?

115
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,657
I want them to take their practice seriously.

116
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:17,220
I play the bad guy and pressure them

117
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,360
so they can win that Hot Wave thing

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,340
and be allowed to date.

119
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,747
All right.

120
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:36,121
For your love's sake, I won't punish the Music Club.

121
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,428
Does that sound good?

122
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:39,428
Yes.

123
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,730
From now on,

124
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,070
we'll help Music Club win Hot Wave,

125
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,120
so I...

126
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,087
I mean, so you, Kajorn,

127
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,899
so you can have a chance at love.

128
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,504
Come on.

129
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:10,100
Wait, Por. Why are you holding my hand?

130
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,800
As your vice president, I agree with you.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,279
Come on. Don't overthink it.

132
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,858
One, two, three.

133
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,905
To the Music Club!

134
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,655
Hey. Run faster.

135
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,636
How are you going to beat anyone with that energy?

136
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,710
Are you making us practice for a music contest or a city attack?

137
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,879
Come on. He didn't punish us yesterday.

138
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,884
Wanna race, Win?

139
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,754
Who finishes ten rounds first wins.

140
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,697
No way. I won't exhaust myself for nothing.

141
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,686
Whatever. The loser has to do push-ups.

142
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,881
Hey! Ouch! You said you would be my leg.

143
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,857
Are you okay?

144
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,948
Did you just trick me?

145
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,700
Nice T-shirt.

146
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,835
I know, right?

147
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:00,704
My boyfriend bought it for me.

148
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:03,899
You should ask your boyfriend to buy one for you.

149
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,799
I'm wearing what my boyfriend bought for me.

150
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,643
No wonder it looks just as nice.

151
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:14,797
Where are you going?

152
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,641
Pat, are you okay?

153
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,120
Pat,

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,700
are you tired?

155
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,478
- I brought you a towel.
- Thanks.

156
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:26,527
Allow me.

157
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,615
I'm so jealous.

158
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,913
I want to disband.

159
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,845
Gun.

160
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:50,006
I'm exhausted. Can I get a drink?

161
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,280
Here.

162
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,329
If you want it, come and get it yourself.

163
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,996
Shit! I have cramps.

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,337
It serves you right for bullying me.

165
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,730
I deserve a good thing.

166
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:34,816
Are you going to leave me like this?

167
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,765
I'll carry you.

168
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,003
Come on. Let me help you with the drink.

169
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:37,296
Isn't it refreshing?

170
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,365
Yes, it's refreshing.

171
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,342
But it will be more refreshing if I don't have to carry you.

172
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,362
You're so damn heavy.

173
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:50,956
By the way, have you decided which song to use in the contest?

174
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,949
I've thought about it,

175
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,083
but Win proposed that

176
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,661
since we're joining the contest, we should make our own MV.

177
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:03,030
Oh? Do you guys know how to do that?

178
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:07,606
Por said the council would help.

179
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:11,145
Oh, that's good.

180
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,437
The council is my team.

181
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,266
Exactly.

182
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,842
I'm counting on you, Mr. School President.

183
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:32,000
We're going to cover a love song

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,040
by the legendary duo, Nop-Bob.

185
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,861
I think that's a good idea. I like that duo.

186
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,336
Good voice. Good song. Good-looking. They're the whole package.

187
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:46,146
Exactly.

188
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,847
I already studied the original song.

189
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:52,396
It talks about the relationships of three couples.

190
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:57,197
The first one is a relationship between a human and a ghost

191
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,001
who meets on Tomb Sweeping Day.

192
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,968
Tinn and Gun will play that couple.

193
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:06,194
Why? We have many members in the club. Why me and Gun?

194
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,241
Because you look like the guy in the original MV.

195
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:11,175
Just do it. Don't be fussy.

196
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:16,142
The second couple is in a love-hate relationship.

197
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:19,305
They have been competing since they were kids because they live next to each other.

198
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,817
Sound and Win. That's you two.

199
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,895
Good.

200
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:28,400
Do I get to punch him?

201
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,771
I want to get back at him for locking my arms in the restroom.

202
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:32,868
You wanna fight now? Come at me.

203
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,336
- Hey.
- Stop.

204
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,389
Sit down.

205
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:41,439
Let's talk about the last couple, the idealistic couple.

206
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,750
A volunteer teacher in the mountain and a forest ranger.

207
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,820
They'll be portrayed by me and Tiwson.

208
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,260
Wait. Why did you get to choose?

209
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,149
Why did we not?

210
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,889
You're cheating, aren't you? You're cheating.

211
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,290
Leave it alone.

212
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,680
It's none of your business. Okay?

213
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,580
Hey. Can we get another couple?

214
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,180
How about someone in the council

215
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,670
who falls for someone in the Music Club?

216
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:14,266
Nonsense. Who would want to watch that?

217
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,231
Right?

218
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,590
All right.

219
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,320
Try to get to know the person you're paired with

220
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,940
so you won't feel uncomfortable when we shoot.

221
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,580
Okay? Okay. Are we all clear?

222
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,040
That'll be all. You can leave.

223
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,721
Bye-bye. Get out.

224
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,221
Okay. Bye.

225
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,961
"36 Questions That Will Get People Closer."

226
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,087
What's this?

227
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:08,527
Por suggested we answer them.

228
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,408
They're just questions. Can they really make us become closer?

229
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,228
I don't see how they can be reliable.

230
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:18,291
If we never try, we'll never know.

231
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,399
First question.

232
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,076
If you could invite anyone to dinner, who would that be?

233
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,416
You.

234
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,000
You can answer first.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,260
I can't decide yet.

236
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,470
Okay.

237
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,347
I've been getting closer to the Music Club.

238
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,360
If I could choose,

239
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,356
I would go with someone from the Music Club.

240
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:07,402
Someone from the Music Club?

241
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,921
Who would that be?

242
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:11,212
Make a guess.

243
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,120
Who from the Music Club?

244
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,361
It must be Win.

245
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,143
It's Win, right?

246
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:23,700
No. Try again.

247
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,337
Tiw, for sure.

248
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:27,720
No.

249
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,020
It must be Yo.

250
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,201
Sound.

251
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,146
He's so handsome and cool.

252
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:35,070
I'll give you one last guess.

253
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:38,388
Oh, how could I forget this guy?

254
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:43,020
It's Pat, isn't it?

255
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
How could I forget him?

256
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,886
You're charmed by his Isaan accent. Right?

257
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,853
I knew it.

258
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:53,302
Okay. I think you should answer.

259
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,621
Who would you want to go with?

260
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:59,154
Me?

261
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:02,593
I think there's one person.

262
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,880
Despite being hard on me,

263
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:13,508
this one has always been there for me when I feel discouraged.

264
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,962
That person is...

265
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:26,186
my mom.

266
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,988
- Excuse me?
- My mom.

267
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,890
- My mom.
- Your mom?

268
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,672
- Yes.
- Okay.

269
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,980
Got it. Let's move on to the next question

270
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,588
before you mention your dad, too.

271
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:43,913
Do we need to be this serious about shooting the MV?

272
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,540
It's Por's order.

273
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,699
Why? You don't know how to play?

274
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,369
If you don't, you can beg me to teach you.

275
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,395
Oh, please, I know how to play.

276
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,824
- Just wait and see.
- Game on.

277
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,267
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

278
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,867
Come on.

279
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,703
Hey! That's a foul.

280
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,933
After you tackle, you must wrap your hands around me too.

281
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,533
Try again.

282
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,834
That's just a warm-up.

283
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:16,676
Come on.

284
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,520
You almost hit my face.

285
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,761
You broke the rules.

286
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:25,096
Don't tell me you don't know how to tackle.

287
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:29,357
Let me teach you.

288
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,519
Come here.

289
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,981
You use the area between your chest up until your shoulders to tackle.

290
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:42,563
You hold your opponent with both of your hands like this.

291
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,909
The areas you can tackle are from the chest down to the feet.

292
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,625
Is that clear?

293
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,190
It's easy. Try it.

294
00:18:58,267 --> 00:18:59,395
Come on.

295
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,643
Hey!

296
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,337
You forgot to wrap your hands around me.

297
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,198
Hey! I told you to wrap your hands, too.

298
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:13,888
Try again.

299
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:17,514
It's still too high.

300
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:19,600
Do you even get what I said?

301
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,044
Try again.

302
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:23,181
Do it right this time.

303
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,133
How many times have I told you already? You haven't learned anything.

304
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,180
You're supposed to teach, not yell at me!

305
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,708
Learn to play sports sometimes. Don't just spend your days hitting on girls.

306
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,852
That's you.

307
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,919
- You don't get a damn thing I said.
- This is a waste of time.

308
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,840
What's wrong with you?

309
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,023
I made an effort to teach you, but you wouldn't learn anything.

310
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,617
You dumbass!

311
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:00,596
Next question.

312
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:04,236
What's your best memory?

313
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,773
What a difficult question.

314
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:11,821
My best memory?

315
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:20,506
Probably when my dad bought me my first guitar.

316
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:24,051
It was my birthday.

317
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,429
What about yours?

318
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,360
Mine?

319
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,055
What a coincidence.

320
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,810
It was my birthday, too.

321
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,040
But my parents were busy,

322
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,890
so I went to this shop by myself,

323
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,170
sitting all alone.

324
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,737
Then a singer sang me a song.

325
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:09,558
It's the best gift I've ever received.

326
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,791
Really?

327
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,642
Which shop?

328
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,815
I want to go there.

329
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,634
Can you tell me?

330
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,726
Please tell me.

331
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,082
Come on, tell me.

332
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,929
Why are you smiling? Tell me.

333
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,766
Please. I want to know.

334
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,600
You don't need to know.

335
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,732
I want to go there.

336
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,880
Can you go talk somewhere else?

337
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,548
Yeah, we want to sleep. You're annoying.

338
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:45,665
Just get out.

339
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,044
Go!

340
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,483
I want to sleep.

341
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,609
I'm so pissed.

342
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,883
The school is pretty nice at night.

343
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,220
I have an idea.

344
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,500
Welcome to PaGun Talk on Tour.

345
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,570
I'm with the leader of the band

346
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,010
who just won Hot Wave 2023.

347
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:22,660
Tinn from Lion.

348
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,700
Tada!

349
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,798
What are you doing?

350
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,783
Practicing.

351
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,062
Because you're going to win Hot Wave.

352
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,800
Now I'm here with the leader of Lion.

353
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,580
This is the leader of the Lion band, Tinn.

354
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,170
This is the school where the Lion band originated.

355
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,318
Can you show us around?

356
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,683
Where are we right now?

357
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:57,681
Give me a second.

358
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,882
He's running up there.

359
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,570
This is where I stand at the morning assembly every day.

360
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,822
To listen to the school president ramble.

361
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,258
It's quite boring.

362
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,162
That's my classroom.

363
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:24,094
I sit at the back of the class.

364
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,850
But I don't know why one student in front of the class

365
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,480
always looks back my way.

366
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,740
I wonder...

367
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,190
if he has feelings for me.

368
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:52,875
If you don't look at me,

369
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:58,498
how do you know I look at you?

370
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,696
There's another highlight at our school.

371
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:24,622
The swimming pool.

372
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,622
I'll take you there.

373
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:28,973
- Let's go.
- Wait.

374
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,575
Let's take a selfie.

375
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,255
Come on.

376
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,111
Come closer to me.

377
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:48,320
♫ There you are ♫

378
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,006
♫ Standing next to me ♫

379
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:55,780
♫ Standing next to me ♫

380
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,908
♫ in a city of millions of people ♫

381
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:04,280
♫ Without having to search for anyone ♫

382
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,160
♫ When you get hold of me ♫

383
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,415
Smile, Mr. School President.

384
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:01,752
There it is.

385
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:04,560
Why the hell are you here?

386
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,100
Did you come to bully me again?

387
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,011
No.

388
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:12,230
I came to look for my wallet.

389
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,205
And I saw a loony person practicing tackling by himself.

390
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,326
Practicing rugby requires two players.

391
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:26,536
Show me.

392
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:32,153
Come on.

393
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,015
Yes. You're doing better.

394
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,030
One more time.

395
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,877
That's it.

396
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:50,906
Do it again.

397
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,119
Come on.

398
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,055
Keep practicing.

399
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:48,752
Come on.

400
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,524
Coming.

401
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:53,933
Yes.

402
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:03,844
It's pouring.

403
00:28:03,844 --> 00:28:06,155
Should we run through it?

404
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,073
Be my guest.

405
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,458
I brought my umbrella.

406
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,942
Hey, can I go with you?

407
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:32,078
Please let me go with you. Please.

408
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:35,981
In your dreams. This is for me.

409
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,409
Wait, Win.

410
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:43,100
What if I get sick from being in the rain? Don't you feel sorry for me?

411
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,981
I won't be able to shoot the MV if that happens.

412
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:46,402
No, the umbrella is small.

413
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:49,735
Please let me go with you.

414
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:52,261
- Hey, I'm soaked.
- Please.

415
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:55,736
I'm soaked.

416
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,606
Please.

417
00:28:57,606 --> 00:28:59,778
The umbrella is small.

418
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:01,833
Is it?

419
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:20,996
Look, I'm all soaked.

420
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:23,210
Can we go now?

421
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,806
How can we go? I'm soaked.

422
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,098
Are you feeling shy now?

423
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,591
What? No.

424
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:32,551
Then why are you blushing?

425
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,818
Let's go.

426
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,123
It's raining.

427
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:46,482
Let's go back to the club.

428
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:56,450
We got two questions left.

429
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,800
If we become closer one day,

430
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:06,796
what would you like me to know in advance?

431
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:09,470
I snore.

432
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:13,201
You don't need to tell me that.

433
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:16,080
I've been spending many nights with you.

434
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,440
I already know that you snore.

435
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,577
My turn to answer.

436
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,825
To be honest, I get scared so easily.

437
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,844
Easily scared?

438
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:35,557
What could someone like you probably be scared of?

439
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:41,460
I'm actually scared that my hope...

440
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,280
will not come true.

441
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:50,220
What do you hope for?

442
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:57,107
I hope...

443
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,930
I...

444
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,730
hope...

445
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:11,341
Let's move on to the next question.

446
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:18,284
Look into the other person's eyes for one minute and ask any question.

447
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:21,750
That person must answer truthfully.

448
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,334
Sure.

449
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
You...

450
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,800
- You...
- You like me, don't you?

451
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,879
I like...

452
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:03,185
I like...

453
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:08,604
I like being alone.

454
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:12,140
I like having my freedom.

455
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,721
Yo!

456
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:17,766
Yo! I'm going to sleep. Yo!

457
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,548
Yo!

458
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,973
I don't want to be his friend. I want to be his boyfriend.

459
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:36,417
Do you understand me?

460
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:39,884
Hey. Slow down.

461
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,000
- Tell me.
- I like being alone, my ass!

462
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,459
I want to be with him. I want to be his boyfriend.

463
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:52,282
I want him to tell people that his boyfriend is the school president.

464
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:54,838
Why are you telling me this? Why don't you tell him?

465
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:57,364
I'm a coward. I'm a loser.

466
00:32:57,364 --> 00:33:00,519
What if he rejects me?

467
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,110
How will I live?

468
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:16,050
At least try to be his friend until

469
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:20,880
we're done with the MV shooting. Okay?

470
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,140
Okay.

471
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,200
I'll try.

472
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:30,653
Damn it!

473
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:33,106
I don't want to be his friend.

474
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:34,620
I won't shoot the MV.

475
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,490
I quit!

476
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,994
You can't do that, Gun.

477
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:39,794
No!

478
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,921
Gun has an emergency and can't shoot the MV anymore.

479
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm sorry.

480
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:51,720
Screw it.

481
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,920
Pat, can you take his place?

482
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,110
You know I'm camera-shy. I'll faint if I do that.

483
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,030
I'll faint if I do that.

484
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,648
Pat!

485
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:01,348
Pat!

486
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:07,580
What do we do?

487
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,154
Yo, then.

488
00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:11,858
It's time for me to shine.

489
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:14,486
Thank God I didn't terminate the club.

490
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:32,242
Gun is devastated.

491
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:39,389
I guess the plan to matchmake him and Tinn is doomed.

492
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,366
I'm sorry.

493
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,280
Why are you apologizing? It's not your fault.

494
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,410
Why are you apologizing? It's not your fault.

495
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,621
Well...

496
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:07,000
If you were not with me,

497
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,480
but someone else,

498
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:12,714
you would've been able to tell people about him a long time ago...

499
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,983
and wouldn't have to hide the relationship like this.

500
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,899
I've had eyes on you for so long.

501
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:27,030
Just being with you right now

502
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,130
is more than enough.

503
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,416
Don't you agree?

504
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,031
It doesn't hurt to wait a little longer.

505
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:36,531
Come now.

506
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:43,625
I can wait.

507
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:56,180
That's non-official.

508
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,098
Once you win Hot Wave,

509
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:02,528
I'll give you the official one.

510
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,378
You promise?

511
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,840
That's non-official from me.

512
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:26,447
Or I can give you the official one right now.

513
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,344
You want to skip a step?

514
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:33,018
I think...

515
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:37,898
we should stick to cleaning the classroom today.

516
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:39,852
Let's clean the classroom.

517
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,850
[THYME]

518
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,169
Hey!

519
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,377
Ma'am!

520
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:55,712
Ma'am!

521
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:58,063
Are you all right?

522
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,219
Ma'am!

523
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,646
Ma'am!

524
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,671
Ma'am, are you all right?

525
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,000
Are you all right?

526
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,156
When did I fall asleep?

527
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,902
Sorry.

528
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,990
I fall asleep wherever I feel sleepy.

529
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,919
I stayed up late watching a series last night.

530
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,100
- You were sleeping?
- Yeah.

531
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:31,971
You scared me. I thought something happened to you.

532
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:34,035
What brings you here? To see Tinn?

533
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,470
Oh, no.

534
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,553
I came for Jumba.

535
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:43,161
Oh? Let me quickly prepare it for you. Wait here a minute.

536
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:47,602
Oh, dear. When did I fall asleep?

537
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:15,325
Here you are.

538
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:19,796
Jumba is served.

539
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:24,693
Enjoy.

540
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:34,488
Are you all right?

541
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:38,778
Why do you look like you just got your heart broken?

542
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:42,764
Are you a fortune teller?

543
00:38:42,764 --> 00:38:46,696
No. I just like to put my nose in other people's business.

544
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:50,120
Hey. You can tell me anything.

545
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,772
I promise I won't tell anyone.

546
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:57,561
I'm serious.

547
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:07,055
Do you think we can be friends?

548
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,740
Why?

549
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,870
Do you want us to be friends?

550
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:13,728
No.

551
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,200
Cut! Sound, once you finish talking, walk up and kiss him.

552
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,852
- Don't wait. Okay?
- All right.

553
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:29,955
- Sorry.
- Let's try again.

554
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:33,060
And action!

555
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,877
Why? Do you want us to be friends?

556
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:37,477
No.

557
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,311
Shit. I can't do it.

558
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:46,811
What?

559
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,499
Come on. Let's try again.

560
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:51,443
You can do it. Okay?

561
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:55,878
And action!

562
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,467
Why? Do you want us to be friends?

563
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,308
No.

564
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:15,567
I can't.

565
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,542
This is a waste of time.

566
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,175
What the hell was that?

567
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:31,357
Sound.

568
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:33,399
Sound.

569
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,259
Cut.

570
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:40,021
Okay. Pack up. Let's call it a day.

571
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,421
Sound.

572
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,709
Sound.

573
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:53,057
I'm sorry for making you feel bad,

574
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:55,254
humiliating you,

575
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:59,351
and kissing you without your consent.

576
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:02,870
I...

577
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,460
don't feel bad that you kissed me,

578
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:11,450
but I feel bad...

579
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,690
that our first kiss was an act.

580
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:19,383
If you don't have feelings for me,

581
00:41:21,386 --> 00:41:23,598
don't do this.

582
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,535
It hurts.

583
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,400
What if I tell you I have feelings for you?

584
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:38,818
Do you know how hard it is to keep my feelings inside?

585
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:43,694
Do you still want us to be friends now?

586
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:50,917
No.

587
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,186
If this was a moment in a series, the characters would have kissed already.

588
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,439
But I will save the kiss for later.

589
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:21,052
Let's leave it for now.

590
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:26,100
♫ You don't have to ask to know what I think ♫

591
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,210
♫ But please let me ask, who will you love ♫

592
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,420
♫ if it's not me? ♫

593
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,840
I'm off, Ma'am.

594
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,320
Bye.

595
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,366
Hey, Buttface.

596
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:56,991
I thought you'd be shooting an MV until late tonight.

597
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:02,129
Yo jammed his hand, so we had to reschedule for another day.

598
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:03,719
What? Really?

599
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,018
Oh my god.

600
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,230
I need to tell the parents' group chat about this ASAP.

601
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,199
Oh, dear.

602
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,751
Oh my god.

603
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:25,904
Is that your friend, Tinn?

604
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,020
Yeah.

605
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,812
It's his birthday.

606
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:37,390
He's probably sitting here alone because his mother is still in a meeting.

607
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,971
How did you know it was his birthday?

608
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:47,066
I heard him talk with his friends.

609
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,590
Do you know how to make a birthday cake?

610
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:55,570
How would I?

611
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,613
But I can make him Jumba.

612
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:02,510
I'll make it myself.

613
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,750
Whoa. The sky must be falling today.

614
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,392
Never in a million years would you do anything I ask.

615
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:11,494
What happened? You're acting strange.

616
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:12,874
Just wait and see, Mom.

617
00:44:12,874 --> 00:44:14,992
Move, please.

618
00:44:51,828 --> 00:44:54,109
Are you still not feeling better?

619
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:56,444
I'm okay.

620
00:44:57,718 --> 00:45:01,164
It's for the best.

621
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:06,369
He and I are too different.

622
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:12,298
Do you think there's another universe where I'm braver than this?

623
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:16,548
The universe where I'm brave enough to say how I feel.

624
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:23,005
How will he and I be in that universe?

625
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,948
I'm secretly seeing Tiwson.

626
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:43,720
Since when?

627
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:46,400
It doesn't matter.

628
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,760
My point is my couple is not so different from yours.

629
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,629
Tiwson and I are so different as well.

630
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:59,133
Tiwson loves hotpot while I live for BBQ pork.

631
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:02,980
The only thing we have in common

632
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,428
is we choose to say how we feel,

633
00:46:07,428 --> 00:46:11,205
even though we might get rejected.

634
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:22,485
Stop imagining another universe.

635
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:29,599
The Tinn you love is in this one.

636
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:32,692
Thanks a lot.

637
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,252
I've decided.

638
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:43,106
In this universe, I'm going to tell him I like him.

639
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,450
Thanks a lot.

640
00:46:47,664 --> 00:46:48,872
I have to go.

641
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,584
Good luck.

642
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:01,012
You...

643
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:05,729
Am I dreaming? You just told him about me.

644
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:14,084
Do you still think you're dreaming now?

645
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,558
Can you pinch the other side, too?

646
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:21,933
I will pinch both sides.

647
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,015
Thank you.

648
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,568
No, I should thank you.

649
00:47:32,493 --> 00:47:34,274
You're cute.

650
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:49,873
Why is everyone heartbroken today?

651
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:54,469
This is a coffee shop, not a sad people club.

652
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:58,063
What are you talking about, Mom?

653
00:47:58,063 --> 00:48:01,335
Keep this a secret.

654
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,092
Today, I saw Gun looking sad as well.

655
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,479
So I asked him what was wrong

656
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:12,727
and found out that he just had his heart broken by his classmate.

657
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:18,620
And he confessed to me

658
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:23,270
that he has liked that friend since grade 10.

659
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,026
Gun asked his mom to make him the school president,

660
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:42,028
so he could save the guy's club from getting terminated.

661
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,820
He even created an anonymous account as a fan named Chinzhilla

662
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,778
and offered himself as a tutor.

663
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,961
He went to all that trouble.

664
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:59,406
But in the end, was still too scared to confess his feelings.

665
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:03,699
That friend is quite clueless.

666
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:06,412
If I were him, I would've known since grade 10.

667
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:09,290
If someone pursues you like that one day,

668
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,770
don't let that person slip away.

669
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:46,981
Tinn.

670
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:50,852
When we looked into each other's eyes that day,

671
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:55,858
I had one more question I haven't asked you.

672
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:01,492
What is it?

673
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:03,384
Ask me.

674
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:08,017
If I want to be your boyfriend,

675
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,148
if I want to flirt with you in front of the aquarium,

676
00:50:13,148 --> 00:50:15,424
if I want to play in the sea with you,

677
00:50:15,424 --> 00:50:18,948
if I want to sing a song with you on stage,

678
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:23,696
if I want to tell everyone about you at prom,

679
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:28,103
will it be possible?

680
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:32,106
I don't know.

681
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:36,031
Try asking me.

682
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:46,529
Tinn,

683
00:50:47,905 --> 00:50:49,759
I like you.

684
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:55,867

Sure.

703

This will help stop me from blushing.

Just relax, but don't forget to share the snack with us.

[One year later]

760
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,949
You keep smiling at the screen. Won't you smile at the real me?

761
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:30,710
What took you so long?

762
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:36,660
I forgot some stuff at home, so I had to go back and get it.

763
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,160
I have something for you.

764
00:58:41,593 --> 00:58:47,512
Here. Put him next to the one in your bedroom to keep him company.

765
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:52,275
Does he look like me?

766
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,567
No.

767
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,556
The doll is more handsome.

768
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:06,380
I'm not okay with that.

769
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,550
What are you going to do?

770
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,290
Are you jealous of me and the doll?

771
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:13,487
Yes. I'm jealous.

772
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,439
Yeah?

773
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:21,494
No one is cuter than my boyfriend, the school president.

774
00:59:23,528 --> 00:59:28,392
You have to say my boyfriend, the doctor.

775
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:30,570
My boyfriend, the doctor.

776
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:34,188
Okay.

777
00:59:34,188 --> 00:59:36,213
I have to go.

778
00:59:36,213 --> 00:59:39,230
The juniors at the club are waiting for a welcome speech

779
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,600
from a cool senior like me.

780
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,562
Let's go.

781
00:59:47,594 --> 00:59:49,194
Can you hold this?

782
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,340

[Next Week]

792
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,552
You're confused, right? You wonder why I'm the boss.

793
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:48,731
Your face says you're scared.

794
01:00:52,921 --> 01:00:54,948
Why are you late?

795
01:00:54,948 --> 01:00:58,129
I want a Thai-style hot black coffee, 2 spoons of condensed milk, 1 spoon of sugar.

796
01:00:58,129 --> 01:01:00,085
You can only get it from Mrs. Ford's on 4th Street.

797
01:01:00,085 --> 01:01:01,511
Can you remember that?

798
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:06,961
You'll understand how the employee you yell at every day feels.

799
01:01:07,692 --> 01:01:10,261
Mr. Cher, please don't make that sound.

800
01:01:10,261 --> 01:01:12,287
Shut up, intern.

801
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:15,262
Once you finish washing my hair, massage my neck.
