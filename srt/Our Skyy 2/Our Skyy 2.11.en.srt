1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,726
Good morning. I'm Cher.

2
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:03,736
Are you looking for a coffee boy?

3
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:04,911
Let Cher do it.

4
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,400
Your coffee is here!

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,540
An extra-iced white mocha, with non-fat milk, and no syrup.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,853
You've been a lot livelier these days, Boss.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,970
♫ My heart says you are the one ♫

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,173
It's impossible.

9
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:24,449
A company owner and an intern.

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,449
I didn't realize that was our last day.

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,058
There was no sign at all.

12
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:29,740
Am I too stupid to see anything?

13
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,247
I'm retreating to stand firm.

14
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,947
Someone else might fucking take him.

15
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:36,285
Without you, my tiny room seems tremendous.

16
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,585
I miss you, Boss.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,900
Boss. Here.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,763
- What are you doing?
- Will you be my boyfriend?

19
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,144
I'm not an intern anymore.

20
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:48,430
Therefore, that thing about a company owner

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,850
and an intern is out of the question.

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,450
♫ Without you, I wouldn't be able to do it again. It's my luck to have you ♫

23
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,233
Come in.

24
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,252
What business do you have with me?

25
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,252
I brought you coffee.

26
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:25,614
Come closer.

27
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,198
What are you doing?

28
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,457
Say that again.

29
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:53,755
Who did you bring coffee to?

30
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:56,368
You want it or not?

31
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,710
Hey. How about you speak more politely?

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,792
Don't make me remind you again.

33
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,333
- Who did you bring coffee to?
- I brought you coffee, Boss.

34
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,079
- Who did?
- I did.

35
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,560
I? I who?

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,176
- Gun.
- And what is Gun's position?

37
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,246
Wait.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,700
You ordered coffee and I brought it to you.

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,530
What more do you want? Huh?

40
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:26,030
I can't drink the coffee you brought.

41
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,099
Why? Why can't you?

42
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,740
I ordered extra whipped cream, just how you like it, Cher.

43
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,416
I don't eat whipped cream anymore.

44
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,316
Because?

45
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:40,420
Because I'm the CEO now.

46
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,969
Hey, why aren't you the same type of boss as I am?

47
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,506
Why are you being a nonsense and unreasonable one?

48
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,638
Oh, wow. This is how you are.

49
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:51,610
Exactly.

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,815
You'll soon discover how painful it is to be an intern who is treated like a slave

51
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:02,814
and is the boss's punching bag.

52
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,502
- Does it hurt?
- It does.

53
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,289
I'll tell the housekeeper to bring you first aid.

54
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:15,434
What? Why did you hit me?

55
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,750
Why don't you, an intern, go get it for your boss?

56
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,660
Why the housekeeper?

57
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,870
Because we have the housekeeper to do the job.

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,340
Then why would I hire her?

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,680
But I want this intern to do it for me.

60
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,853
Go get it now. It's an order.

61
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,504
Yes, Boss.

62
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:43,930
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

63
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,250
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

64
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,750
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,190
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

66
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,370
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

67
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,660
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

68
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,220
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,640
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:26,440
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,070
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

72
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,730
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

73
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,570
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

74
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,560
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,000
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫

[Two weeks earlier]

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,381
Hello.

79
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,329
Are you confused?

80
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:02,317
How did I become the boss?

81
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,462
And how did the boss become the intern?

82
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:07,500
Well, after we agreed to be boyfriends,

83
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,070
I always walked in and out of this company.

84
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:12,302
Hello.

85
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,694
Oh, my beloved bro Laem.

86
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:16,612
Did you bring your handsome big bro snacks?

87
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:18,305
These aren't just for you.

88
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,147
They're for everyone.

89
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:22,077
Wow!

90
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,025
Thank you.

91
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:25,230
You got one too, Aoi.

92
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,001
Thank you.

93
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,592
Oh, not that one.

94
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,958
This is for my Gun.

95
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:34,218
Gun, huh?

96
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,201
You guys are so sweet.

97
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,961
When will you stop calling him Gun?

98
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,068
What should I call him then?

99
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,332
How about darling?

100
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:45,453
- Honey.
- Or daddy.

101
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,219
Or... baby.

102
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,120
Or... dung beetle.

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
What? Are you hungry or what?

104
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,882
Yes, fried bamboo worms would do.

105
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,307
Save those for your future lover, Jack.

106
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,487
I'm just going to call him Gun. It's cute.

107
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,966
Smells good. I'm going to give it to Gun now.

108
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,487
Wow. How sweet.

109
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:13,826
The boss's office is like my living room.

110
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:15,530
I brought you a snack.

111
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,230
Want to eat it now?

112
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,600
Sorry. You go ahead.

113
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,770
My hands aren't free.

114
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,127
Well then.

115
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:27,135
I'll feed you.

116
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:29,450
Eat while it's still hot.

117
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,500
It's tastier.

118
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,446
Yum.

119
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,100
- Good?
- Not only that, the boss moved out of his fancy condo...

120
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,662
- Please come in.
- ...to live in my tiny room.

121
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,275
- Let me, boss.
- It's okay.

122
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:56,077
Welcome to Die With My Food ASMR channel.

123
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:58,077
We're making ASMR videos together.

124
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:01,227
We have a special guest today.

125
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,257
Hello.

126
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,152
Introduce yourself.

127
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,544
I'm Gun.

128
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:06,882
From a fan,

129
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:08,510
- he's now my boyfriend.<
- What's this?

130
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,548
Gochujang stir-fried pork belly.

131
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,808
We're going to wrap it with a veggie.

132
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,090
Let's do two pieces.

133
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,665
Open your mouth.

134
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,315
What are you doing?

135
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,480
Hugging you.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,521
Who allowed you to?

137
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,221
Come on. Can't I hug you?

138
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,133
Everything seems right.

139
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:43,013
We're so sweet that other people get jealous.

140
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:46,514
There, get this.

141
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:50,580
But one day, the boss told me...

142
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:54,180
I think you should refrain from going to the office for now.

143
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,854
Why?

144
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:59,370
You play games until late.

145
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,570
I'm afraid you don't get enough rest time.

146
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:05,166
It's not like I visit so early.

147
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,467
I can go after waking up.

148
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,740
Don't bother.

149
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,700
Stay home and do your things.

150
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,498
It's troublesome going.

151
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:19,180
Are you hiding anything from me?

152
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,509
No.

153
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,842
He's hiding something.

154
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,351
[Hiding]

155
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,181
You look harmless when you sleep.

156
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,254
But you're so grumpy when you're awake.

157
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:48,224
I'm going to smash your face, you evil.

158
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,854
I won't.

159
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:56,237
Because I'm a man with kindness.

160
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,863
Not because of your cuteness.

161
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:00,733
Don't be so full of yourself.

162
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,778
Boom.

163
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:09,909
What?

164
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,664
Sleeptalking?

165
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,415
Boom.

166
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:25,515
Don't.

167
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,512
That's not good.

168
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:31,027
Boom? Who?

169
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,313
Boom.

170
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:54,331
Just like people say, love has its honeymoon phase.

171
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:59,272
Is it the sign that says our honeymoon phase is over?

172
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,319
Should I ask him?

173
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,152
Should I not?

174
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,033
Go ahead.

175
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,476
No. It can be a problem.

176
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:15,769
But if not, it'll get stuck in your head. Just do it.

177
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,544
But lovers should trust each other.

178
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,858
Is there something you want to say?

179
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,515
Nothing.

180
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:26,894
Don't lie. Say whatever it is.

181
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,350
How is it going...

182
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:36,422
with work?

183
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,396
As usual.

184
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:42,676
- Yeah?
- Um.

185
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,941
No problem at all?

186
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,198
No.

187
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:50,467
I notice you've been a little stressed.

188
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,252
If there's anything, you can talk to me.

189
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,259
It's nothing.

190
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,792
Really?

191
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:02,862
He's surely hiding something.

192
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,829
[Hiding]

193
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,085
Who's Boom then?

194
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,400
- Boom?
- Yes. Who's Boom?

195
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,198
Boom who?

196
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,010
Last night you were talking in your sleep.

197
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,400
"Boom, don't."

198
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
"Don't do this. It's not good."

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,571
- What was that?
- I have no clue.

200
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,680
He's definitely hiding something.

201
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,814
[Hiding]

202
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,316
Who's Boom?!

203
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,189
Bring it on.

204
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:44,468
Laem, the mage is going up there.

205
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:45,521
Laem!

206
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:46,900
- Laem!
- What?

207
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,443
Zo said the mage was going to you. Are you listening?

208
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,480
Yes?

209
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,381
Tub, help me.

210
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm coming.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,465
- Come help me first.
- Almost there.

212
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,513
Damn it. It's over.

213
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:11,480
Laem, what's with you?

214
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,200
You seem absent-minded.

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,686
It was just one game.

216
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:17,164
We can start over. Come on. Let's play again.

217
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:18,516
One game, my ass.

218
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:21,664
It's 10 games straight. We're about to get kicked out of the Conqueror rank.

219
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:22,933
Let's take a break, bro.

220
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,930
Laem doesn't seem into it.

221
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,610
What the heck?

222
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,211
Are you okay, Laem?

223
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:34,710
It's surely about the boss.

224
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:37,293
Wow. It's like you can read my mind.

225
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,376
What's it about?

226
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,101
Why don't we know about it?

227
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:43,723
He told me before just a little.

228
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:47,447
You can just let them know, now that they have asked.

229
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,226
Zo,

230
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:55,266
if Three said someone else's name in his sleep, what would you do?

231
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,815
If Three says someone else's name in his sleep,

232
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:04,128
I'm telling you, he's dead.

233
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:08,980
Don't tell me the boss said somebody else's name in his sleep.

234
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,990
- Yes.
- Shit.

235
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,890
Whose name?

236
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,705
He was like this.

237
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,505
"Boom."

238
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,901
"Boom, don't."

239
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:20,954
"Boom, stop."

240
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:23,025
Like this.

241
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,314
So he slipped out the name.

242
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:30,463
Who is this Boom guy anyway? Tell me.

243
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:32,063
No idea.

244
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,949
I'm curious too.

245
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:40,552
I think he might be the new intern in the company.

246
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,658
I'm having the same thought.

247
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,977
Why don't you follow him to the company?

248
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,711
You're there all the time.

249
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,650
The boss told him not to.

250
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,951
That's suspicious.

251
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,885
Right.

252
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,940
Don't misinterpret my opinion here,

253
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,700
but I think it's very likely

254
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,980
he's hiding someone in the company.

255
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,340
- I'm so stressed for you, man.
- Why are you so sure?

256
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,200
Have you ever done that?

257
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,670
- Yeah, twice.
- What?

258
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,382
I'm kidding. I've never done it.

259
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,182
Boom!

260
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:25,198
Is this Boom guy really the new intern?

261
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:29,829
Your coffee is served, Boss.

262
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,478
Don't you know I don't eat whipped cream?

263
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:40,104
If you don't, then I'll eat it.

264
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,588
How dare you drink from the boss's drink?

265
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,420
I don't know how to solve the problem.

266
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:03,145
What you did is not good.

267
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,400
Look at you.

268
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,500
It's all over your mouth.

269
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,357
No, no, no!

270
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,725
I can't let it happen.

271
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,901
If you're so afraid, just go to the company.

272
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,319
He told me not to.

273
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,727
And you listened to him?

274
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,814
Someone so stubborn like you, Laem?

275
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,143
- Right.
- Right.

276
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,172
Right.

277
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:44,803
You're right.

278
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:47,782
I can just secretly stalk him there.

279
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:57,383
Boom, you're over.

280
00:15:57,383 --> 00:16:00,200
- What are you looking at?
- Exactly.

281
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:14,770
I'm completely in disguise.

282
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,520
No one is going to recognize me.

283
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,692
Hi, Cher.

284
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:22,108
You're so early today.

285
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,307
Morning.

286
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:35,678
Cher, what are you wearing?

287
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:39,372
The disguise that I'm so proud of can't even fool anybody.

288
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,970
I'm not Cher.

289
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,432
Your voice is nasal. Do you have a cold, Cher?

290
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:45,329
Did you do the antigen test?

291
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,552
Will you excuse me?

292
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:49,672
I don't want to get Covid from you, in case you're positive.

293
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:55,150
Damn you, Laem.

294
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,930
You suck.

295
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,280
Aoi.

296
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,895
Cher, what brings you here?

297
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:06,150
Did you come with the boss?

298
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,120
No.

299
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,578
He got here first.

300
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,281
Does the boss know you're here?

301
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:18,634
So what if he does?

302
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,520
So Cher doesn't know yet.

303
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,223
I think you should go home for now.

304
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:24,923
Aoi!

305
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:28,336
You're definitely being suspicious.

306
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,477
I'm not.

307
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,548
High-pitched voice.

308
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,862
- Something is up for sure.
- Nothing is up.

309
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,365
- Is that for Gun?
- Yes. Be careful.

310
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,520
I'll take it to him.

311
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,639
He's having a meeting downstairs.

312
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,355
Cher.

313
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,303
Let me bring it.

314
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,103
Please.

315
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:56,675
You're making me more curious.

316
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,697
Don't stop me.

317
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,540
- Bye.
- Cher.

318
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,716
Holy shit. Aoi is so dead.

319
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,956
Cher.

320
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,538
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- Cher!

321
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:25,616
- What the hell is this?
- You're dead.

322
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,564
Cher!

323
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,591
Cher.

324
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,391
Cher.

325
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:34,150
Why are you here?

326
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,190
Who let you in here?

327
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,280
Answer me first.

328
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,560
What is this?

329
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,095
- I'm working.
- Working?

330
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:46,675
You're alone together doing a sexy role-play. That's what you call work?

331
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:55,885
Many people are here.

332
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,670
Cher, I told you not to come.

333
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,890
Sorry, Boss.

334
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:09,335
So you've been stressed because you're trying to come up with a new project?

335
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:11,946
Yeah. That's right.

336
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:16,634
And what about that tiger climbing on the desk?

337
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,880
It's part of the game the team proposed.

338
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,270
But I don't quite like it.

339
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,316
Who would like that?

340
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:27,660
Right. Every time there's a new project coming, I become so stressed.

341
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,100
That's why I didn't tell you.

342
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,310
I didn't want you to share that depression.

343
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,856
It's okay.

344
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:37,260
I know how you are. I can take it.

345
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,606
It's better than let me be paranoid.

346
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,720
Does anything else still cross your mind?

347
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,726
Yes.

348
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:45,526
What?

349
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:50,352
The new intern, is his name Boom?

350
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,808
- The one on the desk?
- Um.

351
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,793
No, his name isn't Boom.

352
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,090
What Boom are you talking about?

353
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,450
You mentioned him once already.

354
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:01,055
You literally said his name.

355
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:04,462
"Boom, don't." Something like that.

356
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,210
Boom?

357
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:09,840
Booming.

358
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,278
The name of this new project.

359
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,845
Oh, yeah?

360
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,445
Yes.

361
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,060
Why?

362
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,570
Are you jealous because of that intern?

363
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,236
What?

364
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:27,654
No, I'm not jealous.

365
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,423
- Not at all?
- No.

366
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:33,200
You barged into my meeting room and made a scene.

367
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,917
You didn't see anyone else but the intern.

368
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,781
- Not jealous at all?
- Right. I said I'm not.

369
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,854
I'm off now.

370
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,930
Not at all?

371
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,070
No, I'm not jealous.

372
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,460
Kids are always like that.

373
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,820
They say one thing but mean another.

374
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,815
Are we all here?

375
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:57,052
Yes, we are, boss.

376
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,976
Cher asked to join us, sir.

377
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,600
I promise to just sit and not interrupt.

378
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,310
I'll be very still.

379
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,415
Then let the meeting begin.

380
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,902
So this is the character that levels up—

381
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,850
That's what you call development?

382
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,717
Level up, do quests, kill bosses, anybody can think of that.

383
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,617
Do it over.

384
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,639
For me, this character is equipped with four skills.

385
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,348
Seriously. Don't you know how to balance all the characters?

386
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:35,168
This one is top-notch and that one is crappy.

387
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,063
Your balance sucks. Start over.

388
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,727
So this was the game we rebuilt, Boss.

389
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:45,270
I've told you countless times I don't want that.

390
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,400
I want something that the players will like right after they see it. The content must be new.

391
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,010
The players will feel like they are the main character,

392
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,282
not some kind of mediocre character.

393
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:54,473
That's not a very nice skin.

394
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:56,863
No, I don't want that outfit.

395
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:58,640
Write something down. Why don't you guys take notes?

396
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,828
Can you even remember what I said?

397
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:03,218
Tell me. Did you guys forget to bring your brains to this meeting room?

398
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:06,875
Why aren't you guys productive at all? It just doesn't work.

399
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,518
Is the air-con on?

400
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:11,935
I told you the temperature must be 20°C only.

401
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:14,276
What's wrong with you guys today? Your preparation failed big time.

402
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:16,509
Let's call it a day then.

403
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:29,753
Jack, is he usually this strict?

404
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:31,574
Yes, this is him.

405
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:35,332
This is the boss. The real him.

406
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,333
Look at us.

407
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,020
I know. It's as if I'm watching The Walking Dead.

408
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,410
And what's with 20°C temperature?

409
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,320
It's freaking cold.

410
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,744
Right. When he gets moody, everything is just wrong.

411
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:54,283
The presentation screen can't be too bright or too dark.

412
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:57,630
The other day, Aoi coughed while he was thinking of an idea.

413
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,630
What happened?

414
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,320
He asked me to go cough outside of the company.

415
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,049
He said I could come back when I was done coughing. What the heck?

416
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,877
We can't force ourselves to stop coughing.

417
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:09,803
Nobody wants to work on this project now.

418
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,745
I get you guys. I wouldn't want to do it either.

419
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:16,150
But if we don't do it, how will we make the money, sir?

420
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:19,832
I know. Relax. It's your little bro here.

421
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:24,308
Cher, can you talk to the boss for us?

422
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:27,074
Look at us.

423
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,687
Please.

424
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,087
Sure.

425
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:33,155
I'll reason with him.

426
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:37,417
Laem, I know what you guys are.

427
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,295
But do you think you can make him understand?

428
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:46,672
You don't know Laem at all.

429
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,635
I know what to do.

430
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,969
So? Does it feel nice?

431
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:14,113
Very nice.

432
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:17,478
Wait.

433
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:20,244
I'm not done.

434
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:22,843
We must apply this one too.

435
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,939
When did you learn about this kind of stuff?

436
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,239
You've been stressed out. I want to help out as much as I can.

437
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,100
I want to take the best care of you. Got it?

438
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,590
Got it?

439
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:47,333
It's good enough to have you by my side.

440
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,513
- Gun.
- Hm?

441
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:57,250
I don't want to get involved,

442
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,394
but what I saw in the meeting today...

443
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:03,581
- The meeting today?
- Um.

444
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,104
Right.

445
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,804
I must tell the Creative Team to resubmit those five topics.

446
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:10,231
Give that to me.

447
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,561
Lie down.

448
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:15,758
It's nine. Working time is over.

449
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:20,539
For me, if the work isn't done, it can't be over.

450
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:25,495
Gun, I get that you're the company owner.

451
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:27,621
But those people are your employees.

452
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,691
They can't be as dedicated as you are.

453
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:33,054
They have their personal life, you know?

454
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:38,258
You're lucky I'm not yelling at you for taking our personal time to work.

455
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:44,023
I just want to project to turn out great.

456
00:25:44,023 --> 00:25:46,504
You're too intense, Gun.

457
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:50,903
Any work under deep pressure can't turn out well, you know?

458
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:54,600
I know. But this is who I am.

459
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,125
I try not to get too stressed, but it just doesn't work.

460
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:10,379
I know it. I know the way to relieve your stress.

461
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:21,427
Listening to a sermon will also put your mind at ease.

462
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,787
Gun, get up.

463
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,600
Meditation doesn't help.

464
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,075
Sleeping on your lap is more comfortable.

465
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:36,752
Get up. Up now. Come on.

466
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:39,565
I told you it doesn't help. It's more comfortable like this.

467
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,887
Sit.

468
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,344
Get up.

469
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:46,610
Working out hard will exhaust you

470
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,790
and help minimize stress.

471
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:52,273
99, 100.

472
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:55,381
So? Is it better?

473
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:57,901
No.

474
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,762
Then continue.

475
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:06,544
497, 498, 499, and the last one,

476
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:08,356
500.

477
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,147
Is your stress gone?

478
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:15,191
I'm just tired.

479
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,792
Here. Refreshing and tasty.

480
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,887
People my age or your age can enjoy it.

481
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:43,335
Hey. Do you have a problem with my age?

482
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:45,126
Just drink.

483
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,626
Here.

484
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:57,191
It's good.

485
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:10,334
Gun.

486
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:11,890
What are you doing?

487
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:17,102
It's refreshing. And I want to share that with you.

488
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:19,690
I just can't let my guard down, can I?

489
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,998
Refreshing.

490
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,293
Good morning.

491
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:38,724
What a cheerful day today.

492
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,234
It doesn't work?

493
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:59,424
From what I see, no.

494
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:01,065
Let's do this, Gun.

495
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:03,040
Just smile.

496
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,072
- Smile?
- Smile.

497
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,228
Do I look forced?

498
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:10,992
Yes, like that.

499
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:12,598
That's the international standard.

500
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:14,913
You can add Y2K sense into it.

501
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:16,213
Like this.

502
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,184
Try it.

503
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:26,850
If we weren't in the office, you'd be attacked by my kisses right now.

504
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:30,693
Let's go up there.

505
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:45,972
Hello, everyone.

506
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:50,871
Enjoy working today, guys.

507
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:56,329
Smile.

508
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:04,192
And today, the vibe of the presentation must change.

509
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:06,960
We created characters of four professions.

510
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,666
Each one can turn into an animal that represents each profession.

511
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:20,872
Breathe in. Breathe out.

512
00:30:20,872 --> 00:30:23,342
Calm down.

513
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:26,042
Smile.

514
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,353
Be kind.

515
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:32,353
Be bright.

516
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:35,558
Be peaceful.

517
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,194
We want the players to feel real when transforming,

518
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:42,940
so we use the first person's perspective.

519
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,467
If you want to present the first person's perspective,

520
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:49,564
then why the heck did you create new characters?

521
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,117
Will the players see that?

522
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,583
Use your brain.

523
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,420
This is so easy.

524
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,643
And everyone is resting in peace.

525
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,955
Good job.

526
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:17,705
Are you really leaving, Kie?

527
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:20,102
Are you going back to Thatthong?

528
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:22,385
Goodbye.

529
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,785
Kie.

530
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,682
Damn it, Boss.

531
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,396
Poor girl.

532
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:34,930
You're next.

533
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,418
I can't let this go on.

534
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:41,831
The prophet Laem's brain must be summoned.

535
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,138
You don't usually knock.

536
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:59,187
I was afraid you'd yell at me too.

537
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:03,385
That's why I knocked in such a cool manner.

538
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,385
What is it?

539
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:07,910
BBQ at Tub's this evening?

540
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:12,323
You go on ahead. I still have work to do.

541
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:16,294
Work will never be done.

542
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:20,001
You should relax your brain sometimes.

543
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,370
I can't relax.

544
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,736
We need to launch it soon. And it's not going anywhere.

545
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:31,207
Are we done here?

546
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:34,661
No, I can't play.

547
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,456
Are we done?

548
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,912
Are we?

549
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,794
Yes.

550
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:52,253
I will prepare the full set for you tonight.

551
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,052
You mean the BBQ?

552
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:05,947
The superb marinated pork, recipe by Mrs. Phon from Udon Thani.

553
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:09,821
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

554
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:16,116
Boss, you should've let him handle it.

555
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:19,372
He's acting like we're his slaves these days.

556
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,388
He's ordering us around like a king.

557
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:25,360
Toobtub, it's not giving orders.

558
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,727
It's called begging nicely.

559
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:29,183
- You never beg.
- I'm doing it now.

560
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:32,646
I'm going to smack you. You're being spoiled.

561
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:34,442
I miss this vibe.

562
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,748
I haven't got to eat with you guys for a long time.

563
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,795
Please enjoy, Boss. We'll take care of you.

564
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:45,500
Should we eat now?

565
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,667
Yeah?

566
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,099
- Yes.
- Let's go.

567
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:02,065
What, Three?

568
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,565
Zo.

569
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:07,673
Why did you give me an egg? I don't eat eggs.

570
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,417
Why didn't you tell me?

571
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,807
Why didn't you ask?

572
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:14,916
I don't like it. Come on!

573
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,024
I'll take it out for you.

574
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:18,943
No. It's too late. I don't want to eat it anymore.

575
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:19,901
It's not edible.

576
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:22,931
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

577
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:28,412
- Why didn't you ask me before you did it?
- Okay.

578
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:30,604
- Why didn't you?
- All right.

579
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:33,325
Please calm down. Let's talk nicely.

580
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,572
- Can you two help put on an act?
- Yes, sure.

581
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:39,591
Wait. What are you talking about?

582
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:42,110
I want super unreasonable.

583
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,316
Act like you're the most self-centered one on the planet.

584
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,810
- Can you?
- We can.

585
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,754
For what?

586
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,254
For what?

587
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:55,451
I want Gun to see that what he does to his employees is not right.

588
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:59,689
Make it easy to understand. When he sees it, he realizes it right away.

589
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:03,136
But Three can't act.

590
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:06,510
Right. I don't think I can.

591
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,801
I don't know how.

592
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,501
I don't want to eat anymore!

593
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:15,208
What you're doing is not right,

594
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,187
- Zo.
- What?

595
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:23,260
If you'd asked Three first, this wouldn't have happened.

596
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,800
If you asked if he wanted the egg, you wouldn't have to argue.

597
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,068
Gun, how can you say that?

598
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:31,068
Everyone here eats eggs.

599
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:35,689
Except for Three who acts like the center of the universe and doesn't eat eggs.

600
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:38,871
So everyone else must not eat eggs just like him?

601
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:43,241
The point is not whether he eats eggs or not.

602
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,724
The point is Zo should've asked Three first.

603
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:48,664
Then find the solution together.

604
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,140
You don't need to make it so real by yelling at me like that.

605
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,000
Zo.

606
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:57,728
Zo.

607
00:35:57,728 --> 00:35:59,856
I'm sorry.

608
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,533
My dear.

609
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:06,487
I should just turn my game channel into a soap opera channel.

610
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:08,792
They act so well.

611
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,012
So the plan failed miserably.

612
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:34,712
Can you smell my hair? Does it still smell like BBQ?

613
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:39,084
Smells very nice.

614
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,711
Does this smell nice too?

615
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:47,755
No more kisses for today.

616
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:50,871
Why not?

617
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:57,118
Do you even realize that none of your actions today was right?

618
00:36:57,118 --> 00:37:00,473
I told you to adjust.

619
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:03,816
But you took it out on your employees today.

620
00:37:03,816 --> 00:37:06,232
But it was all about work.

621
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:09,819
I know, but you could've said it more nicely.

622
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:12,968
Who can put up with your bad temper every day?

623
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:14,850
I've been nothing but adjust.

624
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,773
Why does no one understand?

625
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:20,837
I do everything for the company, for all the employees.

626
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:22,790
If our work turns out badly,

627
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,190
where will I get the money to pay them?

628
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:27,900
Not mentioning the other expenses.

629
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,632
I'm as stressed as the employees are, Cher.

630
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:36,335
I know that.

631
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:38,580
But if you keep on being like this,

632
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:44,010
you will have no employees left.

633
00:37:45,185 --> 00:37:47,013
This is difficult.

634
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:50,055
I have no idea what to do now.

635
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:52,800
It's not difficult at all.

636
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,811
Come on, Cher. It's easy for you to say.

637
00:37:55,811 --> 00:37:58,610
You're not me. You don't get it.

638
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:01,963
Hey. Are you challenging me or what?

639
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:06,890
How about I become a boss

640
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,464
and you become an intern?

641
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:11,983
Why should I do such a thing?

642
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:15,840
So you will get...

643
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,810
how your employees feel getting scolded by you every day.

644
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:26,891
Look at you. You won't dare.

645
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:33,702
Gun here is a man with boldness.

646
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:36,287
Don't be so sure.

647
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:40,787
One hour of being ordered around will make you want to go home and cry.

648
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:43,536
Let's do this then.

649
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:46,181
You become me for 24 hours.

650
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:50,442
If you think you can run the company, I'll let you try.

651
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:56,329
It's a deal.

652
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:05,246
Should we start now?

653
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:06,749
Sure.

654
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:09,036
But before that...

655
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,091
What's that?

656
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,230
Wear this.

657
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,280
You've been promoted.

658
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:43,956
Promoted?

659
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:46,328
When you were an intern,

660
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,681
I gave you the intern ID card.

661
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:54,667
Now that you've been promoted, you should have your own title tag.

662
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,253
Hold on.

663
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:59,000
What we agree on is I become the boss,

664
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,753
and you become the intern.

665
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:03,816
What's "Babe"?

666
00:40:04,823 --> 00:40:06,299
Wrong.

667
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:09,415
I wasn't talking about you becoming the boss.

668
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:13,340
I was talking about you becoming the boss's babe.

669
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:14,940
Yuck.

670
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,148
Can I just throw up?

671
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,298
- Do you like it?
- You mean the necklace?

672
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:22,267
Of course. Because I know you like me.

673
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,279
That's for sure.

674
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:33,675
I do. I like both the necklace and the boyfriend.

675
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm going to take a shower.

676
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,390
♫ I'm probably luckier than anyone else ♫

677
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,120

684
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,226
Today, if you want to ask Gun to do anything, you're welcome to.

685
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,391
Don't be shy.

686
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:32,715
It's the order of Boss Cher, this man right here.

687
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:35,642
Keep going.

688
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,181
What should I ask this intern to do?

689
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,684
How many times have I told you?

690
00:41:39,684 --> 00:41:42,981
If you don't know how to use the photocopier, you must ask.

691
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,909
For everyone, I can do this.

692
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:46,609
Make it quick.

693
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:49,681
Please hear me out.

694
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,410
"I've Changed My Mind" - Force & Book
