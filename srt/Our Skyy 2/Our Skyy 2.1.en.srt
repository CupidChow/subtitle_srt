[First Year]
What are you doing? I really miss you.

4
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:49,166
I wonder if you miss me.

5
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,160
I just finished my class today. I'm so tired.

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,362
I don't have many friends here, so I'm a bit lonely.

7
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:59,162
[Second Year]
It's very cold here.

8
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:01,297
I miss the beach.

9
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:04,749
I want to go back to riding a motorcycle and going to the beach with you.

10
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:06,844
[Third Year]
Why won't you answer my calls?

11
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,406
You also don't answer my texts.

12
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:13,099
I understand that you are busy, but you should make time for me.

13
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,198
How about this? I'll book a plane ticket to go back to Bangkok.

14
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:18,078
Don't forget to pick me up at the airport.

15

Why wouldn't you let me wait for you inside the terminal?

36
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,062
I prepared this signboard to show off to everyone.

37
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:44,819
I wanted to create a romantic moment that you like.

38
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,198
It's okay. No need to make a scene.

39
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,280
Who said I like that kind of stuff?

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,655
I don't like it. I would scold you if you did it.

41
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:56,262
You are going to start scolding me even though we just met.

42
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,284
You look more handsome.

43
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:03,809
You are not only more handsome, but you are also more uptight. Right?

44
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,602
Stop joking around. It's not funny.

45
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:09,858
Why? What did I do that upset you?

46
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,562
Why are you acting grumpy though we just met?

47
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:15,657
Think carefully. What did you do that might upset me?

48
00:04:15,657 --> 00:04:17,959
I'm not an irrational person.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,820
Let me take it.

50
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,847
The car looks nice. Whose is it?

51
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,900
It's mine. I just bought it.

52
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:51,590
You are rich enough to buy a car?

53
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,344
I'm not rich. I'm still paying for the car loan.

54
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:57,176
I make some profits from the bar.

55
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:58,420
I think a car is necessary.

56
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,280
This car is spacious. It can be used for personal and work errands.

57
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:07,633
Soon, I will need to call you Mr. Plutocrat.

58
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,819
You will own businesses all over the island.

59
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,926
Soon you will become wealthier than me.

60
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:17,212
If I become rich, you will too.

61
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:19,744
Because we are one.

62
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,190
You are as cheesy, as always.

63
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,790
Do you like it?

64
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,522
How was your flight?

65
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:44,364
It was uncomfortable. I barely got any sleep.

66
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:45,955
I had a weird dream.

67
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:50,104
There was a lot turbulence. I was worried about a plane crash.

68
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,940
That sounds scary.

69
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,007
If I were with you, I would hold your hand like this throughout the flight.

70
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:04,215
Or I would hold you to calm you down like this.

71
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:10,920
If I held you like this, would you have felt calmer?

72
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,320
No.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,115
Nueng, why are still mad at me?

74
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,419
I missed you so much.

75
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:20,877
Is that so?

76
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,400
You missed me?

77
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,459
If you missed me, why haven't you answered my calls lately?

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,883
Since I went to study abroad, we only saw each other once a year.

79
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:32,554
There are also time zone differences.

80
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,546
It's night time for me, but it's day time for you.

81
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,055
I guess it's useless to have a boyfriend.

82
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:43,101
You said no matter how far apart we were, you would make time for me.

83
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:50,668
I'm sorry. I've been very busy lately.

84
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:52,775
Since you are back,

85
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:56,104
I will give you all my time these two weeks.

86
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:59,029
I won't spend a second away from you. Does it sound good?

87
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,406
Wherever you want to go, whatever you want to eat, just tell me.

88
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:07,430
Now I have a car, I will take you wherever you want to go.

89
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,663
All right?

90
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,412
All right? Please stop being mad at me.

91
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:17,639
You always have a way to make me give in to you.

92
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,400
Do you want to put your bag at your house or the hotel?

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,583
Do you feel tired? Do you want to get some rest?

94
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,286
It's okay. If I sleep now, I will have jetlag.

95
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:32,640
By the way, I didn't tell my mom that I came back.

96
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,006
I don't want to go to the hotel. I'd rather spend time with you.

97
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,476
Sure.

98
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,254
Where do you want to go?

99
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,602
I want to eat Thai food.

100
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:47,338
When I was living abroad, the food there didn't suit my taste.

101
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:50,739
I want to eat spicy food such as Thai stink beans with shrimp or Khua Kling.

102
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:54,120
Seafood with spicy sauce is also good.

103
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,052
Sure. I'll take you to a restaurant.

104
00:07:57,052 --> 00:08:00,140
You will get to eat the spicy food that you want.

105
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,741
Let's go.

106
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,283
I didn't know there was a restaurant in Bangkok

107
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,830
selling Thai southern dishes like the ones we had in Surat Thani.

108
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,959
This restaurant uses curry paste they made themselves.

109
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,845
More importantly, the cook is originally from the South.

110
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,216
How did you know that? Did you bring someone to eat here before?

111
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:40,220
Who would I bring? You are my only boyfriend.

112
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,660
You are the first person I brought here.

113
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,502
How is it?

114
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:52,707
You should peel shrimp for yourself too. You gave me too many to eat.

115
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:55,615
I'm happy seeing you enjoying it.

116
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,951
Palm, water.

117
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,790
Give me the water.

118
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,803
You said you wanted to eat spicy food.

119
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,622
Palm, give me the water.

120
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,440
Give me the water, seriously.

121
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,808
The spicy taste will fulfill your cravings.

122
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:26,682
Palm, why are you teasing your young master?

123
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,082
Tam, what are you doing here?

124
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:33,296
I moved to Bangkok for a while.

125
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:35,496
Is this your restaurant?

126
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:39,200
It looks luxurious, doesn't it?

127
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,080
That's right. It was hard to find a job here.

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,985
I told Palm that I wanted to open a beautiful restaurant selling Southern dishes.

129
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:52,624
He spent the profit he earned from the bar to open this restaurant.

130
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,770
Then, who is taking care of the bar?

131
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,051
My dad is running it.

132
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:58,897
When things at the restaurant fall into place, I will go back.

133
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:02,280
When did you plan to tell me?

134
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,806
I wanted to surprise you.

135
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:06,352
Why don't you tell him that you opened this restaurant

136
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,869
so you could live with him in Bangkok?

137
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,843
I really missed both Thai food and strawberry-flavored yogurt milk.

138
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,501
They melt away my travel fatigue.

139
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:38,350
Did you drink that big bottle?

140
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:40,382
I like it.

141
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:44,927
I need to get fit nowadays. I have someone to take care of.

142
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:52,331
Did you move to Bangkok to wait for me to come back?

143
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:54,060
That's right.

144
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,009
I know that after graduation, you will come back here to manage your hotel.

145
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,883
I know if I was still living on the island, we wouldn't have much time together.

146
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:07,394
I decided to open a restaurant in Bangkok so I can be close to you.

147
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:12,979
I'm working to earn experience for a year while waiting for you to come back.

148
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,960
You didn't answer my calls and texts

149
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,681
because you were busy with the restaurant.

150
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,535
You did that because you wanted me to be proud of you?

151
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,676
Yes.

152
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,632
Why didn't you tell me?

153
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,432
Did you think I wouldn't like it?

154
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,985
I like it. I love it.

155
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:42,494
Thank you so much for everything you did for me.

156
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:47,473
I can do anything for you.

What bracelet?

165
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:28,461
This sun bracelet.

166
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,716
It's mine.

Please let it go.

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,078
What the hell are you saying? We just want the bracelet back.

175
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,378
If you want to know about your future, then follow me.

176
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:26,627
Have you had any strange dreams lately?

177
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:32,096
Yes.

178
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:35,685
In my dream, I woke up under a big tree.

179
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,897
But I don't know and have never been to that place.

180
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,495
What about you?

181
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:46,348
I had dreams.

182
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:47,940
That's normal.

183
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,128
In my latest dream, I was being chased in a place from the past.

184
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,595
But it was not strange.

185
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,988
I always have weird dreams.

186
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:59,908
Are you going to interpret my dream and tell me a winning lottery number?

187
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:07,730
I know that you don't believe in this kind of thing.

188
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:12,220
But if you want to be together,

189
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,845
you need to listen to me.

190
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:18,491
Shoot. What do you have to say?

191
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:27,776
You two are soulmates who have been together for many lifetimes.

192
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:33,574
In another lifetime, you were enemies who tried to kill each other.

193
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:39,887
In another lifetime, you were a master and a servant who took care of each other.

194
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:44,436
In another lifetime, you were best buddies fighting in a battle.

195
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:48,840
You are the other half of each other

196
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,660
who successfully reunited.

197
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,866
But you always ended up parting.

198
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:03,499
In this lifetime as well.

199
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,374
This lifetime?

200
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,182
Do you mean that he and I won't get to be together?

201
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:12,682
Yes.

202
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,586
Based on your fate, you are being chased after by someone.

203
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:20,286
They want to kill you.

204
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,495
What do we need to do?

205
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,934
There. He will tell you that you need to pay him

206
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,440
to perform a ceremony to get rid of bad luck.

207
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,348
I heard this kind of trick before.

208
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,231
Nueng, stop listening to his nonsense.

209
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,973
Let's go home.

210
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,117
You need to go back to the beginning.

211
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,909
To the place where you made your love vow.

212
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,640
That place will make you realize

213
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,930
how much you love each other.

214
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,907
Nueng,

215
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:15,075
you didn't believe what he said about our fate, did you?

216
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:17,498
I didn't totally believe it.

217
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:21,028
But what he said is something I'm worried about.

218
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,127
Don't worry.

219
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,830
I've been through a near-death situation before.

220
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,340
Nothing could be worse than that.

221
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,047
One more thing,

222
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,355
I don't care about fate.

223
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:38,834
Because I believe we can choose our own life.

224
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,188
Don't worry.

225
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,388
Next year, you will come back to live in Thailand.

226
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:50,497
I will move to Bangkok as well.

227
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,697
We will be together for sure.

228
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:55,745
I don't think someone will try to come after us again.

229
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,746
Palm.

230
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:03,597
I have something to tell you.

231
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,097
What is it?

232
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,167
I decided to...

233
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,985
- Give it to me.
- I don't have it.

234
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:13,227
- Palm!
- I don't have it.

235
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,351
- Pay it back.
- I don't have it.

236
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,008
What are you doing?

237
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:19,268
Are you all right?

238
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm okay. Thank you.

239
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,920
Why are you butting into my business?

240
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:25,667
Why are you bothering her?

241
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,468
She owes me money and refuses to pay it back.

242
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:30,627
She's also being a smart mouth, so I'm teaching her a lesson.

243
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:34,000
I would have paid it back if you didn't charge an extremely high-interest rate.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,944
Why take the loan if you couldn't pay it back?

245
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,844
Pay it back.

246
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,738
You are not backing down?

247
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,610
What do we do?

248
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,040
Nueng, run!

249
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,573
Follow them.

250
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:42,588
What are you going to do...

251
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,619
There.

252
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:24,148
We almost got into trouble because you wanted to be a hero.

253
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:25,704
What are you scared of?

254
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,534
I can protect you anyway.

255
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,414
Have you hugged each other enough?

256
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,392
Nueng.

257
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,963
Jackass, you want to be a hero, do you?

258
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:57,467
I'll show you what kind of ending awaits a hero.

259
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,207
You need to go back to the beginning.

260
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:18,836
To the place where you made your love vow.

261
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:36,863
Where is this place?

262
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,351
What happened?

263
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,688
Nueng, where are you?

264
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:49,232
Nueng.

265
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,758
Nueng.

266
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:55,605
Lord.

267
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,724
Phum, why are you here?

268
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:09,475
Who is Phum, sir?

269
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,678
My name is Petch.

270
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:14,160
- Petch?
- Yes.

271
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,907
I'm your close servant whom you love and trust the most.

272
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,566
What the hell are you doing?

273
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,711
Why are you calling me "Lord"?

274
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,364
Because you are a Lord, sir.

275
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:33,981
Lord Poramet, the only son of Baron Teeradejand Baroness Panadda.

276
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,149
What the hell are you talking about? Why do you call me sir?

277
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:47,286
My father is not a Baron. My mother is dead.

278
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:49,148
Your parents are still alive, sir.

279
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:52,379
They are in the northern county for some business, and will be back in a few days.

280
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,473
The more you talk, the more confused I am.

281
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,046
Can you tell me what is going on?

282
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:02,028
Did you work with those thugs?

283
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:05,076
Huh? Tell me. Where did you take Nuengdiao?

284
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,633
Tell me!

285
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,304
Please don't hurt me, sir.

286
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,563
I didn't lie.

287
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,763
I told you the truth.

288
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:16,074
Who is Nuengdiao? I've never heard the name before.

289
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:18,791
Nuengdiao is my friend whom you bullied in high school.

290
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,193
He is my boyfriend.

291
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,831
Bullied? When did I bully him?

292
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:27,421
I really don't know the man.

293
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:30,787
Boyfriend? What is a boyfriend?

294
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:33,767
I've never heard such a word before. Is it a foreign word?

295
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,030
Can you tell me its meaning?

296
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,149
I want to know it so I can boast to the other servants that I know a foreign word.

297
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:50,100
You can tell me later.

298
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,187
I'm here to inform you about a slave who is sent to you to pay a debt.

299
00:23:53,187 --> 00:23:55,639
He borrowed money from you, but he couldn't pay it back.

300
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,047
So he sent his son to work for you.

301
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,928
He is in front of the manor.

302
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:03,879
I'll go and take a look at him.

303
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,105
Lord,

304
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't think I can find the money to pay you back in time.

305
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,999
I don't know what to do.

306
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:54,605
Why didn't you think about that when you borrowed the money?

307
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,827
You knew you couldn't pay it back, but you borrowed the money anyway.

308
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:01,330
Today, I want to ask for your mercy.

309
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,849
Please give me some more time.

310
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:08,488
I brought my only son here to work for you.

311
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,611
You can tell him to do anything.

312
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:14,562
He's able and smart.

313
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,910
Nueng, greet the Lord.

314
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:45,624
From now on, you will be working for the Lord until the day you die.

315
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,423
Nueng.

316
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,943
Do you know him, sir?

317
00:25:56,943 --> 00:25:58,347
This is Nueng.

318
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:00,807
I told you that he went to the same school as us.

319
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:02,867
Sir.

320
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:06,284
Nueng has never gone to school.

321
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:09,047
He isn't smart enough for studying.

322
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,868
Is that right, Nueng?

323
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:13,606
Have you ever met the Lord?

324
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,667
No.

325
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,169
This is the first time I have met him.

326
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,387
From now on, you need to learn about the Lord.

327
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:24,568
You need to work for him.

328
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:28,231
Whatever he orders you to do, you have to do it.

329
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:32,991
Because your life is now his. Do you hear me?

330
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,059
Nueng.

331
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,559
Lord.

332
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:10,764
Lord.

333
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:14,208
I'm sorry, sir.

334
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:17,608
Nueng, it's me.

335
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,404
What are you talking about, sir?

336
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:23,950
Don't you remember me?

337
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,629
We were running away from those thugs at the market.

338
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:28,229
I'm Palm.

339
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,451
How could I not remember you?

340
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,358
I am your boyfriend.

341
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:52,420
How did we end up here?

342
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,736
The last thing I remembered was us running away from the thugs at the market.

343
00:27:58,294 --> 00:28:01,588
I don't know either. I'm as confused as you.

344
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:05,167
I tried to think, but I can't understand what is happening.

345
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:09,220
I woke up under a big tree.

346
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,370
Then a man said he is my father.

347
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,320
He brought me here to pay the debt that he owes a Lord.

348
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,646
When I saw you and Phum, I thought someone was pranking us.

349
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:23,206
After thinking about it,

350
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:24,783
I don't think it's the case.

351
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:29,100
We might really have traveled back to the past.

352
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:32,422
How is that possible?

353
00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:35,725
We were running away from the thugs.

354
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,418
Do you remember? When we fell, the thug was going to attack us with a knife.

355
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:46,926
The knife cut my sun bracelet.

356
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,482
But you aren't wearing the bracelet.

357
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:55,237
Since I woke up, I haven't seen it.

358
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:00,720
Do you remember the fortune teller said

359
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,822
we were a master and a servant in one of our lifetimes?

360
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:08,406
I think we might have been sent back here to reverse our curse.

361
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:12,022
Do you believe this stuff?

362
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,047
How could you not believe it?

363
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:17,008
Look around. Look at where we are.

364
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,678
I think anything is possible now.

365
00:29:19,678 --> 00:29:22,501
I think everything happened because of the sun bracelet.

366
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,425
We met the fortune teller because of the bracelet.

367
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:26,720
The thug cut the bracelet.

368
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,753
If we find the bracelet, we may be able to go home.

369
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:32,101
Then we need to find the bracelet.

370
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,391
Okay. I'll try to find it.

371
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:40,494
What should we do now?

372
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:43,060
I don't want you to work as a servant.

373
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:47,554
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

374
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:50,187
You just have to find the bracelet.

375
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:54,147
Right now, we need to play along.

376
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:56,014
We need to play our roles.

377
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:58,004
Make it convincing.

378
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,847
Make it convincing.

379
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,735
Right now, we need to play along.

380
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:13,583
We need to play our roles.

381
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,733
Make it convincing.

382
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,520
That's enough.

383
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,275
I don't feel stiff now. You can go wherever you want.

384
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:25,013
I'll come to give you a massage after supper.

385
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:27,182
You like to have a massage when you feel full.

386
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:31,157
Do I like that kind of thing? I can't remember that.

387
00:30:31,157 --> 00:30:32,587
Yes, sir.

388
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:36,034
You said when you were full, you would feel drowsy.

389
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,307
So you wanted to have a body massage to feel relaxed.

390
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,687
Hurry up, the new servant.

391
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:53,770
The Lord has been waiting for a while. Do you want to be whipped?

392
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,383
Have you eaten anything, Nueng?

393
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,228
No, sir.

394
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,592
I'll go eat with the other servants.

395
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,884
Aren't you hungry?

396
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:28,972
The food looks spicy. Don't you like it?

397
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,275
I like it, sir. But I'll wait to eat with the other servants.

398
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:39,175
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

399
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:43,428
Wait.

400
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:50,501
But I want you to have the meal with me,

401
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,706
right here, right now.

402
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,469
There is plenty of food. I can't eat everything.

403
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:06,566
Come and eat with me.

404
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:16,338
I don't think it's a good idea, sir.

405
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:18,699
Do you dare to disobey my order?

406
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:21,150
I am your master.

407
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:27,787
Come. The Lord is so kind to you.

408
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:30,358
How dare you disobey him?

409
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:39,026
Sit down.

410
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:44,598
You can take what you want to eat.

411
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:46,658
There is plenty for you to choose from.

412
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,357
What are you waiting for?

413
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:57,023
Do I have to feed you?

414
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:07,359
I can eat it myself, sir.

415
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,377
I can eat it myself, sir.

416
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:22,279
You, go get your plate and come to eat with me.

417
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,248
Me?

418
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:25,154
Yes. I'm talking to you.

419
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:27,740
Do you think I would ask a dog to join my table?

420
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,240
Yes, sir.

421
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:34,773
(What are you doing?)

422
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,523
What are you doing?

423
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:40,560
(Stop it.)

424
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,680
I don't understand what you are saying. Let's eat.

425
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,123
(What is wrong with you?)

426
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,778
What are you waiting for? Get the rice.

427
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:48,602
Get me the rice.

428
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:12,218
Wait. Don't go.

429
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,607
I have something to order you to do.

430
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,214
Yes, sir.

431
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:20,347
I'm full now.

432
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:24,514
I want to get a good sleep. Can you give me a massage?

433
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:28,008
Yes, sir.

434
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:30,814
But that's my job.

435
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:32,321
It's okay.

436
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,308
I want Nueng to give me a massage.

437
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:36,187
I want to try something new.

438
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:38,547
Your massage skills are no longer good.

439
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:43,730
So? Do you know how to massage?

440
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:46,087
I can do it, sir.

441
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:52,680
What are you waiting for? Come here and give me a massage.

442
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:56,187
You can go wherever you want.

443
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,053
Yes, sir.

444
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,047
Hurry.

445
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:03,238
You, too. What are you waiting for?

446
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:05,526
Do you want to be whipped?

447
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:10,960
You are taking advantage of the situation.

448
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,224
Stop talking. Give me a good massage.

449
00:35:14,224 --> 00:35:15,807
Go a bit lower.

450
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:17,187
Go to the middle.

451
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:18,495
Right there.

452
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:20,554
Do you feel relaxed, sir?

453
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:23,672
I told you to stop talking.

454
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:25,432
Go a bit lower.

455
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:37,950
I'm sorry, sir. I was a bit too harsh on you.

456
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,958
I told you to give a gentle massage.

457
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:43,663
If I'm not satisfied with your service, you will be punished.

458
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,327
What kind of punishment will it be, sir?

459
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,461
What kind of punishment do you want?

460
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,626
Now, it's my turn.

461
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,216
Do it well.

462
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:01,887
Massage my legs, too.

463
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:04,358
Why are you smiling?

464
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:06,885
I'm about to do it, sir.

465
00:36:57,078 --> 00:36:59,250
Palm, what are you doing here?

466
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,056
There are many servants outside.

467
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,785
What are you afraid of?

468
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,727
I missed you.

469
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:08,999
I want to hold and kiss you as much as I miss you.

470
00:37:10,256 --> 00:37:11,702
We are not at home.

471
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:13,499
You need to consider your status.

472
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:17,733
You can do whatever you want, but I may be whipped to death.

473
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,557
You don't need to worry about that.

474
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:22,252
I will never let anyone hurt you.

475
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:25,447
Right now, I'm a lord.

476
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:27,877
I'm the most powerful person in this manor.

477
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:30,090
You need to be careful when doing things.

478
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,220
Don't make people suspicious.

479
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,747
No matter how powerful I am, my duty is still the same.

480
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:40,996
My job is to protect you as best as I can.

481
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:44,827
Who am I talking to right now?

482
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:47,630
Palm or Lord?

483
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,707
Of course, it's Palm.

484
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:55,744
Pannakorn Jannaloy who is deeply infatuated with Nuengdiao Kiattrakulmaytee.

485
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,005
You are good at using old words.

486
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:02,027
You should stay and live here instead of going home.

487
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:05,960
Whatever era we are living in,

488
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,687
as long as I can hold you like this, that's good enough for me.

489
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,811
When I was studying abroad, what did you do when you couldn't fall asleep?

490
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:20,354
When I couldn't fall asleep,

491
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:22,827
I would work to exhaust myself.

492
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:25,147
Exhaust myself, exhaust myself...

493
00:38:25,147 --> 00:38:29,221
Then I would wait, keep waiting...

494
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:31,658
until I got to hold you again.

495
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:35,559
Whatever.

496
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,172
Hold me as much as you want and go back to your room, before we get into trouble.

497
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,944
Come and take a look.

498
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,957
They are many pretty items.

499
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,873
Come to take a look at these pretty items.

500
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:25,332
Lord, sir.

501
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,302
Why did you bring Nueng with us?

502
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:31,062
Why don't you let him stay and work at the manor?

503
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,522
Why?

504
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:34,666
Do you want him to only work?

505
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:38,507
Even though he is a servant, he should get to go outside sometimes.

506
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:41,730
One more thing, he just moved in.

507
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,920
I want to give him a chance.

508
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,971
Do you have a problem with that?

509
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:48,767
No, sir.

510
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:53,156
I want to eat bananas.

511
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:58,376
I want sweet fragrant Hak Mook bananas.

512
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,574
Can you find them for me?

513
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:02,374
Of course.

514
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,128
Why did you do that to him?

515
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:11,591
Don't you remember what he did to me?

516
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,891
He already dislikes me.

517
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:15,913
Of course, I remember.

518
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,298
But when we are here, my status is higher than his.

519
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:20,998
I feel good ordering him around.

520
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,862
I guess you have started to like your life here.

521
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:26,590
You have money and power.

522
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,877
You can order anyone you want.

523
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:30,820
I have a chip on my shoulder.

524
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,848
I have been ordered to do things that I didn't want all my life.

525
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:38,590
When I have the chance to order people around, it's quite satisfying.

526
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:44,899
Especially those who ordered me around.

527
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,578
Are you talking about me?

528
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,029
No.

529
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:56,315
For you, I'm willing to do it.

530
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:10,831
To be honest, I want a camera.

531
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,120
I want to take photos to record this moment.

532
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:19,166
If we go back home and tell people that we went and lived in the past,

533
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,218
no one would believe us.

534
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,328
Nueng.

535
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,212
What are you doing?

536
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:03,535
Taking a picture.

537
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:05,474
You said you want a picture to remind you of this moment.

538
00:42:05,474 --> 00:42:08,376
Did you take it? Let me see.

539
00:42:09,187 --> 00:42:10,680
How is it?

540
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,419
I don't look good. Take another one.

541
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:13,902
Is that what you want?

542
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:15,890
You are so picky.

543
00:42:17,424 --> 00:42:19,393
This time, you need to smile.

544
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:21,906
One, two, three.

545
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,406
Click.

546
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:27,550
Do you like it?

547
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,894
What about you?

548
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:31,063
No comment.

549
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:33,216
In my eyes, you always look handsome.

550
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:38,527
Since we are here, you should take a selfie.

551
00:42:41,538 --> 00:42:44,156
One, two, three.

552
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,488
I'll keep it carefully and frame it later.

553
00:42:48,488 --> 00:42:51,620
Your romantic skills are getting more advanced these days.

554
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,149
I wonder if the Lord's personality is like this in every lifetime.

555
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:58,829
I'm acting romantically only to my special one.

556
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:12,347
Nueng, look. There is a foreigner here.

557
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:14,475
How did he come here?

558
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:18,358
I think the vendor can't communicate with him.

559
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:19,963
Just like me back then.

560
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:23,252
So you made all of these by yourself?

561
00:43:24,544 --> 00:43:28,457
It looks like they cannot communicate.

562
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:33,287
- I should help them.
- Wait, Nueng.

563
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:36,470
Hi. Can I help?

564
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,070
Hi. Thank you.

565
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:46,011
Yeah, I just want to know if he made it by himself.

566
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:49,631
He wants to know if you made it by yourself.

567
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,026
Yes, I made all of these by myself.

568
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:56,758
My family is a jewelry merchant, so I learned from my parents.

569
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:59,026
Yes, he learned it from his family.

570
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:01,129
Wow, that's impressive.

571
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:03,319
I want to buy one, actually.

572
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:06,815
He really likes it. He wants to buy this one.

573
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:11,204
Your English is so good.

574
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:12,491
Thank you.

575
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:15,107
Where did you learn to study like that?

576
00:44:15,107 --> 00:44:17,476
I've been studying ever since I was young.

577
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,041
So you must be from a rich family.

578
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,404
I'm from Kiattrakulmaytee.

579
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,853
So what is it? Is that your name?

580
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:29,781
It's my last name. My name is Nuengdiao.

581
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:31,584
Nuengdia...

582
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:34,519
Nuengdiao.

583
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,773
So, what does it mean?

584
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,798
The one and only.

585
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,307
Such a nice name.

586
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:45,684
Okay.

587
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:49,615
Okay, thank you.

588
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:54,097
Thank you and nice to meet you, the one and only.

589
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:55,991
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

590
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:57,887
Thank you again.

591
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:05,245
Thank you so much. Without you, I wouldn't have been able to sell anything.

592
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,626
It's okay.

593
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:09,266
It's not bad to learn a foreign language.

594
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:12,330
Soon, there will be many foreigners coming here.

595
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,408
What are you talking about?

596
00:45:14,408 --> 00:45:16,412
Where could I learn it from?

597
00:45:16,412 --> 00:45:19,369
Where did you learn the foreigner's language?

598
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:23,019
Has a servant like you ever gone to school?

599
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,801
Lately, there are lots of foreigners coming to the town.

600
00:45:26,801 --> 00:45:29,151
We are worried that they will occupy our country.

601
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:31,017
Where are you from?

602
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,513
Are you a spy?

603
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,595
He learned it from me.

604
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:46,943
At my manor, I allow all my servants to study.

605
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:49,147
I taught them a foreign language.

606
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,850
That's right.

607
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,947
My lord taught me.

608
00:45:56,947 --> 00:46:01,001
He said we would have advantages if we learned it.

609
00:46:04,814 --> 00:46:09,126
All right, sir. You are a visionary.

610
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:17,442
You told me to act properly.

611
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,840
But you are acting as if you were a goodwill ambassador.

612
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,439
Aren't you worried they will get suspicious?

613
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,939
Let's go.

614
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:52,376
I really like it when you speak English.

615
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,638
You look cool and sexy.

616
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:58,785
Anyone can tell that you have studied abroad.

617
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:03,295
The accent cannot tell if the speaker is rich or poor.

618
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,942
It depends on how hard you practice.

619
00:47:04,942 --> 00:47:07,838
When you work at the bar, you should practice a lot.

620
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,590
I've been practicing all the time,

621
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:13,020
but my English is still not that good.

622
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,366
For example,

623
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:19,039
Nuengdiao, you are my only one.

624
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,435
Did you practice that?

625
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:22,862
I took an online undergraduate course for it.

626
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:25,160
I want you to be proud of me.

627
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,543
I don't want you to feel embarrassed because your boyfriend is just a high school graduate.

628
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:31,156
Don't worry. I don't feel embarrassed by it.

629
00:47:31,156 --> 00:47:33,865
But you should learn it for your sake.

630
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:35,968
Don't learn it for me.

631
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:39,177
To be honest, if we were in the present time,

632
00:47:39,177 --> 00:47:43,972
I would shout out to tell everyone that I was proud to have you as my boyfriend.

633
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:47,243
Then do it. I dare you.

634
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:50,218
How could I do that? I'm your servant.

635
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:53,535
If you don't do it, I'll do it.

636
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:55,541
This lord is Nueng's...

637
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,141
Stop it.

638
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:03,301
People in the old days must be weak.

639
00:48:03,301 --> 00:48:06,514
With a light bump, our faces became this close.

640
00:48:06,514 --> 00:48:07,736
Palm.

641
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:09,842
Palm, you cannot do it here.

642
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:12,248
- Is that so?
- Palm.

643
00:48:14,273 --> 00:48:16,253
What are you two doing?

644
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:18,456
You will be struck by thunder.

645
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,120
You.

646
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,436
You are the fortune teller we met that day.

647
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:26,536
You are the one that sent us to this place.

648
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,387
Do you know what we need to do to go back to our world?

649
00:48:29,387 --> 00:48:31,476
Do we need the sun bracelet?

650
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,083
Your world?

651
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,314
The sun bracelet?

652
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:37,593
What are you talking about? I don't know anything about it.

653
00:48:38,425 --> 00:48:41,376
You are the fortune teller that we met.

654
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,873
You told us that we were soulmates.

655
00:48:43,873 --> 00:48:46,416
But we always ended up being apart in every lifetime.

656
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:50,467
We needed to go to where we made a love vow.

657
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:52,521
Where is that place? My boyfriend and I want to go home.

658
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:54,071
Please tell us.

659
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:56,601
Boyfriend?

660
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,773
What does it mean?

661
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:02,269
A boyfriend means a lover; a couple.

662
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,741
The boyfriend that you are talking about, who is it?

663
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:30,804
I don't know how to help you.

664
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:34,496
You are two men dating each other.

665
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:36,702
That's already hard enough.

666
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:40,642
Even though one of you is a nobleman,

667
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:44,942
your love is impossible in this lifetime.

668
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:49,226
You always have to hide your relationship.

669
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:52,349
It's impossible for you to get married and start a family.

670
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:57,600
You need to be reborn.

671
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,970
Things may be better at that time.

672
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:22,304
This is where I woke up.

673
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:25,822
As soon as I opened my eyes, my dad brought me to see you.

674
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,833
Then I started to understand what was going on.

675
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:32,543
I think the sun bracelet must be here somewhere.

676
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:34,363
We should look around to find it.

677
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:45,617
Palm, I can't find it.

678
00:50:46,951 --> 00:50:48,626
Me, too.

679
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:50,725
I'm sure that it must be somewhere here.

680
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:52,929
I woke up here.

681
00:50:56,741 --> 00:51:00,382
If we're stuck here forever, it will be a hard life.

682
00:51:00,382 --> 00:51:04,022
When I was a boss and you were the servant, it was very hard for us to be together.

683
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:08,442
Now you are a lord while I'm a slave, this will be two times harder.

684
00:51:09,592 --> 00:51:13,341
Love between men is forbidden in this era.

685
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,925
Although you are a lord and have power,

686
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:20,391
we can't compete with the conservatives who are ruling this country.

687
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:28,001
Nueng, listen to me.

688
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,886
At that time, I was doing everything so we could be together.

689
00:51:32,886 --> 00:51:36,080
No matter how long we are stuck in this world,

690
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,596
I'll do everything so that we can be together.

691
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:46,598
I was shot before. I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

692
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,700
That eases my longing for you.

693
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:42,054
Palm, I have something to tell you.

694
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:44,497
What is it?

695
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:47,157
I don't think there could be anything worse than this.

696
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,820
I... I've decided...

697
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:57,643
to study for a master's degree in the US.

698
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:07,645
When did you plan to tell me?

699
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:11,641
I was trying to find the right time to tell you.

700
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:16,174
Do you think this is the right time?

701
00:53:16,174 --> 00:53:20,089
You told me after kissing in an ancient time?

702
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:21,489
I...

703
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:28,108
I was thinking about it for some time.

704
00:53:28,962 --> 00:53:31,412
There are many things that I want to learn.

705
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:35,210
When I saw that you moved to work in Bangkok

706
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,467
and took courses while waiting for me,

707
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:40,036
I felt guilty to ask you to wait for me.

708
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:46,056
You should have told me sooner, so I could have planned my life differently.

709
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,410
I told you that you should plan your life for yourself,

710
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,400
not for me.

711
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:55,463
Am I wrong that I love you more?

712
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:59,154
Palm, it's not about who loves who more.

713
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,763
This is my future.

714
00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:05,168
I don't want our love to be an obstacle to our future.

715
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,800
I get it.

716
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,960
Just like in our early days,

717
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,700
I was not in your plan.

718
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:15,443
Do whatever you want.

719
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:18,405
Palm, it's not like that.

720
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:21,260
Didn't you say you would always wait for me

721
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,050
while I went after whatever dream I had?

722
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:26,939
Did you forget that?

723
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:30,508
Maybe what the fortune teller said is true.

724
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:36,096
Whether it's this or any other lifetime, we will never be together.

725
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,429
Palm.

726
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:42,676
Palm.

727
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:07,688
I know that you are the one who loves and cherishes me the most.

728
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:11,060
I want you to live the life that you want.

729
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:16,540
The life that I want is a life that has you.

730
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,340
Nueng.

731
00:55:32,604 --> 00:55:34,103
Hey! Stop it!

732
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:35,895
Petch, stop it!

733
00:55:35,895 --> 00:55:38,080
What are you doing?

734
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,110
Why are you whipping Nueng?

735
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:43,684
I think he's a wizard.

736
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:47,610
He probably cast a love spell on you.

737
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,663
What are you talking about?

738
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:51,846
You've changed so drastically.

739
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:54,320
You became very nice to the servants.

740
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,160
You are acting as if you have known him for years.

741
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,480
There is no way that the Lord Poramet I know

742
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,730
would hang out with him.

743
00:56:03,737 --> 00:56:06,003
What's wrong if I act nicely to the servants?

744
00:56:06,003 --> 00:56:09,501
Every servant should be treated equally.

745
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:13,382
But I saw him talk to a foreigner today.

746
00:56:13,382 --> 00:56:15,161
Maybe he is a traitor.

747
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:17,479
I taught him that.

748
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:19,790
I want him to have an education.

749
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,942
So he can be proud of himself.

750
00:56:21,942 --> 00:56:24,940
He doesn't have to be a servant anymore.

751
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,945
Nueng,

752
00:56:27,945 --> 00:56:30,265
from now on, you will be sleeping in my quarters.

753
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:35,054
You will become my new close servant, instead of Petch.

754
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:40,667
What are you waiting for? Untie Nueng.

755
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:55,591
Easy.

756
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,008
Nueng, how are you feeling?

757
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,013
It's bearable.

758
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:06,302
Luckily, you came to help me in time.

759
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:09,749
I told you Petch was looking for a chance to mess with me.

760
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,390
Don't worry, Nueng.

761
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,920
I will never let anyone hurt you again.

762
00:57:14,926 --> 00:57:19,824
I will use my power to protect you.

763
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:22,368
Do you think it's okay to do this?

764
00:57:22,368 --> 00:57:24,845
Won't the servants get suspicious about us?

765
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:27,572
Don't pay attention to them.

766
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:29,590
The most important thing

767
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:34,250
is we need to stay safe to go back to our world.

768
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,372
Palm, I'm sorry that I just told you about my master's degree plan.

769
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,423
It's okay.

770
00:57:50,423 --> 00:57:52,388
I understand.

771
00:57:52,388 --> 00:57:54,764
Your future is more important.

772
00:57:55,881 --> 00:57:57,520
It's not like that.

773
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,100
Our future is also important.

774
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:06,285
I'll try to make it work.

775
00:58:06,285 --> 00:58:11,921
But real lives are usually not as beautiful as we had imagined.

776
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:16,750
Then we both need to work hard to make it work,

777
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,200
whether it's this or any other lifetime.

778
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,744
We are still stuck in the past.

779
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:56,927
I need to help you become beloved by others.

780
00:58:56,927 --> 00:59:01,909
From now on, I assign Nueng to teach all the servants in this manor how to read.

781
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:06,990
Whether it's this or any other lifetime, I will always want to be with you.

782
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,833
I saw you kiss the Lord under the tree.

783
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:12,160
I have a plan. We need to risk our lives.

784
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,741
What plan?

785
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:20,700
♫ How many more winters will there be? ♫

786
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:25,230
♫ Among the stars shining in the sky ♫

787
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:34,630
♫ The love I gave you will never fade away ♫

788
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:39,050
♫ No matter how long ♫

789
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:45,260
♫ You will still have me the one who loves you with all his heart ♫

790
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,060
♫ An unfamiliar person ♫

791
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:53,940
♫ become a person of the heart ♫

792
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,240
♫ From this moment ♫

793
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:02,630
♫ I want you to know... ♫

794
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:08,650
♫ How many more winters are there? ♫

795
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:13,130
♫ Among the stars shining in the sky ♫

796
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:20,890
♫ The love I gave you will never fade away ♫

797
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,960
♫ No matter how long ♫

798
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:34,460
♫ You will still have me the one who loves you with all his heart ♫
