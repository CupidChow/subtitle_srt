00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:06,245
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,155
I didn't want you to leave your work for my birthday dinner,

3
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,860
but have you noticed that we haven't talked much recently?

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,528
I'll find an excuse to change a typical day to our special day.

5
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:25,285
- What's this?
- Our month's calendar.

6
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:32,725
Do you know why I'm giving you a watch fob?

7
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,541
It's because I want us to spend more time together from now.

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,779
Thank you for joining me in doing this crazy stuff.

9
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:44,248
Papa.

10
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:47,256
It's not that we haven't raised any kids before,

11
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,740
but how can we find time for him?

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,284
We'll manage to find time for him.

13
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:56,623
I don't want him to feel that he's left alone.

14
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,025
You know what I mean, don't you?

15
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,625
Yeah.

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,800
Can I please get a plane?

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,141
Please.

18
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:12,481
All right.

19
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,822
You deserve a rocket.

20
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:24,003
You're spoiling me so much.

21
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:27,013
I guess it's snowing in this universe.

22
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,620
Papa Talay is so kind.

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,070
I should give him a reward.

24
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,922
No. There's a kid here.

25
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,891
- He won't see us.
- Don't!

26
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,960
Papa!

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,002
Yes?

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,604
Papa!

29
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:53,980
Yes, Jigsaw?

30
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,205
Wow.

31
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,820
What are you drawing?

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,982
Look.

33
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:03,454
- Wow. What is that?
- What is this?

34
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:08,424
It has whiskers and ears like a cat. Is it a cat?

35
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:12,235
But it doesn't really look like a cat to me.

36
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,335
Do you want to know what a cat looks like?

37
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,071
Here it is.

38
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,530
Puen!

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,091
What the hell are you doing? Why did you paint my face?

40
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,573
To show Jigsaw what a cat looks like.

41
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:26,686
Does he look like a cat?

42
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,374
Meow.

43
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:29,877
Meow.

44
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,733
Meow.

45
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,108
- Yes, meow.
- Meow.

46
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,868
You drew its nose like a pig's.

47
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:41,252
Do you know what a pig looks like?

48
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,642
Hold this.

49
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:48,859
One, two, three, go!

50
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,486
I'm scared now! I surrender!

51
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:53,842
Come on, Jigsaw!

52
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,081
I surrender!

53
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,839
Puen!

54
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:02,080
Do it, Jigsaw. Paint more!

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,403
Let go of me, Talay!

56
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:05,022
More!

57
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,422
- I surrender!
- More!

58
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,504
Come on, paint more!

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,700
"Regret" - 5 U

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,280
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,790
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

62
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,050
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

63
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,360
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,730
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

65
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,870
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,430
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

67
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,000
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,580
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

69
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,420
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

70
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,030
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

71
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,890
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

72
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,830
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

73
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:30,540
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy2]

74
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:45,784
How did you end up painting your body all over?

75
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,128
You could get rashes.

76
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:51,183
You're worried about Jigsaw getting rashes all over his body,

77
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:53,886
but not me getting acne on my face?

78
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:58,087
Puen! Where are you?

79
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm in the bathroom.

80
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,584
Whoa. What a happy family.

81
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,731
What happened to your faces?

82
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,584
Ask your best friend here.

83
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,440
Anyway, it's good you guys are here.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,601
Can you help Jigsaw get dressed? He just got out of the shower.

85
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,980
- Okay.
- Let's go, Jigsaw.

86
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,027
Come on.

87
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,704
- You can take a shower first.
- Wait.

88
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,311
It's your turn to bathe me now.

89
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,099
Don't even try to get yourself out of this.

90
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,810
My face is a mess because of you.

91
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,960
Yes, sir.

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,460
It's cute when Jigsaw pleads,

93
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,170
but when you do...

94
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,360
Why? What about me?

95
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,060
It's exasperating.

96
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,998
Come here.

97
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:33,267
Let me wash your face in return.

98
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:48,420
Taking turns is good, isn't it?

99
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,373
You wash my face. I wash yours.

100
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:53,592
If we wash our own face, it might not be clean enough.

101
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:56,470
We could get acne. Don't you think?

102
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:01,773
Or should I leave it like this?

103
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:05,074
You look cute with the whiskers.

104
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,974
I also look cute without the whiskers.

105
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:19,412
Oh, but I don't think I can wash that redness off your face now.

106
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:28,725
I should thank Jigsaw for giving us a chance to spend time together

107
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,166
even after our mission is complete.

108
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,251
You'll be thanking him for a long time.

109
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,074
Two teaspoons.

110
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:44,617
How many?

111
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:46,417
180.

112
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,182
Jigsaw can drink this.

113
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,723
Puen!

114
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:07,772
This one?

115
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:09,472
Okay.

116
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,066
Hey.

117
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,559
I'll start looking for you now.

118
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:29,575
- Hey, Puen.
- Hmm?

119
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,389
Have you seen Jigsaw?

120
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,358
No.

121
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,358
Jigsaw.

122
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:54,596
Jigsaw!

123
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:59,360
Papa, let's play!

124
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:12,303
Is it out yet?

125
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,851
Push.

126
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,064
- Is it out?
- It's out.

127
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:48,209
High five.

128
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,440
I should really thank Jigsaw

129
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,980
for giving Puen and me another chance to share the same goal,

130
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:19,720
which is to make this unfamiliar kid

131
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,820
the happiest to be with us.

132
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:27,157
May you fall in love with me.

133
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:36,067
- Puen.
- Hmm?

134
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:41,345
Do you think Jigsaw has more dolls now than his first day?

135
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:43,772
I don't think so.

136
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:47,515
I've never seen that shark.

137
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,264
Jigsaw.

138
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,903
Where did you get that shark?

139
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,272
Whoa. This room is full of animals.

140
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:10,465
Do you want to go to the zoo tomorrow, Jigsaw?

141
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,478
- Do you want to go?
- Yes.

142
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,997
Yay!

143
00:12:14,997 --> 00:12:18,082
- We're going to the zoo.
- Wait.

144
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,386
I have to submit my work tomorrow.

145
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,675
But it's okay.

146
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,001
I can reschedule.

147
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,706
Yay!

148
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,995
Let's fly!

149
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,003
What do you want to see tomorrow?

150
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,787
- What do you want to see tomorrow?
- Giraffes.

151
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:41,416
Giraffes? You want to see the giraffes?

152
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,955
What do giraffes look like?

153
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,320
What else do you want to see? Birds?

154
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,340
Let's fly. Woo!

155
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:54,076
How do birds fly?

156
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:00,236
- Hat?
- Ready.

157
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,831
- Binoculars?
- Ready.

158
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,776
- Drink?
- Ready.

159
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,767
If we're ready...

160
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:09,538
Let's go!

161
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:11,826
Go!

162
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,953
Careful.

163
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,068
Hippo!

164
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,490
Wait for it to open its mouth.

165
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,119
Go.

166
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,119
Throw it over.

167
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,897
Hippo.

168
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,490
It's your turn to rest.

169
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,820
- That one?
- Pork leg.

170
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,930
Whoa. Pork leg?

171
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,360
One, two, three.

172
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:33,452
You should take a break.

173
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,638
Now I feel refreshed.

174
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:53,800
Can you hold this and watch Jigsaw?

175
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,639
Hello.

176
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:02,917
Do you like it?

177
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,270
Puen.

178
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:12,657
Can you hold this for a second?

179
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:14,723
Thank you.

180
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,409
Hello.

181
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:22,283
I don't think I can. I'm outside.

182
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,500
I'll hurry back and finish it.

183
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,890
I think I can get it done this evening.

184
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:35,983
My house is next to a forest.

185
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:41,375
I'll submit it as soon as I can.

186
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,378
I'll call you back in a minute.

187
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,399
Okay. Bye.

188
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:52,500
Shit.

189
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,587
Where's Jigsaw?

190
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,912
I want to ask you the same thing.

191
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,687
- Jigsaw!
- Jigsaw!

192
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:00,041
Jigsaw!

193
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,641
Jigsaw!

194
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,385
Jigsaw!

195
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:06,748
Jigsaw!

196
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,625
What are you guys looking for?

197
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,225
Jigsaw!

198
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,731
Are you all right?

199
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,944
Do you have bruises anywhere?

200
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,841
What brings you guys here?

201
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:31,541
We saw your stories, so we followed.

202
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,949
When we arrived, we saw your kid feeding a monkey over there.

203
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,387
He probably found a friend.

204
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,315
It's my fault.

205
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:42,801
I'm sorry, Jigsaw.

206
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,401
Jigsaw.

207
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,281
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:11,640
If next time all I do is work, you can tell me off,

209
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,960
but please don't disappear like that again.

210
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,509
Okay.

211
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,940
Let's go poopoo.

212
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:32,486
How did Jigsaw end up with you guys at the zoo?

213
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,410
Their two papas were busy talking on their phones.

214
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,605
When he saw us, we quickly ran to him.

215
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,220
We didn't know what to do.

216
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,550
We were afraid the truth would come out.

217
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,387
I think we should end this plan.

218
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:55,416
You must've been missing Jigsaw badly, right, Tup?

219
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:02,880
I'm scared my sister will scold me for doing this to her kid.

220
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,800
I'll come to see you every day, Jigsaw.

221
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,570
Don't be afraid.

222
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,397
If we come every day, they'll become suspicious.

223
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:12,815
Listen to Uncle Two, Jigsaw.

224
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:15,288
You're the hero of this game.

225
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:21,621
If you do as I say, I'll bring you a doll every day. Okay?

226
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,631
But first, tell me what you have to call the owners of this house.

227
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:28,587
- Papa.
- That's correct. It's yours.

228
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:29,776
Hey.

229
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,802
- Now?
- Yes.

230
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:32,612
Let's go.

231
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,363
That's right, Jigsaw. Yes.

232
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,946
Let's go.

233
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:46,863
Papa.

234
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:52,019
Thank you so much for bringing Jigsaw to us that night.

235
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,063
It seems you guys are happy and things are going well.

236
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,810
But I feel guilty about doing this to Talay.

237
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,735
It's like I'm lying to him.

238
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:10,935
I'll report this to the police.

239
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,808
You two stay and work with Talay here.

240
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:16,933
I think you can't handle that alone.

241
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:20,128
Let Tup go with you, in case the kid gets naughty.

242
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,277
That sounds good.

243
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:25,156
Go.

244
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,329
Puen.

245
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:39,350
Jigsaw is my nephew.

246
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,850
What?

247
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,793
Please listen to my reason first.

248
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:45,407
Two saw that you guys have been fighting lately,

249
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:49,321
so he begged me to send my nephew to be the glue.

250
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:53,031
Have you lost your mind?

251
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:55,359
Keep it down.

252
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:01,084
You should've told us you wanted us to raise your nephew.

253
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,930
What you did confused us.

254
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,730
Two said the plan would work.

255
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,670
Anyway, it's good you guys are here.

256
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,717
- Can you help Jigsaw get dressed?
- Let's go, Jigsaw.

257
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,638
Come on.

258
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,661
I want to go home already.

259
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:27,501
You want to go home?

260
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,153
Do you still want to go home now?

261
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,712
Do you?

262
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:34,852
- Not anymore.
- Not anymore.

263
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:46,234
This dog is going to bite you now.

264
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:58,610
Besides, I'm sure you guys can see that Talay loves Jigsaw very much.

265
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,041
I don't want them to bond even more.

266
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,740
I don't want to play with his heart anymore.

267
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,226
Jigsaw!

268
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,510
Why are you like this?

269
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,847
I've been kind to you and you don't care about my feelings.

270
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:28,144
Why are you so naughty?

271
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:32,099
I've been exhausted enough today, Jigsaw.

272
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,502
What's wrong? What happened?

273
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:40,184
Jigsaw saw the fish sticker on my hard disk and he floated it on the water.

274
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:43,356
Fish belong in the water!

275
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:50,419
I've been working on this task for a week and I have to submit it today.

276
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,716
You give me so many headaches.

277
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:54,869
- Should I beat you and make you learn?
- Hey.

278
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:56,966
That's enough.

279
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,867
- Guys, please take care of Jigsaw.
- Okay.

280
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,807
You come and talk to me outside.

281
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:03,644
Come on. Come on!

282
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,492
Jigsaw.

283
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:16,325
It's okay.

284
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:19,225
You're right that fish belong in the water.

285
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,842
Talay.

286
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,550
I'm not going to scold you,

287
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,621
but you didn't have to scold Jigsaw like that.

288
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:40,597
Jigsaw won't listen to me.

289
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:43,730
He disappeared at the zoo today

290
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,080
and also broke my stuff.

291
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:50,525
I'm not even talking about the headaches I get every day.

292
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,350
Raising a kid...

293
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,450
is not easy at all.

294
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:04,501
Do you know that you're very stressed out right now?

295
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:08,962
I understand that you have to work hard and also raise a kid.

296
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:11,354
It's not easy.

297
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:14,321
But don't forget that you still have me.

298
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:17,103
You can share your problems with me.

299
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:26,250
I'll take this hard disk to a repair shop tomorrow

300
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,940
and see if they can fix it or recover any files.

301
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,670
If it can't be fixed,

302
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,150
even though I can't help you with your work,

303
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,083
I'll stay with you while you redo it from start to finish. Okay?

304
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,059
Thank you.

305
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:55,130
You're right that I've been too stressed out.

306
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,360
No worries.

307
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:01,110
If we help each other figure out a solution to this problem,

308
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,220
everything will get better.

309
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,799
Let's go back to Jigsaw.

310
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:41,938
Talay.

311
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,431
Talay.

312
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:56,911
Where has he gone so early in the morning?

313
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,864
Jigsaw.

314
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,093
Jigsaw, dear.

315
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,221
Jigsaw.

316
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,743
Hello, Tup.

317
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:35,763
Get yourself and Two to my house as soon as possible.

318
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:39,346
Puen, what happened?

319
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:42,778
- Tup said there's an emergency.
- Yeah, what happened?

320
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:45,329
Talay and Jigsaw are missing.

321
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:47,246
I woke up this morning and saw no one.

322
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:52,144
All Jigsaw's things are gone. And Talay won't pick up my calls.

323
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:53,848
Let me call him, too.

324
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:55,843
Yes, call him.

325
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:11,461
Hey, Tup, Two. What are you guys doing here so early?

326
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:15,632
Where have you been since morning? I've been calling you, but you wouldn't pick up.

327
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:17,732
Is Jigsaw with you?

328
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:21,103
I took Jigsaw out.

329
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,543
Out? But why didn't you bring him back?

330
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,606
We talked about finding a solution.

331
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:34,220
I think this is the best solution.

332
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,589
You and I are really not ready to raise a kid.

333
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:41,346
I took him to a children's home.

334
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:43,246
A children's home?

335
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,789
Talay.

336
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,528
You're kidding, right?

337
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:49,771
That's not you.

338
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:52,387
I'm serious.

339
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:55,525
What happened yesterday made me realize a lot of things.

340
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,332
If Jigsaw disappeared again and ran into someone else other than you guys,

341
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:03,266
imagine how bad things would be.

342
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:06,571
I think this is for the best.

343
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,020
If his family reaches out,

344
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,909
we can tell them to pick him up there.

345
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:19,957
Then tell me where my nephew is right now, so I can pick him up.

346
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:21,742
- What do you mean?
- Don't be confused yet.

347
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,529
Just tell me where my nephew is.

348
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:25,221
What is there to be confused about?

349
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:28,491
It means Jigsaw is Tup's nephew.

350
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:30,567
We brought him here for you to raise.

351
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:34,052
Hurry up and tell me where you left Jigsaw,so I can pick him up.

352
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,835
- Come on!
- Come on, Talay!

353
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm afraid it's too late.

354
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:42,607
What do you mean it's too late?

355
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,598
Where did you take the kid?

356
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:48,018
- Khon Kaen.
- Khon Kaen?

357
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:49,394
Yes.

358
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:52,030
Jigsaw told me he liked dinosaurs,

359
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,720
so I took him there.

360
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:57,605
You idiot. Why did you take him to Khon Kaen?

361
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:00,285
There are no dinosaurs to see there now.

362
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:02,077
What a jerk.

363
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,785
Calm down, Tup. I think we can still make it there in time.

364
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,337
Let's go.

365
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:07,765
Come with us.

366
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,215
Walk. You're too slow.

367
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:13,644
Are we all here?

368
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:15,366
Let's confirm one by one.

369
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:16,512
- Two.
- Tup.

370
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,901
- Puen.
- Talay.

371
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,088
Jigsaw.

372
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:20,888
What?

373
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,705
What the hell are you doing?

374
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:39,771
How dare you leave a small child at another person's house?

375
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:44,425
Did you ever think what would happen to Jigsaw if Puen and I weren't kind?

376
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:47,881
He's right.

377
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,104
You're lucky it's us.

378
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,773
You're just as bad.

379
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,108
I know that you knew everything.

380
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:04,388
When did you find out, Talay?

381
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:06,351
We had no idea.

382
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,313
I wonder the same thing.

383
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,081
Close the door, Papa.

384
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:16,892
Okay.

385
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:18,349
You can poo poo, right?

386
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:19,705
I can.

387
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:23,459
Okay. I'll be right back.

388
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:27,049
How did Jigsaw end up with you guys at the zoo?

389
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,429
Their two papas were busy talking on their phones.

390
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:34,339
When he saw us, we quickly ran to him.

391
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,136
We didn't know what to do. We were afraid the truth would come out.

392
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:39,160
I think we should end this plan.

393
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,558
You must've been missing Jigsaw badly, right, Tup?

394
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:45,082
Yeah.

395
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:50,378
I'm scared my sister will scold me for doing this to her kid.

396
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:51,771
I'm done.

397
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:53,965
All right. I'm coming.

398
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,720
You've finished poo-pooing, right?

399
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,226
We're on the same team now.

400
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:04,594
If you do as I say, I'll give you a doll as big as this.

401
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,909
I'll give you a giraffe. Okay?

402
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,170
Let's do it.

403
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,020
One, two, three.

404
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Jigsaw!

405
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:20,165
Again.

406
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:35,937
Come, let me kiss you.

407
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,467
Bye-bye, Papa.

408
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:40,666
Bye.

409
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:43,355
Won't you say goodbye to your other Papa?

410
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:51,270
You should eat more.

411
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,151
You've never beaten me at eating.

412
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,066
Okay.

413
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,865
If you miss me, please come visit.

414
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:01,856
- Ask Uncle Tup to bring you here. Okay?
- Okay.

415
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,809
Bye-bye.

416
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:07,494
Let's go, Jigsaw.

417
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:09,147
Uncle Two can't carry it any longer.

418
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:10,989
It's heavy.

419
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,999
Bye, guys.

420
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,896
What a gift.

421
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:18,216
How am I going to put this in the car?

422
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,110
Thanks.

423
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:51,668
I'm so tired.

424
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,932
It's because you were in on it with them.

425
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:22,067
Wasn't it a good thing?

426
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,629
Do you remember the first day Jigsaw came to our house?

427
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,601
We were discussing what to do after our love mission.

428
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:44,580
Ever since Jigsaw had been here with us,

429
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,186
it turned out there were things we got to do together almost every day.

430
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:54,017
Jigsaw also taught us.

431
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,980
Look at this drawing.

432
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,830
Even though there's only a little pink,

433
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,130
Jigsaw completed his drawing with other colors,

434
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,412
just like our story.

435
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:12,700
We might focus less on our love one day,

436
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,180
but I'll still understand you, care for you,

437
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,770
and want the best for you.

438
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:26,525
Are you trying to say...

439
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:31,232
that one day we'll love each other less?

440
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:34,013
No, that's not what I mean.

441
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,645
I'm saying,

442
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:40,345
even if one day you have to devote yourself to what's really important to your life,

443
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:42,339
rather than spend your time thinking about me,

444
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:46,669
I'll understand and give you my full support.

445
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,757
Speaking of the day Jigsaw came,

446
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:06,750
I actually...

447
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,590
wasn't done with my surprise plan yet,

448
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:13,355
but it started raining.

449
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:20,513
Let me do it today instead.

450
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:27,143
Close your eyes.

451
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,005
Close your eyes.

452
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:46,181
Puen.

453
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,560
I will take us back to where we were.

454
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,861
Stop.

455
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:15,109
Don't open your eyes yet. Sit down.

456
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:16,944
Don't open your eyes yet.

457
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,061
What are you doing?

458
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,621
Trust me.

459
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:31,599
Don't open your eyes yet. Give me 10 seconds.

460
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,686
10, 9, 8,

461
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:41,686
7, 6, 5,

462
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:46,813
4, 3, 2, 1.

463
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:06,754
♫ The day I said "I love you," I realized everything ♫

464
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:12,457
♫ I realized the true feelings in my heart ♫

465
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:20,355
♫ I will stand by you, now is the start ♫

466
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,169
♫ And we'll never be apart ♫

467
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,891
♫ It's a miracle that we met ♫

468
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:40,292
♫ It's a miracle that I love you ♫

469
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:47,299
♫ It's the greatest miracle I've ever witnessed ♫

470
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:59,074
♫ Oh, you are the miracle ♫

471
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,093
That's not me.

472
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:23,061
I told you.

473
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:26,747
Where there's Puen, there's Talay.

474
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:32,493
See?

475
00:37:32,493 --> 00:37:35,470
I brought you back to the first day we met.

476
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:43,131
Do you remember the night I sang you that song?

477
00:37:46,328 --> 00:37:48,763
I'm glad it's you.

478
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,836
Let's celebrate then.

479
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,064
To our universe-traveling friendship.

480
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,219
Drink!

481
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,426
Cheers.

482
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,944
To our universe-traveling friendship.

483
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:06,421
No.

484
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:10,941
I guess you really don't remember.

485
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:16,913
That means we're not really back to our first day.

486
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:21,652
Since the mission is not complete,

487
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:25,230
we probably can't go home.

488
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:28,596
What now?

489
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,298
If you want the color pink,

490
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:34,669
it'll be difficult to get because I didn't bring it.

491
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:39,773
If I call Tup or Two, they'll probably be confused.

492
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,868
But...

493
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:52,245
if I kiss you, will we be able to go back to our universe?

494
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:58,875
Can we go back if we kiss?

495
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,500
What?

496
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,107
It doesn't work.

497
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:07,386
Let me try again.

498
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,540
(I love you.)

499
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,204
Looking for music contests?

500
00:40:46,204 --> 00:40:49,140
Want some help from the school president?

501
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,829
Time and reality are more than just straight lines,

502
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:56,261
but a multiverse of endless possibilities.

503
00:40:56,261 --> 00:41:00,401
Everything we choose may branch out into unrestricted truths

504
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:04,200
and turn into a parallel universe, different from the one we know.

505
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,040
♫ Thinking about and reviewing our story ♫

506
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,510
♫ Has the color of our love faded? ♫

507
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,470
♫ Has it faded away with time? ♫

508
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,870
♫ I just want to know ♫

509
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,160
♫ Please help make me confident ♫

510
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,040
♫ How many times have we been through this? ♫

511
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,600
♫ I don't want to confuse you ♫

512
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,290
♫ Our love has never faded like our love from yesterday ♫

513
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,480
♫ And know the one thing in my heart ♫

514
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,130
♫ Baby, you know how much I love you ♫

515
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:51,620
♫ Maybe it seems like I don't really care ♫

516
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,470
♫ Before you think of leaving, I don't want you to think too much ♫

517
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,570
♫ A love that is no less than yours ♫

518
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,150
♫ I want to know how much you love me ♫

519
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,860
♫ Is it more than the stars in the sky
or more than the number of grains of sand? ♫

520
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,100
♫ Don't leave me in doubt ♫

521
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,720
♫ Let's summarize what you think ♫

522
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,050
♫ The love that is no less than yours ♫

523
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,840
♫ watch who is more crazy about love ♫
