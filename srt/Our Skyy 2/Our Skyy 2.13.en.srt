1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,895
This guy with the fierce eyes is Pat.

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:05,723
He was born to be my rival.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,731
This guy with the dimples is Pran.

4
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:12,469
I was forbidden from being friends with him.

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,058
True, but we weren't exactly obedient kids.

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,891
Unknowingly, from two people who couldn't be friends,

7
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:24,074
we became two people who were more than friends.

8
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:30,193
Our relationship made some people feel troubled.

9
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,046
So this is what we decided on.

10
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:35,276
We broke up.

11
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:36,636
Pat and I broke up.

12
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,510
We were back to being enemies.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,730
At the end of the day, we were back to being lovers.

14
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,560
It's like we were living double lives.

15
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,440
We might not be able to change the world.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,562
All we could do was adjust to it and live happily.

17
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:01,040
We might not be able to change people around us

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,440
but they couldn't change us either.

19
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:23,469
I thought the Engineering guys would be scared to come.

20
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,511
We would say the same about Architecture.

21
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,340
Only a few of you came.

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,080
Can you guys really handle it?

23
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:34,255
Are you guys sure about coming empty-handed?

24
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,599
Hey. Show them how it's done.

25
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,970
That's all?

26
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:53,598
No.

27
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,431
Why don't you come and help me?

28
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,060
Come on.

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,191
Grab one each.

30
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,334
I want that one.

31
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,261
- Let's help each other.
- Let me have this one.

32
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,697
- Come on.
- All hands on deck.

33
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:09,217
- Can I use that one instead?
- No.

34
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,921
[Engineering Sweeps, Architecture Mops Project]
[All hands on deck to make the school pleasant]

35
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:13,871
On the count of one hundred, smile.

36
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,348
- Just kidding.
- Counting to three is enough.

37
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,856
One, two, three. Smile.

38
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:20,332
Nice. One more.

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,020
All right.

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,644
- Are we done?
- Yes.

41
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,480
What the hell are you guys waiting for? Get back to sweeping.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,580
- No slacking off or I'll kick you.
- Don't slack off.

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,170
- Why so strict?
- Who's strict?

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,956
Hey.

45
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:42,155
I didn't expect to see this day.

46
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,877
Two years ago, you were still running to beat me up.

47
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:52,610
We have to thank Pat and Pran, our class presidents,

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,770
for...

49
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:57,507
for banning the old way of thinking.

50
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:02,168
Otherwise, you and I would still be killing each other today.

51
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:04,220
- I love you, man.
- Amen.

52
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,863
It's sad though.

53
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:09,351
They shouldn't have broken up.

54
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,730
Did they?

55
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,650
I still catch them talking sometimes.

56
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,653
Maybe they're hooking up in secret.

57
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:19,038
- What do you think?
- Really?

58
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:20,293
Yes.

59
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,714
- I see them talk so often.
- Nonsense.

60
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,691
You know their families hate each other.

61
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,294
- Yeah.
- True.

62
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:27,270
What do you want?

63
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,880
Do they have to beat each other to death before you believe they broke up?

64
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:34,168
Guys.

65
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:37,001
Shit is going down. The class presidents are having a face-off.

66
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,837
- What?
- Where?

67
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:39,968
The auditorium.

68
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:44,391
- Let's go.
- Take this.

69
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,234
Get out.

70
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:48,555
No, you get out. I came here before you.

71
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:51,288
I booked this place with the Student Association before you.

72
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:55,494
Are you guys also fighting over who gets to clean?

73
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:56,893
No.

74
00:03:56,893 --> 00:04:00,530
The Architecture guys stole the auditorium for their play.

75
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,315
How could you?

76
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:06,115
Engineering also has to produce a play this year.

77
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:07,246
Stop it.

78
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,113
This is the common auditorium.

79
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:11,318
Who books it first gets to use it first.

80
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,938
That's the problem.

81
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:15,060
The Student Association double-booked it

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,670
and they won't help us settle this. They're letting us fight it out ourselves.

83
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:22,643
Why don't you guys reschedule for another week?

84
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,570
You will have more time to plan.

85
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:32,542
Korn, the next problem is the auditorium is about to close for a long renovation.

86
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:40,409
So only one faculty gets to produce a play?

87
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:56,441
Settle this with me backstage so there's no collateral damage to the others.

88
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:06,467
Hey, Pran.

89
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,367
Wait here.

90
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,350
Please let me have it.

91
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,760
If I fail, the guys in my faculty will scold me.

92
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,340
Whoa, that looks intense.

93
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,060
I've been producing plays for many years.

94
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,420
This is only your first year of doing it.

95
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,037
You need to back out.

96
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,771
- What's wrong?
- Something got into my eye.

97
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:47,759
Let me see.

98
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,200
Whoa. Pat started it?

99
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,360
There's nothing.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,483
Do you think those eyes will make me give in, Dimples?

101
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,415
So will you give in?

102
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,259
Fine. You win.

103
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,191
I'll tell my faculty friends to do a concert instead.

104
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:20,541
You're the best.

105
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,628
Oh my god. They're killing each other.

106
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,787
Really?

107
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:28,258
More like they're being lovey-dovey. Look.

108
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:33,150
How is that lovey-dovey? They're about to beat each other. Look.

109
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,461
I love you, but not now.

110
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:49,367
I will never give in!

111
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:54,274
Calm down.

112
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,939
Hey! Calm down!

113
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,490
- Stop it, Pran.
- Calm down!

♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,170

♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

121
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,750
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

122
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:44,380
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

126

♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

Hey. Be gentle.

129
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:20,705
I haven't even used any energy.

130
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,620
Damn.

131
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,300
We've been fighting for three years.

132
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,673
How could we screw up?

133
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:32,668
I signaled you to punch on the left, but you punched on the right.

134
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:37,948
I did that on purpose because it wasn't the time to be lovey-dovey.

135
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,939
Can we be lovey-dovey now?

136
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,240
Not yet.

137
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm not in the mood.

138
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:47,760
Of course not.

139
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,280
You take me for granted.

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,610
I wanted to kiss my boyfriend's cheek, but he punched me.

141
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,670
What's this?

142
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,560
Are you being dramatic to make me give in?

143
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,949
Is it working?

144
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:02,549
No.

145
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,916
Fine.

146
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,588
Happy now?

147
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:25,188
Not yet.

Three years later, Pa's timing is still the worst.

150
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:51,556
I ruined your moment again, didn't I?

151
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,244
I'm glad you're aware.

152
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,538
Sorry, bro.

153
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,982
Pran!

154
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,254
Pran!

155
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:09,340
Ink, I want to eat shrimp.

156
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,265
Just a moment. I'm about to peel it for you.

157
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,854
Just a moment.

158
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,105
So good.

159
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:34,150
Phi Pran, Nong Pat wants to eat shrimp.

160
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,110
Sure, Nong Pat. How many do you want?

161
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,318
I can give you all.

162
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:44,487
But if you eat them, you must let me have the auditorium.

163
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:48,612
I want to, Phi Pran,

164
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:51,920
but you guys beat us up in front of my faculty friends.

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,673
My faculty friends are furious.

166
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,700
I'll be damned to give in after you did that to us.

167
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:01,431
You're still fighting over the auditorium?

168
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:05,032
We may no longer be enemies, but this is about dignity.

169
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,128
We stand on our dignity.

170
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:10,069
Men are so boring.

171
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,669
Just eat.

172
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:15,606
Why don't you find a mediator to help you decide?

173
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,984
The Student Association told us to settle it between ourselves.

174
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:21,660
Then find someone else accepted by both faculties.

175
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,977
Let that person decide.

176
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:26,995
That way, you won't lose face as class presidents.

177
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,520
Someone accepted by both faculties?

178
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,591
You're the one we could think of.

179
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:43,270
Damn. So you guys are basically throwing a hot potato at me.

180
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,470
Come on. Please help us.

181
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,780
We really can't think of any other way to settle it.

182
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,774
Professor,

183
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:53,610
please decide who'll get to produce a play

184
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,930
so we can end the fight already.

185
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:04,042
Okay. I will decide for you.

186
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:09,754
- Please.
- But I will decide based on your performance.

187
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:13,252
The faculty that's more prepared gets the auditorium.

188
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:18,153
What? That means we have to compete with each other again.

189
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:22,511
If you want me to decide, you play by my rules.

190
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:27,069
How about this? Present your work to me in one week.

191
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,032
Good luck.

192
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,640
There, there.

193
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:44,300
Do I have to compete with you forever?

194
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,370
Come on. Just do your best

195
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,890
so that when you lose, people won't question it.

196
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:57,394
What do you think are the Professor's criteria?

197
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,443
Many things.

198
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:03,797
For example, my screenplay is ready. All the cuts.

199
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,268
Mine is ready too.

200
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:10,291
I will produce Snow White this year and make Korn play one of the dwarfs.

201
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:12,992
I've already created a model of my set.

202
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:17,254
I've already put mine in 3D. Every corner of it.

203
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:20,708
Then there's only sponsorship left.

204
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,559
Sponsorship?

205
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,671
It's just a presentation. Why do we need sponsorship?

206
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:29,571
Whoever gets more money is more prepared.

207
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:36,251
Where do you think you will get sponsorship from?

208
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,154
Subtle. I won't tell you.

209
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,917
Tell me.

210
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,919
I will buy you soup with three wontons.

211
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,007
- Mo, did you see the girl I spotted in that building?
- Shit.

212
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,328
Do you know her?

213
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,420
Of course, I do.

214
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,020
Go.

Hi.

217
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,453
I came to ask for sponsorship.

218
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:19,357
You came with a friend. Right?

219
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:21,729
- A friend?
- A friend.

220
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,364
Hey, friend.

221
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,529
Did you really think I wouldn't know what you were up to?

222
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,597
Thank you.

223
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,397
Thank you.

224
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:59,640
Hey. Wait up.

What's your plan?

227
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:14,045
I intentionally let you look at my work plan,

228
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,245
so you would come to present yours on the same day as me.

229
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:21,021
I know I'll beat you at the presentation.

230
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,435
How can you be sure?

231
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,182
You're not the only one who knows how to snoop.

232
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,965
There's no need to push against me.

233
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,464
You think I want to push against you so much?

234
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,320
Admit it.

235
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,530
You also did it on purpose last time

236
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,730
because I smelled good.

237
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,423
Others have left. You should too.

238
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:34,057
Sorry, I zoned out.

[HIGHTEM: Home Design & Construction]

Isn't it too late to edit the file now?

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Give up.

243
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,710
No.

Hello, Korn. Is the file ready?

251
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,774
The new movie? I'm downloading it. Just a moment.

252
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:08,650
No, not the porn movie.

253
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,670
I mean the work file. The work file I asked you to edit. Is it ready?

254

Our faculty's future is in your hands.

257
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:33,564
Since the Architecture's play this year is inspired by the forest conservation team,

258
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:36,407
the mood and tone will be green and pleasant.

259
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,599
Something like this,

260
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,286
which really fits your brand.
[Is it ready yet, Korn? Pran is almost finished.]

261
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,787
I hope the Architecture's play will get support from you all this year.

262
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,587
Thank you.

263
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:52,754
Next presenter, please.

264
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,154
Yes.

265
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:59,606
Well.

266
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:08,500
The Engineering faculty has done some research

267
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,860
and came up with this concept.

268
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:26,054
I have the new version of the file that has just been revised.

269
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:27,850

Well, our faculty...

00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:42,112
Hey.

273
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,153
Are you sure you're going to present that?

274
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:48,031
Of course. We just revised the file.

275
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:50,373
Shit, Korn!

276
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,523
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

277
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,645
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

278
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,745
Is this what you call being prepared?

279
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:02,744
Are you sure you're well-prepared?

280
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,725
I'm well-prepared.

281
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,925
- Are you ready to present?
- Yes, I'm ready.

282
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,519
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,294
My friend probably sent the wrong file.

284
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,655
It's him, not me.

285
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:18,781
Let me just tell you about the idea in my head.

286
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:21,163
I'm so sorry.

287
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:24,330
The Engineering faculty has this idea

288
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,440
that's quite better than the Architecture faculty

289
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:32,496
because we've planned the concept of our play.

290
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,538
You're not prepared to present.

291
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:44,377
Damn it. That bastard Korn.

292
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:52,424
Honestly, it's not because of your porn movie.

293
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,439
Then what was it?

294
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:58,059
Why did they choose you and not me?

295
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:02,345
The cost of your stage setup is two times more expensive than mine,

296
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,609
but our work is equally good.

297
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:07,934
If you were them, who would you choose?

298
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:20,705
Are you hungry? Let me treat you to soup with three wontons.

299
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:24,143
No, I'm good. Thank you.

300
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:26,143
I have things to do.

301
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,118
What are you playing?

302
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,062
What you used to play.

303
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:01,526
How did you know I was here?

304
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:04,619
You're so easy to read.

305
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,977
You're going to fix the stage set to ask for a new fund, right?

306
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:11,873
I'm thinking about it, but I'm completely lost.

307
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:15,881
I don't know what parts I should get rid of. They're all important.

308
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,493
Then don't get rid of them.

309
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,619
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

310
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,659
No, I'm not. I'm serious.

311
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:29,798
You Engineering students think too much about making your play.

312
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:31,580
You use logic

313
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,660
when you don't actually need it that much for a play.

314
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,309
What do you mean?

315
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:43,100
You're producing Snow White, right?

316
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah.

317
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:49,455
What do you think this bench can be?

318
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:55,743
A bench?

319
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,001
See?

320
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:02,595
You Engineering students only see this as a bench when actually...

321
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,624
Architecture students like me see this as the Magic Mirror.

322
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,373
Magic Mirror on the wall,

323
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:21,874
who is the smartest of them all?

324
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,740
You can do that?

325
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,534
Of course.

326
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,737
You can do it too.

327
00:23:31,737 --> 00:23:32,800
Good idea.

328
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,464
Think. What else can it be?

329
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,378
A table?

330
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,126
No. The size is not right.

331
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,926
It can be.

332
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,426
Here.

333
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,762
The seven dwarfs' dining table.

334
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:04,890
This meal looks so good.

335
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,487
Okay. What else can this be?

336
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,158
- Lie on top of it.
- What?

337
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:15,444
Lie on top of it. Lie flat.

338
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:16,508
Lie flat.

339
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:17,604
- Lie down?
- Yeah.

340
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:22,585
What are you going to do?

341
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,847
There. This is Snow White's glass coffin.

342
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:31,789
Oh, I'm Snow White after eating that poisoned apple?

343
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:33,099
Correct.

344
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:36,927
Now how do we wake Snow White up?

345
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:41,223
Ah, I know just what to do.

346
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:44,020
The handsome prince...

347
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,270
must kiss her.

348
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:50,551
I don't think so.

349
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:57,573
Snow White is unconscious. She can't talk.

350
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:05,208
Hey! Who's there?

351
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:24,272
Thanks for coming to help.

352
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,546
Instead of thanking me, give me the auditorium.

353
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:29,046
Sure.

354
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,481
So the Engineering faculty will back out?

355
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:37,161
Yes. I've thought it through.

356
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,940
The Architecture guys are better-prepared,

357
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,192
so they should get to produce their play.

358
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:45,677
And your friends won't mind?

359
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,630
They will probably make a fuss, but it's understandable.

360
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,790
I will persuade them to hold a concert on the football field instead.

361
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,369
All right. I'm not against your decision.

362
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:59,970
I only have one concern.

363
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:04,283
The Architecture's play is based on a true story, right?

364
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:06,558
Yes. It's a story from the internet.

365
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,483
I don't see any written permission from the story's owner.

366
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,833
Oh, I already sent a letter.

367
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,508
I'm waiting to hear back.

368
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:22,852
The owner is in the countryside, so communication could be a little challenging.

369
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:27,246
This is a very serious matter. You could get sued.

370
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:29,825
I'll give you one week.

371
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,321
You must get the story owner's signature

372
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:37,222
or I may have to give the auditorium to the Engineering students.

373
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,709
- Okay.
- Good.

374
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,097
Hey. One week.

375
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,324
Why don't you call the owner?

376
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,168
There's no signal there.

377
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,668
- What about email?
- I don't have his email.

378
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,870
- Facebook?
- Even if he has one, I don't know about it.

379
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,820
Oh, come on. Don't you know anything else other than his address?

380
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,056
That's all I found on the web board. He only posted approximately where he lives.

381
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:20,745
What do you want me to do? Do you want me to go there and find him?

382
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:23,686
Why not? What are you waiting for?

383
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,874
But it's far and I don't even know if I'll be able to find him there.

384
00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:34,787
It's okay. You have nothing to lose.

385
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:38,162
You have me. You don't have to be scared.

386
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:51,797
All right. Deal.

387
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,344
I thought you wanted to help me.

388
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:03,202
Turns out you wanted to show off your stuff.

389
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:06,399
This is a work trip, not a vacation.

390
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,399
Didn't you say the stars are beautiful there?

391
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:13,081
Come here.

392
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,776
What are you doing?

393
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,376
Sit down.

394
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,403
- I'm packing.
- Sit down.

395
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:22,174
Imagine what I say.

396
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:23,840
The sky is dark.

397
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,864
The vibe is good. The weather is cold.

398
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:31,290
We sit here by the fire. We lie down in there and look at the stars.

399
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,076
Wow. It's so romantic.

400
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:34,990
Let me turn off the light.

401
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,614
What do you think?

402
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,974
Come on. Be romantic with me.

403
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,078
Since we got back from our honeymoon trip to Uncle Tong's house

404
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:06,397
we haven't traveled at all.

405
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:12,587
I miss those moments...

406
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:15,426
when we didn't have to be afraid of getting caught by anyone.

407
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:17,505
We could do whatever we wanted.

408
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:20,909
Do you feel the same?

409
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:24,662
I like it.

410
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,320
You mean you like the stars?

411
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,120
I like you.

412
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:33,017
No matter what problem I face,

413
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,701
you're always there for me.

414
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:44,091
I have no choice.

415
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,466
We've been neighbors since we were born.

416
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,546
Damn it.

417
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:03,334
What the hell is it, Korn? I'm busy.

418
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,728
- We have a problem. Come to the shop now.
- What?

419
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,154
It's Korn.

420
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:19,364
Come on. See for yourself.

421
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:21,212
- Go see. It's Chang.
- What's going on?

422
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:25,210
Chang brought too much liquor, so we need to celebrate.

423
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,712
- You guys dragged me all the way here for this?
- Huh?

424
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:33,840
I told you I was busy.

425
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,511
If I hadn't made up a story, would you have left your boyfriend and come to see us?

426
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:41,230
Besides, we're celebrating you.

427
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,955
Celebrating what?

428
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:47,220
Beating the Architecture guys and getting to produce our play.

429
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,919
Not this week. We'll know next week.

430
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:53,164
He won't get the signature in time.

431
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:55,778
He would have gotten it a long time ago if he could get it. Trust me.

432
00:30:55,778 --> 00:30:58,191
Yes. Mo is right.

433
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:02,676
Fine. Since I'm already here, I'll drink but only one glass.

434
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:04,038
I'm traveling tomorrow morning.

435
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,560
You got it, buddy.

436
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,253
Hey, that's enough.

437
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:13,500
- What?
- I have a heavy hand. Sorry.

438
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,523
One glass only.

439
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:19,747
Come on. Cheers!

440
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:48,695
That's enough.

441
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:54,735
Hey. You know what? The other day, the Architecture guys did a 3-on-1 attack on me,

442
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,278
but they couldn't take me down.

443
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:59,726
Like I said, only elevators can take me down.

444
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:07,723
Our friend is the real deal.

445
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:31,072

447
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:41,131
Pran is so unlucky, don't you think?

448
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,186
You're right.

449
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:50,721
He set the stage and got everything ready, but he has no permit.

450
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:07,055
- What are you talking about? That's not what I mean.
- What?

451
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:11,582
I mean how could he leave you when you're such a nice guy?

452
00:33:11,582 --> 00:33:14,605
He's so damn stupid, don't you think?

453
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,931
He's so stupid.

454
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:19,031
You're exaggerating.

455
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,164
It's true.

456
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:22,851
You've helped him so many times.

457
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:26,225
You helped him build the bus stop.

458
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:30,615
Yeah, and you played the main lead for his play.

459
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:31,914
Right?

460
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:35,914
I know, but he actually helped me a lot too.

461
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:39,090
You just don't know about it.

462
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,917
Hey. Why are you siding with him?

463
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,934
Do you still have feelings for him?

464
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:46,683
Say it.

465
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,370
What are you talking about?

466
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,119
No. I don't have feelings for him.

467
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,455
That's nonsense.

468
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:55,054
Do I have to carry him through forever?

469
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,496
No, it's too much.

470
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:58,550
Honestly, look how he is now.

471
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,810
Without me, he can't do anything.

472
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:04,289
That's right.

473
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:07,283
Without our friend, he's a loser.

474
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:09,114
Our friend is awesome.

475
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,816

483
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,159
I was scared you'd be gone.

484
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,588
I thought you'd be mad and left without me.

00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:37,242
You're so cute.

486
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:39,742
Did you fall asleep waiting for me?

Shit. Wai?

How did you get here?

492
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:05,188
I was drunk and couldn't go home, so I asked Pran if I could crash here.

Where's Pran?

00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:28,315
Pran!

540
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,632
Damn it!

541
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,604
Have we arrived?

542
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:11,040
Sorry. This is as far as I can drop you off.

543
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,372
I'm going home this way.

544
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:16,006
How much further do I have to go?

545
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:19,600
About 4-5 hours, if you don't get lost.

546
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,200
- I have to go.
- Oh, okay.

547
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,983
Bye.

548
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:06,708
Are you going to the village?

549
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,108
Yes.

550
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:11,162
Get in.

551
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:14,163
- I'm going there too.
- Thank you.

552
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:19,937
Thank you so much.

553
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:24,149
If you didn't pick me up, it'd take me until midnight to walk there.

554
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,226
Why are you going there?

555
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:30,445
I'm going to see a volunteer teacher named Tian.

556
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:31,712
Do you know him?

557
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:34,731
Teacher Tian? I know him well.

558
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:39,511
I work in the forest department. I take care of him.

559
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,348
- Really?
- Yes.

560
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:42,908
You're Chief Phu?

561
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:46,300
I thought you would be more stern.

562
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,165
Oh, I'm not him.

563
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:55,642
Though many people mistake me for him.

564
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:58,896
My name is Yodchai Muengnuea.

565
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:01,277
You can call me Yod.

566
00:41:01,277 --> 00:41:04,007
I'm the department technician. I work for Chief Phu.

567
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,430
Chief Phu is waiting in the village.

568
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,463
I'll introduce you to him today.

569
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:10,321
Oh, of course.

570
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:11,994
- Thank you.
- No problem.

571
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:14,107
Let me tell him.

572
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:15,707
Sure.

573
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,178
Eagle, this is Star 3. Over.

574
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:26,028
Eagle, this is Star 3. Over.

575
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:14,991
Is the car okay?

576
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:33,780
- Can you start it?
- Uh...

577
00:42:36,226 --> 00:42:38,339
Just a moment.

578
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,039
Come on!

579
00:42:41,613 --> 00:42:43,743
You old thing!

580
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:50,253
The car is old.

581
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:53,087
- What?
- The car is old.

582
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:59,836
Do you want to walk to Pha Pun Dao like Teacher Tian?

583
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,608
I guess I have no choice.

584
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,373
It's not far. It's not too far now.

585
00:43:11,373 --> 00:43:12,574
Okay.

586
00:43:12,574 --> 00:43:14,946
Let's get our stuff.

587
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:28,778
It's not that far. It's not too far now.

588
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:32,929
Hang in there.

589
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,646
How embarrassing.

590
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,150
Can't be helped.

591
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:42,708
Consider this a workout.

592
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:57,907
Come on. We're almost there.

593
00:43:57,907 --> 00:44:00,595
It's not too far now. Hang in there.

594
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,679
Hang in there. Come on.

595
00:44:04,964 --> 00:44:06,708
Hey.

596
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,810
Are you sure...

597
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,969
Teacher Tian walked all the way up there?

598
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:13,820
Yes, I'm sure.

599
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,270
I led him up there.

600
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,865
As soon as he arrived,

601
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:23,324
he fainted.

602
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:25,428
Don't panic.

603
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,290
You're still young. You can do this. Come on.

604
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,560
It's not too far now.

605
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,237
- Give me a second.
- Sure. Are you all right?

606
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,418
Yes. Let me just breathe.

607
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:38,388
How much further?

608
00:44:38,388 --> 00:44:41,238
It's not too far now. It's the peak over there.

609
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:42,841
It's not too far now.

610
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:47,246
Come on.

611
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,609
Are you going to beat me with that?

612
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:52,748
No.

613
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:55,972
Come on.

614
00:44:57,468 --> 00:45:00,640
There. That's the teacher's house.

615
00:45:01,787 --> 00:45:03,489
Chief.

616
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:05,809
This young man is looking for Teacher Tian.

617
00:45:19,346 --> 00:45:20,846
Hello.

618
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:31,424
Chief!

619
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,242
Everyone, don't crowd him.

620
00:45:33,242 --> 00:45:35,115
Move away. He needs air.

621
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,904
Does anyone have smelling salts?

622
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:39,904
Let me go find smelling salts.

623
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,625
- Can I leave him with you?
- Okay.

624
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:44,915
Can you please move a little further back?

625
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:47,177
Chief!

626
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,711
- What happened?
- Hey.

627
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:51,634
Move. Are you a doctor or what?

628
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,046
My name is Tian. I'm a volunteer teacher here.

629
00:46:05,046 --> 00:46:06,979
Who are you?

630
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:26,190
Pran, my buddy. I thought we'd never see each other again.

631
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,372
Well, if it isn't my buddy Pat.

632
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:33,440
We're here to ask for your permission to use your story for my play.

633
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,988
I'll never let you use this story.

634
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:37,784
You can use it.

635
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:39,371
I'm the writer.

636
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:42,451
Why does Teacher Tian have to be sulking now?

637
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:46,279
You're going to make them make up in one week?

638
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,718
Everyone knows I'm Engineering's top-notch.

639
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:53,358
You probably don't know that I'm Pha Pun Dao's top-notch.

640
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,910
