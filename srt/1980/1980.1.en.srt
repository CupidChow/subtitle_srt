00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Inspired by the diary kept
by pastor Peder Olsen

2
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,480
"Something incomprehensible lies
within every human being."

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>Minister President Quisling
addresses the nation.</i>

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,880
Men and women of Norway…

5
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,080
…a few days ago,
the world received the news

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,600
that Adolf Hitler,

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
the Führer and chancellor
of the German Reich,

8
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,560
had died, as befitting a hero,
at his command post in Berlin

9
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,600
during his heroic effort to prevent

10
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,400
the Bolshevik destruction
of his country and of Europe.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
With Adolf Hitler's passing,

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,320
we have lost a historic character

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,680
capable of creating an era
in the history of humankind.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,560
If Europe does not go under,

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,480
surely the future will acknowledge

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,040
that the salvation
of the European cultural civilization

17
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,160
was due to Adolf Hitler.

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,880
His National Socialism
made Germany into a mighty bulwark

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,720
capable of breaking
the red wave of Bolshevism.

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,920
His life's greatest tragedy

21
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,680
was that he, despite all his efforts,

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
was unable to bring about peace
between England and Germany.

23
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,360
Such an alliance would
have ensured world peace

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,520
and neutralized Bolshevism.

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,880
<i>I will not betray our cause.</i>

26
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,920
Nor will I let it succumb
to lawlessness and Bolshevism.

27
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Thank you.

28
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Did you listen?

29
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
To my speech?

30
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,960
It sounds like we have capitulated.

31
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
Not at all.

32
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,920
Berlin won't abandon us.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
I'm trying to negotiate
with Nygaardsvold in London

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,320
about an interim government.

35
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
And if that doesn't work out?

36
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,440
I won't tolerate
talk of defeat or capitulation!

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,440
You will achieve what you want.

38
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
You are Captain Quisling.

39
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,600
You will succeed.

40
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,760
We have 30,000 men at our disposal,
they have 4000.

41
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,080
We can still fight.

42
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Vidkun!

43
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,200
I was at the dentist.
He rushed me here afterwards.

44
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,960
He's going to the train station.

45
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,960
He's fleeing the country,
bringing nothing.

46
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
My God.

47
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
You said they wouldn't capitulate!

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,640
-Don't panic.
-What are they doing here?

49
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,080
It might be a good idea to pack a bag
with the bare necessities.

50
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,200
-Just in case.
-Pack?

51
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
What about London and the negotiations?

52
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,200
Calm down, Maria. Please.

53
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,160
Have the kitchen prepare some food.
This may take a while.

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,920
<i>And old tales which night, in falling</i>

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,280
<i>Brings as dreams to earth</i>

56
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,680
Christ, all hell's breaking loose.

57
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,760
-We should have just left.
-What do you mean?

58
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,960
They're running around
like headless chickens, shouting.

59
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,080
A group of drunken German seamen
were firing their sub-machine guns,

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
shooting like crazy.

61
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,160
I barely got away unscathed.

62
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,200
-No one has talked to the Resistance.
-Did we walk straight into a trap?

63
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,840
There seems to be a power struggle
between the Resistance and the police.

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,360
The new national police chief is insane.

65
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,720
Capitulation begins at midnight.

66
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
We just heard it on the radio.

67
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
In that case…

68
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,840
…there's not much more we can do.

69
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,000
Nonsense. I'm going down there myself.

70
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,880
I would advise against that.

71
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,480
It's dangerous out there.

72
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
They're shooting.

73
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,760
You can't go anywhere
without a promise of safe passage.

74
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,280
I doubt the police will grant you that.

75
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,040
Surely there are still some
civilized people left in this country!

76
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Yes, hello.

77
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,800
Vidkun Quisling, the Minister President.

78
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you for taking the time, Arntzen.

79
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,960
No, we're contacting you to clear up
some misunderstandings regarding--

80
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,120
Right.

81
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
Yes.

82
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Absolutely.

83
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,400
Listen, we're discussing matters
with the military authorities,

84
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,919
this could turn into--

85
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
No.

86
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,159
I see.

87
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,560
But the fact that you don't know Foss
is your problem.

88
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,920
He came to see me and offered me
internment in Holmenkollen.

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,080
He could guarantee--

90
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,800
I see.

91
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Yes.

92
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,480
You calling me a criminal I find very--

93
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
I've worked so hard for this country.

94
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,320
I have no--

95
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
Fine.

96
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,640
Right.

97
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

98
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,360
Hello?

99
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,800
He gave us until six o'clock
tomorrow morning.

100
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,520
And if we refuse?

101
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,000
They will come at us with force.

102
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
They…

103
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,560
…will come at us with force.

104
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,480
I heard you, Vidkun,
on the phone with the police chief.

105
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,640
It's over.

106
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,560
No, I'm going to the police station
to clear this up.

107
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,880
-I have to go. They're waiting.
-Stop.

108
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,640
Please state your name.

109
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,320
Where is Police Chief Arntzen?

110
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,320
State your personal details.

111
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,560
-I demand to talk to Arntzen.
-Your hat, please.

112
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,200
Occupation?

113
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,840
-Your occupation?
-I just need to check your pockets.

114
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,640
Wait a minute. I'm not being arrested.

115
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,680
I have made an agreement
with the police chief

116
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,160
that I am to stay
in a house in Holmenkollen.

117
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
Your wedding ring, please.

118
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,560
-What?
-Could I have your wedding ring?

119
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,400
No. Is that really necessary?

120
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
Yes. I have to take it.

121
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,720
Let me remind you that I've been
Norway's head of state for five years.

122
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,360
I expect to be treated with respect
and not like a criminal.

123
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,880
This way, please.

124
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,640
Mr. Olsen, his Grace will see you now.

125
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,200
Right. Sorry.

126
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,720
Thank you.

127
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,240
Peder Olsen.

128
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,840
-It's been a long time.
-Indeed. How are you?

129
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
I must thank you.

130
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,280
Without your efforts,
this war could have been a lot darker.

131
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,280
Let's put the war behind us.

132
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm more interested in the peace.

133
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,360
Take a seat.

134
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,760
I've been told you are
an excellent judge of character.

135
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,760
I don't know about that.

136
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,080
Vidkun Quisling.

137
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,920
Yes?

138
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,080
He's in his cell at Mollergata 19,
awaiting his trial.

139
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,840
Which will be highly necessary.

140
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,360
Would you consider serving as his pastor?

141
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
-Me? For Quisling?
-Yes.

142
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,320
But isn't Mr. Traaen
prison chaplain over there?

143
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,200
He's made a decent effort so far,
but with the trial coming up,

144
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,080
they don't seem to get along.

145
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,240
Quisling is, perhaps not surprisingly,
a very complex human being.

146
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,280
-In what way?
-How should I put this?

147
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,000
During the war,
he threatened me with execution.

148
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Now, he wants me to be his pastor.

149
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,000
-Can he make such demands?
-I politely declined.

150
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,000
However, I think it is crucial
that the Church is involved.

151
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,320
In what way?

152
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
We are a broken country.

153
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,280
People are calling for the death penalty.
More bad blood, more hatred.

154
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,880
In the worst case, we make him a martyr.

155
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,520
If we could help him realize his actions,

156
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,520
it can start a process of reconciliation,
for the rest of us as well,

157
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,400
no matter the outcome of the trial.

158
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
To start with.

159
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,520
I'm not sure I'm the right man
for such a task.

160
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,160
I… I'm a hospital chaplain.

161
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,760
I have no experience with criminals.

162
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,800
Reconciliation is neither simple
nor pleasant.

163
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,800
Anyone taking such a thing lightly
is not sincere.

164
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,640
You having doubts
only counts in your favor.

165
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,040
Here is your prison pass
and other documents.

166
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,040
And you must keep this to yourself,
for security reasons.

167
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,480
What about my wife?
Can I discuss this with her?

168
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,880
Like I said, Olsen,
we keep this to ourselves.

169
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,600
Oops!

170
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,720
Let's see.

171
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
That wasn't very smart.

172
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,200
Try not to laugh so much.

173
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,920
I think we need to pull here. Like that.

174
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
-You got it straight away.
-There you go.

175
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,160
There's only static there.
We need to go to--

176
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,760
Isn't there a--

177
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,640
<i>Quisling denied ever having
improper contact with the Germans.</i>

178
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,760
<i>He had been in Copenhagen
from April 5 to 6…</i>

179
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,360
-It's from the magistrates' court.
-They won't release him before the trial?

180
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,080
<i>…his rescinding</i>

181
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,280
<i>of the Norwegian government's
mobilization order.</i>

182
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,680
<i>He said he'd acted in the best interests
of the Norwegian people.</i>

183
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,240
"In the best interests"?
The man is stark raving mad.

184
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,640
<i>"I'm a martyr," Quisling shouted.</i>

185
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,400
<i>"I've found myself
in a terrible situation where I've--"</i>

186
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,120
-What?
-I've had enough of him.

187
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
What's a martyr?

188
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Why don't you go and play outside?

189
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,280
He executed Norwegians to save himself,
and now he's a martyr?

190
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,080
He's just defending himself.

191
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,480
He seems proud of what he's done.

192
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,840
He's mad. A monster.

193
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Heidi, we are all mere humans,
we are all God's children.

194
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,680
Could you lay off
the preaching for a second?

195
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
Preaching?

196
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,560
-Am I not allowed to be angry?
-Sure you are.

197
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,400
But I don't think it's productive.

198
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,560
He's worse than the Germans.
He knew what he was doing.

199
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
He was one of us.

200
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
The children and I were dodging bombs
while he was welcoming our enemies.

201
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,400
He traded our freedom for his power.

202
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,360
I want him on his knees.

203
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,160
With his hands over his head,
begging for forgiveness.

204
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,120
If not, they might as well shoot him.

205
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Yeah. I'll go and get the coffee.

206
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,920
I can hardly believe it's true.

207
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
For so long,
I've had this knot in my stomach.

208
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
Fearing that something could go wrong
at any moment.

209
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
I feel like if I allow myself to let go…

210
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,120
…the air raid sirens will wail
or the Gestapo will come.

211
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,920
-Or a nurse will tell me--
-Please.

212
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,960
All those things are behind us now.

213
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,040
Right?

214
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,280
It's over.

215
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
I know.

216
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
I do know that.

217
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,520
You're allowed to be happy now.
You deserve to be.

218
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,280
Dad?

219
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,960
But those two will
never leave us in peace.

220
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,440
-Follow me, please.
-Thank you.

221
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,800
Go through that door,
across the courtyard and into the prison.

222
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,680
-Up the stairs.
-Thank you.

223
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,280
The cell door must be left open.

224
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,480
If he hangs himself,
we can't shoot the bastard.

225
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,120
Excuse me?

226
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,160
Hello, my name is Peder Olsen.
I'm the hospital--

227
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,720
No, I'm a pastor.

228
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
I asked for Berggrav.

229
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,360
Yes, I'm afraid he was indisposed.

230
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,320
"Indisposed?" Right.

231
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,440
I've brought the New Testament.

232
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,400
Thanks. The last fellow
already gave me one.

233
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
-So, no thanks.
-I see.

234
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,640
There can never be
too much of a good thing.

235
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,920
I was just joking.

236
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,320
You bring humor into this place?

237
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,040
I don't mean to be rude… Mr. Olsen.

238
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,560
But I am in no need of a pastor.

239
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,280
-Yet you wanted to talk to Berggrav?
-Exactly, and you're not him.

240
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
No, I'm here representing the Church.

241
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,440
Many people in your situation
would like someone to talk to.

242
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:13,040
I could perhaps help you
clear your mind and find peace.

243
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,360
Find peace.

244
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,000
-Yes, if you want.
-No thanks. You know why? I am innocent.

245
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,440
I have no unfinished business
with the Church, God or country.

246
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
If you'd be so kind as to tell Berggrav

247
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,560
that I have matters to discuss
with him regarding my case

248
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,920
and not my soul,
I would greatly appreciate that.

249
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,200
Excuse me, but do you know

250
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,560
the parable of the Pharisee
and the Tax Collector?

251
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,040
Luke 18:9-14.

252
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,440
Every child knows that one.

253
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,480
But the message is valid, right?

254
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,640
It's about humility,
being able to see one's own faults.

255
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,520
The Pharisee, the righteous,
looks down upon the other man,

256
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,360
since he's a lowly tax collector,

257
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
an ordinary man with a dirty job--

258
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,160
"God, I thank thee
that I'm not as other men are,

259
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,640
extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this tax collector."

260
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Exactly, the Pharisee
brags about his virtue.

261
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
While the tax collector--

262
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,720
Pounds his chest and leads,
"God, be merciful to me, a sinner."

263
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,920
What do you think he meant?

264
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,720
-Are you asking me?
-Yes.

265
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,280
I thought you were the pastor.

266
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,800
Yes.

267
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,480
It's not just that the tax collector
asks God to forgive him his sins.

268
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,040
He doesn't take forgiveness for granted.

269
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,600
He does what we find so difficult,
he realizes what he has done.

270
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
Regrets it.

271
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,040
He… confesses this to God.

272
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,880
Which is why he is absolved.

273
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,280
That's why the tax collector is
closest to God of the two of them.

274
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,640
Yes. So the question is,
which one of us do you think

275
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,560
is the Pharisee
and which is the tax collector?

276
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,440
What do you think?

277
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,920
I think you're here on a mission.

278
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,440
An assignment
from that reputable Berggrav,

279
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,920
who can't be bothered to come himself,

280
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,320
to demand that I show guilt and regret.

281
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,240
Am I right?

282
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,720
So you and the church you represent
can clear your conscience.

283
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,720
If that's not pride worthy of a Pharisee,
I don't know what is.

284
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,800
But I have no regrets
and won't confess to anything.

285
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,840
Not to you or your Sunday school theology,
even if you drag me to Golgotha!

286
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,280
Everyone has something to answer for.

287
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,400
Fine, then!

288
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,120
What do you have to confess, pastor?

289
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,160
Well, I don't think
we're here to talk about me.

290
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,600
If you would excuse me…

291
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,720
-…I have work to do.
-Yes.

292
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,480
The Pharisees
were actually great scholars.

293
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,920
The history books have given them
a poor and undeserved reputation.

294
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,840
They were idealists, just like you, Olsen.

295
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,000
Well, that went bloody well!

296
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,640
Peder!

297
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,800
Sorry to bother you at work.

298
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,480
Perfect timing, actually.

299
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,600
I was just about to have lunch.
We're going inside.

300
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,440
-Okay.
-Let me see your permit.

301
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,840
-Easy now.
-Lift them up!

302
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>There's a lot of pent-up rage.</i>

303
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,120
What's it like coming here
now that the tables are turned?

304
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,120
When the prison guards
have become prisoners?

305
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,040
There's less paperwork, and…

306
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,120
It's nice not having SS with me
in the cell when I'm working.

307
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,920
It's Quisling, isn't it?

308
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,000
Of course. He asked you first.

309
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,920
I… just couldn't do it.

310
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,040
Not after four years of spiritual guidance
for those sentenced to death here.

311
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,600
I keep in touch with the families
of the people executed by the Germans.

312
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,400
That's why it just didn't feel right.

313
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,200
-So, I recommended you.
-Should I thank you, then?

314
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,880
I thought you
were the right man for the job.

315
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,920
I have no experience with criminals
or people sentenced to death.

316
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,720
I tried the Pharisee
and the Tax Collector.

317
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,160
I think I offended him.

318
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,040
He was born into a family
that had four generations of clergymen.

319
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,320
He was totally…

320
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,640
He became very…

321
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,440
You once told me that spiritual guidance
is just a conversation.

322
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,800
-It should be a dialogue.
-I don't think Quisling would agree.

323
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,240
Listen to what he has to say.
Keep the conversation going.

324
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,200
If that doesn't work,
threaten him with clamps or a baton.

325
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,480
<i>Every single man can walk away
from this fight…</i>

326
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,720
…with a clear conscience.

327
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,720
It's such fine work.

328
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,640
Making something like this
in that dark little room.

329
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,040
It was good
that you gave them knitting supplies.

330
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,600
I'm sure that calmed their nerves.

331
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
I don't know.

332
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,560
We never asked.

333
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,000
We didn't take the time
to get to know them.

334
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,640
We helped them hide.

335
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,840
We did what we could.

336
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,840
These labor camps
in Germany they write about…

337
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,440
They say several thousands have died.

338
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,840
We don't know if they ended up there.

339
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,280
They were two elderly people.

340
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,280
What good would they be in a labor camp?

341
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,440
They've probably been in internment.

342
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
Do you really think
they took age into account?

343
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,960
The Red Cross
are getting people home all the time.

344
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,000
I think it will take time
to get the complete picture.

345
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,440
Where do you get all that optimism from?

346
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,800
Hey…

347
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,639
Heidi.

348
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,280
I have a good friend up there.

349
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,000
You never have doubts?

350
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,719
I choose to believe.

351
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,000
We have to.

352
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,680
Mr. Quisling?

353
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,720
I didn't mean to disturb you.

354
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,240
Well, it's you and me again.

355
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,280
I thought I'd made myself clear.

356
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,680
We got off on the wrong foot
and I'm sorry about that.

357
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
My wife made butter cookies.

358
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,440
I believe the food here is bland.

359
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,720
The food is just fine.

360
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Herring and potatoes. Wholesome food.

361
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,640
And they treat you well?

362
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,880
Yes. Perfectly fine.

363
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,880
Yes.

364
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
You look a bit pale.

365
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
Please, help yourself.

366
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,160
Are you trying to be my friend?

367
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,520
Judging by the mood out there,
you don't seem to have too many.

368
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,800
-You're trying to be witty again.
-Yes.

369
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,000
Have you been able to see your wife?

370
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,240
Not since I got arrested.

371
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,040
That must be hard on you.

372
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,240
I can handle it,
but I'm worried about her.

373
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,040
If I hadn't been able
to talk to my wife Heidi,

374
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,960
I would've gone mad.

375
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,160
What do you mean? I'm completely sane.

376
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,040
Yes, yes. I'm not saying you're not.

377
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,640
Psychiatrists seriously consider
everyone in our movement

378
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,440
to be permanently mentally impaired.

379
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,840
At least, impaired.

380
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,320
These so-called investigators…

381
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,000
…who want me to admit
to being some sort of opportunist.

382
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,560
A spineless <i>Peer Gynt</i> character
with only self-interest in mind.

383
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
But that's not you.

384
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,080
I fought for my country.

385
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
For five long years.

386
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,600
Day and night.

387
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,920
Well, well. You don't believe me.

388
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,640
Yes, I do think you mean what you say.

389
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,640
Absolutely.

390
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,560
But… I'm sure you enjoyed
some benefits during the occupation.

391
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,360
Exactly. So, you think I only fought
for riches, titles…

392
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,480
…salutes, stuff and nonsense?

393
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,880
The armor of an insecure man.

394
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,760
I couldn't care less.

395
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,280
Just ask my wife.

396
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,880
I have acted according to my convictions.

397
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,040
For that, I feel no shame.

398
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,040
May I sit?

399
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,600
You met with Hitler, didn't you?

400
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,560
What do you mean?

401
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,640
What was he like?

402
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,240
As a person?

403
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,760
A passionate man.

404
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,680
You can always question the outcome,
but he believed in something.

405
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,920
-You can't say that about everyone.
-Is that something you admire?

406
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,560
Belief?

407
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,280
Of course.

408
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,080
But I value certainty even more.

409
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,800
-Certainty?
-You can't, like Hitler did,

410
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,200
base your politics on…belief.

411
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,480
You need to know.

412
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,560
Spend time finding the sources.

413
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
To know.

414
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,000
I've worked all my life on my philosophy.

415
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,880
Universism.

416
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
The actual truth.

417
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,080
I've given myself the mission
of lighting a candle for humankind.

418
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,120
To find the true philosophy of life.

419
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,560
In accordance with both
science and empiricism.

420
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,960
I can't expect that you…

421
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,560
…a simple prison chaplain,
will be able to understand.

422
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
I'm sure Universism is very interesting.

423
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,800
But what we really should aspire to
are the words and deeds of Christ.

424
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,960
Love.

425
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,400
Universism is the same thing,
just greater.

426
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,200
-It concerns--
-Mr. Quisling, greater than love?

427
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,960
What is greater than love?

428
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,880
Would you be so kind, Pastor,
as to go and see Maria, my wife?

429
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,120
Just to make sure she's all right.

430
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,360
Of course.

431
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Thank you.

432
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,560
And if you could bring some writing paper.

433
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,880
I'm about to run out.

434
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,600
Next time you come here.

435
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,240
I'll see you then.

436
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,680
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

437
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Are you all right?

438
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,520
-Did you get him to apologize yet?
-What?

439
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,680
Did you get him to say he's sorry?

440
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,000
Does he have any regrets?

441
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,840
It's all I was allowed to bring.

442
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,480
It's my whole life now.

443
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,960
Must be quite a change.

444
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,160
If it hadn't been for Mrs. Prydz' flat,
I'd be out on the street.

445
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,160
How is he?

446
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,840
He's doing fine, considering…

447
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,080
-Sorry, would you like one?
-No, thank you. I don't drink.

448
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,960
Is there something you
would like to tell him?

449
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,280
I could pass it on, if you want me to.

450
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,240
Tell him that I'm doing fine.

451
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
That I'm strong.

452
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,040
Strong and optimistic.

453
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm not interested in politics.

454
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,880
Have a drink with me.

455
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
How did you meet?

456
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,080
What have you heard?

457
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,320
No, I'm just asking.

458
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,400
We met in Ukraine.

459
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,840
My homeland.

460
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,880
He was very famous: Captain Quisling.

461
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,600
He saved thousands of lives
during the great famine.

462
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
Did you know?

463
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,000
No.

464
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,480
Look.

465
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,400
Look at that.

466
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,440
Ukraine.

467
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,720
Russia.

468
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Thousands. Jews, as well.

469
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,360
Did he work for Nansen?

470
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,360
Nansen…

471
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,560
Nansen did not get his hands dirty.

472
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,200
Vidkun, on the other hand…

473
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,560
I saw him for the first time
through my office window.

474
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,600
I could tell straight away
that this man could achieve anything.

475
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,240
He was to be my destiny.

476
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,040
I left everything behind for him.
My mother…

477
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,200
SS VICTIMS BURIED AT TRANDUM

478
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,120
Hi.

479
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,680
I started to get worried about you.

480
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,600
Oh, yeah?

481
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,840
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

482
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
-I saved some for you.
-Thanks.

483
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,160
-Have you been drinking?
-Just half a glass.

484
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,680
We had a little celebration
at the hospital.

485
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,680
With the nurses?

486
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,160
No, a peace drink with a doctor.

487
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,160
-A peace drink?
-Yes.

488
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,360
It's not the end of the world.

489
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,800
I was at the hospital.

490
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,400
Could you tell me where we are going?

491
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,880
At least tell me where we're going.

492
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,840
OSLO POLICE

493
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,320
They can't be Norwegians.

494
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,680
They're as Norwegian as you and me.

495
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,480
This is murder.
Of defenseless people, Mr. Quisling.

496
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,800
This is part of what
you are being charged with.

497
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,560
-How many did you find here?
-Six, so far.

498
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,080
-And over there?
-Eight, we think. It's hard to tell.

499
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,680
Riisnaes?

500
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
Führer?

501
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,040
Arvid?

502
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,520
Hello?

503
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,720
Would you kindly
switch off the light, please?

504
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,760
Thank you.

505
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,240
Having trouble sleeping?

506
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
No, it's…

507
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,080
The light…

508
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,040
You want me to tell you
why you can't sleep?

509
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,600
This place is haunted.

510
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,000
Those boys you killed at Trandum…

511
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,840
Listen.

512
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,320
Can you hear that?

513
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,240
It's my brother.

514
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
They're coming.

515
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,600
Vidkun…

516
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,840
Vidkun…

517
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,440
The trial is not far off.

518
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,160
They want you transferred
to Akershus prison.

519
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,200
Okay.

520
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,280
Hold on. Hold on.

521
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,480
Henrik Bergh, Quisling's defense lawyer.

522
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,160
Why was I not informed about this move?

523
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,400
-For security. Closer to the courthouse.
-Unacceptable.

524
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,400
My client's health is poor,
and it's cold and damp in there.

525
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,360
-It's fine.
-Could I have a word?

526
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,040
Could I have a word with my client?

527
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,920
Could I have a word with my client?

528
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,680
By all means.

529
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,360
-It's only for a few weeks.
-Right.

530
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,520
The psychiatrists have found
you to be of sound mind.

531
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,480
Yes, of course.

532
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,760
But they haven't carried out
a thorough assessment.

533
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,520
The conclusion was already given,
so I think we should appeal.

534
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,560
-What for?
-Things should be done correctly.

535
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,200
You do understand that you
risk getting the death penalty?

536
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:36,440
It's in your best interests to claim
that you may have lost your mind at times.

537
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,880
That wasn't the case.
I never lost my mind.

538
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,040
I see.

539
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,400
But the difference
between your perception of reality

540
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,120
and that of the court is problematic.

541
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,520
So madness is a better defense strategy
than the truth?

542
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,840
I've made my evaluations
based on my competence,

543
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,880
knowledge and strategic assessment.

544
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,960
Surely we can make
the court understand that?

545
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,200
It's your job!

546
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,640
Goddammit!

547
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,800
By the way, I'm in excellent shape.

548
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,080
I feel great!

549
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,960
I've never felt stronger!

550
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,440
No touching.

551
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,800
No.

552
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,120
You look well.

553
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,560
You have to tell Bergh to let me testify.

554
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,240
-I don't understand why I can't.
-It was my choice.

555
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,080
I won’t put you through that.

556
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,520
No touching!

557
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,520
I told you.

558
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,040
-Didn't you hear me?
-Yes, you told me.

559
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,640
Your friend is here.

560
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,800
Is it you?

561
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,320
Are you going to give me a shave?

562
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,120
No, I'm not.

563
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,760
I just wanted to wish you good luck.

564
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,600
It's a… big day.

565
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,760
I look like a bum.

566
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,560
Not at all.

567
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,160
It's a nice suit.

568
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,280
Tell me. Do you also think I'm crazy?

569
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,200
No, you actually seem
remarkably clear-headed, Mr. Quisling.

570
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,920
Considering the circumstances.

571
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,120
Good morning. May I see your pass?

572
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,440
Proceed.

573
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,680
-Good morning. Proceed.
-Very well.

574
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,920
The court is in session.

575
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,240
Vidkun Abraham Quisling.

576
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,080
The indictment has been drafted
by acting Public Prosecutor Anneus Schodt

577
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,520
by order of the Director
of Public Prosecution.

578
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,760
It reads as follows…

579
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,120
…"Major Vidkun Abraham Quisling,
born the 18th of July 1887,

580
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,840
is hereby indicted
at the Eidsivating High Court

581
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,160
for the crimes
on the following three counts.

582
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,720
One. Attempting to deliver Norwegian
or Allied troops into enemy hands.

583
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,760
Two. Attempting to deliver fortifications
or defense structures into enemy hands

584
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,440
or destroying or disabling them.

585
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,600
Three. Luring Norwegian
or Allied soldiers to join the enemy

586
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,120
or inciting them to commit mutiny
or other treacherous acts."

587
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,520
Will the defendant please rise?

588
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:01,360
Do you plead guilty to any
or all counts listed in the indictment?

589
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,920
I plead not guilty.

590
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,720
On all counts.

591
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,160
The only thing I wanted…

592
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,280
…was to protect my people
against Bolshevism.

593
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,560
That's right, you went to Russia.

594
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,920
My beloved Russia
was transformed into hell on hearth.

595
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,120
People were starving.

596
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,240
Mothers would…

597
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,840
…eat their own children.

598
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,400
It was… a betrayal
against their own people.

599
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:53,760
Back home, responsible figures
in the government were applauding.

600
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,880
It spread like a cancer.

601
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,880
I saw it as my calling
to put an end to it.

602
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,640
-You regarded it as a calling?
-Yes.

603
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,200
As a pastor,
you should understand what I mean.

604
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,280
Well, it's not quite the same, is it?

605
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,800
Why not?

606
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,920
It was a mission from God.

607
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,480
You think you have been called by God?

608
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,400
The prosecution can prove

609
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,800
that the defendant
committed treason before 9 April 1940.

610
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,000
He conspired with Hitler,

611
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,600
his foreign policy advisor Rosenberg,

612
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,320
and Germany's Admiral
of the Fleet, Raeder.

613
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,440
The plan was to topple the government
with the promise of the King's acceptance.

614
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,400
The coup d'état
of 9 April was part of a plan

615
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,800
driven by cynical opportunism.

616
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,120
As a lawmaker during the occupation,
he is responsible for oppression,

617
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,760
censorship, dictatorship
and The Führer Principle.

618
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,560
He is also responsible for the murder
of Chief Superintendent Eilifsen,

619
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,080
who was sentenced to death

620
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,480
according to a law
drafted by the defendant.

621
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,880
As well as 14 Norwegian patriots
who were executed in reprisals

622
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,800
for the assassination
of State Police Chief Martinsen in '44.

623
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,200
Quisling's culpability
in the fate of Norwegian Jews

624
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,040
also appears to be greater
than previously thought.

625
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,360
Finally, I would like the court
to note the charges of theft,

626
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,720
embezzlement, receiving
and the misappropriation of goods.

627
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:03,440
The defendant claims these are
legitimate arrangements as head of state.

628
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,000
To that our reply is that Vidkun Quisling

629
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:12,640
never has been head of state in Norway,
in accordance with Norwegian law.

630
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,600
Would you like to make a statement?

631
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,360
For five years,
I fought for Norway's interests,

632
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,440
for the Norwegian people,
Norwegian values and neutrality,

633
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:31,400
caught in between
the gruesome Germans and Terboven,

634
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,600
and Nygaardsvold, who urged
good Norwegians to commit acts of terror.

635
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,480
Trandum was atrocious,

636
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:47,160
but no one would have had to die
if people had worked together!

637
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,360
But you did sign the death sentences.

638
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,040
You could have pardoned them.

639
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,120
This is the premise of war,
the monstrosity of war.

640
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,520
The Germans had to be given something.
To save ten…

641
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,360
…one had to be sacrificed.

642
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,920
Like horse trading?

643
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,160
Call it what you want.

644
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:32,160
It's no secret that I thought England
was threatening Norwegian neutrality,

645
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,880
which would have resulted
in Germany invading Norway,

646
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,480
causing a bloodbath on Norwegian soil.

647
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,320
I wanted to avoid
Norway ending up like Poland.

648
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,000
I am Norway's savior.

649
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,600
You might not see that now,
but maybe in the future.

650
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,480
How could the Germans save us
without an occupation?

651
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,120
The idea was a peace operation
with Hitler's blessing.

652
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,480
He wanted to save Norway's neutrality.

653
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,360
To save Norway,

654
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,520
you wanted Germany to preempt England
and occupy us?

655
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,200
-No, not like that. I left that to fate.
-Fate?

656
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:20,359
It is surely an act of fate
that I became Norway's savior.

657
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,960
This is not only my cause.

658
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,359
It concerns the entire
Norwegian population,

659
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,920
as the future will show.

660
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,080
No one can take away
my belief in my cause.

661
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,240
I know I have saved Norway
and the Nordic countries!

662
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,880
We will not be getting anywhere

663
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,680
if you keep repeating
that you are a savior.

664
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:48,840
President of the court,
could we ask for a short break, please?

665
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,960
To be honest,
I find it difficult to understand him.

666
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,880
Yes.

667
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,479
No one knows my husband.

668
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:03,960
No?

669
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,840
You have sworn
an oath of confidentiality, right?

670
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,800
Yes.

671
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,120
We're not married.

672
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,240
-What?
-Not officially.

673
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,160
Vidkun was married
to someone else when we met.

674
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,080
Don't look at me like that.

675
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,240
I didn't know.

676
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,120
-What happened?
-She refused to get divorced.

677
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,279
So, no one would marry us.

678
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:48,279
We tried many places,
in Russia, the legation in Paris.

679
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,279
In Norway, she had…

680
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,040
…already met the family.

681
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,520
It was terrible.

682
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,480
Yet you ended up together.

683
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,000
Vidkun thought we could live together,
the three of us.

684
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,920
We could raise her as our foster daughter.

685
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,440
Okay. The woman he was married to?

686
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,000
She was just a child,
17 years old, far too young for him.

687
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,720
And you accepted this?
It was alright with you?

688
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,400
I was in love.

689
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,760
But it didn't work.
He sent her off to…Paris.

690
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,800
What did his family have to say?

691
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,240
He explained that it was a formality.

692
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,640
-He had to save her.
-Save? But he betrayed her?

693
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,040
Russia was hell on earth back then.

694
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,080
He got her out of there.

695
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,840
Right. So he betrayed his wife,
calling it a rescue mission.

696
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,280
Just like he's doing now with Norway.

697
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,800
You went to school with Mr. Quisling?

698
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,520
That's right. We were close
back in upper secondary school.

699
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,160
What was your impression of him?

700
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,360
It was very good.

701
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,600
I think highly of him as a person.

702
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,840
He was a faithful friend.

703
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,920
He was good at school.

704
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,920
He was highly receptive.

705
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,400
He had interests
that were unusual for boys that age.

706
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,000
He was particularly good at math.

707
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,520
And he was kind.

708
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,560
He would help us out with our homework.

709
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,240
We looked up to him, we all did.

710
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:03,080
-He was a good friend?
-Yes, he was.

711
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,520
And I speak for all
of his classmates back then.

712
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:14,240
But there was one
particular characteristic

713
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,920
I would like to address.

714
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,240
One that may be
of interest to the psychologist,

715
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,440
is that deep down Vidkun is very shy.

716
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,400
To a degree that was painful.

717
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,880
He was often alone,
and it was obvious that he had…

718
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,360
…an inferiority complex,

719
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,880
even though he was
such an educated person.

720
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,960
With us, in private, he was at ease.

721
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:51,440
But in the company of strangers,
he would be silent and withdrawn.

722
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,520
A loner, I would say.

723
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,400
I made it an asset.

724
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,360
-An asset?
-I was determined to be the best.

725
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,000
I didn't go to parties.

726
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,560
I didn't go out with girls.

727
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,840
I graduated with the best grades
the school had ever witnessed.

728
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,200
So, you…

729
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,600
Instead of making friends,
you beat them at school?

730
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,880
I had friends,

731
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,960
but my mind was occupied
with other matters.

732
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,680
Such as being number one?

733
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,960
Are you mocking me?

734
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,680
-No.
-I can tell what you're after.

735
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,760
You want to put me in my place.

736
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,240
Write me off as a megalomaniac.

737
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,760
Truth be told,
I made sacrifices for others, not myself.

738
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,640
I'm sure you understand what it's like
to have something to fight for.

739
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,440
To be doing good.

740
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:13,280
That may be, but many people don't see
the good in what you've done.

741
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,200
That's obvious.

742
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,360
History is written by the victors.

743
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,240
That doesn't diminish the suffering.

744
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,080
Norway was a peaceful,
neutral country who was attacked.

745
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,360
A free nation forced into dictatorship.

746
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,240
Weren't you responsible for this?

747
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:39,960
I shouldered my responsibilities.
I tried to avoid a bloodbath.

748
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,080
Stalin was at our border.

749
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,160
When the Germans came,
we had no other option.

750
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,840
But to stage a coup?

751
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,840
-To oust--
-They ran away!

752
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,000
All of them! Left their people!

753
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,320
Flew the coop, like chickens!

754
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,960
Someone had to take charge!

755
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,000
I ran into him later on,
right before the war broke out.

756
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,080
We had dinner, which was nice.

757
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,800
Then we began talking
about Norway's position,

758
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,360
and everything had changed.

759
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,480
I feared he'd lost his senses.

760
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,280
He had these delusions

761
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,800
about armed communist forces
within our borders.

762
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,840
Bolshevik cells waiting
for the signal to start a revolution.

763
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,720
He claimed
that several governmental officials

764
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:49,840
were on the Russian payroll
to finance this revolution in Norway.

765
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,640
To be honest…

766
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,600
…I thought he had gone mad.

767
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,280
At any rate, he was a changed man.

768
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,640
Right. Thank you.

769
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,840
I followed… my inner compass.

770
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,920
They want to blame me for events…

771
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,200
…beyond my control.

772
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,760
To brand me as a scapegoat,
responsible for this miserable war.

773
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,120
But my intentions were good.

774
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,440
Do you understand?

775
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,480
Yes.

776
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,920
Shouldn't that amount to something
in this final reckoning?

777
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,600
That I did what I thought was right.

778
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,960
What else could I do?

779
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,400
What would you have done?

780
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,480
I have no way of knowing.

781
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,560
It's foul…

782
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:20,360
…to accuse me of persecuting the Jews!

783
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,640
I who have done such
extensive humanitarian work.

784
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,880
I am bold enough to say I've helped
more Jews than anyone else in Norway.

785
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,040
Excuse me, could you repeat that?

786
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:38,120
You heard me, I have helped
more Jews than anyone else in Norway.

787
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,400
Yet in various accounts
you claim that Judaism

788
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,160
is to blame for everything.

789
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,240
And that the "Jewish troll"
must be conquered.

790
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,680
All right.

791
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,280
What part did you play in the deportation
of Norwegian Jews, Mr. Quisling?

792
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,840
I knew nothing.

793
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,600
You knew nothing?

794
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,120
As head of the police, you knew nothing
of the nature of this mission?

795
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,240
There was talk
of them being sent to Poland.

796
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,840
-That's all I knew.
-You must have known something.

797
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,240
You've said, on record, that you visited
the camps where thousands of Jews

798
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,760
were sent in 1942.

799
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,440
Yes, and they appeared to be
regular labor camps, workplaces.

800
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,840
Nothing out of the ordinary.

801
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,080
Nothing that left an impression on me.

802
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,560
No, "nothing left an impression" on you.

803
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,480
Who knows what he must have seen?

804
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,480
Hello.

805
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,480
Where are the children?

806
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,520
Something wrong?

807
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,160
I pressed your trousers.

808
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,000
Yes?

809
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,880
I found your pass.

810
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,280
To the prison.

811
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,640
Heidi, I wanted to tell you, but…

812
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,320
-It was confidential information.
-Rubbish!

813
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:42,320
You could have just told me
who it was. I mean, Quisling!

814
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,640
It was to protect your safety,
yours and the children.

815
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,720
Safety.

816
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,360
Peder, please!

817
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,840
Yes. Berggrav felt it was for the best.

818
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,640
Of course he did.

819
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,280
Of course the bishop doesn't think
"the little lady" needs to know.

820
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,360
But you and I, we talk to each other.

821
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,000
It is my duty as a pastor.

822
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,400
What about your duties as a husband?

823
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,160
I went to their old flat.

824
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,480
Heidi…

825
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,240
What else could I do?
The Red Cross doesn't know a thing.

826
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,560
Apart from the fact
that they were on board that ship.

827
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,200
I found these in a drawer.

828
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,840
You went through their things?

829
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,680
I was just trying
to find out what had happened.

830
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,560
There's word of organized extermination.

831
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,600
People being gassed
and thrown into mass graves.

832
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,560
-You mustn't believe all the rumors.
-Why not?

833
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,920
All the things
we never expected came true.

834
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,520
-Quisling let it happen.
-You don't know that.

835
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,120
-Are you defending him?
-No, but he hasn't been convicted.

836
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,920
I… You need…

837
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,840
The world is not as black or white
as you'd like it to be.

838
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,080
You need to…

839
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,960
What if the Abrahamsens never return?

840
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,400
I don't want to hear such a thing.

841
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,720
It must have crossed your mind
that God might punish us?

842
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,600
That's enough!

843
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,440
-I need to talk about it.
-Let it go.

844
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,680
We have to move on!

845
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,040
And if they don't return?

846
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,880
-If we sent them to their death--
-They'll be back!

847
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,520
They are labor camps, where they work.
There's nothing sinister!

848
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,360
Please state your full name
and profession.

849
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,640
Leo Eitinger.

850
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,800
Date of birth, 12 December 1912.

851
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,960
I am a medical doctor,
and was granted a license in 1940.

852
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
Your witness, Schodt.

853
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:55,120
You continued to practice medicine
until 16 May 1942, correct?

854
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,160
Yes.

855
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,320
Were you arrested for being a Jew?

856
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,000
I don't know, there was no interrogation.

857
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,360
-Where were you taken?
-First, to Molde.

858
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,280
Then on to Falstad and Bredtvet.

859
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,520
Then, in February 1943,
I was taken to Germany

860
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,480
on the freighter Gotenland.

861
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,720
And then I was sent on to Auschwitz.

862
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,640
-Were the passengers mixed in sex and age?
-Yes.

863
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,840
The oldest was a man who was 80,

864
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,520
and the youngest was
one and half years old.

865
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,840
What happened when you came to Auschwitz?

866
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,440
Some of the young women were selected,

867
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,840
and the other women along
with children and the elderly,

868
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,440
were taken away in lorries.

869
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,520
Only later did we find out
what happened to them.

870
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,840
And what happened to them?

871
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,360
All the women and children
were taken to the gas chamber,

872
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:04,600
where they were killed
with hydrogen cyanide and cremated.

873
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,960
-When did this take place?
-1943.

874
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,400
Describe the process.

875
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,520
Well, in the early days,
the gas chambers were primitive.

876
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,080
A simple barrack lined
with sheet metal to seal in the gas.

877
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,720
The people were told to undress outdoors.

878
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,120
Then they were pushed inside
and the doors were locked.

879
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,120
The canisters of gas
were dropped through a skylight.

880
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,840
Later on, the chambers
were large underground facilities.

881
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,880
They had a dressing room
that looked like one at a bath house.

882
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,000
They were under the impression
that they were to shower, and undressed.

883
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,040
They entered without knowing
what awaited them.

884
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,960
It wasn't uncommon
for one group to be gassed

885
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:12,720
while the next undressed
and waited their turn naked,

886
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,560
while they heard what was going on.

887
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,920
How many were led to the gas chambers?

888
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,080
I'm not certain,

889
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,720
but anyone who couldn't work
was killed immediately.

890
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,960
Men between the ages of 20 to 45
were considered able.

891
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,880
Were people mistreated in other ways?

892
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,360
Yes.

893
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,640
Enough to kill them?

894
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,640
Yes.

895
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,480
Did you see this yourself?

896
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,400
Yes, I saw people being beaten to death.

897
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:56,840
Do you know if Jews in other camps
were treated in the same manner?

898
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,040
Yes. I know that for certain.

899
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,720
Did many people commit suicide?

900
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,400
Yes.

901
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,920
The most common way
was to step out of line

902
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
when marching to and from work.

903
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,880
You'd be shot on sight.

904
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,200
Do you know how many Norwegian Jews
were sent to Germany?

905
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,240
I think it was about 950 or 1000.

906
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,480
The exact numbers are unknown.

907
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,080
How many have returned home?

908
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,080
Twelve.

909
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,800
Did you say twelve?

910
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:37,960
Yes.

911
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,640
So, we can assume the rest are dead?

912
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,600
Yes.

913
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,160
Thank you.

914
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,440
May I say something in closing?

915
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,920
I recently read in the papers that…

916
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,360
…Quisling stated that he knew nothing
about the persecution of Jews.

917
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,760
That he wanted to help them.

918
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,640
But after the Donau sailed,
Quisling held a speech in Trondheim,

919
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,600
where he defended these actions.

920
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,120
So how can he say that he knew nothing?

921
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,600
Do you remember this speech?

922
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:34,080
Yes, I held a speech in Trondheim.

923
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,880
It was probably a lecture.

924
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,680
I lectured a lot in those days.

925
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,240
You know when you're finding your way
by the sun out in the woods,

926
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,960
and it gets dark,
and you don't know where you are,

927
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,000
where you're going, or what time it is?

928
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,840
No, I…

929
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,400
I wonder if I'm losing my mind.

930
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,840
You've always had a more…

931
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,280
…interesting inner life than me.

932
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,720
When I think of these camps,

933
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,000
the evil that prevailed…

934
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,640
The worst thing is
that I almost started to like him.

935
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:29,840
When he talks about his cause,
he seems so dedicated to doing good.

936
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,600
-Like you.
-No, nothing like me.

937
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,200
He twists right into wrong,
and truth into lies.

938
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:44,240
Even worse, the concepts
of right and wrong cease to be objective.

939
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,040
He draws you into his sense of logic,
and you think you've got it wrong.

940
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,640
Is being right so important?

941
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,560
There's a difference between the two.

942
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,600
He calls himself a Christian,
but he lacks humility.

943
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,640
That's the Nazi in him,
the leadership ideal.

944
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,800
The strong man who never has doubts.

945
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,640
Nothing Christian about that.

946
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,440
You can only show him the way.

947
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,280
You can't force him to take it.

948
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,600
<i>But what if I don't know the way?</i>

949
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,040
Are you afraid of losing your faith?

950
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,160
It's only human to have doubts, Peder.

951
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,360
It's human to lose your way.

952
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,800
We make mistakes.
That's something we just have to accept.

953
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,840
Are you asleep?

954
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,480
They're dead.

955
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Aren't they?

956
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,680
Rosa and Elias Abrahamsen?

957
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,280
They're all dead.

958
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,440
Good afternoon,
or whatever time of day it may be.

959
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,280
How can you…

960
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,880
How can you say that you knew nothing?

961
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,480
But that's your approach,

962
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:25,800
rewriting the story
to fit your twisted world view.

963
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,200
It doesn't matter to you

964
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,480
who gets sacrificed
along the way, who dies.

965
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,480
Are you referring to the deportations?

966
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,000
Of course I am! You knew!

967
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,200
You held a fiery speech
about the "Jewish problem"

968
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,040
shortly after the Donau left Oslo.

969
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,760
-You defended your actions!
-The issue was complex.

970
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:53,320
Much more complicated than that.
First, I didn't know everything.

971
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,600
You were Minister President!

972
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,080
Under great political pressure!

973
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:02,560
Innocent people were murdered!
That is indefensible!

974
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,640
War has other rules!

975
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,720
People die in wars!

976
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,880
The Bolsheviks were much worse.

977
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,400
I have proof,
I've seen it with my own eyes!

978
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,760
-Everything--
-I spent eight years

979
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,320
up to my knees in dead bodies!

980
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,280
Mothers who ate their own children!

981
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,480
Who are you to teach me about suffering?

982
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,920
I've seen it up close!

983
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,480
So how far was it all right
to go for "the greater good"?

984
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,920
How many lives is your "calling" worth?

985
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,880
Has it gone to your head?

986
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:54,640
You had Hitler's ear,
you were the King of Gimle.

987
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,000
That was nice, wasn't it?
To finally have a voice, to be heard?

988
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:04,960
Vidkun Quisling, the aid worker
overshadowed by Dr. Nansen,

989
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,160
a politician unable to capture the public.

990
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,200
And when the opportunity presented itself,
for your tiny party…

991
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,280
…you chose to get in bed with the enemy!

992
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,240
Because there was a greater enemy!

993
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,680
Had it not been for my efforts--

994
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,840
Maybe you actually believe that,
but you don't know for sure!

995
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,360
You don't!

996
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,480
How could you even think
you knew what Norway needed?

997
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,160
You don't know a thing about people.

998
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,840
You chose to exclude them.

999
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:35,440
-I didn't chose--
-Just like you cast the truth aside.

1000
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,760
History will show that I was right!

1001
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:43,240
That I acted in the best interests
of Norway and its people.

1002
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,720
That I did know what Norway needed.

1003
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:50,520
People can say whatever they please.

1004
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,480
I can handle it!

1005
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:58,920
"The strongest man in the world
is he who stands alone."

1006
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,400
Is that what you want?
To stand alone? Be my guest.

1007
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,560
We're done, you and I.

1008
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
How are you doing?

1009
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,080
Do you think…

1010
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,720
…a person can be
mistaken about their calling?

1011
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,120
Yes, I do.

1012
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,920
What happens then?

1013
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,560
Are you afraid that you were mistaken?

1014
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,720
If everything I have done was wrong…

1015
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,960
…then I could no longer live with myself.

1016
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,240
There is forgiveness to be had.

1017
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,760
I don't know…

1018
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,280
I…

1019
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,800
Could you stay a little longer?

1020
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,320
It would be nice
to not be alone right now.

1021
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:44,640
TAILOR GULSRUD
CONFECTIONER

1022
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,720
<i>It is not easy for us
to understand Vidkun Quisling.</i>

1023
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,520
<i>There is a huge difference</i>

1024
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:59,920
<i>between his perception of reality
and that of others.</i>

1025
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,600
<i>Yet it is the duty of this court
to try to comprehend his personality.</i>

1026
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:07,640
<i>Because even his extent
of subjective guilt must be proven</i>

1027
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:08,960
<i>if he is to be convicted.</i>

1028
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,360
<i>It happens that one cannot understand</i>

1029
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:19,000
<i>or even imagine the inner life
and feelings of another person,</i>

1030
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:23,920
<i>and in this case, we face such a riddle.</i>

1031
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:30,600
We have tried to solve
the riddle that is Quisling

1032
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:35,600
with the simplified explanation
that he is driven by self-glorification,

1033
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,560
the lust for power or money.

1034
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:42,240
If you maintain that this is
the key to Quisling's mindset,

1035
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,080
you know very little about this man.

1036
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,800
So, I raise the question,
what would explain

1037
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,520
how the man who excelled
during Nansen's rescue operation

1038
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,280
in Ukraine and Armenia,

1039
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:02,240
and was regarded
as being a first-class person,

1040
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:07,160
is now in this court of law
being tried for heinous crimes?

1041
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,000
As his defense attorney, it is my duty

1042
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:20,040
to ensure that the defendant's
entire personality comes to light.

1043
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:27,360
The court needs to realize
that we are indeed faced with a riddle.

1044
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,600
-How are you doing today?
-They gave me this pencil.

1045
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,960
But no sharpener, no knife.

1046
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,480
How am I to defend myself

1047
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,840
when I can't even put
my thoughts in writing?

1048
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,640
-What do you want to say?
-To explain my motives.

1049
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:55,160
What shaped me, my upbringing in Fyresdal.

1050
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,880
My patriotism.

1051
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,760
My time at the Military Academy.
My political efforts.

1052
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:06,200
Maybe it ought to be more about
what you could have done differently?

1053
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,600
Am I not to defend myself?

1054
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,640
You will be convicted
regardless of your explanations.

1055
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,160
The court requires atonement.

1056
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,280
-Atonement?
-That's right, humility.

1057
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:24,600
Humility. I cannot waver in court!
I need to be clear and concise.

1058
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:32,320
No one likes to admit they were wrong,
but if it could save your life?

1059
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,040
You humbled yourself before me.

1060
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,360
Humility…

1061
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:02,800
You have a powerful way with words.
You'll figure it out.

1062
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,200
Till next time.

1063
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,080
Till next time.

1064
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,080
Thank you.

1065
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,440
Thank you very much.

1066
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,480
You're very quiet.

1067
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,920
Your attorney Bergh asked me
to urge you to show humility.

1068
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,960
He wants you to say you're sorry.

1069
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,800
-What do you think?
-Me?

1070
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,920
Do not bow down to them.

1071
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,520
You hear me?

1072
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,040
Do not let those barbarians break you.

1073
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,840
There's no one as strong as you.

1074
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,560
I knew that as soon as I laid eyes on you.

1075
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:25,000
There is a man who will not be broken!

1076
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,240
That's what I thought.

1077
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,960
You are Captain Quisling.

1078
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,480
My Captain Quisling.

1079
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,640
They will understand.

1080
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,080
Isn't that right?

1081
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,240
You will make them understand.

1082
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,680
<i>That I, who faithfully served my country,</i>

1083
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,720
<i>should be accused of treason,</i>

1084
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:14,840
<i>while those who are truly
responsible for this misfortune…</i>

1085
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:22,640
…who sabotaged the armed forces,
who drove us into the war, go free.

1086
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,720
They may rejoice and say "Hah!

1087
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,880
We got him in the end!"

1088
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,680
I aimed to do good.

1089
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,120
My actions…

1090
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,840
…have been solely
for the good of my own people,

1091
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,000
and for the advancement
of the Kingdom of God on Earth

1092
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,840
that Jesus Christ came to establish.

1093
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:55,320
I am not aware of doing anything
to harm the people of Norway.

1094
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,800
But I have done my utmost to keep

1095
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,400
the Nordic countries
from becoming a theatre of war.

1096
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,480
Which is exactly
what I am accused of here.

1097
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,280
I have prevented a civil war,

1098
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,040
tried to remedy
the invasion and occupation,

1099
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:19,120
the enormous misfortunes
they caused the Norwegian people.

1100
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,760
Do you have children?

1101
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,320
Neither do I.

1102
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,720
A verdict is ready for disclosure.

1103
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:53,280
Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Quisling

1104
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:57,560
is hereby sentenced to death for crimes
against the Military Penal Code,

1105
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:00,480
section 80, numbers 1, 2, and 3.

1106
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,400
Compare section 9, number 1
and the Civil Penal Code 12…

1107
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,840
Section 80 of the Military Penal Code
is as follows,

1108
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,360
"A person is charged with treason…"

1109
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,960
Do you understand the verdict?

1110
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,200
Yes.

1111
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,840
The High Court has come to its conclusion.

1112
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,400
You may petition the Supreme Court
should you deem the verdict too harsh,

1113
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,240
in the event of unjust process,

1114
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,800
or that the law
has been incorrectly applied.

1115
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,040
You may request an appeal now,
or take some time to think it over.

1116
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,920
I wish to file an appeal
before the Supreme Court.

1117
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,800
That concludes this session.

1118
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,480
Court adjourned.

1119
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:31,200
-Mrs. Quisling…
-Do not disturb me.

1120
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,200
Have you heard the verdict?

1121
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:42,800
Of course, but I cannot accept it.

1122
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,480
I am a fighter, Mr. Olsen.

1123
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:50,640
It's what one does. To the last bullet.

1124
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:55,520
I've tried to call our friends,
but they are all in prison.

1125
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,040
So, I'm writing letters instead.
Here, I'm writing to…

1126
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:03,640
I'm writing to Gerhardsen.
I'm writing to General Ruge.

1127
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,640
To Stalin. Stalin.

1128
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,960
-Stalin?
-Yes.

1129
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,160
He's a countryman of mine,
he valued our efforts in Ukraine.

1130
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,760
What do you think he can do?

1131
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,560
I'm asking for mercy.

1132
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:29,240
Someone must be capable
of mercy even after a war.

1133
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,800
They mustn't shoot him.

1134
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,200
I can't lose him.

1135
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:42,800
I was nothing before I met him.

1136
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,400
A penniless secretary
from a country without a future.

1137
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,240
A nobody.

1138
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:53,480
But in his eyes, I was someone.

1139
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:57,240
I was Maria Pasek,
a descendant of Vikings.

1140
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,840
The Minister President's wife.

1141
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:03,120
What am I to do without him? I am nothing!

1142
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,240
Don't you understand? A lie…

1143
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:45,400
There are many who support you.

1144
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,680
I've received letters.

1145
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:56,160
And I've written
to Prime Minister Gerhardsen.

1146
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:58,800
With a plea for you.

1147
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,280
And General Ruge.

1148
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:04,640
And the King.

1149
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,000
You wrote to the King?

1150
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,160
We've met,
when you were Minister for Defense.

1151
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:14,360
That was long ago, in 1932.

1152
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,120
I even danced with him.

1153
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:20,240
He liked you.

1154
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:22,880
Really?

1155
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,600
There must be something more I can do.

1156
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:38,120
There must be!

1157
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:49,240
What exactly am I supposed to let go of?

1158
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,920
My guilty conscience?

1159
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,520
God?

1160
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,640
Is that it?

1161
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,080
Is that what you do?

1162
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:03,280
I can't see it like that.

1163
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,040
Then…

1164
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,280
If I opened that door,
I wouldn't know where I'd end up.

1165
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:12,600
Here, perhaps.

1166
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,600
Where I am.

1167
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:20,160
But my job is to instill hope in others.

1168
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:23,600
If I lose hope myself, then…

1169
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:29,400
Here we have a man
who is condemned to die.

1170
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,920
He is lost, damned.

1171
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,520
But if I can get through to him,
find a flicker of light, or hope…

1172
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,040
Your faith will be restored?

1173
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,920
I just want to help him to be at peace.

1174
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,360
It's a lovely thought, Peder.

1175
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,760
But how can you help others,
if you're not at peace yourself?

1176
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,840
You write such lovely letters.

1177
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:33,040
"We are as one.
That's how it was, and how it will be.

1178
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,480
Never allow yourself
to believe it is otherwise.

1179
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:41,320
And should I be asleep
or have passed to the other side…

1180
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,840
…the part of me that never dies
will always be with you…

1181
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:51,680
…my eternal and immortal beloved."

1182
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,800
I would…

1183
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,440
I wish…

1184
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,080
…you could say this.

1185
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,880
What you wrote.

1186
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,080
These words…

1187
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:14,080
That you would look at me and say them.

1188
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,720
So I could tell that you meant it.

1189
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,800
I…

1190
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:21,840
I…

1191
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,480
Please?

1192
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,280
Just this one time?

1193
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,200
Could you please do it?

1194
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:40,080
-Tell me you love me!
-I do…

1195
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:42,960
Please!

1196
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:45,680
Maria…

1197
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,320
I…

1198
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:50,320
I…

1199
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,440
-Maria, it would only sound absurd.
-Absurd?

1200
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:02,400
What's holding you back?

1201
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,680
I mean everything I wrote.

1202
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:07,000
-I put it all in writing for you.
-No.

1203
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,320
Do you want me to help him?

1204
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:23,680
Because I don't know
if I can do it all alone.

1205
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,040
Heidi. I-- I need you.

1206
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,040
Thank you.

1207
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,960
Yes, of course.

1208
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,760
Pardon has been denied. So…

1209
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:49,840
I have to go to him.

1210
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,480
The Pharisee and the Tax Collector.

1211
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,840
That's where the Bible opened.

1212
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,360
Any word?

1213
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,400
Unfortunately, your pardon was denied.

1214
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:30,480
Neither the King, the Prime Minister,
nor any others wish to pardon you.

1215
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,440
So, a decision was reached.

1216
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:37,840
How much time do I have?

1217
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:40,600
It will take place tonight.

1218
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:44,440
Tonight?

1219
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:48,640
I'll stay here
with you as long as you wish.

1220
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:54,520
I assume this must
be happening for a reason.

1221
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:57,360
Maria…

1222
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,080
Will you promise
to look after Maria for me?

1223
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:05,920
Yes.

1224
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:10,000
She appreciates
the conversations you've had.

1225
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,880
Would you like us
to read something together?

1226
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,000
I don't know…

1227
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,880
Would you like to take communion?

1228
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,080
No, no. Not that…

1229
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:32,000
It's good to have one's sins forgiven.

1230
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:37,560
You don't understand, I am…

1231
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:40,920
…innocent.

1232
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,080
I have nothing to confess.

1233
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:00,080
Everyone has something to confess.

1234
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:05,120
Remember when we discussed
the Pharisee and the Tax Collector?

1235
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,160
You dismissed it
as "Sunday School theology".

1236
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,720
And I felt foolish.

1237
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:16,280
But it's a parable for children
because it happens to be a simple truth.

1238
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,400
He who is closest to God, is he who…

1239
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,360
…can admit his wrongdoings.

1240
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,560
His weaknesses.

1241
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:30,800
His humanity.

1242
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:36,360
I have no regrets.

1243
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:38,480
None.

1244
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,640
But you told me…

1245
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:44,000
You wondered if you had been wrong.

1246
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,080
About your calling.

1247
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:48,280
Yes.

1248
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,480
Yes.

1249
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,480
I was blinded by my love for Norway.

1250
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:03,000
I should have dedicated myself
to weightier pursuits.

1251
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:07,040
This might not be the time
to focus on what might have been.

1252
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,680
Had I only been more active
on the political scene…

1253
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:17,080
…I could have averted the war,
I saw it coming.

1254
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:21,040
Please, you don't have
to defend yourself to me.

1255
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:22,320
It's in the scriptures.

1256
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:25,240
"Whoever hates me,
hates my father as well.

1257
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,480
If I had not done among them
the works no one else did,

1258
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,760
they would not be guilty of sin.

1259
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:35,920
But now they have seen the deeds
and hated both me and my father.

1260
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,600
But this happened
that the word might be fulfilled

1261
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:42,160
which is written in their law.
They hated me without a cause.

1262
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:46,680
They hated me without a cause--"

1263
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,640
Vidkun.

1264
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,680
God doesn't hate.

1265
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,280
God is love.

1266
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:59,600
The Jews rejected Jesus Christ
for Barabbas, a robber.

1267
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,920
The same choice the world faces today.

1268
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,240
Many would prefer a Barabbas
to a Messiah any day.

1269
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:09,080
I cannot accept such a thing.

1270
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,640
I need to fight!

1271
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:13,800
To the very end.

1272
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:19,760
I'll be more dangerous after my death.

1273
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:23,440
You're no Messiah, Vidkun.

1274
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,640
You're a human being.
A sinner, just like the rest of us.

1275
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:30,000
-It's time for you to go.
-No, I'm not going anywhere.

1276
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:33,320
Not until you make your peace with God.

1277
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:35,040
I want to be alone.

1278
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,960
-No, I'm staying.
-Go now!

1279
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,920
-Do you hear me?
-Please--

1280
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,560
-Get out of here!
-Please listen to me.

1281
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,280
Go now!

1282
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,800
I am the Pharisee.

1283
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:54,840
What was that?

1284
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:03,960
You asked which one of us was
the tax collector or the Pharisee.

1285
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:05,120
You were right.

1286
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,720
I…

1287
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,960
I haven't taken an honest look at myself.

1288
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:23,720
An elderly Jewish couple
stayed with us, in hiding.

1289
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,680
Rosa and Elias Abrahamsen.

1290
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:36,560
We… kept a crate of apples in there.

1291
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,520
And one night…

1292
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:44,880
…our daughter Liv sneaked upstairs
to get one and she saw them.

1293
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:50,880
She was terrified,
thought they were trolls.

1294
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:56,880
I calmed her down
and told her it was just a dream.

1295
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,480
But I couldn't stop thinking

1296
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:05,360
that she might mention
these "trolls" to some…

1297
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,360
…classmate at school.

1298
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:16,880
So, I had them committed
to Lovisenberg as being infectious.

1299
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:22,600
Hoping… that would trick the police.

1300
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,440
But they were caught.

1301
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:44,520
Dragged away,
begging and pleading for mercy.

1302
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,640
Heidi saw it all from our kitchen window.

1303
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,480
They died in Auschwitz.

1304
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,320
You did what you had to do.

1305
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:09,800
No, I made a choice.

1306
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:12,200
I could have saved them, but…

1307
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:20,520
I chose to protect myself and my family
before helping two people in need.

1308
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:27,080
Anyone would have done
the same in your situation.

1309
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:31,600
That's what I've been telling myself,
that I had the best intentions.

1310
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:37,080
But nevertheless,
my choice cost them their lives.

1311
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:45,520
Why are you telling me this?

1312
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:50,840
Because I acted in the same way as you,
by defending my actions.

1313
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,760
All because I was afraid,
because I lost my way…

1314
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:58,560
I lost faith that God
would be there to save me.

1315
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,760
I didn't trust in the Lord,
I almost lost my faith.

1316
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,280
Vidkun…

1317
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,680
…do you have the courage
to trust in the Lord?

1318
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:19,800
Do you trust me?

1319
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:28,600
Then you should ask
the Lord to forgive your sins.

1320
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:32,640
Then you must do as the tax collector.

1321
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,400
Say, "God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

1322
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,800
Say it to God.

1323
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,120
Don't be afraid to say it.

1324
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:50,920
God will not forsake you.

1325
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:53,600
I will not forsake you.

1326
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:33,800
Lord, show mercy and forgive me.

1327
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:42,480
God, forgive my sins.

1328
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:47,040
My sins…

1329
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:04,040
The body of Christ.

1330
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,840
The blood of Christ.

1331
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:20,240
The body of Christ.

1332
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,760
The blood of Christ.

1333
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:35,480
Christ, crucified and risen again,

1334
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:39,840
offered us his body and blood,
that he gave to atone for our sins.

1335
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,920
To strengthen us and keep us strong,
as we maintain the belief of eternal life.

1336
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,240
Peace be with you.

1337
02:10:59,080 --> 02:10:59,960
Excuse me.

1338
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:06,280
Your wife came by and dropped this off.

1339
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:09,040
I see.

1340
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:35,280
My wife says hello.

1341
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:38,840
Right.

1342
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,240
Thanks.

1343
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:53,800
Real coffee?

1344
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:58,160
With a kick like gunpowder.

1345
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,320
More of your humor?

1346
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:07,080
What? No, I didn't mean--

1347
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,360
"A kick like gunpowder?"

1348
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:15,680
"A kick like gunpowder…"

1349
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,640
Well then.

1350
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,160
I will most certainly go to sleep tonight.

1351
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,040
I've been told to make you ready.

1352
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,800
May I take over?

1353
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:46,600
It's time.

1354
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:17,880
<i>"The hour is come.</i>

1355
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,240
<i>Behold…</i>

1356
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,480
<i>…the Son of Man is betrayed
into the hands of sinners."</i>

1357
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:39,000
<i>"And the soldiers led him away…</i>

1358
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:44,520
<i>…into the castle-- and they called
together the whole band of guards.</i>

1359
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:49,280
<i>And they clothed him with purple…</i>

1360
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:54,760
<i>…and plaited a crown of thorns
which they put about his head."</i>

1361
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,360
And led me out to crucify me.

1362
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:14,800
And they brought me
unto the place Golgotha.

1363
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:19,600
It was the third hour,
and they crucified me.

1364
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:26,640
"And at the ninth hour,
Jesus cried with a loud voice…

1365
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:34,320
…'My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?'"

1366
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,360
"Father…

1367
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:46,480
…forgive them…

1368
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:52,320
…for they know not what they do."

1369
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,600
Mr. Quisling.

1370
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:27,520
The time has come.

1371
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Goodbye.

1372
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:11,320
I wish to look death in the eye.

1373
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:14,120
I wish to look death in the eye!

1374
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:16,840
These are the rules.

1375
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:54,879
Peder…

1376
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:44,120
I am innocent!

1377
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:49,440
You are about to shoot an innocent man!

1378
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:18,640
Vidkun Quisling was arrested on 9 May
and executed on 24 October 1945.

1379
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:28,360
Maria Quisling lived a secluded life
as "Mrs. Bang" and died in 1980.

1380
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:35,160
Peder Olsen came to be
an authority in his fields,

1381
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:38,720
both psychiatry and ministry.

1382
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,880
Peder Olsen died in 1977.

1383
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:47,200
This film was partly inspired
by the diaries of Peder and Heidi Olsen.

1384
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:21,000
{\an8}<i>Quisling: The Final Days</i>
is based on several diaries,

1385
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:23,920
{\an8}witnesses and historical interpretations.

1386
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,760
The movie is based on real events,
but it's not a documentary.

1387
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:31,520
It shows one truth.
There might be other truths out there.
