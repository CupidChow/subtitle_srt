No. I waited for a while, but nobody came.

9
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:10,762
I see. The store out front was closed,

10
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:12,533
so I had to go to the edge of town.

You said there are other kids like you there.

27
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:18,371
They're not doing anything, but you escaped on your own.

If you get caught escaping, they practically beat you to death.

If I would've been a bit lazier,

144
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,551
he would be lying on a beach somewhere in Southeast Asia,

145

where the evidence dashcam footage came from?

Yes, of course.

155
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:51,811
The owner of the car was...

156
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,482
a 27-year-old male, a delivery man.

157

Then was it a motorcycle, not a car?

Yes, correct.

When Jung Man Chun was kidnapping Baek Ji Eun,

160

the motorcycle driver was delivering a roast chicken.

161

Rain was pouring down,

162

and Jung Man Chun had Baek Ji Eun wrapped up in a raincoat,

163
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,561
so he didn't realize how serious the situation was.

164
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,002
But the action cam on his helmet...

165
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:15,271
recorded this scene without fail.

168
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:23,082
compared to security cameras.

169
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,452
Baek Ji Eun's body was found...

170
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,311
a week after she was murdered.

171
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,382
How was it possible for this footage to still exist?

172
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,122
We got lucky.

173
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,452
There happened to be an accident during a delivery,

174
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,492
so the delivery man submitted the footage to customer service.

175
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,462
And by the way, I didn't find this footage.

176
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,602
It was Detective Kang of Violent Crimes Team Four...

177
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:48,031
who is an elite officer and a graduate of the Police University.

178
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,071
I barely managed to become a police officer.

179
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,112
He's funny.

180
00:12:58,482 --> 00:12:59,512
Your Honor.

181
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,122
There are two pieces of hard evidence.

182
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,781
A video of Jung Man Chun kidnapping the victim,

183
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,791
and the bloodstain left on the knife belonging to him.

184
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,421
- Is that true? - My goodness.

185
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,661
However, I could only be sure that Jung Man Chun was the killer...

186
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:19,002
because of his unique crime methods.

187
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,901
I guess some might call it...

188
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,472
his signature.

189
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,712
It's over there.

190
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,612
By the way, Detective.

191
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,952
Don't tell Man Chun that I told you about this place.

192
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:38,921
If he finds out that I betrayed him,

193
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:41,592
he'll rip my mouth apart just like he did to that girl.

194
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,161
How did you know that was what happened to Baek Ji Eun?

195
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,462
I...

196
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:49,862
Is that what happened to Mr. Baek's daughter too?

197
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,531
What are you saying?

198
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,332
Weren't you talking about Baek Ji Eun?

199
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:00,372
Where is that woman you just mentioned?

200
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:22,862
Police.

201
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,842
Do you know Jung Man Chun?

202
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,212
Could you please take off your mask?

203
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,132
(Woman who lives with Jung Man Chun)

204
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,602
- Oh, my gosh. - Her mouth...

205
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,931
- Gosh. - How could he?

206
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:03,102
Jung Man Chun, with no hesitation,

207
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,441
tied this woman to a chair,

208
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,041
and ripped apart this woman's mouth, because she had ignored him.

209
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,482
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

210
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:11,541
- He's sick. - What a scumbag.

211
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,191
(Similarities)

212
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,362
He did not kill her,

213
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:28,232
but the crime method was the exact same as with Baek Ji Eun.

214
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:31,262
My gosh.

215
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:33,372
Disgusting.

216
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,671
He's a killer!

217
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,202
He's a murderer.

218
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:40,811
My gosh.

219
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,811
- That's not true. - How could he do such a thing?

220
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:49,551
I didn't kill Mr. Baek's daughter.

221
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:53,352
That detective made all of this up.

222
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,092
Jurors...

223
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:59,431
Please believe me.

224
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,732
I didn't kill anyone.

225
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,031
The person who killed that woman...

226
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:07,972
is this detective.

227
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:11,712
This detective is a murderer.

228
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:14,071
- Nonsense! - He's a liar!

229
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,911
He's guilty!

230
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:18,281
- Take him away! - He's guilty!

231
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,452
Shut him up!

232
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,882
There's no way that's true.

233
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,952
What kind of monster is he?

234
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,901
Was this all you had in mind...

235
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,401
when you asked for a jury trial?

236
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:44,901
Nobody would believe you if you simply denied your charges,

237
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,512
so you wanted to bring someone down with you?

238
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,112
I'm a detective.

239
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,582
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

240
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,191
Is there a rule that says detectives can't be killers?

241
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:09,732
Be thankful I don't have a gun on me.

242
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,012
Detective Ryu Sung Jun.

243
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,942
Watch your back.

244
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,821
(Juror 6, Juror 7)

245
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,831
(Juror 2)

246
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:50,242
(Juror 3)

247
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,412
My gosh.

248
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,932
Excuse me... Juror Five?

249
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,662
Are you feeling ill?

250
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:18,262
You're sweating a lot. You don't look so good.

251
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,942
This is taking forever.

252
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,012
Aren't we going home?

253
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,912
I'd love to do that too,

254
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,311
but one person hasn't decided yet.

255
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,652
Miss.

256
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:37,682
Are you not done yet?

257
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,452
I'm not a miss.

258
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,692
Are you married?

259
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,692
Yes?

260
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,202
I'm not a miss, I'm a juror. Number Eight.

261
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,702
Sorry, I'm almost done.

262
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,432
Finish reading, then.

263
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:58,041
It wouldn't be bad to look as if we're deliberating.

264
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:01,881
We should take time on issues that are worth debating over.

265
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,412
When you're my age,

266
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:06,051
if you see someone for just five minutes,

267
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:08,252
you can tell right away,

268
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:10,351
"Oh, that's what the person's like."

269
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,621
You can tell just from one's face.

270
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,192
This case is like...

271
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:19,432
someone took in a stray dog and gave it food and shelter,

272
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:22,531
and it bit the owner's daughter because it felt hungry.

273
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,262
It's just like that.

274
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:27,902
How distraught would the parents be?

275
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,442
They must feel terrible.

276
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,142
If I were to think that happened to my daughter...

277
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,111
Gosh. Just the thought alone is dreadful enough.

278
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:38,851
But instead of showing remorse,

279
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:42,121
he tried to put the blame on someone else.

280
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:44,752
How flustered do you think the detective must've felt?

281
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,851
That's why we must ban such people...

282
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:49,091
from entering the country in the first place.

283
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:50,962
How are we to know...

284
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,291
if he killed elsewhere and fled over here?

285
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:55,061
It's possible.

286
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,071
I still feel so cold.

287
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:02,502
The feeling of death is too strong.

288
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,041
Juror Eight, is something bothering you?

289
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,081
- Yes. - What is it?

290
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:18,281
"I'm not the killer. Believe me."

291
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,962
When the defendant said that, it sounded sincere.

292
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,621
Gosh.

293
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,992
You're naive.

294
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:30,531
I must feel for him because I've been wronged many times.

295
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:34,871
When I was in school, whenever cash went missing,

296
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:36,801
the kids automatically suspected me.

297
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,071
Because I was poor and fatherless,

298
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,912
I naturally had to be the thief because that was their logic.

299
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,781
That's how their parents thought.

300
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,952
What we think is common sense...

301
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,851
is often prejudice packaged to look like common sense.

302
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,692
To be honest, a few of you here think like this.

303
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,561
"He's Korean-Chinese, so he'll be the killer."

304
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,472
I'm checking to see if I missed anything.

305
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,442
You have a point.

306
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,611
(Photos from when the body was found)

307
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:17,841
(Skin on side of mouth cut)

308
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:29,892
Muyoung Police Station's Detective Ryu Sung Jun. It was him.

309
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,162
He killed Mr. Baek's daughter.

310
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:37,101
Your honor.

311
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,702
The jury reached a verdict.

312
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,172
Okay.

313
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,912
(Court)

314
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,311
I will read the jury's verdict.

315
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:24,111
The nine jurors unanimously said...

316
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:27,281
defendant Jung Man Chun is guilty.

317
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:31,422
Okay.

318
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:33,722
No.

319
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:36,762
This is nonsense.

320
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:41,192
Jurors. Why didn't you believe me?

321
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,432
Shouldn't you believe the person who says they're wronged?

322
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:50,371
Is it because I'm Korean-Chinese?

323
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,111
You Korean people!

324
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,811
You called us countrymen.

325
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:59,482
If we're countrymen, you should believe me!

326
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:01,351
What a joke.

327
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:04,922
That's enough. The more you say, the worse it'll be for you.

328
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,091
What a useless punk.

329
00:23:15,502 --> 00:23:16,531
Here's the sentence.

330
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,371
Defendant, please stand.

331
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,012
The sentence.

332
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:35,111
Defendant Jung Man Chun...

333
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,121
is sentenced to life in prison.

334
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,962
Nice. The result I hoped for.

335
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:51,031
Here's the reasoning.

336
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:55,571
Defendant Jung Man Chun was not paid on time by Hope Foods'...

337
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:57,172
CEO Baek Moon Kang.

338
00:23:57,442 --> 00:24:00,371
To gain revenge, he murdered Baek Moon Kang's daughter,

339
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:03,341
and desecrated her body in a cruel manner.

340
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,182
My gosh.

341
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:11,851
You!

342
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:17,621
The victim Baek Ji Eun...

343
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:19,432
died not knowing why on her 20th birthday.

344
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,031
The day which she should've been the happiest.

345
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,732
Her family who loved her more than life itself...

346
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,672
will spend the rest of their lives with a wound that'll never heal.

347
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:27,801
You scumbag!

348
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:34,012
You caused a whole family a wound they'll never recover from,

349
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,742
and you show no remorse at all.

350
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,952
This court commands you be separated from society forever.

351
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,702
Let go of me. Let go!

352
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:02,202
Keep still!

353
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:05,341
Let go.

354
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,512
Let go.

355
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,811
Cuff him.

356
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:12,512
Gosh.

357
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,212
Darn it.

358
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,152
Let me go!

359
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,722
Lock him up!

360
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,392
I hope this sentence offers some peace and comfort...

361
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:25,392
to the victim's family.

362
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:29,101
You!

363
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,271
Judge!

364
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:42,841
You jurors too.

365
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,611
Remember this day clearly.

366
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:49,922
You will all die because of...

367
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:52,821
what you did today.

368
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,321
Okay?

369
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:10,271
Gosh. He's so scary. I'm scared.

370
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,512
What a freak.

371
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:14,242
Goodness.

372
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,351
Darn it!

373
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,621
Jung Man Chun!

374
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,331
The jurors of the trial...

375
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:43,472
for Joker Murder culprit Jung Man Chun...

376
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:45,002
sentenced him to life in prison.

377
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,371
Jung Man Chun was found guilty by a unanimous decision,

378
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:49,381
and he objected...

379
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,551
Why is every channel talking about the murderer?

380
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:57,652
Your hearing was unusually in the candidate's favor.

381
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,091
You got overshadowed by your two sons.

382
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,021
It's more of a relief it went over quietly.

383
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,762
I didn't kill her!

384
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:07,462
I didn't kill the girl!

385
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:08,732
I didn't kill her!

386
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:11,002
Wait, that man...

387
00:27:12,902 --> 00:27:15,801
(Jung Man Chun is being transported)

388
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,642
What? Did you see someone you know?

389
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:20,771
No, it's nothing.

390
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:28,081
(With fair judgment we create a warmer world.)

391
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,262
Goodness, that almost knocked ten years off my lifespan.

392
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:47,271
You all did well.

393
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:48,902
It's a shame to part like this.

394
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:50,472
How about we have dinner?

395
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:52,472
Yes, I'm starving.

396
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:54,172
I'd prefer a drink.

397
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,541
Come to my establishment. I'll treat you all.

398
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,781
Sounds great.

399
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,652
Let's all go to Juror Six's place.

400
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:02,521
- Let's go. - I love it.

401
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:16,762
You won't come with us?

402
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,472
Join us.

403
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,752
How does he not have a single flaw?

404
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:50,561
Hey, Sung Hoon.

405
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:54,702
Did you get hurt?

406
00:28:57,642 --> 00:29:00,012
If you didn't, that's good. I was just wondering.

407
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,041
Do you want me to thank you?

408
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,291
It's not about that.

409
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:25,061
About earlier. Why do you think Jung Man Chun did that?

410
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:29,101
What kind of reason would a bad guy have for doing something bad?

411
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:34,472
Also, if that jerk hurt you in the smallest way,

412
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,841
I was going to execute a death sentence.

413
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,341
That evil little jerk.

414
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,222
Baek Ji Eun.

415
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,252
What about her?

416
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:50,462
Was it you?

417
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:53,262
Did you do it?

418
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:01,371
You're...

419
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:04,702
kidding, right?

420
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,041
Do I look like I'm kidding?

421
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,521
Think about why...

422
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:22,861
I can't seem to let go of something a murderer like Jung Man Chun said.

423
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,061
That's because you don't trust me.

424
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:37,402
Never mind.

425
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:40,841
Forget it.

426
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,182
I only ask for one thing from you.

427
00:30:45,482 --> 00:30:47,212
Never sit in the defendant's seat.

428
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,551
Okay.

429
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:59,162
(Ministry of Justice)

430
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:08,702
Goodness.

431
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:13,212
We almost lost our jobs today.

432
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:15,871
There's still a lot of time before my kids go to college.

433
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:17,682
I'd be in trouble if I lost my job now.

434
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,851
I know.

435
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,682
Gosh, that little inhumane punk.

436
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:24,821
Gosh.

437
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:53,281
There was a commotion because he tried to get revenge,

438
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,482
but that's that, and we're us.

439
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:58,182
Let's just enjoy our meal. Good job, everyone.

440
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,291
Yes. Good job, everyone.

441
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:03,962
It seems we were meant to meet each other.

442
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:06,531
- Shall we introduce ourselves? - Let's do that.

443
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:10,031
Calling each other by a number makes me feel like a prisoner.

444
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:11,462
Right.

445
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,672
We'll start here and go counter-clockwise.

446
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:17,801
Let's have our foreman start.

00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:07,051
- I will be sure to call you! - Me too!

472
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:42,582
I've never had a day I was so proud of like today.

473
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,781
It felt like I became a model citizen.

474
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:49,421
I felt like g.o.d. You know, a deity.

475
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:53,162
Maybe I should've become a judge instead of a producer.

476
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:57,102
By the way, the judge seemed really young.

477
00:34:57,102 --> 00:34:58,432
It must be a nice job to have.

You're right.

480
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:05,501
After my experience today, I think they should consider...

481
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,012
- making a policy for a jury system. - Right? I agree.

482
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:12,341
Sir. Please have a drink.

483
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,912
I'll pour you a drink.

484
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,182
- I have to drive. - Oh, that's right. I'll drink then.

485
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:20,452
The sashimi is nice and chewy. It must be wild-caught.

486
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,722
So cold.

487
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,531
Why is it so cold?

488
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,992
Do I have a cold?

- Do you want to put this on? - What?

490

Oh, my. Thank you.

491
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,651
- You have such a clean soul. - "Soul?"

492
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:48,881
Don't worry about it.

493
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:52,821
Did you say you worked for a company?

494
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:55,622
- May I ask what you do? - Oh, I...

500
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,171
I should be asking you that instead. What are you doing?

501
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,042
I can't take selfies with my own phone?

502
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:54,012
I don't like being photographed,

503
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:57,651
so make sure I don't come out. Okay?

504

Yes, I asked my landlady to fix it in the morning.

Yes.

Did I check? No, I didn't.

517

I'm sure she'll fix it for me.

518
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:32,632
I wouldn't say my landlady is amazing,

519
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:34,101
but she's not that cheap.

520

Right.

00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:39,811
Really? Okay, I'll let you go then.

522

All right. Take it easy, Mom. Bye.

523

Not amazing but not cheap?

524
00:38:50,052 --> 00:38:52,951
Does that make her a good person or not?

525
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:56,192
Just an average person, I'd say.

666

Thank you for your concern.

You take care too, Judge Ryu.

What's this?

671
00:50:41,002 --> 00:50:42,701
Gosh, this is harsh.

672
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:44,931
I know there's nothing to steal here,

673
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:47,132
but still, a woman lives alone here.

Hello?

676
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:34,522
Yes, Judge Ryu. I just got home.

677
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:38,451
I should've replied right away. I'm sorry.

678
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:41,261
No worries. I'm just glad to hear you got home safe.

679

- Head in. - Let's go.

684
00:53:24,056 --> 00:53:25,427
Go.

685
00:53:25,697 --> 00:53:27,596
Don't come up here. Get back down!

686
00:53:27,596 --> 00:53:29,697
- Why are you here? Get back down! - Calm down.

687
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,067
- Mr. Jung. - Mr. Jung.

688

- Wait! - Don't do that.

689

- Mr. Jung. Calm down. - Let's talk this through.

I don't have anything to say.

- Don't move! - Hold it!

696
00:53:50,016 --> 00:53:52,257
Should I do it?

697
00:53:56,826 --> 00:53:58,357
Get down! It's dangerous!

698
00:53:58,357 --> 00:54:00,197
Come on! Detective Na!

699
00:54:00,197 --> 00:54:01,467
Hurry.

700
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:05,136
Come on. Good.

701
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:06,697
He just got life in prison.

702
00:54:06,697 --> 00:54:08,067
Why did you tell him to go home?

703
00:54:08,067 --> 00:54:09,806
- Captain. - Good, you're here.

704
00:54:09,806 --> 00:54:12,436
- Hey, who's the hostage? - It's Cho Eun Ki.

705
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:14,007
She's a 29-year-old woman who lives alone in the rooftop room.

706
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:15,047
What's her relationship with Jung Man Chun?

707
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,107
She was one of the jurors in his jury trial.

708
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:18,177
A juror?

709
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:20,947
How did he find out she lived here?

710
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:22,286
That's not important right now.

711
00:54:22,286 --> 00:54:23,686
I'll go up and arrest him this instant.

712
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:24,886
- No! - No!

713
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,056
He's going berserk. He just set a fire.

714
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:29,357
The safety of the hostage is more important than Jung Man Chun.

715
00:54:29,357 --> 00:54:31,096
That's why we have to go in right now!

716
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,397
That jerk, Jung Man Chun,

717
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:34,596
killed an innocent woman over 7,000 dollars.

718
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:36,596
Would he let a juror go when she said he was guilty?

719
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:39,297
Calm down. If he was going to kill her, he'd have done it already.

720
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:41,837
For now, let's leave it to the professionals. Okay?

721
00:54:42,306 --> 00:54:45,107
Jung Man Chun is not someone you can reason with!

722
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:46,706
What kind of negotiations can you make with a knife wielding lunatic?

723
00:54:46,706 --> 00:54:48,277
You just shut your mouth!

724
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:50,346
- Let's rethink our plan, okay? - Yes, sir.

725
00:54:50,346 --> 00:54:53,277
He's putting up too much resistance to our direct approach.

726
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:55,947
So, Detective Na. You take the right side.

727
00:54:56,346 --> 00:54:58,087
- You two take the left. - Yes, sir.

728
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,317
And you, Sung Jun...

729
00:55:00,016 --> 00:55:02,226
That punk. Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

730
00:55:09,596 --> 00:55:11,197
Hey! Jung Man Chun!

731
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:13,397
Nobody move!

732
00:55:16,206 --> 00:55:19,507
If you try anything stupid, I'll slice her throat.

733
00:55:20,806 --> 00:55:21,907
Mr. Jung.

734
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:23,706
Calm down.

735
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:27,547
You can see me, right? I am not armed.

736
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:29,786
I am not here to arrest you.

737
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:31,686
I am here to listen to you.

738
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:33,587
All of you, get rid of your guns.

739
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,757
Get rid of your guns!

740
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:38,927
Put them down.

741
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,857
Hurry. Put them down.

742
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:58,846
Mr. Jung. You seem very angry.

743
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,717
Will you tell me why you're so angry?

744
00:56:02,346 --> 00:56:05,157
Tell me anything you want to say.

745
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:09,027
I won't move an inch from this spot. I'll just listen.

746
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:30,306
Please let her go first.

747
00:56:30,507 --> 00:56:32,346
She didn't do anything wrong.

748
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:34,317
Shut your mouth.

749
00:56:35,346 --> 00:56:36,516
The moment I let her go,

750
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:41,357
you'll shoot me down. Did you think I wouldn't know that?

751
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:43,257
I told them we couldn't negotiate with him.

752
00:56:44,657 --> 00:56:46,226
I only have one request!

753
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:50,226
Tell the President to annul the court's decision in an hour.

754
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:53,136
Or else, this woman dies.

755
00:56:53,136 --> 00:56:54,366
That scumbag...

756
00:56:58,076 --> 00:56:59,076
That jerk...

757
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:23,826
That woman is...

758
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:27,197
Hello. I'm Kwon Yu Na's guardian.

759
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:39,277
Got something to say?

760
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,846
They won't grant your request.

761
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:44,616
They can't.

762
00:57:44,616 --> 00:57:47,257
The President can't change the court's decision.

763
00:57:47,257 --> 00:57:49,027
That's simply impossible in a law-governed country.

764
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:51,056
The President can't do it even if he wants to.

765
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:54,297
Please don't do this. Just turn yourself in, okay?

766
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:56,627
Did you think I wouldn't even know that?

767
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:59,366
I've been living in Korea for over five years.

768
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,536
If you knew that, why did you make such a request?

769
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:06,837
Did you want to kill me from the get-go?

770
00:58:06,837 --> 00:58:08,447
Shut your mouth and stay put.

771
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:10,947
I'll make sure you can die without pain.

772
00:58:14,846 --> 00:58:16,817
I did not know you'd do this. I was a fool...

773
00:58:17,116 --> 00:58:19,087
for believing you even for a short moment.

774
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:21,386
You said you were wrongfully accused,

775
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:22,386
and I thought it might be true.

776
00:58:22,886 --> 00:58:25,027
"What if someone actually framed him?"

777
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:26,357
I was worried.

778
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:28,866
I'm such an idiot, aren't I?

779
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:36,907
You should never trust other people so easily.

780
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:40,036
People? You're a monster.

781
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,806
You are a monster.

782
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:44,746
I'd never believe a monster, but I trust people.

783
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:52,386
Stop, you little...

784
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:56,956
- Go away! - Open the door.

785
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:01,596
Open it!

786
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:28,657
Darn it.

787
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:30,527
What?

788
00:59:31,297 --> 00:59:32,927
Hey! What are you doing? That punk!

789
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:45,206
You little...

790
00:59:48,447 --> 00:59:49,976
Do as I say,

791
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:51,246
or I'll kill you!

792
00:59:51,246 --> 00:59:53,377
- You little... - Help!

793
01:00:29,317 --> 01:00:30,916
- Are you all right? - Yes.

794
01:00:30,987 --> 01:00:32,757
- Are you hurt? - No.

795
01:00:35,087 --> 01:00:36,087
Okay.

796
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:42,096
No!

797
01:01:11,226 --> 01:01:14,627
Help!

798
01:01:15,496 --> 01:01:17,627
Are you okay? Stay with me.

799
01:01:18,197 --> 01:01:20,697
Help!

800
01:01:20,866 --> 01:01:24,007
Sung Jun. Ryu Sung Jun! Snap out of it.

801
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:25,737
Ryu Sung Jun, snap out of it!

802
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:27,877
- Hey, call the medics. Now! - Yes, sir.

803
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:31,416
Sung Jun! Snap out of it!

804
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:33,516
Sung Jun!

805
01:01:34,377 --> 01:01:36,846
Stay with me, Sung Jun!

806
01:01:40,157 --> 01:01:42,226
(Patient Jung M. Chun)

807
01:01:53,737 --> 01:01:55,866
Excuse me! Officer!

808
01:01:56,107 --> 01:01:57,436
We need you over there. Quick!

809
01:01:57,507 --> 01:02:00,337
In the ward, there is a man who is beating up his wife...

810
01:02:00,337 --> 01:02:01,547
to a pulp.

811
01:02:01,547 --> 01:02:03,206
Please hurry.

812
01:02:06,147 --> 01:02:07,346
I have to stay here.

813
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:09,186
- What? - I'll call it in for you.

814
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:11,657
Look, he even hit me!

815
01:02:11,657 --> 01:02:14,016
If you don't stop him now, she'll be badly hurt!

816
01:02:14,286 --> 01:02:17,386
Please hurry over there and stop him. Please?

817
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,527
- My gosh. - Where is the ward?

818
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,967
It's that way. Please hurry.

819
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:24,166
My gosh.

820
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:40,377
What is going on?

821
01:02:40,976 --> 01:02:42,386
- What are you doing? - He's gone.

822
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:45,956
What is this?

823
01:02:46,817 --> 01:02:47,817
What are you doing?

824
01:02:51,397 --> 01:02:52,397
You...

825
01:02:53,397 --> 01:02:54,397
Who are you?

826
01:03:03,837 --> 01:03:04,936
Mr. Baek.

827
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:07,306
What are you doing here?

828
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:08,377
Why?

829
01:03:09,107 --> 01:03:10,647
Are you scared?

830
01:03:11,817 --> 01:03:13,377
You didn't see this coming...

831
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,147
when you killed my daughter?

832
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:19,657
No. Let go. Let me go!

833
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,087
Let go of me.

834
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:22,886
No, I...

835
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,397
It wasn't me!

836
01:03:26,197 --> 01:03:27,257
Let me go!

837
01:03:27,826 --> 01:03:30,266
Stop... Let me go!

838
01:03:32,697 --> 01:03:33,697
Let go!

839
01:03:34,136 --> 01:03:35,337
You see,

840
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,266
you killed my daughter,

841
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:40,576
yet they'll let you stay in a warm room,

842
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:43,377
where you'll be served three free meals a day.

843
01:03:45,246 --> 01:03:46,677
Then a few years later,

844
01:03:46,677 --> 01:03:50,016
you'll be released on parole.

845
01:03:51,087 --> 01:03:53,186
I am not generous enough to let that happen!

846
01:04:00,456 --> 01:04:01,897
Had that detective not intervened,

847
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:05,436
I would've already ripped you to shreds...

848
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:08,706
and fed you to dogs.

849
01:04:20,116 --> 01:04:21,786
I got this in China.

850
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:25,056
This is what they use to torture people.

851
01:04:28,016 --> 01:04:30,027
It's so painful...

852
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:33,326
that you'll beg me to just kill you.

853
01:04:35,797 --> 01:04:36,797
No, please...

854
01:04:40,136 --> 01:04:41,337
My daughter, Ji Eun.

855
01:04:42,706 --> 01:04:46,677
You're about to experience the pain she went through.

856
01:04:47,936 --> 01:04:51,206
Since this took longer than I thought, I'll make sure...

857
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:57,416
you die a slow death while feeling the pain a thousandfold.

858
01:05:01,016 --> 01:05:03,886
No! I told you it wasn't me.

859
01:05:03,886 --> 01:05:05,056
It wasn't me.

860
01:05:06,397 --> 01:05:07,897
Please. I didn't do it.

861
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:22,177
I was simply paid to follow orders.

862
01:05:22,576 --> 01:05:24,377
I was told to fake a kidnapping of your daughter.

863
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:27,447
They said they'd take care of the rest.

864
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:28,547
Shut it!

865
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:31,757
Do you think I'd let your filthy tongue deceive me?

866
01:05:32,357 --> 01:05:33,817
- No. - Shut it.

867
01:05:33,817 --> 01:05:36,927
I have evidence!

868
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:38,326
I can prove it.

869
01:05:41,157 --> 01:05:43,766
I have a recording of my phone conversation with that person.

870
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:48,766
Who is that person?

871
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:54,036
He said his name was Yoon Jae. Jung Yoon Jae.

872
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,677
Jung Yoon Jae?

873
01:05:59,516 --> 01:06:01,076
Jung Yoon Jae.

874
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,746
Jung Yoon Jae...

875
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:08,927
Jung...

876
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:14,826
Sir...

877
01:06:20,467 --> 01:06:22,206
Jung Yoon Jae.

878
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:00,407
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

879
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:01,676
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

880
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:03,006
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

881
01:07:03,006 --> 01:07:04,247
(but with doubles and dummies.)

882
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:27,897
(Blind)

883
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,466
The night Jung Man Chun took someone hostage,

884
01:07:30,966 --> 01:07:33,376
I texted all the jurors.

885
01:07:35,976 --> 01:07:37,747
Jung Man Chun was in the hospital.

886
01:07:38,617 --> 01:07:39,777
That woman.

887
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:43,417
This is the work of a copycat.

888
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,817
Those who were with Yeom Hye Jin until the last moment.

889
01:07:46,617 --> 01:07:48,016
- The jurors. - The person...

890
01:07:48,016 --> 01:07:50,256
who was with Hye Jin until the last moment...

891
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:52,926
I'll annul my trial.

892
01:07:52,926 --> 01:07:53,997
I need confirmation.

893
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:57,426
That night, did you really see the culprit's face?
