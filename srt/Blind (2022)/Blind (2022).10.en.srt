(Episode 10: The Child Who Survived)

5
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:40,647
This...

6
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,118
is where the culprit killed Baek Ji Eun, Yeom Hye Jin,

7
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,588
and An Tae Ho.

8
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,828
Why did the culprit choose this place to commit his crimes?

9
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,927
It's strangely familiar.

10
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:01,037
I feel like I've been here before in the past.

11
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:36,968
(Just kill me.)

12
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,208
(There are people in here. Please save 11, 12, and 13.)

13
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,768
What are you doing in here?

14
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:46,107
Sung Jun.

15
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,537
Oh, it's my mom!

16
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:50,208
Help me.

17
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:55,648
Help me.

18
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:01,088
Where are you, Sung Jun?

19
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,308
A long time ago, we were struggling financially,

20
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:22,278
so we had to send away some of the older kids.

21
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,178
Hope Welfare Center said they could take them in,

22
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:26,778
so we sent them there.

23
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:31,717
That place was quite big at that time.

24
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,118
What were the names of the kids that were sent there?

25
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,118
There were a total of three kids.

26
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:39,688
The oldest kid was Gabriel, and the other two were siblings.

27
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:43,127
The older sister was Yoon Jung and her brother was Yoon Jae.

28
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,397
- Did you say "Yoon Jae"? - Yes, that's right.

29
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:49,767
Her younger brother's name was Yoon Jae. Jung Yoon Jae.

30
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,567
How old was he?

31
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,108
At that time,

32
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,438
he was nine years old.

33
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,707
Do you still keep in contact with those kids?

34
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,877
After they went there, I lost contact with them.

35
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,017
I figured no news was good news,

36
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:08,158
but one day, I heard rumors that Hope Welfare Center was closing.

37
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,988
I was so surprised, so I looked into them.

38
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,858
I was told Gabriel was adopted,

39
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,998
and they said they had no idea where Yoon Jung went.

40
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:18,368
And Yoon Jae...

41
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,337
What happened to Yoon Jae?

42
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:25,567
Yoon Jae...

43
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,507
died.

44
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:52,928
- Did you lock it? - Yes, I did.

45
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,967
Have a seat.

46
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:57,298
Show them.

47
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:02,908
The culprit sent this video to Chief Yeom.

48
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,277
Why are you doing this to me?

49
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:10,717
Why am I doing this?

50
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,087
Ask your father, Chief Yeom Ki Nam.

51
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:18,887
I don't know what my father did to you,

52
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:21,827
but I apologize on his behalf.

53
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,457
Please forgive him.

54
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:27,498
My son is waiting for me at home.

55
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:30,168
Please don't kill me.

56
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,707
Chief Yeom Ki Nam, are you watching this?

57
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,377
Your daughter is begging me not to kill her.

58
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:44,688
Darn it...

59
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:47,748
So this is the culprit who killed An Tae Ho as well, right?

60
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:51,257
This is the basement cell underneath Hope Welfare Center.

61
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,897
Why didn't Chief Yeom show this to us...

62
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,327
after he had gotten this?

63
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:00,827
He must not have wanted his own sins to be revealed.

64
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,798
What kind of sins did he commit...

65
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,067
to hide the culprit who killed his own daughter?

66
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,507
He didn't try to hide him.

67
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:10,077
He tried to secretly kill him with Mr. Baek and Detective Kang.

68
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,447
The culprit was at Hope Welfare Center 20 years ago.

69
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,288
That kid grew up and is now taking revenge on those who tortured him.

70
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:27,087
The problem is that his revenge isn't over.

71
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:30,228
Then who's next?

72
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,827
When the culprit publicly executed An Tae Ho,

73
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,298
he invited the rest of the jurors to the killing game.

74
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:43,077
Jo Eun Ki.

75
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:46,377
Kwon Kyung Ja.

76
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,377
Lee Jung Soo.

77
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,248
Bae Chul Ho. Jung In Seong.

78
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:55,387
What would be the reason they were all invited?

79
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,858
Then are these people also connected to Hope Welfare Center somehow?

80
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,327
We need to find that out from now on.

81
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:06,267
If these people are connected to Hope Welfare Center in some way,

82
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,868
the culprit's next target is among them.

83
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,138
Do you like puffer fish sashimi?

84
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,408
I'm not sure. I've never tried it.

85
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,717
Usually, people who like sashimi...

86
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,717
consider puffer fish the ultimate sashimi.

87
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,717
Some hesitate to try it because of the poison.

88
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:06,388
But don't you have to put up with that much for something so tasty?

89
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,727
I guess you like adventure, Mr. Lee Jung Soo.

90
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:13,867
My motto is to enjoy today and not care about tomorrow.

91
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:17,197
Did you develop that conviction after your brother died?

92
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:23,178
I saw that your brother died when you were young.

93
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,707
What was the cause of death?

94
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,077
My brother went missing.

95
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,947
We looked for him for years but never found him.

96
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,688
So we reported him dead.

97
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,347
When was that?

98
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:37,258
It was when I was nine years old, so in 1999.

99
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:39,727
He disappeared on his way home from school,

100
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,628
like a puff of smoke and like the 20th century.

101
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,898
Could I have your parents' contact information?

102
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:47,497
Well...

103
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,607
You should just leave my parents alone.

104
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,538
They barely got back to their own lives after letting my brother go.

105
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,908
How can you be so sure your parents let your brother go?

106
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,518
A woman I know still tries to find her lost son from 20 years ago...

107
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:05,487
and goes to crowded places on the weekends to hand out fliers.

108
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:09,987
And what I want to know...

109
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:14,028
is whether or not your parents are connected to Hope Welfare Center.

110
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,798
What's your number, detective?

111
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,408
(Ryu Sung Jun)

112
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,977
I thought my son might be at an orphanage,

113
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:40,347
so I searched every single one in the country.

114
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,388
But I still couldn't find him.

115
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,688
Did you perhaps go to Hope Welfare Center as well?

116
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,658
Hope Welfare Center?

117
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:52,898
Oh, we didn't go to that place ourselves.

118
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,768
The station chief in that area looked into it for us.

119
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,268
The station chief?

120
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,707
Was the station chief's name Yeom Ki Nam?

121
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:05,207
Yes, that's right. It was Chief Yeom Ki Nam.

122
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:08,977
He worked so hard to try and find our Hyun Soo.

123
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:13,688
Producer Bae Chul Ho is on vacation. But we can't reach him.

124
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,688
Yes. But there's one thing that bothers me.

125
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:19,957
Twenty years ago, Producer Bae...

126
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:23,658
pulled the plug on an investigative show on Hope Welfare Center.

127
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:25,867
Yes.

128
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:30,168
But nobody knows why he stopped the show.

129
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:36,477
What? Who?

130
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,447
Oh, the detective.

131
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:43,247
I'm here to pray.

132
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:47,447
Gosh, I thought I should at least pray for Manager An's soul.

133
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,487
Hope Welfare Center?

134
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:52,587
I don't know.

135
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,727
Goodness.

136
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,258
I have no one in this world. I have no relations.

137
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,067
I might have had a client who was from there, though.

138
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:04,967
Where did you say that welfare center was located?

139
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,278
Sosan-myeon?

140
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:19,817
Lady.

141
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:22,117
- Lady, save us. - Save us!

142
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,227
- Lady, they are trying to kill us! - Save us!

143
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,288
- Lady! - Save us!

144
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,898
Save us!

145
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:35,898
Perhaps, were those kids...

146
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,898
What do you mean by those kids?

147
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:39,038
I saw...

148
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:44,138
some kids being dragged away by men in military uniform.

149
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:48,447
They were young kids, and they were wearing tracksuits.

150
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,418
They had numbers on their chests.

151
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:52,817
Numbers?

152
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,117
Do you remember anything else?

153
00:12:57,888 --> 00:12:59,028
Wait a second.

154
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,128
Yes.

155
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,028
I can see it.

156
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,268
The number was...

157
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,668
thirteen.

158
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,648
It was number 13.

159
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:24,117
Did you just see the kids there? Was that all?

160
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,747
No. I saw that kid's future.

161
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,628
The whole world was drenched in blood.

162
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,398
People were dying.

163
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:44,298
Hello?

164
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:46,207
Ms. Kwon Kyung Ja.

165
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,638
Kill him.

166
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,707
You must kill that kid.

167
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,548
If you let that kid live,

168
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,447
you will die and so will the rest of us.

169
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:09,658
A witness?

170
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:12,327
Yes.

171
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:16,168
I think she witnessed the kids who were caught running away.

172
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,508
Then all three of them are connected.

173
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:22,808
What about Jung In Seong and Jo Eun Ki?

174
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:25,038
I'm trying to contact Jo Eun Ki,

175
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:28,148
and Jung In Seong is on his way back from a business trip.

176
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,357
Sung Jun. Jung In Seong is here.

177
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:38,528
Yes, hello.

178
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,247
It's stuffy in here, isn't it?

179
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:07,117
I'm sorry. The squad room is too noisy.

180
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:08,717
It's okay.

181
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:18,668
Both of your parents are American citizens.

182
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,298
- When did you go to the States? - When I was little.

183
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:25,668
My dad was an American soldier stationed in Korea.

184
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:28,067
An American soldier?

185
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,138
He adopted me before going back to America.

186
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,117
Then...

187
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:40,587
Do you know where you were before you were adopted?

188
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,188
I don't.

189
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:48,227
I was in a car accident shortly after I was adopted.

190
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:53,197
I lost all memories prior in some kind of aftereffect.

191
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,067
So...

192
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:57,967
Both your parents are in the US, right?

193
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:02,337
Could you have been adopted from Hope Welfare...

194
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:13,447
They're both...

195
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,117
dead.

196
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:26,768
- Thanks, bye. - Bye, take care.

197
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,638
Your kkakdugi's delicious.

198
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:29,638
Thank you.

199
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,467
- Hello. - Welcome.

200
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:33,638
Sit over here.

201
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:37,237
Hey. Mom.

202
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:40,707
Two gukbap and a rolled omelet, as quick as you can.

203
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:44,577
I'm too busy to make you a rolled omelet.

204
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:45,648
Come on.

205
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,347
My goodness.

206
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,028
Is she your mother?

207
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:03,337
Oh, no.

208
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,038
She's like a mother to me.

209
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,577
Her son disappeared 20 years ago.

210
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,607
She opened this place...

211
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,247
opposite the police station thinking the closer she was,

212
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:15,548
the sooner she'd hear about her son.

213
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,517
I'm a cop and I couldn't find him for her.

214
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,648
So I'm a surrogate son.

215
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,027
Excuse me.

216
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,297
Hi, Eun Ki.

217
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:42,408
(Please help find In Seong)

218
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:49,517
Hello, how are you?

219
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,987
Is this your first time here?

220
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,118
Yes.

221
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:26,247
Why are you so hard to reach? I got worried.

222
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:34,957
Eun Ki, did your mother ever say...

223
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:37,697
she worked at Hope Welfare Center?

224
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:40,568
No, she didn't.

225
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,197
I see.

226
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,568
I'll ask her myself.

227
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:47,108
Can I have her number and address?

228
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,247
Why? Do you have something to say?

229
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,878
You said your name was Jung Yoon Jae...

230
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,547
before you were adopted.

231
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:00,717
Yes.

232
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:02,487
Why?

233
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:06,027
I think that memory is false.

234
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:12,227
What do you mean it's false?

235
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,568
I met someone who knew Yoon Jae.

236
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:17,297
But she said...

237
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,908
Hope Welfare Center's Jung Yoon Jae died 20 years ago.

238
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,188
Is she sure...

239
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,318
Yoon Jae is dead?

240
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:37,257
Did she see his body or something?

241
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:38,787
She knows where it is.

242
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:43,358
Corpses that no one claims are cremated and kept...

243
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,358
at the House of Remembrance for ten years.

244
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,928
If no one comes forward during that time,

245
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:50,037
the ashes are buried with others who met the same fate.

246
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:58,078
(The 381 unclaimed souls from 2002 were buried here, August 10, 2013.)

247
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:00,878
This must be where Yoon Jae was buried.

248
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,457
Hope Welfare Center's Yoon Jae is dead.

249
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:18,598
Then why did I think I was Yoon Jae until now?

250
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:26,737
Detective Ryu.

251
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,007
Detective Ryu. Are you all right?

252
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:36,848
Bro.

253
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:42,557
Bro. Watch me.

254
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,757
Yoon Jae. Don't.

255
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:50,128
Sung Jun doesn't know he was adopted, right?

256
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,727
He can't even remember who he is.

257
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:54,898
Could he remember that?

258
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:56,898
It could be for the best.

259
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:00,338
It's too late to send him back.

260
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,777
Even if we don't like it, we must keep him.

261
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,158
I don't know who I am.

262
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:22,227
I don't know my real mom and dad's faces.

263
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:31,537
I don't know where I lived before I came here.

264
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,777
Do you really not remember?

265
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:42,247
No.

266
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:44,648
But...

267
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:48,118
I think someone called me "Yoon Jae."

268
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,318
Is that my name?

269
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:54,928
What are all these memories?

270
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,197
Detective Ryu.

271
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,098
I'm fine.

272
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,138
(2002NA1523 Embezzlement)

273

(Sentenced August 9, 2002)

275

(2002NA1523 Ruling Embezzlement)

276
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:10,697
Careful.

277
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,287
I'm fine.

278
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,457
Don't mind me.

279
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,368
I'm fine too. Don't mind me either.

280
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,237
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

281
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,438
I don't even know who I am.

282
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:54,848
You don't know yourself just because you remember.

283
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:02,517
Why did you think you were Yoon Jae?

284
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,418
There must've been a reason.

285
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:22,168
I heard someone...

286
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:24,608
call out.

287
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:28,348
A voice?

288
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,818
Yoon Jae.

289
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:33,148
Yoon Jae. Jung Yoon Jae.

290
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:36,318
Who was that?

291
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,237
Sung Jun.

292
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,237
Sung Jun.

293
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:04,148
When he gets drunk on his own sometimes,

294
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:06,717
he gets so utterly miserable.

295
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:10,358
I'm glad he's not alone tonight.

296
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:12,928
Do you know where he lives?

297
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,957
I don't but someone who does will be here soon.

298
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:19,197
Oh... Good, then.

299
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:23,537
Hello.

300
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,247
Okay.

301
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:43,858
Gosh.

302
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:53,967
Who am I?

303
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:58,797
At the playground you said...

304
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,178
I was Yoon Jae.

305
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:10,977
Why did you do that to me?

306
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:13,487
Why?

307
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:18,957
Stop hiding and come out.

308
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:23,727
Why did you do that to me?

309
00:26:24,697 --> 00:26:27,868
Why? Why did you do it?

310
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,037
Gosh.

311
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:33,557
Sung Hoon. Thank you for this.

312
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:37,697
How did I get home last night?

313
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,098
I blacked out, so I don't remember.

314
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:42,697
I brought you home because Eun Ki called me.

315
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:43,967
Really?

316
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:46,838
Thank goodness.

317
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:49,477
I thought Eun Ki carried me here.

318
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,237
Why did you drink so much?

319
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:54,947
I have my reasons for that.

320
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:57,747
Is it a secret you can't tell me?

321
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:01,217
Gosh, it's not like that.

322
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,027
Number 13. Yoon Jae.

323
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:15,227
You and I were going after someone who died 20 years ago.

324
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,497
Really?

325
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:21,237
Is that why you got completely drunk?

326
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:24,277
No, it's not necessarily because of that.

327
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:29,178
I'll tell you later when I know for sure.

328
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,447
I don't really know what's going on right now either.

329
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,588
Okay, then.

330
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,287
Have something for your hangover. You might get sick.

331
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:36,318
Okay.

332
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:39,928
Thank you.

333
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:44,957
My daughter!

334
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:47,568
Mom!

00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:52,138
Goodness, my daughter.

336
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,237
Have you been well?

337
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:59,908
Why did you get so pretty?

338
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,878
Ms. Jo, the doter, is at it again.

339
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:05,217
In my eyes, you're Miss Korea.

340
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:08,588
Are you seeing anyone these days?

341
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:11,487
- No, I'm not. - Why not?

342
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,128
You need to meet a nice guy and get married.

343
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,398
I'm sure I'll meet someone eventually.

344
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:20,227
To be honest, I came here to ask you something.

345
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:21,267
What is it?

346
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:24,938
Have you heard of Hope Welfare Center?

347
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:31,207
No.

348
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,608
I've never heard about them.

349
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:37,378
Really?

350
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:41,447
Then Dad must have no connections to that place either.

351
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:44,257
Of course.

352
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,527
Why are you asking me that so suddenly?

353
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:53,967
Never mind.

354
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,898
What kind of person was Dad?

355
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:02,138
I just suddenly got curious.

356
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:04,707
You never talked about Dad before.

357
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:07,608
What's the point of talking about someone who's dead?

358
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,078
It'll just upset me.

359
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:11,217
Was he handsome?

360
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:15,188
If you have a photo, show me, so I can see what he looks like.

361
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:19,158
I don't have anything like that. I threw it all out.

362
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:23,828
Why? It's not like he's your enemy.

363
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,898
Is there a reason why I shouldn't know what my dad looked like?

364
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:30,568
Dad!

365
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:34,938
If you're going to keep talking about him, leave.

366
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:36,908
Just leave.

367
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:40,277
Mom.

368
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:43,477
Eun Ki.

369
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:46,987
(Chamgoun Nursing Hospital)

370
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:49,017
What are you doing here, In Seong?

371
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,658
We did jury duty together.

372
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:00,467
This is my mom.

373
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:04,697
Hello. I'm Jung In Seong.

374
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,868
I see. Hello.

375
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:14,207
What brings you here?

376
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:16,247
I had some business inside.

377
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:31,727
At the playground you said...

378
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:36,068
I was Yoon Jae.

379
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,118
(Yeonju-dong)

380
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:05,057
Judge Ryu. You have a lot of work today.

381
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:07,727
This is a record of all the cases you've been assigned.

382
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,068
Please leave it on my desk.

383
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:16,338
The hospital your mother works at uses my company's software.

384
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,648
We go to our clients, update their systems,

385
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:22,747
and fix any errors that come up. That's my job.

386
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:23,918
When you said you worked for a company,

387
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,747
I thought you studied liberal arts, not science.

388
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:29,247
If your computer ever breaks, call me.

389
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,158
- I'll go and fix it for you. - Thank you.

390
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,457
Did you meet the nun?

391
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,967
I heard you talking on the phone with her at the funeral.

392
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:47,108
Oh, I see.

393
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:50,207
Yes, I met with her.

394
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:55,108
I feel bad. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

395
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,787
I got curious about Hope Welfare Center too.

396
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:01,747
Did she say anything?

397
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:04,287
She knew as much as we do.

398
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:06,727
But why are you curious about that place?

399
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:14,168
- Because... - Hold on.

400
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,138
Hello? Yes.

401
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,508
If the culprit isn't Yoon Jae, who is it?

402
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:26,108
It'll be someone who knows Jung Yoon Jae well.

403
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,608
Even if 20 years have passed,

404
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,878
it'd be hard to mistake someone else for Yoon Jae.

405
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:33,887
No. I think that's a possibility.

406
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,918
When you go to your elementary school reunion,

407
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,628
there are people who show up looking completely different.

408
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,887
When they tell you who they are,

409
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:45,427
you say, "Oh, it's you!"

410
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:47,997
"Did you always look like this?"

411
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,968
In any case, if you were to see them on the streets,

412
00:34:50,968 --> 00:34:52,867
you would never recognize them.

413
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:57,207
Manager An probably didn't know who the culprit was at first.

414
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:59,338
That's why he went to the wedding.

415
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:01,508
To find out who the culprit was.

416
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:06,017
- Seok Gu. - Yes?

417
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:08,818
Did you make a copy of the CCTV footage from Kang Ha Na's wedding?

418
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:10,017
Yes.

419
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:15,528
Fast forward.

420
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,028
Over here. Go back.

421
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:23,198
Right. From here. Go slowly.

422
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:30,608
Okay. Stop.

423
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:33,347
Over there. The black hat.

424
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:42,548
This guy went in right before Manager An.

425
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,188
This punk is the culprit.

426
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,227
Darn it...

427
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:51,528
We missed the guy in the black hat while focusing on An Tae Ho.

428
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,028
Check the wedding hall's security cameras once more.

429
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,668
And track down the black hat guy.

430
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:57,668
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

431
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,736
(Petroleum, diesel fuel)

432
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:20,043
Yu Na's mother, don't be like this. Please go just once.

433
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:21,473
I won't go.

434
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:23,743
Adults shouldn't get involved in a kids' fight.

435
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,942
The other kid's mom is saying she'll report Yu Na...

436
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:28,782
to the school violence committee if you and Yu Na don't apologize.

437
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:31,683
Please go and talk to the other mom tomorrow.

438
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:33,183
I'm baffled.

439
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:35,382
Why are you asking me to apologize for something Yu Na did wrong?

440
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,822
Yu Na didn't do anything wrong.

441
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:40,493
She didn't, but if it's just her, she might take all the blame.

442
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:42,663
So you should go and stand up for her.

443
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:46,132
You didn't even visit Yu Na when she was in the hospital.

444
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:48,532
And what about her? Did she even call me?

445
00:36:49,632 --> 00:36:52,572
Gosh, anyway, I don't want to go to any schools.

446
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,813
When you see Yu Na, tell her I wish her luck.

447
00:36:57,373 --> 00:37:00,512
And tell her not to come home.

448
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:03,282
There's only one room. Having a grown daughter around...

449
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:06,253
will make my boyfriend uncomfortable.

450
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:09,552
Are you telling Yu Na to sleep elsewhere because of your boyfriend?

451
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:13,962
Yu Na is still a child. You're her mother!

452
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:14,993
I know.

453
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:18,262
I shouldn't have given birth to her.

454
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:37,813
Here you go.

455
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:51,692
Do you like Ms. Jo?

456
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:55,833
No.

457
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,333
If you're not a stalker, why are you following her around?

458
00:37:58,273 --> 00:37:59,273
Kwon Yu Na.

459
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:01,072
Didn't you agree...

460
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,512
not to ask about today if I bought you what you wanted to eat?

461
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:06,643
Even verbal contracts are binding.

462
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:08,143
In case of a breach of contract,

463
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:11,282
you generally must pay 2 to 3 times the agreed upon amount...

464
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:13,953
I can't talk about that either, right?

465
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,373
Why are you showing this to me?

466
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:37,873
It seems like your secret.

467
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:45,083
You must've seen earlier,

468
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:46,782
but I don't have a home to go to.

469
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:50,293
I have a mom, but I might as well be an orphan.

470
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:52,592
The teachers and kids at school...

471
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,063
look down on me because my mom is a karaoke escort.

472
00:38:57,063 --> 00:39:00,232
But Ms. Jo was the first.

473
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:04,273
The first adult who didn't expect anything and just treated me well.

474
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:09,442
Ever since I met her, things have become weird.

475
00:39:10,342 --> 00:39:13,413
I haven't changed a bit, and neither has the world.

476
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:16,043
But I just feel like life is fun.

477
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:21,083
And I have some hope that I could become someone decent.

478
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:24,623
So don't hurt Ms. Jo.

479
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:28,563
If something happens to Ms. Jo, I won't let you get away with it.

480
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:34,802
Why are you smiling?

481
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,933
Is your dream to become a decent person?

482
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:42,203
What kind of person is a decent one?

483
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,172
Someone like Ms. Jo?

484
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:47,942
Then what about you?

485
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:49,442
What kind of person did you want to become?

486
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,523
A normal person.

487
00:39:55,723 --> 00:39:57,753
Gosh, how annoying.

488
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:03,223
Come on. Let's go become normal people.

489
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:06,192
What happened with the black hat guy?

490
00:40:06,563 --> 00:40:07,603
We couldn't find him.

491
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:14,072
What about the kids who were close to Yoon Jae? Did you look into them?

492
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:15,603
There has to be records for us to look into it.

493
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:19,572
List of kids, list of staff, financial audit records...

494
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,583
None of the records on the welfare center still exist.

495
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:26,552
It's as if someone destroyed the records on purpose.

496
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,223
They're completely gone.

497
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:30,192

In order to catch the killer, I must find out...

who Yoon Jae was with before he died.

565

was older than Yoon Jae.

566
00:46:51,132 --> 00:46:55,442
Yoon Jae, his sister, and Number 11 all came from the same orphanage.

And he was quite small.

570

When they were trying to escape, his ankle got caught in a trap.

571

He was hurt badly.

Oh, and...

662
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:01,819
Eun Ki.

663
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:05,649
Gosh.

664
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,959
Sung Jun, look who's here.

665
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,819
(Nun)

666
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:43,660
Yoon Jung is the girl on the left.

667
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:48,560
Yoon Jae is the kid in the middle.

668
00:55:49,899 --> 00:55:53,100
The older boy on the right is Gabriel.

669
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:57,600
Number 11 was older than Yoon Jae.

670
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,279
Yoon Jae, his sister, and Number 11 all came from the same orphanage.

671
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,669
Number 11 was older than Yoon Jae.

672
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:08,439
Yoon Jae, his sister, and Number 11 all came from the same orphanage.

673
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:19,850
Sung Hoon was...

674
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,790
He was Number 11.

675
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,439
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

676
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:43,779
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

677
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:45,080
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

678
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,450
(but with doubles and dummies.)

679
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,000
(Blind)

680
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,209
Where is Eun Ki?

681
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:14,779
Where is Eun Ki?

682
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,450
Some women are just dogged by misfortune.

683
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:24,120
Even you suspect that I could be the killer.

684
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,790
I am the only person who can get you out.

685
00:58:30,759 --> 00:58:32,189
We received a tip-off from a witness.

686
00:58:33,229 --> 00:58:34,259
That guy with a black hat...

687
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,600
Find out where my brother is now.

688
00:58:37,899 --> 00:58:39,430
I am asking you why you hid it from me!
