(are not based on reality.)

4
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,206
Number 11 was caught last night.

5
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,377
So? Where is he now?

6
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,517
The storage room in the backyard of the center.

7
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:16,786
That storage room...

8
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,716
Yes. That place. Hope Welfare's execution ground.

9
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,257
Darn it. That idiot.

10
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,897
I told you not to talk!

11
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,026
Darn it!

12
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,177
Is he still alive?

13
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,776
Yes, sir. What should we do with him?

14
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:21,686
If I kill someone,

15
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:24,247
it won't be good for the baby. Right?

16
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,086
Pardon?

17
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,826
My wife is pregnant.

18
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,396
Congratulations, sir.

19
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:35,967
My wife seems nervous because it's a geriatric pregnancy.

20
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,236
She told me not to do anything that would be unlucky.

21
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:41,336
Sir. Once they get a taste of the outside,

22
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:43,136
they can never forget it.

23
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:45,377
We should nip it in the bud to prevent future troubles...

24
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:49,106
I thought I'd never have children in this lifetime.

25
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:54,717
Do you know what I thought when we got pregnant after ten years?

26
00:02:56,747 --> 00:03:00,086
The deity is always on my side.

27
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,086
Let him go.

28
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:48,836
Gosh...

29
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:58,317
Hey.

30
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,586
I knew you'd come back alive.

31
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:04,516
Let's help him up.

32
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:05,986
One, two, three.

33
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:13,727
I can't believe you.

34
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,027
How can you smile when you came back from the dead?

35
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:18,097
I'm the one that got dragged to the storage room,

36
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,266
but why do you look like that?

37
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,636
Did Sergeant Choi beat you up again?

38
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,067
Don't even bring him up.

39
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:25,176
I get chills just thinking about him.

40
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:41,116
How far did you get?

41
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:42,657
Did you meet anyone?

42
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:49,696
I got lucky and made it to the police station.

43
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,267
I told the chief of the station about our story.

44
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:58,637
But they were all in it together.

45
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,277
Even that pig.

46
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,376
Darn it. I knew it.

47
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:07,376
Don't be disappointed.

48
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:10,446
I figured out a route out from here.

49
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:11,587
Really?

50
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,186
Can we run away without Crazy Dog finding out?

51
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,827
What if we looked for more people to help us?

52
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:22,366
There's nobody out there who can help us anymore.

53
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,637
We need trust only in ourselves from now on.

54
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,407
What do you want to do?

55
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,137
I want to go with you.

56
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,436
What about you guys?

57
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:47,616
(Episode 3: The Children Who He Abandoned)

58
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,926
So how is the public?

59
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,097
Are you up?

60
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,167
Okay. No, never mind. I'll call you back later.

61
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,207
You're here.

62
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,606
You ran around shooting guns.

63
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,676
Now look at you.

64
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,887
Use your brains before you act. Okay?

65
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,816
If it were your brother, he wouldn't have acted so rashly.

66
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:22,986
What would you have done if something terrible happened...

67
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:24,897
to the woman who was held hostage?

68
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:27,827
Sung Jun.

69
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:31,467
What do you think about transferring to a desk job?

70
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:33,897
Like the Department of Inspection or the Department of Intelligence.

71
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:37,106
He's not educated enough to go that route.

72
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:40,736
Then you should just quit the police force.

73
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,707
Why do I have to quit the police force?

74
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:44,407
Because you always cause trouble.

75
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:48,517
How long must we be worried about you?

76
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:56,186
Don't be upset because we're nagging you in bed.

77
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,126
It's all for your benefit.

78
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:01,827
I'm tired. Please leave.

79
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,897
Think about it as you recover.

80
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,256
What did the doctor say? Did the surgery go well?

81
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,727
I haven't spoken to him yet.

82
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,986
I'll meet with his doctor on my way out.

83
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,756
I know you must be busy,

84
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:35,327
but Sung Jun keeps causing trouble like this.

85
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,327
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

86
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,236
I saw your hearing.

87
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,936
Really? How was I?

88
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,736
- You were really good. - I see.

89
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:46,606
I feel happiest when my oldest son compliments me.

90
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,647
He's got a good eye.

91
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,676
If Sung Hoon said you did good, that means you did.

92
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,376
Right?

93
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,256
Goodness, does it make you that happy?

94
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,256
Of course.

(Muyoung Hospital)

98
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:41,027
Excuse me.

99
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,967
Can you tell me where Detective Ryu Sung Jun's room is?

100
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,996
What's your relationship with the patient?

101
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:49,107
Well... He's someone I know.

102
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,167
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

103
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:56,206
I really need to meet him. Is he hospitalized here?

104
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,086
Ms. Cho Eun Ki?

105
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:08,426
Judge Ryu.

106
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,696
Detective Ryu Sung Jun is my little brother.

107
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,497
I see.

108
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:24,566
You guys don't look anything alike.

109
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:33,617
Should I have given the jurors a stronger warning?

110
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:39,186
I don't think that would've changed the outcome very much though.

111
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:45,196
I just mean there's no need for you to feel guilty.

112
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,576
Still, it'll be better to hide that for the time being.

113
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:00,206
You'll be reminded of the incident every time you see it.

114
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:01,676
Thank you.

115
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:05,676
By the way, Sung Jun's room is on the sixth floor.

116
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:07,377
Thanks.

117
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,167
- You're... - Thank you for saving my life.

118
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:25,767
Don't mention it.

119
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:29,267
But is it okay for you to walk around like this already?

120
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,267
Of course.

121
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,976
What about you? How are you feeling?

122
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,576
As you can see, I'm fine.

123
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,716
I was just lying down for so long...

124
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,757
that I have some muscle cramps.

125
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,757
Where should I put this?

126
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,357
You can leave it on the table.

127
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:26,857
Sorry, I was just going to put the knife away.

128
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:32,367
It's fine.

129
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:41,237
You know you have to get treatment for trauma, right?

130
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:43,607
There's a psychological treatment center for victims...

131
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,216
run by the police agency.

132
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,446
You should go and get treated as soon as you can.

133
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:50,316
Okay.

134
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,747
Oh, right.

135
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,127
This is my business card.

136
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:01,696
You must have...

137
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,267
Feel free to contact me anytime if you need my help.

138
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:07,096
I'm the type of person who always repays my debts and gratitudes.

139
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:10,836
I see.

140
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,007
I don't think I'll ever ask you for help,

141
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,546
but I'll take this since I appreciate the offer.

142
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,777
I'll help with anything besides something that requires me...

143
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:20,846
to give up my life or a ton of money.

144
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:21,987
Anything?

145
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,086
That's a really dangerous thing to say.

146

Happy birthday, dear Ji Eun

00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:58,216
Happy birthday to you

Moon Kang.

152
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:02,987
What happened?

153
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,897
As Jung Man Chun said,

154
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:08,796
it was in a subway locker.

155
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,566
Excuse me. Where is the X-ray room?

156
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,306
- The X-ray room? - Yes.

157
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,637
It's down that way.

158
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,076
Oh, down that way...

159
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,917
I can't seem to find it. Can you show me once more?

160
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,517
I'm bad with directions.

161
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,417
Just turn right and keep going.

162
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:33,787
So go straight...

163
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:36,657
- and it's... - Yes, that's where radiology is.

164
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:37,787
- You'll see it. - Right.

165
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,326
- Won Woong. - Daddy!

166
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,627
Won Woong.

167
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,336
Won Woong.

168
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:56,647
Daddy will do anything for you.

169
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:59,046
If I have to jump into a fire, I'll do it.

170
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,917
If I have to jump into water, I'll do that too.

171
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:07,017
I will risk my life to keep you safe.

172
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,857
Don't worry about a thing...

173
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,787
and just grow up healthy.

174
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:13,456
Okay?

175
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,647
Sung Hoon. Were you still here?

176
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,176
I had something I needed to check with you.

177
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,277
- What is it? - How did Jung Man Chun...

178
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:36,716
find out Cho Eun Ki's address? Did you ask?

179
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,517
Oh, that. Detective Kang looked into it,

180
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:42,357
but he's not answering any questions this time either.

181
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,527
People like him shouldn't be treated as human.

182
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,196
Is it because Detective Kang is a Police University graduate?

183
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,357
He's way too gentle.

184
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:50,767
What?

185
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,667
- Do you have a hunch? - After the trial,

186
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,867
a part of the Juror Address Directory went missing.

187
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,237
Cho Eun Ki's name was on there.

188
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:59,436
Then did Jung Man Chun get a hold of the directory?

189
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:04,176
Let go of me.

190
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:06,147
Let go!

191
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,046
You...

192
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:11,546
Got it.

193
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,617
That jerk already had Cho Eun Ki in mind as his target.

194
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,226
That's why he yelled at the jurors.

195
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:20,096
He said something like "You will all die" and whatnot.

196
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:23,296
"You will all die because of what you did today."

197
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,566
Yes, that.

198
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:28,936
This guy is unexpectedly meticulous.

199
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,157
It's nothing.

200
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:26,556
You were just unlucky.

201
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,667
Right. It's all in the past.

202
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:37,667
You're just going to walk in calmly and get your stuff.

203
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,836
That's it.

204
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,456
Oh, my.

205
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:56,086
Eun Ki.

206
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,637
Mom.

207
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,046
Mom...

208
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,776
The landlady...

209
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:24,617
She refuses to give back the deposit until a new tenant signs the lease.

210
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,087
Now that things have come to this,

211
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:29,686
just come home with me.

212
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:32,297
And switch jobs while you're at it.

213
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:33,897
I should go back to work tomorrow.

214
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:36,226
I used up all my vacation days for this.

215
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,627
- Eun Ki. - I miss the kids too.

216
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,706
I wonder how Yu Na is doing.

217
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:43,867
Mom.

218
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,907
There's a girl named Yu Na who comes to the center.

219
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:50,107
She keeps losing her way and gets into trouble.

220
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,807
She reminds me of myself back in the day.

221
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:55,047
I want to help her do well.

222
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:57,716
To be honest, I don't know how far I should go to help her.

223
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,486
Is this the time for you to worry about her?

224
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:04,587
You almost died not too long ago!

225
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,456
But I survived.

226
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,297
I've decided to stay at the center for the time being.

227
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,736
I already got permission from my boss today.

228
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:18,766
Why were you born as my daughter?

229
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,547
What's wrong?

230
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,347
I knew that my one and only daughter...

231
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,776
lived in a rooftop room that doesn't even have a proper door.

232
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:34,387
You were born to a mom like me who can't even get you a decent house.

233
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:41,557
My goodness. Here you go again, Lady Cho.

234
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:42,597
Mom.

235
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,996
I'm turning 30 soon.

236
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,436
Finding a house, getting a job, and managing relationships...

237
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,067
are all adult responsibilities, not their parents.

238
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,407
It's the same thing with this.

239
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:54,436
I happened to be chosen as a juror.

240
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:56,246
And that's why this happened.

241
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,746
It's not because I live in this rooftop room.

242
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:02,417
It's not your fault, so stop blaming yourself.

243
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,446
Stop crying.

244
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,956
- Okay. - It's fine.

(Muyoung Community Children's Center)

246
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,016
Was I really just unlucky?

247
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,387
No, let's not think about it.

248
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,637
He's here.

249
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,147
Did you forget already?

250
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:14,587
I'm pretty sure I told you that day it was best if we never met again.

251
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,887
You haven't changed at all, Station Chief Yeom.

252
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,456
What? "Station Chief?"

253
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:21,827
Oh, right. You're the police chief now.

254
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,926
I'm sorry. Police Chief Yeom.

255
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:27,597
Get to the point.

256
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,206
Find someone for me.

257
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,766
Find someone? Who?

258
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,706
Twenty years ago, there were five children...

259
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,946
who were the last to try to escape the center.

260
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,617
It's one of them.

261
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,446
Jung Yoon Jae.

262
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:46,417
Why are you looking for him now?

263
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:49,857
I think...

264
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,827
that jerk killed my daughter.

265
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,426
What?

266
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:03,367
Are you trying to pay me to kill someone?

267
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:07,137
No. You just need to play the role of a person framed for murder.

268
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:09,807
I'll get rid of Mr. Baek's daughter on my own.

269
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:11,147
Who are you?

270
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:14,246
What kind of grudge do you have to kill Mr. Baek's daughter?

271
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,087
Do you want to know who I am?

272
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,887
My name is Yoon Jae.

273
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:21,117
Jung Yoon Jae.

274
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:25,857
How do you know he killed your daughter based on this?

275
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,996
Did you already forget that girl...

276
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:32,436
at the vacation home?

277
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:59,196
I don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:02,526
Are you afraid your past will be revealed?

279
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,627
Are you blackmailing me?

280
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,567
The welfare center was closed 20 years ago.

281
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:10,536
All the records there were burned too.

282
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:15,006
Even if that kid, Yoon Jae, was the culprit,

283
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:17,347
how can we find him now?

284
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,676
It's unfortunate that you lost your daughter, but let it go.

285
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:21,746
Ji Eun...

286
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:25,917
was the most precious person in my life.

287
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,857
Who is that kind of person in your life?

288
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:31,256

Who wants to do it?

294
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:53,946
- Why not? Come on! - Get up! Do it!

295

Stop it!

00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:32,216
Come down!

Hello, Mr. Yeom.

Thank you all that is mighty and good!

Mr. Joker gave me this.

I didn't know what you'd like, so I got a little bit of everything.

368
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:26,756
What about your diner?

369
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,925

and find your lost son.

371
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:35,665
There's too much going on, I didn't feel like working today.

Why? Is something wrong?

373
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,835
Chief Yeom.

374
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:46,046
His daughter was found dead in a park.

375
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,746
Her cheeks slit like the other girl.

376
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:53,016
I feel so bad for the chief.

377

Right, Sung Jun?

378
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,085
Are you sure her cheeks were slit?

379
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:57,685
Yes, I'm sure.

380
00:30:57,685 --> 00:31:00,756
The detectives all rushed out halfway through breakfast.

381
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:03,095
I wondered what was going on.

382
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:06,736
Oh, dear...

383
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,635
They told me not to tell you.

384

You won't...

385
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,206

(Morgue, Staff Only)

387
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:00,986

388
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,825
Why her?

389
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,726
Captain, look at this.

390
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,595
These are the last selfies Yeom Hye Jin posted on social media.

391
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,865
The hashtags are "juror" and "the Joker case."

392
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,435
The Joker case?

393
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,536
- That's Baek Ji Eun's case. - Captain.

394
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:26,145
I guess the chief's daughter was a juror...

395
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:28,075
of that trial.

396
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,085
What's going on?

397
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,885
- Sung Jun. - Hey.

398
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:35,556
Why are you even here?

399
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,925

(Morgue, Staff Only)

403
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:06,615
The bruises on the insides of her knees and elbows,

404
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:09,385
the length of the cuts on both cheeks,

405
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,085
the clean edges.

406
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,595
They're all identical to Baek Ji Eun's.

407
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,395
- Cause of death. - Asphyxiation.

408
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,036
There are no signs of sexual assault,

409
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:23,366
also just like Baek Ji Eun.

410
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:25,765
Other than traces of assault.

411
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,035
Why was she assaulted?

412
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:28,605
Was she hard to subdue?

413
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,745
Her fingernails were broken.

414
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:32,605
She definitely fought back.

415
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,596
Why? What is it this time?

416
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,296
Do you want to test if my fingernails break...

417
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:57,006
- if I fight back? - Can I?

418
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:58,935
You lunatic.

419
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:00,906
Don't you dare.

420
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:04,506
Forget it. Your fingernails aren't like hers.

421
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,156
Is it the same guy?

422
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:16,156
Based only on the marks on the body,

423
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,756
there's a 99 percent chance it was the same killer.

424
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:21,526
I don't get it.

425
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:23,495
Jung Man Chun was in the hospital.

426
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,596
How did he kill Yeom Hye Jin?

427
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,196
When was he admitted?

428
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:32,265
The day of the hostage situation.

429
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:35,136
On the 15th, around 6am?

430
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,546
Then it's not impossible.

431
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:39,145
Time of death...

432
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,875
is between midnight and 2am of the 15th.

433

This sly punk.

434
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:13,316
It was you.

435
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:15,145
You killed Yeom Hye Jin, didn't you?

436
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,245
- Who? - Yeom Hye Jin, the juror!

437
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,585
Detective. You can't do this.

438
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:23,986
Okay, fine.

439
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:26,696
I'll just ask some questions.

440
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:32,225
You killed Yeom Hye Jin.

441
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,736
On the 15th between midnight and 2am.

442
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:36,096
You slit her cheeks...

443
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:37,466
and killed her, didn't you?

444
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:40,176
Is that true?

445
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:44,205
Is it true she was killed around that time?

446
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,915
I have an alibi.

447
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:49,076
An alibi?

448
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:51,185
Yes. That woman.

449
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:53,915
That woman is my alibi.

450
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,725
Who is that woman?

00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:24,915
It was 11:50 at night.

457

00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,196
- Come on. - It's...

462
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,395
a Japanese restaurant run by one of the jurors.

463
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:41,236
- Come this way. - Okay.

- Get in. - Let's have another round!

467
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,576
Yes, another round!

468
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,406
- Come on. - Take care!

469
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,676
I'll see you next time, then.

00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,245
- I'm off. - Bye.

471
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,716
- Get in. - Okay.

472
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,285
- You too. - No, I'll take the bus.

473
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,716
- Get in. - No.

474
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,085

475
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:06,185
- Get in. - I can walk...

At a little after 11pm,

477
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,125
- Let's go. - the dinner ended.

478
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,495
Mr. Choi took me home in his taxi.

479
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:26,475
I took some photos earlier.

480
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:28,375
- Would you like to see them? - Yes.

481

- Don't we look nice? - We do.

482
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,756
- You look nice in this. - Let me see.

483
00:37:35,415 --> 00:37:36,585
Look.

484
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:38,426
Why do you keep looking that way?

485
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,156
- Why? - I know, right?

- Thanks. Get back safe. - Take care.

00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:58,506
Get home safe.

490
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,756
I read Judge Ryu's text when I was almost home.

It was 11:42pm.

00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,185

Ms. Cho. Are you okay?

It was 11:50pm.

You called the police after 5am.

It seemed like he was contemplating something.

503
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:20,955
Did he ever go outside between midnight and 2am?

504
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:23,566
No, never.

505
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,466
But why do you ask?

506
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:34,335
Yeom Hye Jin was murdered during that time.

507
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:41,946
No way.

508
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:50,426
Gosh.

509
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:55,196
A hostage became the hostage taker's alibi.

510
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,866
Life is an irony.

511
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:59,926
As long as Jung Man Chun has an alibi,

512
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:03,935
we'll have to start all over with the case of Chief Yeom's daughter.

513
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:07,406
- I guess so. - It's not just "I guess so."

514
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:10,875
It's my theory that this case is...

515
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:13,576
the doing of a copycat.

516
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,785
But don't you think the MO is too similar to be a copycat?

517
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,316
The location and size of the wounds on the mouth.

518
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,026
There is no difference when you compare it to Baek Ji Eun.

519
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,495
Then perhaps, do you think the perp...

520
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:31,326
is among those who saw Baek Ji Eun's photos or autopsy report?

521
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,165
Hey, Seok Gu. That makes sense.

522
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:37,466
Who saw Baek Ji Eun's body?

523
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:41,636
Our investigation team, the NFS, and the Forensics team?

524
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,435
There's someone else who saw it.

525
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:45,346
And who's that?

526
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:47,846
The people who saw Baek Ji Eun's body...

527
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,185
and were with Yeom Hye Jin until right before she died.

528
00:40:57,026 --> 00:41:00,156
The jurors of Baek Ji Eun's murder case.

529
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,515
Sorry, we're not open yet.

530
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:37,466
You're Detective Ryu Sung Jun, right?

531
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:41,765
How do you know my name?

532
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,605
You have such impressive good looks that I remembered your name.

533
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:47,636
Oh, and I enjoyed your testimony as well.

534
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:48,736
You have a great memory.

535
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:56,245
On the night of the 14th, the jurors had dinner here together, right?

536
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:57,446
Yes.

537
00:41:57,446 --> 00:41:59,685
After the dinner, between midnight and 2am,

538
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:00,986
where were you and what did you do?

539
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,386
I cleaned up the store and went to sleep.

540
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,486
In fact, I slept here so I could sober up.

541
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,495
I don't see a place where you could sleep here.

542
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:11,526
If I put together a few chairs, it's a makeshift bed.

543
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:17,305
You don't seem curious.

544
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:20,406
Why a detective suddenly shows up and is asking all these questions.

545
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:23,375
I saw the news.

546
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:25,006
The Coco Mom case.

547
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,156
How long have you been using a knife?

548
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:38,826
Including four years in Canada and studying abroad in Japan,

549
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:41,895
- it's about eight years total. - Eight years?

550
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:46,866
After eight years, you must be an expert with knives.

551
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:00,245
Do you want to see?

552
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,515
How good I am with a knife?

553
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,426
There's a security camera outside the store.

554
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:13,855
I should show you the footage from that night, right?

555
00:43:26,466 --> 00:43:28,435
Was there anyone acting suspicious that night?

556
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:33,305
There was.

557
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,426
Gosh, don't even get me started.

558
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:52,625
He was being so flirtatious...

559
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:54,835
that even I was getting red in the face.

560
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,035
How did Ms. Yeom react?

561
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:58,906
Well, she didn't seem entirely displeased,

562
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:01,776
but she couldn't be overtly happy. He's a married man.

563
00:44:01,776 --> 00:44:04,346
Ms. Yeom was married too. And she had a child.

564
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:05,475
Is that so?

565
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:08,046
She didn't look like a mom.

566
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,645
What time did you get home that night?

567
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:13,785
What time was that?

568
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,716
My husband came home in the early morning.

569
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:18,526
Around what time?

570
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:23,826
It was about 3 or 4 o'clock.

571
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:26,466
He's been feeling lonely since he retired,

572
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:29,136
and I guess he had a good time being out with people.

573
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:31,805
The dinner ended at 11pm.

574
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,736
Where were you and what were you doing until 3 or 4 in the morning?

575
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,745
Well, the thing is...

576
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:46,145
Did Mr. Kang say that?

577
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:48,455
Gosh, that man...

578
00:44:49,216 --> 00:44:51,725
A hostess bar? As if. It was just a regular bar.

579
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,995
According to Mr. Kang, he got drunk and fell asleep.

580
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,866
And when he woke up, you had disappeared.

581
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,196
I didn't disappear.

582
00:45:03,665 --> 00:45:05,935
Gosh, I wasn't going to say this.

583
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:07,506
Mr. Kang, that guy...

584
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:11,506
He likes to play dirty.

585
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:15,176
I guess it's because he worked in sales for a long time.

586
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:18,645
He was so used to wining and dining.

587
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:23,386
So I couldn't take it anymore. I gave up and ran away.

588
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:25,486
What time was that?

589
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:27,826
About 1am...

590
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:29,426
After leaving the bar at 1am,

591
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:32,366
- where did you go? - Of course I went home...

592
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:40,406
Are you suspicious of me?

593
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:43,535
I produce current affairs shows, you know.

594
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:46,946
A producer who makes documentaries that only chase after the truth,

595
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,375
got it?

596
00:45:57,386 --> 00:45:59,656
Hey, Soo In. I enjoyed your show.

597
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,455
The composition is good and the message is clear. You did great.

598
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:03,495
Right.

599
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,495
That rude punk...

600
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:18,705
Here is your coffee and cake.

601
00:46:18,805 --> 00:46:20,076
Thank you.

602
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:25,716
Gosh.

603
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,555
I should've gone to you. Sorry to make you come all the way.

604
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:31,156
No worries. Gosh, you didn't have to get these.

605
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:32,785
This puts me in a difficult position.

606
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:35,696
This time of day is when people usually feel drowsy.

607
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,326
You should get a little sugar boost.

608
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:39,796
Gosh, you sure know your stuff.

609
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:42,636
Then I won't refuse.

610
00:46:47,006 --> 00:46:48,006
It's delicious.

611
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:50,745
Oh, right.

612
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,605
That night, you got out of the taxi...

613
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,816
- and went straight home, right? - Yes.

614
00:46:55,975 --> 00:46:59,046
Is there anyone who can prove that you were home?

615
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,216
That night, I spent the whole night...

616
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:03,585
with my friend.

617
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,656
I see. You were with someone.

618
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:10,296
Then could I have your friend's contact information?

619
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:12,366
Contact information?

620
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:14,335
Just a second.

621
00:47:21,076 --> 00:47:22,576

00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:42,455
Come, spirits.

00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,926
The year of the white rat it is

626
00:47:45,926 --> 00:47:49,535
The month is the holiest of all

627
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:54,875
The day is nearing its end as the spirits speak

628
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,736
Come!

629
00:47:57,605 --> 00:47:58,875
Let's see.

630
00:48:07,316 --> 00:48:08,386
A woman?

631
00:48:09,785 --> 00:48:10,886
A married woman.

632
00:48:12,026 --> 00:48:14,395
Gosh. You're good.

633
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:15,926
How did you know I was here about that woman?

634
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:19,366
The ladies of Gangnam wait a month and some more...

635
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,066
in order to meet me.

636
00:48:21,136 --> 00:48:22,366
What do you think that means?

637
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:27,035
I didn't see anyone else waiting besides me.

638
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:29,406
Reservations only.

639
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:31,676
I see. Reservations.

640
00:48:34,276 --> 00:48:38,386
Come, spirits!

641
00:48:38,386 --> 00:48:42,886
Dear spirits, please show me visions!

642
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,026
All right, let's see.

643
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:02,906
You'll be humiliated and get roped into some kind of scandal.

644
00:49:03,805 --> 00:49:05,145
You two aren't compatible.

645
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,105
Break up with her at once.

646
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,185
A month and ten days, my foot.

647
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:24,826
I'm a cop.

648
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:29,196
After the dinner with the other jurors on the night of the 14th,

649
00:49:29,196 --> 00:49:30,935
you and Ms. Yeom Hye Jin left in the same taxi.

650
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:33,066
Did anything happen in the taxi?

651
00:49:33,636 --> 00:49:35,406
No, nothing happened.

652
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:37,076
Why do you ask?

653
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,745
She's been murdered.

654
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:46,346
Who was the last person seen with her?

655
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:51,426
Oh, I think...

656
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,225
It was probably Eun Ki.

657
00:50:06,805 --> 00:50:09,435
Yu Na has been going clubbing with some older guys.

658
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:11,745
Even today, she said one of them was picking her up at 5pm.

659
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,145
She's been burned one too many times already.

660
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:26,685
Hey.

661
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,395
Yu Na!

662
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:35,935
Hey, Yu Na!

663
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:40,835
Hey!

664
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:42,676
Yu Na!

665
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:48,975

Hey! Are you out of your mind?

669
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,656
You can't cut in on me like that!

670
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:15,636
Oh, boy.

671
00:51:15,636 --> 00:51:18,446
Then what about Mr. Choi? Did you notice anything suspicious?

672
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:19,446
Gosh, no.

673
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:22,375
His face tells me that he'd never hurt anyone.

674
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:24,685
He'd be the one getting beaten up if there was an altercation.

675
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,185
My job would be so easy if every perp looked like a bad guy.

676
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:30,555
I'll get going, then.

677
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:32,685
Wait.

678
00:51:33,555 --> 00:51:35,826
Well, I'll give you this...

Hi, brother.

Why is he still awake?

From time to time, I wondered about my father.

He's been staring at you secretly.

745

I think he was looking at you.

It'll come in handy if I'm ever caught in an unexpected rain.

You carry a raincoat around but not a single umbrella?

759
00:58:03,164 --> 00:58:04,894
I used to have a bunch of umbrellas...

760
00:58:04,894 --> 00:58:06,034
but gave them to my passengers.

761
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:10,003
I can see that he used to have a dashcam,

762
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:11,773
but it looks like someone ripped it out.

763
00:58:11,773 --> 00:58:13,733
I told you. I got it stolen.

764
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:15,974
If I had it in my possession, I could prove my alibi.

765
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,273
So why would I lie?

767
00:58:21,173 --> 00:58:23,814
Maybe the footage contains something that no one should see.

00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:26,854
No, that really isn't the case.

Coco Mom said...

770
00:58:29,184 --> 00:58:31,593
she had to meet someone at the park, so I dropped her off there...

771
00:58:31,593 --> 00:58:32,854
and left right away.

I'm reminded of that place.

I'm still not sure.

805

The police believe that a copycat killer...

01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,158
I'll annul the court's decision.

820
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:14,589
But for me to do that, I need to be convinced...

821
01:02:15,058 --> 01:02:16,958
that you really aren't the killer,

822
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,699
and I need to know if you truly saw the killer's face that night.

I did see the killer,

824

but not his face.

825
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:34,179
Then why did you say...

826
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:36,949
that Detective Ryu Sung Jun did it?

827
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:38,018
That's...

828
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:48,429
If you really want to know who did it, why don't you find out?

829
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:50,299
I don't know about other things,

830
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,429
but I can assure you that I saw the killer...

831
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,529
kidnapping Mr. Baek's daughter.

832
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,908
(Starlight Park, Muyoung Local Court)

833
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,078
(Don't worry. Everything will work out in the end.)

834
01:04:21,018 --> 01:04:23,118
(Case Report)

835
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,609
(Earring, nothing found on the left ear)

836
01:06:34,748 --> 01:06:36,458
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

837
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,988
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

838
01:06:37,988 --> 01:06:38,988
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

839
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:39,988
(but with doubles and dummies.)

840
01:06:59,578 --> 01:07:03,349
(Blind)

841
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:06,889
Are you saying the killer is among us?

842
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:09,389
If we trace the message you received,

843
01:07:09,389 --> 01:07:11,458
we can find out where they were at that time.

844
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,458
Where were you?

845
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,828
Call him.

846
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:19,269
It was there?

847
01:07:20,198 --> 01:07:21,669
I think I found him.

848
01:07:21,669 --> 01:07:23,368
- Ryu Sung Jun! - The one who killed my daughter...

849
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:26,169
Detective Ryu Sung Jun.

850
01:07:26,368 --> 01:07:29,078
No, I should call you Yoon Jae now.

851
01:07:29,238 --> 01:07:30,639
How do you know that name?
