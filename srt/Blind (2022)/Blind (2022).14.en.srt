(There are people in here. Please save 11, 12, and 13.)

4
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:46,674
Put the gun down.

5
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:52,843
What is this?

6
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:56,244
Put the gun down, you punk!

7
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,254
Sung Hoon, what is this?

8
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:06,524
Why aren't you saying anything?

9
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:09,223
Say something!

10
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:11,793
Sung Hoon.

11
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:14,204
Jung Yoon Jae.

12
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:18,334
You're under arrest for murder, attempted murder, and assault.

13
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,403
Sung Hoon.

14
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,173
Sung Hoon.

15
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:24,643
Sung Hoon.

16
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:27,143
Sung Hoon!

17
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:37,054
(Episode 14: In Search for Lost Time)

18
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,563
Here they come.

19
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:43,164
They're here.

20
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:46,164
Move aside.

21
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:48,533
- Why did you do it? - Make room!

22
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,763
- Why did you do it? - What made you do it?

23
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:52,074
- Why did you do it? - Give us a word!

24
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:55,003
The prime suspect in the Joker Murders has been arrested.

25
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,444
It has been revealed that the suspect, Jung,

26
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:00,813
was surprisingly one of nine jurors...

27
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:04,414
in the trial for the first victim, Ms. Baek.

28
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:06,513
Jung is under investigation...

29
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:08,923
for the murders of not only Baek but also seven other people.

30
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:10,923
This time, he had imprisoned eight people in the basement jail...

31
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,194
at Hope Welfare Center...

32
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:14,864
and was caught before he could murder them.

33
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:17,194
A police chief and the Minister of Health and Welfare...

34
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,063
were among the victims that were locked in the basement jail.

35
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:23,834
We are still unaware of the motive for his crimes.

36
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:26,774
- Did you get hurt? - Are you okay?

37
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,973
- How do you feel to be back? - How is your health?

38
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,973
We'd like to know the circumstances of your abduction.

39
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,913
I wasn't abducted.

40
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:36,984
I went there to persuade the criminal.

41
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,184
When I found out that he was from Hope Welfare Center,

42
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:43,283
I went there with the mindset of a mother.

43
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,394
Because Hope Welfare Center...

44
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:51,163
was where I adopted my precious eldest son.

45
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,934
- Is that so? - How do you feel right now?

46
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,964
- Can you elaborate? - Please tell us more.

47
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,774
I didn't know you were here.

48
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:06,413
Did you see the press conference?

49
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,184
Yes, I did.

50
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:10,514
Are you upset I said that without discussing it with you?

51
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:13,454
No, it was bound to come out anyway.

52
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:20,353
Were you serious about persuading Yoon Jae?

53
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:23,823
Persuasion is something you do with humans.

54
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:29,964
Yoon Jae is consumed with paranoia.

55
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:33,033
How can you call anyone who obsesses over something...

56
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,503
that happened over 20 years ago sane?

57
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,373
If we sent him to the US for adoption,

58
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:40,343
he should've forgotten about his past and lived a good life.

59
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:42,144
How foolish.

60
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,084
I see.

61
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:50,753
It's foolish to obsess over the past.

62
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:55,294
I'll get going now.

63
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,424
Why?

64
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:58,794
You should stay for dinner.

65
00:03:58,794 --> 00:03:59,834
Next time.

66
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:17,883
Did you have to do a press conference?

67
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,253
What choice did I have?

68
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,753
The press got a whiff of it and came after me.

69
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:23,783
I had to turn their attention elsewhere.

70
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,454
What about the other people who were locked up?

71
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,894
We don't have to worry about them?

72
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,994
All of them are probably nervous wrecks right now.

73
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,963
They're afraid what they did will come out.

74
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,443
- Yes? - I'm Detective Kim Seok Gu.

75
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,544
Do you understand what I'm saying?

76
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,713
Yes. We're investigating the victims,

77
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:48,284
so when does Minister Na have time?

78
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,143
She doesn't have time?

79
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,854
Then I'll talk to my bosses to see if that's possible...

80
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:55,083
and call you right back.

81
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:56,924
Yes, I'll call you back soon.

82
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:00,963
She doesn't want to give her statement?

83
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:03,424
It's not that. That was her secretary.

84
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,034
Apparently, she's so busy...

85
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:06,594
that she wants to do a written investigation.

86
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,703
Then push the minister back and move forward with someone else.

87
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:10,763
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,773
Jung Yoon Jae's arrest warrant was approved.

89
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,104
- Really? - We'll be back.

90
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,104
Okay. Go ahead.

91
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:22,114
Where is he? Did you get Jung Yoon Jae's confession?

92
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:24,713
- No, not yet. - Why haven't you gotten it yet?

93
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:28,924
End the investigation this week and send it to the prosecution.

94
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,184
Within the week?

95
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:33,224
That's impossible.

96
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,193
There's a total of seven murders. In order to get through...

97
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,794
That's why I'm telling you to end it quickly!

98
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,333
What are you going to say...

99
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,864
when they ask us what we were doing while seven people died?

100
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:47,674
The entire police force will get criticized for your incompetence!

101
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:52,713
Say he's a psychopath...

102
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,883
and that they were random killings.

103
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,253
You have until this week. Okay?

104
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:01,154
He is a psychopath,

105
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,054
but these weren't random killings.

106
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,193
What?

107
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:11,034
You know that too.

108
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,034
- Let's go. - Okay.

109
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:25,974
What did that punk just say to me?

110
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,513
I'm not sure.

111
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,614
Oh, right. Chief Yeom.

112
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,523
What's your connection to Hope Welfare Center?

113
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,523
What?

114
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,323
It's because of your victim's statement.

115
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:44,594
Darn it.

116
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:47,434
Do you want to give a written statement since you're busy?

117
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:59,174
- Shut your mouth! - What?

118
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:30,873
Jung Yoon Jae.

119
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:34,813
How long have you been living as Jung In Seong?

120
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:52,693
(Jung In Seong)

121
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:55,503
Your photo was in Jung In Seong's adoption papers.

122
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,963
How did you manage this?

123
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,573
Did you change it?

124
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,344
How did you figure out who I was?

125
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:08,414
There's no way an incompetent officer like you figured it out.

126
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,484
Did my brother tell you?

127
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,453
- "My brother"? - Yes. My brother.

128
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,994
If it hadn't been for my brother,

129
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,164
would you have been able to catch me?

130
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,693
Is the brother you speak of...

131
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:26,534
Judge Ryu Sung Hoon,

132
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,463
the guy you stabbed with a knife?

133
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:32,773
Why did you do it?

134
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,844
I didn't do that.

135
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,344
Sure you didn't.

136
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:43,684
He already told us that you stabbed him.

137
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,223
- My brother did? - Yes.

138
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,124
He did.

139
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:59,233
And we have evidence that you were there...

140
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,134
when the crime happened.

141
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:15,313
But you didn't get my face in the picture.

142
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:26,424
These are the shoes we found in your apartment...

143
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,624
that you wore at the crime scene.

144
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:32,794
Will you still deny it?

145
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:34,434
What about these?

146
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:38,374
Am I the only one who wears these shoes in the whole country?

147
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:48,914
Baek Ji Eun, Yeom Hye Jin,

148
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,213
Choi Soon Gil, An Tae Ho,

149
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:53,914
Kang Ha Na, Kwon Yu Na.

150
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,353
You killed them all, right?

151
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,063
Should we talk about Baek Ji Eun first?

152
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:07,264
But...

153
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,934
do you have any evidence for that?

154
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:16,144
You incited the abduction of Baek Ji Eun,

155
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:18,243
saying you'd pay for Jung Man Chun's son's surgery.

156
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:21,113
He told us everything.

157
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,384
Jung Man Chun...

158
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,083
But didn't he die?

159
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,323
If the witness is dead,

160
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:33,993
you'd at least need a recording to use as evidence.

161
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:37,164
What will you do, detective?

162
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,634
It's a murder case without any evidence.

163
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:01,784
Darn it.

164
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:11,294
What do we do if we don't have any direct evidence?

165
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:13,063
If we're not careful, we might not be able to charge him...

166
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,363
for the serial murders.

167
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:16,934
The attempted murder of Detective Ryu's brother...

168
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,573
and special assault...

169
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,634
for abducting the eight people might be all we can charge him with.

170
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:26,243
He must have his reasons for being so confident.

171
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:29,014
I feel like there's something else.

172
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,124
Jung Yoon Jae.

173
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:47,934
He had cameras at all of his crime scenes and filmed them.

174
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:51,264
Seeing how he sent a video of Yeom Hye Jin to Chief Yeom,

175
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,073
there must be original files of the recordings somewhere.

176
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:57,343
Seok Gu.

177
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,213
Where's all the stuff we confiscated from his car?

178
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:06,254
Here it is.

(Storage history management)

180
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:28,943
Was the hard drive missing in the first place?

181
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:30,144
I don't know.

182
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:32,174
We just store things exactly how they're brought in.

183
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:25,164
It had been about three months...

184
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,634
since I started working at Hope Welfare Center.

185
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:34,473
Sometimes, I thought the kids I was treating...

186
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:38,274
had unusual wounds.

187
00:13:39,414 --> 00:13:40,644
But that was the first time...

188
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:45,483
that I had seen it with my own eyes.

189
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:48,953
That man...

190
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:52,654
was torturing a child.

191
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:57,493
I was so surprised that I just...

192
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:03,764
ended up screaming.

193
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:08,703
He saw me.

194
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,573
And ever since that day...

195
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,493
I knew that I was pregnant with you,

196
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:36,203
but I was too scared to run away.

197
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:43,243
The only thing I could do for you...

198
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,644
was to keep you from knowing that he was your father.

199
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,784
Both then and now,

200
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,453
I'm so pitiful, aren't I?

201
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:04,463
No.

202
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:09,934
I really hated that man,

203
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,843
but not once did I...

204
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,674
regret having you.

205
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:27,054
Eun Ki,

206
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,823
I was so lucky to have you.

207
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,363
You were like a gift to me.

(Starlight Park, Muyeong Local Court)

All the data on Jung Yoon Jae's laptop and phone are gone.

210
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:10,063
You think someone got rid of the evidence on purpose, right?

211
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:13,764
Jung Yoon Jae didn't have any time to get rid of it himself.

212
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:17,833
What about other evidence?

213
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,703
As you already know, all we have is circumstantial evidence.

214
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:22,374
There are plenty of cases where we got a guilty verdict...

215
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:23,443
with only circumstantial evidence.

216
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,544
I don't want that.

217
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:29,184
That snake-like punk keeps cracking smiles and mocking the police.

218
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:31,384
I can't handle that.

219
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:35,483
I will find direct evidence, no matter what.

220
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:42,664
Do you need me in finding evidence?

221
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:44,223
How did you know?

222
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:47,593
Tell me. What do I have to do?

(Video Interrogation Room A)

What are you two plotting?

225
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:44,053
I asked to see you.

226
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:47,354
Why?

227
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,564
Are you sorry that you had me locked up here?

228
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,463
I want to help you.

229
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,604
How should I help you?

230
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:06,344
Do you want me to get you a talented lawyer?

231
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:12,013
Then will that lawyer break me out of jail?

232
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:14,953
- Is that your plan? - No.

233
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:20,223
A good lawyer would create mitigating circumstances...

234
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:23,094
so you get a life sentence.

235
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,533
If proof of the murders surfaces,

236
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:31,934
you will be executed.

237
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:34,803
I see.

238
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:39,473
Now I see what you're worried about.

239
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:54,154
He'll do something to the judge.

240
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:55,924
Wait.

241
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,174
Then I won't have to do anything.

242
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:12,043
No.

243
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:14,414
But what's the real reason?

244
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:19,053
Why did you stop me from killing them all?

245
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,053
To be honest,

246
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:26,023
you wanted to see it too.

247
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:31,064
Didn't you?

248
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:50,483
It can't be because of the guy outside.

249
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,334

Why did he say you betrayed him?

I don't think you need to worry about that nonsense.

254
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:40,263
Like you said, he has something that connects him to the murders.

255
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,104
Did he tell you where it is?

256
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:55,013
I hid it in the safest place.

257
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:58,344
He said he hid it in the safest place.

What is it you must do?

Judge Ryu.

267
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,314
The truth about Hope Welfare Center...

268
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:04,384
Let's tell the world about it.

269
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:10,424
Do we have to get involved?

270
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,594
The culprit was arrested,

271
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:14,894
and the media are interested...

272
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:17,493
because of all the abductions.

273

The interest of others never lasts.

274

They'll forget about it when something else comes along.

275
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,134
We, those who were involved, must do something.

276
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:30,003
That's the only way to reveal facts that other people will miss.

277

The victims are crying out there somewhere.

278

How will you make it known?

Through the media.

282
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:51,763
If the most popular current affairs documentary were to cover the story,

283
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:53,164
it will cause a stir.

284
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:55,164
We just have to say...

285
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:58,104
what we experienced and what we know.

join me?

If he had taken videos of the crime scenes,

292
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:33,604
he would have moved it to a flash drive.

293

I think I know.

00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:09,273
Where is it?

00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:11,003
Inside his body.

302
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:16,043
He swallowed it.

303
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:18,884
I doubt that.

304
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,483
Would he use such an old trick?

Seok Gu, a classic is forever.

306
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:24,654
Right, Detective Ryu?

307
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:29,064
If he said it was a safe place,

308
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:32,164
he was pretty sure about it.

309
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:36,803
If you want to talk about safety, the police station's the safest.

310
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:41,973
Is it here?

311
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:44,703
- You... - Dong Hwa. Stop it.

312
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:48,844
What brings you here?

313
00:24:51,513 --> 00:24:54,654
I want to ask for a favor.

314
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:27,953
Eat up.

315
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:32,894
I don't get why you're doing this.

316
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,824
Do you want to be nice to me instead of your real son...

317
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,334
for vicarious pleasure or something?

318
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:53,013
My In Seong.

319
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:03,124
My In Seong...

320
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:07,324
What happened to him?

321
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,894
Is he alive?

322
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:23,503
Well,

323
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,243
twenty years ago,

324
00:26:32,513 --> 00:26:34,513
we all tried to escape together.

325
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:37,084
He got caught in a trap.

326
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,064
He wasn't treated properly,

327
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,233
and he suffered.

328
00:26:57,904 --> 00:26:59,844
So I freed him from his misery.

329
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:15,824
Oh, right.

330
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:23,604
There's something he kept saying until he died.

331
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:33,943
"I miss my mom's cooking."

332
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:42,053
I miss him.

333
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:44,453
The loser crybaby.

334

Yes. That's why Jung Yoon Jae abducted me.

336
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,594
The ending he probably wanted...

337
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:35,864
was for Mr. Baek to kill me or for me to kill Mr. Baek.

338
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:38,703
You must've been shocked.

339
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:40,374
Are you okay?

340
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:42,203
It'd be a lie if I said I wasn't.

341
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,443
But...

342
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,614
I'm glad it was revealed now.

343
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,553
Now I know exactly what I need to do.

344
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:58,983
Did Minister Na say anything?

345
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:00,723
We need to investigate her now.

346
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:03,193
Prepare yourself for anything.

347
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,334
Seeing the dark side of your family...

348
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,864
is harder...

349
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:14,033
than you think.

350
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:16,374
I'm preparing for the worst.

351
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:44,303
If you want to talk about safety,

352
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:46,803
the police station's the safest.

353
00:30:51,973 --> 00:30:53,074
(Storage Room)

354
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:00,808
Get up.

355
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,118
My brother told me...

356
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:17,058
you were really smart even when you were young.

357
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,157
Did he say that?

358
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:27,167
Yes. That's what he said.

359
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:32,838
He never treated me...

360
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:35,637
like a person since we were young.

361
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:38,677
Because I always got into fights.

362
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:46,187
Maybe it's because I'm dumb,

363
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:48,118
but I don't seem to understand.

364
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:54,028
Why did the culprit bring Jung Man Chun into this?

365
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,627
Could you tell me since you're so smart?

366
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:06,467
The jury.

367
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:09,477
The jury?

368
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:12,647
A trial by jury...

369
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:15,048
is the perfect case to attract attention.

370
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,717
I see.

371
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:22,148
Then...

372
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:24,857
the culprit was in the car...

373
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,887
just like Jung Man Chun said in court.

374
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,458
Right.

375
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:52,248
Please save me.

376
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:56,987
That man is trying to kill me.

377
00:33:58,657 --> 00:34:00,357
Please open the door.

378
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,128
Please open the door for me.

379
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,668
Please, I'm begging you.

380
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,848
Thank you.

381
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,857
Thank you so much.

382
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,277
Then I guess Baek Ji Eun was grateful to the culprit...

383
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:56,378
without knowing what was coming.

384
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:57,878
Are you serious?

385
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:00,748
If he had more time...

386
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,228
So he didn't have enough time.

387
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:12,527
Because he had to kill her before her 20th birthday was over.

388
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:19,098
Right.

389
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:22,368
If he killed her on the happiest day of her life,

390
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:26,878
wouldn't her parents remember the pain of it forever?

391
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:28,248
I see.

392
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:32,277
But...

393
00:35:33,418 --> 00:35:35,188
why did he cut her lips?

394
00:35:39,118 --> 00:35:40,228
I don't know.

395
00:35:41,228 --> 00:35:43,958
It could've been for revenge.

396
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:48,668
Or maybe he enjoyed...

397
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,938
killing her.

398
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:55,567
I see.

399
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:00,348
Then why did he do this?

400
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:06,587
There were marks of assault all over Yeom Hye Jin's body.

401
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:10,257
Unlike the other victims.

402
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:13,288
What reason did he have to leave marks of an assault?

403
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:20,328
Was the culprit so weak that he couldn't handle...

404
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:22,768
a woman by himself?

405
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,208
Hey.

406
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,607
Mr. Choi was the one who hit Yeom Hye Jin.

407
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,518
How did you know Mr. Choi hit Yeom Hye Jin?

408
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:44,018
On the day...

409
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,188
you killed Yeom Hye Jin,

410
00:36:47,387 --> 00:36:49,188
you were following Mr. Choi, weren't you?

411
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,538
(Taxi)

412
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:48,788
You dragged a woman who was fighting for her life...

413
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,558
as if she were an object,

414
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:53,487
and you choked her and cut her mouth.

415
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:00,927
That's interesting.

416
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,197
Keep going.

417
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:10,237
Murderers each have their own unique habits.

418
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:12,378
You kill people...

419
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:15,648
and rip their mouths, but there's one more.

420
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:19,817
The murder video.

421
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,357
As if it's a trophy,

422
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:28,657
you recorded a video every time you killed someone.

423
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,507
With Kang Ha Na, the daughter of Director Kang,

424
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:48,348
you made the mistake of nicking her artery since you didn't have time,

425
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:50,478
but you still took a video.

426
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:54,118
Where did you get this?

427
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:14,967
The safest place.

428
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:17,507
You sure are smart.

429
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:21,677
Who knew you would've hidden evidence of murder...

430
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:26,688
in the evidence locker of the police station?

431
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:33,058
Will you still deny it?

432
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:40,898
No way...

433
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,797
There's no way my brother told...

434
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,878
There's no way my brother would've betrayed me.

435
00:39:58,547 --> 00:39:59,688
You pathetic punk.

436
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,217
If you had wanted to take revenge,

437
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:06,058
you should've made the guilty people pay for their crimes.

438
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:09,357
Why would you kill their daughters who did nothing wrong?

439
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:14,427
Those jerks killed my sister too.

440
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:16,797
They should feel it too.

441
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:20,268
They took what was most precious to us.

442
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:22,637
They should know how that feels.

443
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,837
That's what justice is.

444
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:29,547
Justice?

445
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:32,748
Jung Yoon Jae.

446
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:34,987
You're just...

447
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:37,958
a psychopath who's crazy about murder.

448
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:51,368
Oh, right.

449
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,038
Even my brother...

450
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,708
doesn't consider a piece of trash like you to be human.

451
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:15,958
What do you know about my brother and me?

452
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:20,868
I should've just killed you then.

453
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:23,538
Then?

454
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,507
Yes, in that playground.

455
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,677
I should've just killed you on that slide.

456
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:38,078
Sung Hoon.

457
00:41:39,618 --> 00:41:40,688
Watch me.

458
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:43,987
Yoon Jae.

459
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,527
Yoon Jae, don't do that.

460
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:57,197
That was...

461
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,868
you?

462
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,538
Do you remember now?

463
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:07,578
It was nice to watch you cry after losing your memory.

464
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:11,878
I don't know who I am.

465
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:17,188
I don't know what my mom and dad look like.

466
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:24,197
I don't know where I used to live before I came here.

467
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,427
Do you really not remember anything?

468
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:33,868
No.

469
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:39,677
But I think I remember someone calling me Yoon Jae.

470
00:42:41,177 --> 00:42:42,878
Do you think that's my name?

471
00:42:43,148 --> 00:42:44,947
It probably is.

472
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:48,087
Yoon Jae.

473
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:55,728
You...

474
00:42:56,757 --> 00:42:58,228
What did you do to me?

475
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:03,498
What did you do to me?

476
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,067
Sung Jun!

477
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:13,478
Darn it!

478
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,277
Hey, think about it.

479
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:21,648
Why do you think you have that necklace?

480
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:43,378
So, Number 11, if I...

481
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:46,177
No.

482
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:51,118
If I accept your offer, Judge Ryu,

483
00:43:54,047 --> 00:43:55,587
what will you be able to give me?

484
00:43:55,817 --> 00:44:00,058
Consider it a second chance that I'm giving you.

485
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:04,498
A second chance for you to make up for your mistake 20 years ago.

486
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:07,368
If you take this chance,

487
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:11,067
I will make sure to bury the past nicely.

488
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:16,907
And if I turn down your offer?

489
00:44:18,107 --> 00:44:20,007
It wouldn't be an easy offer to turn down.

490
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:26,987
(Brother)

491
00:44:28,087 --> 00:44:30,188
Think about it and let me know.

492
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:14,998
Sung Hoon.

493
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:19,438
Do you remember what you said to me in the playground 20 years ago?

494
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:21,368
What was that?

495
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:22,808
Yoon Jae.

496
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:24,777
Yoon Jae,

497
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:27,308
don't do that.

498
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:39,458
Why didn't you tell me that I didn't fall by mistake...

499
00:45:41,387 --> 00:45:44,398
and that Jung Yoon Jae had pushed me?

500
00:45:45,657 --> 00:45:46,728
You saw everything.

501
00:45:52,538 --> 00:45:54,538
I also don't know why I did that back then.

502
00:45:56,538 --> 00:45:57,978
I think I was scared.

503
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:02,348
I think I also wanted to protect Yoon Jae.

504
00:46:04,518 --> 00:46:06,277
You had lost your memory anyway.

505
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:09,947
I thought that if I stayed quiet, nothing would happen.

506
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:11,887
Nothing would happen?

507
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:23,768
You don't know...

508
00:46:25,498 --> 00:46:28,668
what happened between me and Jung Yoon Jae after that,

509
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:30,378
do you?

510
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:35,148
Jung Yoon Jae, that punk,

511
00:46:36,148 --> 00:46:38,118
made me into himself.

512
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:43,087
My mind had become a blank slate,

513
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:46,987
and he planted his own memories in my mind.

514
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:51,628
I didn't even know that,

515
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:55,297
and I lived as Jung Yoon Jae...

516
00:46:56,368 --> 00:46:57,898
from Hope Welfare Center.

517
00:47:06,538 --> 00:47:07,648
Can you believe it?

518
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:10,878
That such a young kid...

519
00:47:12,447 --> 00:47:13,918
did something like that?

520
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:24,458
I think there's something more to this.

521
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:27,967
I feel like I remember something but don't know what it is.

522
00:47:33,237 --> 00:47:34,708
Is there anything else you know?

523
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:41,308
I'm not sure.

524
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:52,188
What about this necklace?

525
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:04,637
That necklace...

526
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,668
I gave it to you.

527
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:11,478
You gave it to me?

528
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:23,587
Over there. Aim for that.

529
00:48:28,728 --> 00:48:29,828
Try once more.

530
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:45,637
(Always keep the necklace on.)

531
00:48:46,438 --> 00:48:49,308
Gosh, it'll be such a hassle especially when I shower.

532
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:51,547
Do I really have to keep this on?

533
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:56,188
(It means that we're family.)

534
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:00,357
(Look, I have one too.)

535
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,598
Okay, if you say so.

536
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:14,907
There's one for me too?

537
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:18,337
(Of course. You're our family too.)

538
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:33,487
(I'll trust that you'll take good care of Yoon Jae...)

539
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:36,757
(if something happens to me.)

540
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:39,728
Don't worry.

541
00:49:40,197 --> 00:49:43,938
I'll protect you and Yoon Jae, no matter what.

542
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:47,507
We're family.

543
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:49,938
(Thank you.)

544
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:02,587
Wearing that necklace...

545
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,217
meant that we were family.

546
00:50:06,788 --> 00:50:08,228
That's why I gave it to you.

547
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:11,228
Because I thought of you as my real brother.

548
00:50:22,808 --> 00:50:24,878
I didn't know you thought of me that way.

549
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,107
I wish I had known.

550
00:50:32,348 --> 00:50:33,887
Don't be so touched by what I said.

551
00:50:34,487 --> 00:50:35,918
Most of the time,

552
00:50:36,887 --> 00:50:38,257
I thought you were pathetic.

553
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:43,157
Good parents who are well-off.

554
00:50:43,697 --> 00:50:44,927
A smart brain.

555
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:47,067
I wondered why you were living like that...

556
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:48,797
when you had everything from birth.

557
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:54,668
I wonder too.

558
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:02,907
How come you never once asked...

559
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:05,217
who you really were?

560
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:09,547
I'm not sure.

561
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:13,728
I just felt like...

562
00:51:14,688 --> 00:51:16,288
I would be...

563
00:51:19,098 --> 00:51:20,797
abandoned the moment I brought it up.

He wants to talk to us about something.

578

We're starting a new investigative documentary...

about Hope Welfare Center.

Who's the producer in charge?

582
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,471
Me.

583
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,511
Have you lost your mind?

584
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,710
You're filming a documentary about it? Have you no shame?

585
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:04,011
I know. I wasn't going to do it,

586
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:07,750
but all the deaths made me feel guilty.

587
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,121
And as a producer, I want to make the show.

588
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:13,991
Think about it.

589
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,431
I have the footage I recorded 20 years ago.

590
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:19,860
That with the interviews of the survivors,

591

593

Footage from 20 years ago?

594
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,141
Not the one Jung Yoon Jae had? There's another one?

595
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,551
Of course, there is.

596
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:41,480
I made copies.

597
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,161
I have to submit the final proposal by the end of the week.

598
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:58,630
What should I do?

599
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,601
You two should talk about it and let me know.

600
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:05,011
I'll get going, then.

601
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,121
Darn it.

602
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,221
- What do we do? - We must stop him.

603
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,891
As for the evidence Jung Yoon Jae had,

604
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,991
I threw it in the Han River with my own hands,

605
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,931
so we just have to get rid of the evidence Producer Bae has.

606
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,661
I'll take care of it.

607
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:33,471
Just get some money ready.

608
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:36,270
Money?

609
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,011
You should at least pay me.

610
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:39,710
I'm doing all the dirty work.

611
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,310
Okay, fine.

612
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:47,721
Just make sure everything goes without a hitch.

613
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,290
A TV interview?

614
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,721
Yes. Producer Bae is working on a special documentary...

615
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:56,761
about Hope Welfare Center.

616
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:59,331
Judge Ryu and I have agreed to his interview request.

617
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,661
Can you also talk about what you saw that day...

618
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:04,500
My goodness.

619
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,701
No, I don't want to do it.

620
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,670
I don't want to have anything to do with Hope Welfare Center.

621
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,871
You can go ahead and do it.

622
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:15,181
Don't you feel bad for those kids?

623
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:20,511
He's a murderer. He does not deserve my pity.

624
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,351
Maybe he wouldn't have turned out like that had you saved him.

625
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,420
You said Yoon Jae was with other kids that day.

626
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,860
Then you should've at least saved them.

627
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,331
Other kids?

628
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,431
Right.

629
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,831
There were other kids too.

630
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:39,500
- Help! - Ma'am, help us.

631
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,741
- Ma'am! - Save us!

632
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,701
They'll kill us!

633
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,670
- Help us! - Ma'am!

634
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,340
Ma'am...

635
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,110
Help us!

636
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,940
- Help! - Ma'am!

637
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:51,980
Gosh.

638
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:54,980
That's odd.

639
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:58,250
I couldn't foresee that kid's future.

640
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,261
No.

641
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,090
Maybe it's not that I couldn't foresee it.

642
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:09,701
Perhaps, I had already seen it.

643
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,400
He's coming out!

644
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:19,340
- Get him on camera. - Get him!

645
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,210
- Get him. - Just a comment, please.

646
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,610
Why did you kill them?

647
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,210
- Do you admit to the charges? - Will you apologize to the victims?

648
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:33,821
They owe us an apology.

649
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,821
- "Us?" What do you mean? - Was there an accomplice?

650
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,891
What happened at Hope Welfare Center?

651
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:40,130
- A comment, please. - The victims...

652
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,400
- Say something to the victims. - Do you have anything to say?

653
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,831
- How do you feel? - Say something!

654
00:56:43,831 --> 00:56:46,000
Don't you feel bad for the bereaved?

655
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:47,801
- One moment! - Just a comment, please!

656
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:48,871
Why did you kill them?

657
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:50,911
Don't you feel bad for the bereaved?

658
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,840
- Say something! - What really happened?

659
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,641
- Just a comment! - Why did you kill them?

660
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:56,911
- Why did you kill them? - Why did you do that?

661
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,351
Just a comment, please.

662
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,980
You remember everything, right?

663
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,621
- Tell us. - Say something!

664
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:05,020
- Why did you kill them? - Say something to the bereaved.

665
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,491
Don't you feel bad for the bereaved?

666
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,821
- Can we get a comment? - Wait!

667
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:11,590
- No, wait! - One moment!

668
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,060
- No! - Wait!

669
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:24,770
Sung Hoon.

00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:34,121
Hey.

671
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,221
We've just completed his habeas corpus proceedings.

672
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:38,491
- Really? - Yes.

673
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,590
"Really?"

674
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,290
That's all you can say after seeing this?

675
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:47,661
Hey, it's not like he cuffed you.

676
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,860
Why take it out on him?

677
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,900
Did you tell this idiot where he could find the evidence?

678
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,610
Hey.

679
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,781
You can't do this.

680
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,250
Let's go, Seok Gu. I'll see you later, Sung Hoon.

681
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,551
Sung Hoon.

682
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,761
You must have another plan. Sung Hoon.

683
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:20,161
Hey!

684
00:58:21,261 --> 00:58:22,301
Hey, be quiet.

685
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,770
(Producer Bae Chul Ho)

686
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:09,810
Yes.

687
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,880
Okay.

688
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,690
What?

689
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,331
Have you found the answer to the question about that necklace?

690
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:27,701
Yes.

691
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,601
I sure have. The answer was very touching.

692
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:34,130
It was touching?

693
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,340
I guess you haven't found the answer yet.

694
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:38,511
What?

695
00:59:40,511 --> 00:59:43,681
Do you still not know who made you like that?

696
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:49,121
Do you really not remember what happened?

697
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:52,190
Are you just pretending not to remember?

698
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,460
Or do you not want to know the truth?

699
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:57,730
Hey.

700
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:00,690
Be honest.

701
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,500
I bet you're afraid...

702
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,670
of finding out the truth.

703
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,810
- Seok Gu. - Yes.

704
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,321
Sung Jun!

705
01:00:28,661 --> 01:00:30,491
Sung Jun, are you okay?

706
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,500
Sung Jun.

707
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:41,400
Sung Jun.

708
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,911
You can have this.

709
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:53,480
This was yours in the first place.

710
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,321
Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

711
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,821
Your real name is Jung Yoon Jae.

712
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,560
You lived at Hope Welfare Center before you came to our house.

713
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:07,031
Hope Welfare Center?

714
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:09,101
Scary people live there.

715
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,331
There, everyone called you Number 13.

716
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,411
Scary people? Who are they?

717
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,340
Crazy Dog.

718
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,380
If Crazy Dog catches you, he will kill you.

719
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:32,951
Don't tell anyone that you used to live at Hope Welfare Center.

720
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:35,460
If Mom and Dad find out, they'll abandon you there.

721
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,290
Don't cry!

722
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:40,931
Don't be sad, and don't resent anyone.

723
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:44,701
You see,

724
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,641
it's your own fault for being born to your parents.

725
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,681
Wearing that necklace...

726
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:02,380
meant that we were family.

727
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,051
Because I thought of you as my real brother.

728
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:08,420
Sung Hoon...

729
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:39,790
You said Sung Hoon betrayed you.

730
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,420
What did you mean by that?

731
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:57,601
So have you found the answer?

732
01:03:01,181 --> 01:03:02,880
I'm asking you to explain what it means.

733
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,460
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

734
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,831
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

735
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:24,130
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

736
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,471
(but with doubles and dummies.)

737
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:49,090
(Blind)

738
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,761
Your second chance to make up for your mistake.

739
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,391
He knows everything.

740
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,601
Pretend it happened when it didn't?

741
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,031
Don't do that.

742
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:02,601
I really don't know what I'd do if you keep this up.

743
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,310
Hold on to this, Eun Ki.

744
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:08,710
Let me out for just one day.

745
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,880
You roped my brother into it.

746
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:13,610
He didn't start this because of me.

747
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,181
This time, get it right.

748
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:17,480
What do you think I'll do next?
