1
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,554
(This drama is fiction and people, places, organizations,)

2
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:32,885
(incidents, groups, and settings are not based on reality.)

3
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,614
Director Lee Myung Sin.

4
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,155
What should I do?

5
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:19,605
(Episode 15: The Designer)

6
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:27,815
Sung Jun!

7
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,545
Sung Jun.

8
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:34,414
Sung Jun.

9
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:43,965
You can have this.

10
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:46,495
This was yours in the first place.

11
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,364
Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

12
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,105
Your real name is Jung Yoon Jae.

13
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:58,804
You lived at Hope Welfare Center before you came to our house.

14
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,274
Hope Welfare Center?

15
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,345
Scary people live there.

16
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,685
There, everyone called you Number 13.

17
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:11,024
If Crazy Dog catches you, he will kill you.

18
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:15,194
Don't tell anyone that you used to live at Hope Welfare Center.

19
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,625
If Mom and Dad find out, they'll abandon you there.

20
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:20,495
Don't cry!

21
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,065
Don't be sad, and don't resent anyone.

22
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:26,935
You see,

23
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:30,775
it's your own fault for being born to your parents.

24
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:45,925
Sung Hoon...

25
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:56,565
Wearing that necklace...

26
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:59,365
meant that we were family.

27
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:01,974
Because I thought of you as my real brother.

28
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:49,055
You said Sung Hoon betrayed you.

29
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:51,585
What did you mean by that?

30
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:06,634
So have you found the answer?

31
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,044
I'm asking you to explain what it means.

32
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:25,984
I guess the shock therapy I used was quite efficient.

33
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:36,865
(Cell 2)

34
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,935
Why did you make me remember?

35
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,545
Because I felt bad for you.

36
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,175
You were suffering without knowing who was doing this to you.

37
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,714
Are you sure it wasn't because you didn't want to suffer alone?

38
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,504
Did he betray me?

39
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,004
Did Sung Hoon tell you?

40
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:22,545
Sung Hoon would never betray me.

41
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,214
Did you tell this idiot where he could find the evidence?

42
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:32,285
Hey.

43
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:35,654
You can't do this.

44
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:38,394
You must be really nervous.

45
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:46,365
What made you so nervous?

46
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,475
I was just frustrated.

47
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,375
That's too bad.

48
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:55,375
You'll have to rot in a cell smaller than this for the rest of your life.

49
00:05:58,915 --> 00:05:59,944
Me?

50
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:04,584
In prison forever?

51
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:08,524
That would never happen.

52
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:15,935
A serial murderer...

53
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:20,535
will be sentenced to death regardless of who the judge is.

54
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,105
They might not carry out the death sentence,

55
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:26,975
but it doesn't change the fact you'll die in prison.

56
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,315
But you're certain you won't end up like that.

57
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:33,514
I guess you have something you can fall back on.

58
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:37,625
I'm not sure.

59
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,065
When did you start planning your murders?

60
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:52,865
From the moment...

61
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,675
he made you me.

62
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,644
That was a long time.

63
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:06,785
Did you plan this...

64
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,084
with him since then?

65
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,495
Do you want me to guess...

66
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:27,704
why you're so nervous?

67
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:31,105
You're...

68
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,904
afraid that my brother...

69
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:36,344
will betray you.

70
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,915
I thought about why...

71
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:42,285
you were so nervous.

72
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:47,285
There was only one answer.

73
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:51,625
You and Sung Hoon...

74
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:55,735
are accomplices.

75
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,805
Am I wrong?

76
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,475
I don't really understand what you're saying.

77
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:21,194
Instead of writing up a novel, do an investigation.

78
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:28,165
Do you know why...

79
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,105
accomplices betray each other?

80
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:37,204
In order to put the blame on the other person.

81
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,574
That way, they can get out of it safely.

82
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:49,854
Furthermore, if that accomplice is well respected in society...

83
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:52,525
and comes from a good home,

84
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:56,255
putting all the blame on a person like you...

85
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,565
would be a piece of cake.

86
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,435
While you're rotting away for the rest of your life in prison,

87
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,704
Sung Hoon will be outside living the life.

88
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:12,805
Are you okay with that?

89
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:26,255
Fine.

90
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:28,724
Go ahead...

91
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:31,994
and stay loyal.

92
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:52,685
(Accomplice number 3)

93
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:56,315
When did we miss the fact that Sung Hoon was an accomplice?

94
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,395
(1st Baek Ji Eun case, Baek Moon Kang's daughter)

95
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,565
(2nd Yeom Hye Jin case, Yeom Ki Nam's daughter)

96
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,005
(3rd Jo Eun Ki case, Jo In Sook's daughter)

97
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:15,074
(8th Kwon Yu Na case, Jo Eun Ki's student)

98
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,874
(9th Ryu Sung Hoon assault case, Hope Welfare Center's Number 11)

99
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:26,185
(Hope Welfare Center's Number 11, May 24 at 9pm)

100
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,815
Before the case at the riverbank,

101
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,084
I was thinking Sung Hoon was the culprit.

102
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:42,895
Even you are suspicious that I might be the culprit.

103
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:46,505
Sung Hoon had caught on and staged the whole thing.

104
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:01,655
All of this was...

105
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,724
planned meticulously by Sung Hoon.

106
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,954
Judge Ryu Sung Hoon at the Muyeong Local Court...

107
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:11,224
has decided to hold a jury trial.

108
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:12,724
Defendant Jung Man Chun...

109
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,265
is sentenced to life in prison.

110
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,874
The night that Jung Man Chun was holding a victim hostage,

111
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,775
I sent the jurors a text message.

112
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,915
All eight jurors except for Yeom Hye Jin texted back.

113
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,844
The time of their responses was between 11:30pm to 1am.

114
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,045
(3rd Jo Eun Ki case, Jo In Sook's daughter)

115
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,614
I know you won't believe me,

116
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:35,755
but it was all his idea.

117
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,925
A recording? What recording?

118
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:40,255
(Suspect Baek Moon Kang, Family murder)

119
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,354
The recorded call of Jung Man Chun and Baek Ji Eun's killer.

120
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,665
So, did you find it?

121
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:48,734
Mr. Choi got whacked.

122
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:51,035
He's been hit in the head.

123
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,535
He seemed to be in critical condition.

124
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,635
You went to Mr. Choi's place?

125
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,905
I clearly told you not to go anywhere without my permission.

126
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,775
Manager An is at Mr. Choi's place now.

127
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,214
It's a waste of time.

128
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,484
An Tae Ho will die if you keep barking up the wrong tree.

129
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:09,114
Sung Hoon. Weren't you at the wedding hall too?

130
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:12,484
(8th Kwon Yu Na case)

131
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:15,624
Kwon Yu Na. She's in danger.

132
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:18,065
Why did the culprit send you that text?

133
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:20,525
He must've been angry.

134
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,734
I'd thwarted him.

135
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:25,035
(10th case, kidnapping of 8 people related to Hope Welfare Center)

136
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,305
Two, four, zero.

137
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:28,374
The vacation home.

138
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,074
The address of the vacation home...

139
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,645
where Yoon Jung was locked up was 240.

140
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,874
There's only one other place near here...

141
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,015
that Yoon Jae would go.

142
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,084
Sung Hoon was always either at the scene of the crime...

143
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,385
or got involved in the investigation.

144
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,354
The reason he got involved in the investigation...

145
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,724
wasn't to solve the case...

146
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:50,854
but to interfere with it.

147
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:55,135
(People who will testify: Ryu Sung Hoon, Jo Eun Ki, Jo In Sook)

148
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:00,334
That should be enough for now.

149
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,685
What...

150
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,584
(Detective Ryu Sung Jun)

151
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,124
- Yes, Detective Ryu. - Eun Ki.

152
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,925
Was it you who wrote the address of the vacation home...

153
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,255
on the drawing by Number 45?

154
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,124
The address of the vacation home?

155
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,525
Yes. Two, four, zero.

156
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,734
Wasn't it you who circled the numbers?

157
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:29,734
No, it wasn't me.

158
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,334
I was just wondering who had circled those numbers too.

159
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:35,334
Okay.

160
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:52,255
This is...

161
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:55,055
Chief Yeom and my opinion.

162
00:13:56,724 --> 00:14:00,124
It won't do you any good to look into the Hope Welfare Center case...

163
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:01,734
that's over 20 years old.

164
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:03,334
Just take what you can for your own interest.

165
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:05,805
That is true.

166
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:10,374
Even if I work myself to death to look into the case and edit it,

167
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:13,175
I wouldn't even get paid more.

168
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:15,515
Then...

169
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:18,285
are you accepting our offer?

170
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,084
Well...

171
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,385
I will drop the case.

172
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,334
(2002, Hope Welfare Center)

173
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,675
Did you perhaps make a copy and hide it somewhere?

174
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,574
If you did, you might really end up in trouble.

175
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:49,574
Come on, I'm not some thug.

176
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:53,744
That's all there is.

177
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:57,984
Good thinking.

178
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,954
You sure are wise, Producer Bae.

179
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:02,124
Did you drive here?

180
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,494
No, I left my car at the broadcasting station.

181
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,295
Good. Have a drink.

182
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:12,265
But...

183
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:15,234
I don't think this will go away easily...

184
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:17,474
just by shutting me up.

185
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:24,415
Are you saying we need to make someone else shut their mouth too?

186
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:25,815
No, I'm just saying.

187
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:30,055
But it's not like we're the only ones who know what happened then.

188
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,565
Crazy Dog is in prison, so he won't be a problem.

189
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:42,494
There's Nurse Jo and her daughter,

190
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:45,135
the shaman called Eungam-dong,

191
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:47,974
and In Seong's mom.

192
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,374
I'll talk to those people.

193
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,744
Make sure to look underneath your own nose too.

194
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,874
Underneath my own nose?

195
00:15:58,015 --> 00:15:59,114
It's nothing.

196
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,155
I mean you should take every step with caution.

197
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,065
I'm sorry. My meeting ran late.

198
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:22,465
I just got here too.

199
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:26,065
- Isn't Producer Bae here yet? - No.

200
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,775
The phone is turned off.

201
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:40,785
Please leave a message after the beep.

202
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:41,914
You will be charged...

203
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,315
Is he not picking up?

204
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:45,555
His phone is turned off.

205
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:48,495
Did something happen?

206
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:51,124
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

207
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:57,065
I was a bit surprised when I heard Mr. Bae was going to do the show.

208
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:59,005
How did you persuade him?

209
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:02,035
Why is that so surprising?

210
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,945
When we were locked up in that basement prison,

211
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:08,344
I saw what kind of person he truly was.

212
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,584
They say a person shows their true colors when they're in danger.

213
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:17,884
I thought it wouldn't be easy for him to repent.

214
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,124
Why do you think it's so hard to apologize sincerely?

215
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:26,725
It's probably because even when apologizing,

216
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:29,695
people are weighing their benefits and losses.

217
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:34,535
There's usually more to lose than to gain.

218
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,144
I didn't say much to Producer Bae.

219
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,614
I only said...

220
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,684
that this would be his second chance to correct his past wrongdoing.

221
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:50,914
A second chance to correct his wrongdoing.

222
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,455
It's true.

223
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,695
Go meet with them...

224
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,035
and tell them that you're filming a documentary on Hope Welfare Center.

225
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,705
Give them some plausible excuse.

226
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:10,235
And tell them you have the tape from 20 years ago.

227
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,344
Yoon Jae already took that.

228
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:25,985
You want me...

229
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:28,995
to bluff that I have it?

230
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:33,465
And then what?

231
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,065
All we have to do is...

232
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,565
watch how those people react.

233
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:43,434
(2002, Hope Welfare Center)

234
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:03,195
What...

235
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:10,695
What's this?

236
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:13,604
Why... It's blank.

237
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:19,775
Darn it.

238
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,114
He...

239
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:26,684
This tape is blank!

240
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:30,055
The producer duped us!

241
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:38,624
Hang on.

242
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,324
Why did he...

243
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,965
tell a lie that would get found out so easily?

244
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:11,565
You're Minister Na Guk Hee, right?

245
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,394
Yes. That's me.

246
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:23,374
This is for you.

247
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,334
What's the matter?

248
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:53,765
What are these?

249
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:09,315
These photos. Where are they from?

250
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:13,854
Where are they from?

251
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:21,424
Just now, a man on a motorcycle gave them to me outside the house.

252
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,664
A motorcycle?

253
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,805
Bae Chul Ho, the producer?

254
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,235
- Was it him? - No.

255
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,174
How do you know that?

256
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,114
Oh, it's just not him.

257
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:45,525
It can't be Sung Hoon, can it?

258
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:48,455
Sung Hoon?

259
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:52,324
He's been acting strange lately.

260
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:55,394
And what Sung Jun said bothers me too.

261
00:22:56,035 --> 00:23:00,404
It makes no sense that Sung Jun has memories of being adopted.

262
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,904
Not unless Sung Hoon planted them.

263
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:05,174
Why would he do that?

264
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,844
He knows everything.

265
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:13,614
He knows exactly what we did.

266
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:30,434
You're home.

267
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,005
You got home early.

268
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:39,874
How are things with Yoon Jae? Did you get a confession?

269
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:03,235
Eun Ki, let's talk outside.

270
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:27,584
Why did you want to talk out here?

271
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:31,725
Eun Ki.

272
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:33,894
Do you have a place to stay at for a while?

273
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:37,065
I do. I found a new place a while ago.

274
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,404
What's the matter?

275
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,104
My brother...

276
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:44,275
is a bit suspicious.

277
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:47,975
You can stay the night because I'll be here.

278
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:49,715
You need to move out tomorrow.

279
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:52,884
Don't give anyone your new address.

280
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:54,644
Not even my brother.

281
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:56,184
Okay.

282
00:24:57,184 --> 00:25:00,424
And from now on, anything you hear about him,

283
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,654
I need you to share with me.

284
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:08,025
Okay.

285
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:37,884
Is this where he usually met Yoon Jae?

286
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,084
You're here for Bae Chul Ho, right?

287
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:16,354
Yes, hello.

288
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:18,664
I can't reach him.

289
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:20,094
He didn't come in today.

290
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:22,765
Oh, really?

291
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:27,104
Could I meet the writer he works with?

292
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,404
He doesn't work with a writer.

293
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:34,045
Isn't he working on a documentary on Hope Welfare Center?

294
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,515
You must be mistaken.

295
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,215
It did come up in a meeting,

296
00:27:38,515 --> 00:27:40,144
but we haven't decided if we'll do it.

297
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:42,614
Then...

298
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,555
- Okay. Thanks a lot. - Bye.

299
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,515
(Social worker Jo Eun Ki)

300
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:12,045
Hi, Eun Ki.

301
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:14,045
Did you find a place?

302
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:16,255
Yes. The place I checked out was still available,

303
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:18,055
so I can move today.

304
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:19,884
Sorry. I should help you move.

305
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,795
It's fine. I don't have much stuff anyway.

306
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:26,565
I didn't call to tell you that.

307
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:29,735
There's something odd about Mr. Bae, the producer.

308
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,735
Producer Bae? What about him?

309
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,465
He didn't come to work today.

310
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:37,475
And he lied about the documentary on Hope Welfare Center.

311
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:39,574
About making the documentary...

312
00:28:41,374 --> 00:28:42,745
Did you hear about it from him?

313
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,144
No, your brother did.

314
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:53,684
Eun Ki. Let me look into Producer Bae.

315
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:56,295
Don't worry too much. Good luck with the move.

316
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:57,755
I'll be in touch.

317
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:05,295
- Hey, Seok Gu. - You need to come over.

318
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:06,834
What is it?

319
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,164
Bae Chul Ho was murdered.

320
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:25,985
Seok Gu.

321
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,364
- Where were you? - I had stuff to take care of.

322
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:37,664
This had to be Lee Jung Soo.

323
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:41,035
Jung Yoon Jae's in the holding cell.

324
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,975
The only one who could...

325
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:45,205
kill the jurors is Lee Jung Soo.

326
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,555
Detective Park from Team Two said...

327
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:58,854
he hasn't seen Lee Jung Soo recently.

328
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,055
My gosh.

329
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:01,684
How incompetent.

330
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:03,824
There are two teams on the case,

331
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:05,225
but they couldn't find Lee Jung Soo?

332
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:07,424
Don't criticize others and focus on this case.

333
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,795
Get all the footage from the surrounding CCTV cameras...

334
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,305
and find out who Bae Chul Ho met with last.

335
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:14,334
Yes, sir.

336
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:39,725
You're here.

337
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,364
I thought you abandoned me.

338
00:30:42,364 --> 00:30:43,735
What did you do this time?

339
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,434
I didn't do anything.

340
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,565
This place is suffocating.

341
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:50,505
Get me out of here soon.

342
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,815
It seems like Sung Jun heard something.

343
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,384
Oh, that?

344
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:03,755
Ryu Sung Jun seemed to have gotten half of his memories back,

345
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:04,985
so I helped him.

346
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:09,055
But he figured out right away who my accomplice was.

347
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:13,225
Are you saying he got back...

348
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:15,634
all of his memories?

349
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,334
Yes.

350
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:24,705
You didn't know?

351
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:29,414
Gosh, look at this punk.

352
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:32,985
So he knew everything,

353
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:35,414
but he's hiding it.

354
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,864
You're really...

355
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:48,025
a lost cause.

356
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:51,465
Why are you getting mad over a little joke?

357
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:54,505
Everything you've done so far is just a joke to you, isn't it?

358
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:57,074
But to someone else,

359
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:58,634
this is a plan they spent a lifetime making,

360
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:01,005
and it's still ongoing.

361
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,574
I know. Of course, I do.

362
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:08,584
But Ryu Sung Jun keeps talking nonsense.

363
00:32:10,184 --> 00:32:12,285
He says you don't see me as a human being.

364
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:14,555
Do you know what he said yesterday?

365
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:19,394
He said you betrayed me to walk away from this alone.

366
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:23,164
So don't you think I'd get mad?

367
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,574
I don't know about anything else,

368
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,644
but it's true that I don't see you as a human being.

369
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:51,854
You've done too many things that you shouldn't have done.

370
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:55,364
I just took you out of the equation.

371
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:08,844
Don't do that.

372
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,315
If you do this,

373
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:16,955
I don't know what I will do.

374
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:23,055
Do whatever you can.

375
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,715
(Muyeong Police Station)

376
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,222
- I'm here from the police. - I see.

377
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:15,753
Did this man come here yesterday?

378
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:18,722
Yes, he did.

379
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:22,422
Did he come alone?

380
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,063
Yes. He came here alone,

381
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:28,503
but his party was waiting for him in the room.

382
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,873
His party?

383
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:31,873
How many people came?

384
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:33,943
Two people.

385
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:38,373
One was a middle-aged man, and the other was a woman.

386
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,782
She's really famous.

387
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:44,313
- She's famous? - Yes.

388
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,753
It was Minister Na Guk Hee.

389
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:53,793
Which room were they in?

390
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:57,293
Over here.

391
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,943
Did you hear what they were talking about in here?

392
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:10,273
We shouldn't eavesdrop.

393
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:36,132
Did you put this in here?

394
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:37,172
No.

395
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:39,603
What is that?

396
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:44,873
Let's check your CCTV.

397
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,672
The bag he left with isn't the same bag he went in with.

398
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:29,422
The person who put a hidden camera in the restaurant...

399
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,092
was Sung Hoon?

400
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,132
What did Sung Hoon want to find out...

401
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:41,132
by putting a hidden camera in there?

402
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:45,632
Did you meet with Chief Yeom and Producer Bae last night?

403
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,043
What did you talk about?

404
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:50,842
We didn't talk about much.

405
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:54,242
Chief Yeom wanted to get dinner together.

406
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,753
We just had a quick meal and parted ways.

407
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,552
Why did you bring a bag of money for a quick meal?

408
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:06,592
I don't know what you're talking about.

409
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,362
Everything was caught on camera.

410
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,262
The bag you brought with you...

411
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,362
was carried out by Producer Bae.

412
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:16,933
It wasn't money.

413
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:20,202
It was filled with documents. Unimportant documents.

414
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:22,873
Mom, a person died.

415
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:25,943
Tell me the truth.

416
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,123
I was being blackmailed.

417
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:36,293
About what?

418
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:38,623
Producer Bae...

419
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,663
said he'd reveal everything that happened 20 years ago...

420
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:43,092
unless we gave him money.

421
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,233
That's why I gave him the money. That's all.

422
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,563
I don't know anything else.

423
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:49,132
What happened 20 years ago?

424
00:37:49,373 --> 00:37:51,273
Do you mean what happened at Hope Welfare Center?

425
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,112
What on earth happened at Hope Welfare Center...

426
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,012
for Producer Bae to have blackmailed you?

427
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,753
Are you not going to tell me?

428
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:13,393
Because of what happened at Hope Welfare Center 20 years ago,

429
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:14,963
innocent people have died.

430
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,433
How could you be so brazen?

431
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,532
Just because you turn a blind eye to it,

432
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,572
it doesn't change the fact that something happened.

433
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,612
Who else...

434
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:33,043
knows besides you?

435
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,523
Please. Make the right decision.

436
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:33,802
(Brother)

437
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,242
(Brother)

438
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,012
Hey.

439
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,012
Where are you?

440
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:44,713
Why?

441
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:46,922
Let's meet.

442
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:51,123
I'm busy right now. Just say what you have to say.

443
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:57,132
Producer Bae. You killed him, didn't you?

444
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:02,463
Why do you think that I killed him?

445
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:04,702
You're the one who installed the hidden camera at the restaurant.

446
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:09,672
You wanted to see how Producer Bae, Chief Yeom, and Mom would act.

447
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,242
You wanted to check if they were the same as they were 20 years ago,

448
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,143
or if they had changed.

449
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,012
But these people...

450
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:21,683
They haven't changed a bit.

451
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,592
So you killed Producer Bae first.

452
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,563
Then are you going to kill...

453
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:32,592
Chief Yeom and Mom too?

454
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:37,572
You're pretty good.

455
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:41,443
Sung Hoon. Are you crazy?

456
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:43,512
Sung Jun.

457
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,213
Guess what my next move will be.

458
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:49,012
Don't get it wrong this time.

459
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:50,483
Sung Hoon.

460
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,782
Sung Hoon...

461
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:06,632
Earlier today, a murder occurred in Muyeong, Gyeonggi Province.

462
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:09,402
The victim has been confirmed as Producer Bae of NTBS...

463
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:12,833
who was one of the jurors in the Joker Murder Case.

464
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,443
Mr. Bae was discovered with a head wound...

465
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:17,342
- in an alleyway. - I'll pay for these.

466
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,842
The police assume this was the doing of the accomplice...

467
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,382
of serial killer Jung Yoon Jae...

468
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:23,853
and are pursuing the suspect.

469
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:48,143
Judge Ryu.

470
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,572
(Courtrooms, Civil Complaints Department)

471
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:55,913
(Criminal Division 1 Chief Judge's Office)

472
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,322
(Criminal Division 1 Chief Judge's Office)

473
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:11,492
What are you doing here?

474
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,163
- I came to ask you a favor. - What favor?

475
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,233
Please hold onto this.

476
00:42:20,143 --> 00:42:21,143
What is this?

477
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,112
You'll know once you see it. This file...

478
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:26,882
I'm sure you will make the best use of this.

479
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:29,382
Then I'll be going.

480
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:31,853
Judge Ryu. Are you going somewhere?

481
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:34,753
I'm going to take care of my affairs.

482
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,693
You're...

483
00:42:38,393 --> 00:42:39,922
not the accomplice, right?

484
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:01,183
Step outside.

485
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,262
You wanted to see me.

486
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:21,262
What do you want?

487
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,242
Let me out just for a day.

488
00:43:30,512 --> 00:43:32,172
What are you saying? Darn it.

489
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:33,643
Your corruption.

490
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:38,353
The evidence of your corruption.

491
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,382
I know where that is.

492
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:47,262
I'll bring you that evidence. I just need one day.

493
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:06,043
You're a psycho with a death sentence.

494
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,382
How dare you try to bargain with me?

495
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:09,483
That evidence you speak of...

496
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,452
is at the bottom of a river right now.

497
00:44:12,913 --> 00:44:15,452
I took your cell phone and your laptop's hard drive...

498
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,023
and threw them in the Han River before they ran forensics on them.

499
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,693
Bad guys never believe what people say.

500
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,632
That punk, Producer Bae, conned me with a blank tape.

501
00:44:27,362 --> 00:44:29,003
How pathetic can you guys get?

502
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:33,302
I thought there was some new evidence or something.

503
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:35,103
I got nervous for no reason.

504
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:37,813
Yoon Jae.

505
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,282
If I could have it my way,

506
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,253
I'd rip you to pieces with my own hands.

507
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:48,452
But I'm holding back since it seems I don't have to get my hands dirty.

508
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:51,492
You don't have much longer to live.

509
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:53,822
Enjoy the air in here as much as you want.

510
00:44:54,563 --> 00:44:58,563
Make sure to eat your meals too.

511
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,463
Okay?

512
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:06,572
Think about it...

513
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:11,413
before it's too late.

514
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:28,793
Sung Jun.

515
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:31,963
Guess what my next move will be.

516
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:34,733
Don't get it wrong this time.

517
00:45:42,302 --> 00:45:43,911
(Muyeong Police Station)

518
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:46,095
Jung Yoon Jae.

519
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:49,626
Get up. Get up, you punk!

520
00:45:58,306 --> 00:46:00,945
An early morning interrogation with no consent is illegal.

521
00:46:00,945 --> 00:46:02,106
It's a violation of human rights.

522
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:04,615
Who is the next target that my brother is going to kill?

523
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,945
Who is he going to kill after Producer Bae?

524
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:08,545
I didn't kill him.

525
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:19,056
Did my brother kill him?

526
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:26,865
This is interesting.

527
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:28,405
What?

528
00:46:31,106 --> 00:46:34,075
Was Producer Bae not part of your plan?

529
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,086
What will you do for me if I tell you that?

530
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:43,316
I don't make deals with a murderer.

531
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:45,416
Then why did you come here so early in the morning?

532
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:49,226
You knew that I wouldn't give it up so easily.

533
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:51,255
Because I have to stop Sung Hoon.

534
00:46:53,795 --> 00:46:56,795
If only my brother hadn't met you when he was young,

535
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:58,795
he wouldn't have become the monster that he is now.

536
00:47:00,365 --> 00:47:02,436
Even when you pushed me off the slide,

537
00:47:03,066 --> 00:47:05,206
he tried to protect you because you were like a brother to him.

538
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:07,545
That's probably why he did that.

539
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:13,516
You forced my brother to take part in this revenge too.

540
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:16,856
Isn't that right?

541
00:47:17,856 --> 00:47:20,155
You must really like Sung Hoon.

542
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,135
You're mistaken on one thing.

543
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:33,965
Sung Hoon didn't start because of me.

544
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:37,505
The person who mapped out this revenge...

545
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:40,275
was him, not me.

546
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:47,186
It was Sung Hoon's plan from the very beginning.

547
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:51,916
Based on the evidence we've collected so far,

548
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,985
we will decide on the targets of our revenge and how to do it.

549
00:47:56,996 --> 00:47:58,126
The first target is...

550
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:01,695
Crazy Dog, Baek Moon Kang.

551
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:04,896
He runs a meat processing plant on the outskirts of the city.

552
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:07,635
He has a wife and a daughter who just got into college.

553
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:10,675
He's enjoying a happy middle-class lifestyle with his family.

554
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,476
And he adores his daughter?

555
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:14,606
As for Crazy Dog,

556
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:19,445
we'll make him experience what he did to us in this torture chamber.

557
00:48:19,976 --> 00:48:21,945
- Exactly what he did to us? - Yes.

558
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,016
That is the rule of our revenge.

559
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:30,925
Next is Yeom Ki Nam.

560
00:48:30,925 --> 00:48:32,795
He is currently the chief of Muyeong Police.

561
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,235
His daughter is a divorcee, and he has a young grandson.

562
00:48:37,896 --> 00:48:39,635
He still hasn't quit that old habit of his.

563
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:41,965
He still takes bribes and has accumulated wealth.

564
00:48:42,106 --> 00:48:43,166
Hey.

565
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:47,545
Who do you think is most dear to Crazy Dog and Chief Yeom?

566
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,215
For Crazy Dog, it must be his daughter.

567
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:54,115
For Chief Yeom, it's probably his grandson.

568
00:48:58,186 --> 00:48:59,615
We cannot punish their family members.

569
00:49:00,226 --> 00:49:02,425
Our goal is revenge, not murder.

570
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:05,195
You said the rule was that we should do exactly what was done to us.

571
00:49:06,226 --> 00:49:08,996
Have you already forgotten the fact that Yoon Jung died because of them?

572
00:49:15,735 --> 00:49:17,106
I'll execute the punishment.

573
00:49:18,036 --> 00:49:19,476
Just give me the go-ahead.

574
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:24,775
(Yeom Ki Nam)

575
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:26,545
Don't hurt the kid.

576
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:32,755
Okay.

577
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:35,485
Then as for Chief Yeom, I'll target his daughter.

578
00:49:42,496 --> 00:49:43,795
Next is Choi Soon Gil.

579
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:45,666
He's a taxi driver.

580
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:48,166
He lives in a redevelopment area...

581
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,536
and is looking for his wife who ran away 20 years ago.

582
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:52,206
His charges are...

583
00:49:52,775 --> 00:49:54,876
habitual assault and assault causing death.

584
00:49:55,106 --> 00:49:56,706
Then he should be beaten to death.

585
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:00,215
Next, An Tae Ho.

586
00:50:00,516 --> 00:50:02,646
In Tae Ho's case, there were extenuating circumstances,

587
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:04,385
so I'll give him a chance.

588
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:07,255
Extenuating circumstances? He killed his friend.

589
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:09,856
He's my friend. That's why.

590
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:13,496
- What kind of chance? - A chance to be saved.

591
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:19,166
This is ridiculous.

592
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,175
If you don't want to obey me,

593
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,505
take your hands off this and go back to the US.

594
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:33,786
Keep going.

595
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:38,456
Bae Chul Ho.

596
00:50:38,686 --> 00:50:42,025
He's still greedy for money and lies all the time.

597
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:45,795
He's guilty of turning a blind eye when he clearly saw it...

598
00:50:46,595 --> 00:50:48,996
and for not speaking out when he should have.

599
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:51,465
Should we gouge out this scumbag's eyes...

600
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,066
or pull out his tongue?

601
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:54,905
Don't cross the line.

602
00:50:55,905 --> 00:50:59,135
We'll make him spill the truth of his own accord.

603
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:03,275
Next, Kang Young Ki.

604
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:05,876
He's guilty of feeding the children rotten foods.

605
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,246
Let's burn his esophagus so he won't be able to eat anything.

606
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:12,686
He has a daughter who is supposed to get married soon.

607
00:51:13,086 --> 00:51:15,956
He won't be able to eat anything at his daughter's wedding...

608
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:17,825
and will be rushed to the ER.

609
00:51:21,025 --> 00:51:22,266
Next, Jo In Sook.

610
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:27,635
She did try to save us but also sat by and watched.

611
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:31,606
Her daughter, Jo Eun Ki, will find out the truth,

612
00:51:31,976 --> 00:51:33,275
and we'll punish her.

613
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:34,945
Jo Eun Ki.

614
00:51:37,376 --> 00:51:39,545
She's an angel.

615
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,856
Once she finds out whose filthy blood is flowing in her veins...

616
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:49,226
It'll be fun to watch.

617
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:55,226
The last one is Kwon Kyung Ja.

618
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,135
She's guilty of seeing something she shouldn't have seen...

619
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,905
and failing to fulfill her duty to save us.

620
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:09,175
The seven of them will attend a jury trial as jurors.

621
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:17,016
Once you take care of Baek Ji Eun,

622
00:52:17,086 --> 00:52:19,356
someone will be wrongfully accused of the murder,

623
00:52:19,356 --> 00:52:21,056
and a jury trial will be held.

624
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:23,925
I'll be the presiding judge of the trial.

625
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:25,956
You and Charles should be on the jury as well.

626
00:52:27,226 --> 00:52:31,295
Just like that, we'll punish them one by one.

627
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:44,876
He planned the revenge,

628
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:48,316
and I simply executed the plan.

629
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:53,925
And like you said,

630
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:00,595
it's not over yet.

631
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:14,575
Earlier today, we received a video...

632
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:16,345
from an anonymous informant.

633
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:19,316
The video shows an incumbent police chief and minister...

634
00:53:19,316 --> 00:53:21,385
bribing Producer Bae who is now deceased...

635
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:24,115
to make sure the show wouldn't go on the air.

636
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:27,016
It won't do you any good to look into the Hope Welfare Center case...

637
00:53:27,016 --> 00:53:28,686
that's over 20 years old.

638
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:30,896
Just take what you can for your own interest.

639
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:34,295
I will drop the case.

640
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,295
Darn it.

641
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,235
The anonymous informant who sent this video...

642
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:40,766
said they'd send another video tomorrow...

643
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:44,436
and that the second video would be even more shocking.

644
00:53:48,146 --> 00:53:49,275
No...

645
00:53:57,086 --> 00:53:59,615
I bet this is exactly what you did back then too.

646
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:02,686
You were afraid your civil service career would be over for good.

647
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:04,396
Is that why you covered it up?

648
00:54:08,865 --> 00:54:09,896
What?

649
00:54:10,566 --> 00:54:11,635
You think...

650
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:14,005
I covered it up for my own sake?

651
00:54:14,806 --> 00:54:16,235
No, not at all.

652
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,206
I did it to protect you.

653
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:21,575
Because you went to that vacation home!

654
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:23,916
What?

655
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:26,246
Did you think I wouldn't know what went down in that place?

656
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:28,945
They took the girls at Hope Welfare Center...

657
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:30,485
and made them offer sexual favors to the guests.

658
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:32,816
The things you did there...

659
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:36,385
I know...

660
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:39,126
everything.

661
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:42,365
All of it.

662
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:52,606
You're mistaken on one thing.

663
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:55,646
Sung Hoon didn't start because of me.

664
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:58,646
The person who mapped out this revenge...

665
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:01,186
was him, not me.

666
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:05,655
Sung Hoon won't stop here.

667
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:15,595
- Eun Ki. - Detective Ryu.

668
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:18,396
Do you know where Judge Ryu Il Ho is now?

669
00:55:18,635 --> 00:55:21,206
- Why are you looking for my father? - I'm worried about him.

670
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:24,336
Judge Ryu Sung Hoon gave me this last night.

671
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:31,916
It's a petition he wrote when he was young.

672
00:55:35,485 --> 00:55:37,516
Hello, Judge Ryu Il Ho.

673
00:55:38,816 --> 00:55:41,925
I'm a 15-year-old boy who lives at Hope Welfare Center.

674
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:44,456
My name is Im Sung Hoon.

675
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:47,095
Judge Ryu Il Ho!

676
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:49,195
- Judge Ryu Il Ho! - You brat.

677
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:50,666
Are you here to see me?

678
00:55:52,066 --> 00:55:56,266
A little while ago, my friends and I got caught while trying to escape.

679
00:55:57,836 --> 00:56:01,775
My friend, Number 24, got hit by the officers' car and died.

680
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,976
Number 12 almost lost his foot because it got caught in a trap.

681
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:08,115
And Number Seven...

682
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:11,316
was locked in a mental hospital, then went missing.

683
00:56:14,626 --> 00:56:17,896
Why did we have to risk our lives to escape?

684
00:56:19,496 --> 00:56:21,226
I'm writing this...

685
00:56:21,865 --> 00:56:24,996
to tell you what kinds of things had happened...

686
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:27,336
at Hope Welfare Center.

687
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:30,905
Okay, I'll refer to this.

688
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:32,836
Thank you.

689
00:56:41,115 --> 00:56:43,416
My father was connected to the case too.

690
00:56:43,845 --> 00:56:45,655
But nothing changed.

691
00:56:46,456 --> 00:56:48,525
Director Lee Myung Sin was only punished for embezzlement.

692
00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:50,556
- With a 3.5-year sentence. - Embezzlement?

693
00:56:55,965 --> 00:56:56,996
(My Brother)

694
00:56:58,996 --> 00:57:00,806
(My Brother)

695
00:57:02,505 --> 00:57:03,536
What is it?

696
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:05,036
Come to the fishing spot in Ojeong-ri.

697
00:57:12,146 --> 00:57:13,275
I have to go.

698
00:58:20,816 --> 00:58:22,115
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

699
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:23,485
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

700
00:58:23,485 --> 00:58:24,816
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

701
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:26,056
(but with doubles and dummies.)

702
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:49,845
(Blind)

703
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:51,316
Atonement?

704
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,545
It wasn't done to help you with your revenge.

705
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:55,885
Evidence?

706
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,655
It's not over yet.

707
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:01,255
I didn't know you were so cowardly and despicable.

708
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:05,295
Have you ever truly thought of me as your brother?

709
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:08,865
Keep your eyes wide open and watch what I do.

710
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:11,235
A jury trial?

711
00:59:11,996 --> 00:59:13,195
Then I have no choice...

712
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:15,465
but to stick to my plan.
