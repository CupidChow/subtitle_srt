The student of the deity

00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:48,082
Use your power to let me see

5
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:54,752
As your student, help me go the right way

6
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:17,142
Hey, lady.

7
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,412
Lady!

8
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,272
- Please save us! - Please save us!

9
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,481
- Lady! - Please save us!

10
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,481
- They're trying to kill us! - Please save us!

11
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,578
- Make him quiet. - Save us!

12
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,479
Save us!

13
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,449
- Lady! - Please save us!

14
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:31,849
- Help us! - Save us!

15
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:33,449
Help us!

16
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,888
- Help us! - Save us!

17
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:37,419
Save us!

18
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,259
Save us!

19
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:41,328
- Save us! - Lady!

20
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:42,798
Save us!

21
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,429
- Save us! - Lady!

22
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:47,528
Save us!

23
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:49,569
Lady!

24
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:06,649
You...

25
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:08,658
have to kill that kid.

26
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:13,388
If you let him live,

27
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,028
you'll die...

28
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,059
and so will everyone else.

29
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,229
You must...

30
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:23,768
kill that kid.

31
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,499
(Episode 8: Murder Notice)

32
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,529
I got a statement from the bride's helper.

33
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:21,529
- Tell me. - The bride was changing...

34
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:23,298
into her reception dress by herself,

35
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,629
and the helper came back to get her...

36
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,928
and found her like this.

37
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:30,999
So an employee was outside waiting, but the culprit came in?

38
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,868
She said she stepped away for a moment...

39
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:34,909
when the bride's father collapsed.

40
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,289
- Are you sure? - Yes.

41
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:53,988
We'll contact you separately.

42
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:55,828
- Thank you. - Thank you.

43
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,669
Excuse me.

44
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:03,338
Everyone that was here today...

45
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,808
will get calls separately.

46
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,708
You can come to the police station then...

47
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,279
and give your statements as testifiers.

48
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,618
Then...

49
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,449
does that mean we can go?

50
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,419
Yes. You can go.

51
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:25,958
Detective Na.

52
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,328
Where's Captain Oh?

53
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:28,458
In the bridal suite.

54
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,159
I think we should take a look at the CCTV footage.

55
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,568
The CCTV footage?

56
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:48,849
Hold on.

57
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,779
It's An Tae Ho.

58
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,488
Are you sure?

59
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:54,048
This isn't my first day on the job.

60
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,159
Do you think I wouldn't recognize him because he covered his face?

61
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,737
It's An Tae Ho.

62
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:00,497
I think it's An Tae Ho as well.

63
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:02,336
What are you doing? Put out an APB for An Tae Ho.

64
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,406
- Yes, sir. - Let's go.

65
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:21,287
An Tae Ho stayed hidden at the wedding reception venue.

66
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:25,057
Then when Director Kang drank the champagne and collapsed,

67
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,656
he left the venue right away.

68
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,696
- Gosh, what is going on? - Did you see what happened?

69
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,867
Someone collapsed?

70
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:36,107
- Oh, gosh! - Mr. Kang!

71
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,307
- Mr. Kang! - Make way!

72
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,237
What happened?

73
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,906
He collapsed!

74
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:44,847
What's going on?

75
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,347
- Goodness. - Did you see what happened?

76
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:51,787
That is so shocking.

77
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,956
And then I followed him out.

78
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:15,006
Right, and that's when I lost An Tae Ho.

79
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,677
Darn it.

80
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:21,787
Sung Hoon. Weren't you at the wedding hall too?

81
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,016
- What? - As I was chasing after An Tae Ho,

82
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,687
I saw someone who looked like you.

83
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,456
You know I don't go to places like that.

84
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,826
Figures. You don't even go to your own school reunions.

85
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,667
There's no way you would've gone to a wedding.

86
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,006
There is a connection between this case and An Tae Ho.

87
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:53,877
You assume he's the culprit because of a bloody wedding invitation...

88
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,287
and the fact that he was there?

89
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,656
If that's the case, you were at the scene too.

90
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:00,557
Why are you picking a fight?

91
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:02,886
Why? Do you still suspect me?

92
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:04,357
The way you investigate...

93
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:07,557
is illogical and unscientific. That's what I'm trying to say.

94
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,466
Illogical and unscientific?

95
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,537
Fine.

96
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,867
A genius like you has a brain that works fast,

97
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,906
so everything is so logical and scientific for you.

98
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,136
But I'm not like that.

99
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:21,336
I'm not smart, so I have to tackle things head-on at the crime scene...

100
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,706
and run around until I'm sweating all over...

101
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:25,047
to find a tiny piece of evidence.

102
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,016
So what if that's unscientific and illogical?

103
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,847
All that matters is that I catch the culprit.

104
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,557
So the culprit that you managed to catch was Jung Man Chun?

105
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,816
You're the one who gave Jung Man Chun a guilty verdict!

106
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,886
You're the one who brought in contaminated evidence!

107
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:39,627
- Did I do that on purpose? - What are you two doing?

108
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:50,937
You know what happened today, right?

109
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:52,206
Someone died.

110
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,506
And it was a bride who had just walked down the aisle.

111
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,146
But do you guys have enough time to argue about your feelings?

112
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,047
Ryu Sung Jun.

113
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:01,816
Do you think I helped you despite the risks so that you could do this?

114
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,347
No.

115
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:06,456
Judge Ryu Sung Hoon.

116
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:09,386
If you can't trust your brother that much, just call the police.

117
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,227
Stop being so cheap.

118
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:15,497
What are you doing? Seriously, are you guys children?

119
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,537
It seemed like the police discovered something.

120
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:29,047
But I couldn't ask about it because Seok Gu looked too busy.

121
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,847
Ask him once some time has passed.

122
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,016
I'll look into it later.

123
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:43,787
I need to go to the bathroom.

124
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:02,207
We have An Tae Ho coming out of the bride's waiting room...

125
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,377
on the security footage.

126
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:05,117
I knew it.

127
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:07,317
Where is An Tae Ho now?

128
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,087
We can't locate him. His phone is turned off too.

129
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,916
So he's already going under the radar?

130
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,256
Can you send me a list...

131
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,817
of all of An Tae Ho's previous residences?

132
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,426
- Sure, I can. - Oh, and Seok Gu.

133
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,056
Did I ever tell you this?

134
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,396
So...

135
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,426
Tell me what?

136
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,197
Thank...

137
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,006
So, I mean...

138
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,607
Work hard while you can.

139
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:34,136
Stick by the captain and the others to learn everything well.

140
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,747
Of course, it's a shame that I'm not there...

141
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:40,117
when I am such a great role model.

142
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,516
What can you do? You're just unlucky.

143
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,756
Just worry about yourself.

144
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:47,686
Okay.

145
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:50,227
I'll see you when we catch An Tae Ho.

146
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,707
Gosh, how did he find out?

147
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:07,936
Key.

148
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:12,347
Hey, Sung Hoon. I just talked to Seok Gu,

149
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,847
- and An Tae Ho was seen... - Give me the keys.

150
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,296
- Get in. - Forget it.

151
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:27,396
Just get in.

152
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:56,286
(Kim Seok Gu)

153
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:08,867
Where are you headed first? Type in the address.

154
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,367
What address?

155
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,176
(Juror Jo Eun Ki)

156
00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:20,016
- Hello? - Hey, Eun Ki. It's me.

157
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,847
Sung Jun will send you Manager An's address list now.

158
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:23,847
Okay.

159
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:26,756
We have to find someone who might know where he is.

160
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,357
We'll visit his most recent addresses first.

161
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,156
Please look into the oldest ones.

162
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:33,627
Okay. I'll do that.

163
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:40,367
Sung Hoon. Did you perhaps plant a bug on me?

164
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,406
Why would I go through the trouble of doing that?

165
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,477
Then how did you know I was tracking down An Tae Ho?

166
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:48,646
Your brain is too clear.

167
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,247
I always wondered how criminals ever got caught by a guy like you.

168
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:55,317
That's because criminals are right on the same level as me.

(North Chungcheong Province, Gyeonggi Province, Incheon)

171
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,497
Why did An Tae Ho move around so much?

172
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,656
Most of the stuff found in the container...

173
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,727
was for camping or single-use items.

174
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,367
He has no intention of settling down anywhere.

175
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:19,477
What was this punk doing moving around the entire country?

(20-5, Byeonsa-ri, Seorae, North Chungcheong Province)

179
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:33,217
Hi, do you have a record of a child named An Tae Ho there?

180
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,256
An Tae Ho?

181
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,487
He had a big burn mark on the back of his hand.

182
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,627
Oh, I see. Yes.

183
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,296
Yes, thank you.

Sung Hoon.

189
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:37,046
That hits the spot.

190
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,786
It's good.

191
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,577
- Here. - Forget it. You eat it.

192
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:00,707
Thanks.

193
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,087
This situation must not be that hard for you.

194
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,286
Does anything change if I think that it's hard?

195
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,957
Besides, I like how it is now.

196
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:18,857
I get to eat with you.

197
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,536
This reminds me of old times.

198
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:36,847
The ramyeon you made me back then was so salty.

199
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:39,377
Salty?

200
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:42,247
Didn't you say it was good?

201
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,347
Come on. I was starving.

202
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:45,857
I had to say it was good if I wanted to eat something.

203
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:47,957
All you ever made me was ramyeon.

204
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,256
Hey. Whose fault was that?

205
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,396
The money that Mother gave us for food...

206
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,697
was all spent on paying for settling with the kids you beat up.

207
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,936
Sometimes that wasn't even enough, so I had to dip into my savings.

208
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:05,006
And then you'd be shameless enough to whine about being hungry.

209
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,536
I made a punk like you ramyeon, and now what do you say?

210
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,077
It was salty?

211
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,117
All I ever made you was ramyeon?

212
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,526
You're so weird.

213
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:26,727
You clearly show you don't want to do it,

214
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,327
but you do whatever I ask.

215
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,997
I was a scumbag.

216
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,467
You'd just had a nosebleed from studying all night,

217
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,906
and I demanded you cook me ramyeon or I'd go out and beat up someone.

218
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,817
But...

219
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:49,747
I had no other choice.

220
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:56,786
You never looked at me otherwise.

221
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:08,036
That was the only time I ever felt happy.

222
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,636
When I sat across from you...

223
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,377
and we ate together.

224
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:18,676
It felt like...

225
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,817
we were family.

226
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,756
I wish I could have ramyeon.

227
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,396
Gimbap and ramyeon is the best combination.

(Spring Light)

229
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,057
Let's go.

230
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,926
- Can you carry that? - Yes.

231
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:40,627
Can you really?

232
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,926
- Watch your step. - Okay.

233
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:45,396
Wow, Ye Seo, you're really strong.

234
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,867
I'll get the door for you.

235
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:56,946
Hold Mom's hand.

236
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,176
- Let's go. - Excuse me.

237
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:01,347
May I ask you something?

238
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,757
Do you know an An Tae Ho...

239
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:07,587
who used to live here?

240
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,087
Mr. An?

241
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,057
Yes, I know him well.

242
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,297
Who are you?

243
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,767
Oh, I'm...

244
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,367
a friend.

245
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:38,617
I didn't know Mr. An had friends.

246
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:41,517
I didn't think he would.

247
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:46,027
May I ask how you know him?

248
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,636
Mr. An...

249
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,935
saved the lives of me and my son.

250
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,245
If it hadn't been for him,

251
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:01,945
my son and I...

252
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,546
wouldn't be here.

Hey, you.

256
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,155
Are you in pain?

257
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:55,735
If you're having a baby, go to a hospital.

258
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:57,596
Not a restroom.

259
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:02,905
Why do you care...

260
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,505
where I have my baby?

261
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:06,776
Wait here.

262
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,106
I'll call an ambulance.

263
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:09,316
Don't.

264
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:11,546
If you make the call,

265
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,715
I'll bite my tongue and die on the spot.

266
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,396
Then he hurt his leg...

267
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,619
Yes.

268
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,764
Whenever I see him,

269
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,547
I feel guilty and upset.

270
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,068
He limps now because of me.

271
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:05,117
I found out that...

272
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,541
he'd been building a home for single moms...

273
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:12,216
in our neighborhood.

274
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,681
The place where we met outside.

275
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,294
It's the shelter for single moms...

276
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,091
that Mr. An built.

277
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:31,352
A boy with a burn mark on the back of his hand.

278
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,592
I remember him.

279
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,022
Was the boy's name An Tae Ho?

280
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:36,832
That's right, An Tae Ho.

281
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,403
I remember his name because it was a dreadful mark on a boy so young.

282
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:43,733
He came to our orphanage from somewhere else,

283
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:46,243
and I heard his mom had him while she was single.

284
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:48,602
Did he have any friends...

285
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:50,812
or relatives I could contact?

286
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:52,443
No.

287
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:56,413
He was with us for a few years before going to another orphanage.

288
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,953
Do you remember what the place was called?

289
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:00,822
I'm not sure.

290

It was Hope-something.

291
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:07,322
It was so long ago, I can't be sure.

292

Okay, thank you.

301
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:51,133
when did you meet Mr. An?

302
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:53,443
In high school?

303
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:56,042
Yes. A long time ago.

304
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:19,054

305
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:22,224

Mom!

309
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:39,575
What are you doing?

310
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:41,274
Who are you?

311
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:43,145
How dare you touch my kid?

312
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:48,054
I'm...

313
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:51,284
I'm sorry.

314

Who are you?

315
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:56,895
I'm sorry.

316
00:23:58,565 --> 00:23:59,665
Are you okay?

317
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,204
I should go now. Thank you.

318
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:13,744
Bye.

319
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:30,024
What was that about?

320
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:36,562
I don't know...

321
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:38,562
why I did what I did.

322
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:42,602
I just thought...

323
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,072
the kid would fall.

324
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:51,372
Do you remember what happened to you as a kid?

325

Can you do anything right?

326
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:21,943
You said you'd use An Tae Ho as bait to catch Yoon Jae.

327
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:24,013
That's why although he shouldn't have been released,

328
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:25,572
I let him go.

329
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:28,483
Then you should've linked him to Yoon Jae and gotten rid of them.

330
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,013
There was another murder because of you.

331
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,923
Who was killed this time?

332
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:35,822
She was the daughter of a juror Hye Jin did jury duty with.

333
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:40,362
- A juror? - I think his name is Kang Young Ki.

334
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,693
Do you know who that is?

335
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:47,963
I don't remember his name exactly,

336
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,372
but 20 years ago, there was a guy named Mr. Kang,

337
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:54,572
ad he was a supplier at Hope Welfare Center.

338
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:04,382
What happened?

339
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:09,753
He disappeared after we found out he wasn't who I thought he was.

340
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:12,423
What do you mean?

341
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:15,493
It turns out An Tae Ho was a good person...

342
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:18,132
who made shelters for single mothers who had no place to go.

343
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:23,203
What about you? Did you find out anything?

344
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,872
No.

345
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:28,602
I called all the orphanages that An Tae Ho stayed in,

346
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,143
but none of them still kept in touch with him.

347
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,513
It seems that An Tae Ho...

348
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:37,282
has no friends or family and lives a lonely life.

349
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:54,403
Hey, Yoon Jae.

350
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:15,822
- Did your mom call you? - What do you think?

351
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,562
Are you going to the shelter?

352
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,893
No. I want to go to the center.

353
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,032
You can't go there.

354
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:27,832
Why are you yelling?

355
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:30,102
Me?

356
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:32,233
I didn't.

357
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:34,802
I heard you were staying in the night-duty room.

358
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:37,372
It's scary to sleep alone. I'll stay with you.

359
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:39,243
No, I'm a light sleeper,

360
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:41,413
so I can't sleep with other people around.

361
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:43,453
You slept just fine here.

362
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,183
This place is different. Either way, you can't stay at the center.

363
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:49,693
You should go to the shelter and stay with kids your age.

364
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,253
How suspicious.

365
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,763
Why are you avoiding eye contact as you say that?

366
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,733
Ms. Jo, are you hiding something from me?

367
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:01,532
Hey. What would I be hiding from you?

368
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:10,913
- Hello, Detective Kim. - Tell Sung Jun to hide.

369
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:12,782
Detective Kang is headed over there.

370
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:14,542
Okay.

371
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:18,612
Yu Na, something urgent came up, so I need to go.

372
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:20,282
Everything's ready for your discharge,

373
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,983
so go straight to the shelter. Got it?

374
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:23,453
Bye!

375
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,933
Detective Ryu. You need to get up.

376
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,832
Hurry. Get up now!

377
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:36,673
- What? - The police are coming.

378
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,832
You have to get out of here.

379
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,042
- Right now! - Hold on.

380
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:50,552
Okay.

381
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:54,552
- What's up with you two? - Hey.

382
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:57,453
What the...

383
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:59,493
Are you sending me to the shelter because of him?

384
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,592
What are the two of you doing here?

385
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,763
Are you dating?

386
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:09,233
- Yu Na, it's not like that... - If you're not dating,

387
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,072
why are you hiding a serial murderer?

388
00:29:11,072 --> 00:29:13,403
Hey. I'm not a serial murderer.

389
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:15,072
If you're not, why are you hiding?

390
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:17,072
Yu Na, we don't have the time to explain it to you.

391
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:19,943
- Let's go outside. - I should report you.

392
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,042
How much was the reward for turning in a serial murderer again?

393
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,453
- Hey! - Hey!

394
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,223
I told you I'm not a serial murderer!

395
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,022
And honestly, shouldn't you be grateful to me?

396
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:34,322
I saved you at that club!

397
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,522
Who saved whom?

398
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:37,562
You're the one who caught junkies because of me.

399
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,062
- No... - Fine.

400
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:40,763
I won't report you.

401
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,503
But in return, I need to get a reward.

402
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,772
Yu Na, what's up with you today?

403
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:47,842
- Let's go out. - I don't want to.

404
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,013
Who is that guy?

405
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:00,483
He's the judge who imprisoned the junkie...

406
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:03,322
who tried to cut you with the scalpel.

407
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:12,092
This guy is really that judge?

408
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:14,203
Are you happy now that you know?

409
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,302
Let's go.

410
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:19,703
Let me join you.

411
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:22,503
I don't know what the three of you are doing,

412
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:23,713
but let me join too.

413
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,483
If you don't, I'm going to report him.

414
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,695
My gosh.

415
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,885
One, two three.

416
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:31,955
- Freeze! - What's going on?

417
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:38,155

420
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,565
Let's go.

421
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:37,914
We're looking for a suspect.

422
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,755
It seems you came to the wrong place.

423
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:43,924
- Sung Jun isn't here. - That's odd.

424
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:46,055
He called Detective Kim on a phone...

425
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:48,924
located here.

426
00:32:57,535 --> 00:32:58,835
That's my phone.

427
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:02,305
Didn't Seok Gu tell you that he was dating me?

428
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,344
- No way. - No.

429
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:07,414
He didn't mention it.

430
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,085
If you get it, please leave.

431
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:15,315
We're in the middle of a Mentor-Mentee Class.

(Mentor-Mentee Class)

433
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:23,525
A mentor?

434
00:33:23,965 --> 00:33:25,664
Instead of mentoring other people,

435
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:27,894
why don't you guide your brother on the right path?

436
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:29,765
Listen here, Detective Kang.

437
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:35,235
I apologize for the inconvenience.

438
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:01,134
Do you think he'll be back? I think he's still suspicious.

439
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:03,404
I think we should be more careful for the time being.

440
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:06,265
Try to avoid coming into the storage room.

441
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:07,634
Okay.

442
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,985
You too, Sung Jun. Don't roam around on your own.

443
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:18,644
Okay.

444
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,525
We should call it a day.

445
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:27,155
What? Is this how it's ending?

446
00:34:32,595 --> 00:34:34,034
Isn't there anything else?

447
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:36,604
Isn't there anything else? What about me?

448
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:38,735
What about you? It's time to go to the shelter. Hurry up and go.

449
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:41,135
My gosh. How boring.

450
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,423
Gosh, that was close.

451
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:54,723
Are you okay?

452
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,522
Yes, and you?

453
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:05,303
Eun Ki, your phone's ringing.

454
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:10,573
Yes, hello?

455
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:12,803
Yes, this is she.

456
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,812
Oh, I see.

457
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:17,682
Yes, thank you.

458
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,713
At noon? Okay.

459
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,352
Is something the matter?

460
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,452
They asked me to come in to make a witness statement...

461
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,982
for Director Kang's daughter's case.

462
00:35:26,053 --> 00:35:27,352
Is that so?

463
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,522
I'll be back.

464
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,602
See you later.

465
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,403
Get some rest.

466
00:35:46,513 --> 00:35:48,443
Where are you going? The courthouse?

467
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:51,682
Don't you have a car?

468
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,153
I want to see the judge's room.

469
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,352
Will you let me see it?

470
00:35:58,553 --> 00:35:59,553
Mister.

471
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:02,292
Did you really throw that junkie in jail?

472
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:03,323
Why?

473
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,193
What do you mean why?

474
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:08,732
They all said back then,

475
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:11,332
that his dad would bribe people to get him probation.

476
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,033
Oh, right.

477
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,832
Did his dad not pay you enough?

478
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,443
The verdict I gave him...

479
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,142
was based on the law and on principles.

480
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:20,173
I see.

481
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:21,772
The law and principles?

482
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:24,513
There's no judge who actually cares about that stuff.

498
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,113
Thank you.

499
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,482
So...

500
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,812
What did the detective say to the two of you?

501
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:40,423
He asked me to speak in detail about what I saw at the wedding.

502
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:42,723
Me too.

503
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:45,622
And he asked me if I saw Manager An at the wedding hall.

504
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,662
He asked you too?

505
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:52,062
I told you. The police suspect Manager An is the culprit.

506
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:55,073
Then...

507
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:57,102
What's up with Detective Ryu Sung Jun?

508
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:01,812
Didn't Detective Ryu kill Baek Ji Eun and Yeom Hye Jin?

509
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:05,843
Aren't those cases and this one not related?

510
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:07,513
Why aren't they related?

511
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:09,182
Baek Ji Eun and Coco Mom.

512
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:12,223
And even Director Kang's daughter. They're all connected.

513
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:14,752
What do you mean by that?

514
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:17,193
How are those three connected?

515
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,392
Mr. Bae.

516
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:24,863
Do you know something about this case?

517
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:28,832
Well...

518
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:30,702
What would I know?

519
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:40,452
All three of them had their mouths cut.

520
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:43,082
Gosh, I thought it was something more.

521
00:38:56,662 --> 00:38:57,963
("Save Me" Big event! Deadline closing in 20 hours.)

522
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,463
Gosh, what's this?

523
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:04,473
("Save Me" Big event! Deadline closing in 20 hours.)

524
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:20,553
Goodness.

525
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:22,792
("Save Me" Big event! Deadline closing in 20 hours.)

526
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:29,062
What is this?

527
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,533
"Save An Tae Ho?"

528
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,973
I think it means saving An Tae Ho's life.

529
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:40,973
("Save Me" Big event! Deadline closing in 20 hours.)

530
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,312
This seems...

531
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,013
kind of serious.

532
00:39:45,412 --> 00:39:46,752
I'll try clicking on the link.

533
00:39:56,963 --> 00:39:58,892
What? That's An Tae Ho.

534
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:01,392
What is this?

535
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,633
Isn't that Manager An?

536
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,133
What is this?

537
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:10,673
I think it is Manager An.

538
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:38,133
(Brother)

539
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:40,332
Hey.

540
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:42,673
I saw it too.

541
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,272
Okay. I'll be right there.

542
00:40:58,252 --> 00:40:59,982
Someone, please call the police.

543
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,423
I'll call them. It's on my phone too.

544
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,263
- I'll head out first. - I'll come with you.

545
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:10,803
Goodness.

546
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:13,232
We need to perform an exorcism or something.

547
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:15,232
We'll all end up dead at this rate.

548
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:28,182
Every hour, the noose is being tightened automatically.

549
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,082
There are 19 hours left.

550
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:36,493
Sung Hoon.

551
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:40,062
Couldn't this be a recorded video?

552
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:46,062
What reason would they have to send it out as if it were a live stream?

553
00:41:46,502 --> 00:41:47,803
Darn it.

554
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:51,642
The culprit is planning...

555
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:54,843
to publicly execute An Tae Ho as we all watch.

556
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:56,812
Publicly execute him?

557
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:04,522
Could this be...

558
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:06,553
a self-fabricated scenario by An Tae Ho?

559
00:42:06,852 --> 00:42:08,153
Couldn't it be a show...

560
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,823
so he can pretend to be dead and live a whole new life somewhere?

561
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:15,263
But then...

562
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:17,232
look at his face.

563
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:18,963
Could this be fabricated?

564
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:26,272
I wish it actually was a show.

565
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:30,142
- Eun Ki. - You're watching it, right?

566
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:32,312
All the jurors got the message.

567
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,883
- All of you got it? - Yes.

568
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:48,633
Hey. What do we do?

569
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:52,502
Darn it.

570
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:55,232
- Captain. - Yes?

571
00:42:55,232 --> 00:42:57,243
- I've located the IP address. - Really? Where?

572
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,473
It's an Internet cafe downtown.

573
00:42:58,602 --> 00:42:59,872
- Head over there now. - Yes, sir.

574
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:17,022
Hello.

575
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,122
Hello. Police.

576
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:20,332
Oh, I see.

577
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,993
Which computer belongs to this IP address?

578
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:25,062
Just a second.

579
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,073
- It's number 52. - Where...

580
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:28,473
- It's over there. - Number 52...

581
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:44,283
Since when was that seat vacant?

582
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:45,923
It's been vacant all day.

583
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:36,633
We have no way of figuring out where this could be.

584
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,843
Is this above-ground or a basement? Is he in the city or not?

585
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,243
How are we supposed to save An Tae Ho?

586
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:45,042
Can't we catch the killer by tracing the IP address?

587
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,783
To the killer, this is like a game.

588
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:47,952
A game? What do you mean?

589
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,323
The fact that he sent this video...

590
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:53,653
shows that he feels confident he will win this game.

591
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:58,323
I bet he already knows that the police are tracking his IP address.

592
00:44:58,923 --> 00:45:00,363
I'm sure he diverted his IP address.

593
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:04,633
Darn it, this scumbag...

594
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:11,173
Hold on.

595
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:14,812
Do you hear that?

596
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:29,852
It's some kind of bell.

597
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,162
I think it's a clock bell.

598
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,133
It sounds familiar.

599
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:51,082
It sounds the same.

600
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,783
Manager An is at Mr. Choi's place now.

601
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:56,812
Wait.

602
00:45:57,752 --> 00:46:00,392
How can you be so sure that he's at Mr. Choi's place?

603
00:46:00,622 --> 00:46:02,653
The exact same wall clocks can be found all over the country.

604
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:04,593
You heard that too. It sounds exactly the same.

605
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:06,223
We're only speculating here.

606
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:09,062
I'll go there and find out whether I'm right or not.

607
00:46:10,432 --> 00:46:11,763
It's a waste of time.

608
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:13,803
An Tae Ho will die if you keep barking up the wrong tree.

609
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:16,173
Don't you think we're wasting time by arguing like this?

610
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,403
This could be dangerous, Eun Ki. Just stay here.

611
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:45,633
No, I'm coming with you.

612
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:51,002
- Be careful. - You too.

613
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:06,852
An Tae Ho.

614
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,493
We picked up a signal from An Tae Ho's phone again.

615
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:15,493
Darn it.

616
00:48:15,752 --> 00:48:18,363
- Hey, are you sure it's here? - Pardon me?

617
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,493
- Did we come to the right place? - Sorry?

618
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:22,963
That little...

619
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:32,343
Do you hear that?

620
00:48:33,073 --> 00:48:34,213
Where is it?

621
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:36,243
Where is the sound coming from?

622
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:38,812
- It's this way. - It's here.

623
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:41,852
- Where is it? - Wait! Hold on.

624
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:44,252
- Where is it? - Hold on.

625
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:46,482
Goodness. Go away.

626
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:38,586
What happened?

627
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:47,327
Manager An probably doesn't know that we're watching him, right?

628
00:49:52,997 --> 00:49:54,537
I think he's trying to say something.

629
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:01,736
Yes, An Tae Ho. Where are you?

630
00:50:02,037 --> 00:50:03,677
Tell us, please.

631
00:50:05,776 --> 00:50:06,847
Yoon Jae.

632
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:16,787
That day, 20 years ago...

633
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:20,827
Yes, it was me.

634
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:26,126
I was the one who told Crazy Dog about our plan to escape.

635
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:31,166
I thought about telling you guys the truth...

636
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:34,006
I debated, time and time again.

637
00:50:34,006 --> 00:50:35,936
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

638
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:38,077
At the time,

639
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:42,477
all I could think was that I had to get out of that misery.

640
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:47,186
I really didn't know Number 24 would die.

641
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:48,356
I swear, I didn't know.

642
00:50:54,097 --> 00:50:56,396
Since then, there hasn't been a single day...

643
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:59,566
when I could sleep peacefully.

644
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:03,236
The moment I close my eyes, I see Number 24's face.

645
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:07,137
No matter how hard I try to run, I can never get away from it.

646
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:12,376
I suppose it's time to put myself out of this misery.

647
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,747
I'm really happy...

648
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,787
I got to see you again before I breathed my last.

649
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:24,086
There was something...

650
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:27,756
I really wanted to tell you if I ever met you again.

651
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:32,526
I'm sorry.

652
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,466
I'm sorry, Yoon Jae.

653
00:51:38,966 --> 00:51:41,836
Number 11, 12,

654
00:51:42,836 --> 00:51:44,037
and 24...

655
00:51:45,006 --> 00:51:47,977
I owe you all an apology. I'm really sorry.

656
00:51:52,716 --> 00:51:53,816
And...

657
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:57,887
I really hope...

658
00:51:58,557 --> 00:52:01,197
I'm the last one.

659
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:05,796
You must stop, Yoon Jae.

660
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,146
An Tae Ho.

661
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:25,747
We only have three hours left now.

662
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:45,166
Ma'am.

663
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,677
Everything you said at the wedding was very accurate.

664
00:52:48,037 --> 00:52:51,606
Look. Do you think you can figure out where he is?

665
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:54,216
If I knew that,

666
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,847
I wouldn't be drinking here now.

667
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:01,356
Your karma decides when and how you will die.

668
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:04,756
Oh, boy.

669
00:53:20,807 --> 00:53:21,907
What?

670
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:23,376
That wall...

671
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:26,347
What is it?

672
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:28,146
That wall.

673
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:30,677
The walls were covered with blackout curtains.

674
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,586
Something's written on the wall.

675
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,086
Let me zoom in.

676
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:40,657
(Someone's in here.)

677
00:53:40,657 --> 00:53:43,856
"Someone's in here?"

678
00:53:49,197 --> 00:53:50,296
This is...

679
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,006
It says, "11, 12, 13. Help us."

680
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:55,936
What? "11, 12, 13?"

681
00:53:57,006 --> 00:53:58,747
I've seen this before.

682
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:00,847
This? Where?

683
00:54:02,517 --> 00:54:04,146
I swear, I've seen it before.

684
00:54:04,347 --> 00:54:05,486
Where did I see this?

685
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,577
(2002, Hope Welfare Center)

686
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:00,936
Sung Jun!

687
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:05,606
Mom.

688
00:55:05,947 --> 00:55:07,816
Where did you meet me?

689
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,546
Who's here?

690
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:15,057
You little...

691
00:55:15,517 --> 00:55:17,157
What on earth is going on?

692
00:55:17,216 --> 00:55:18,427
I don't have time to explain.

693
00:55:19,157 --> 00:55:20,927
Tell me where you met me before you brought me home.

694
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:22,126
What?

695
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:23,227
What are you talking about?

696
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:24,367
I know everything.

697
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,396
Where was I adopted from?

698
00:55:33,736 --> 00:55:35,006
I don't have time. Tell me now!

699
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:37,747
Come with me.

700
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:40,506
Someone is on the verge of death in that place now.

701
00:55:40,977 --> 00:55:43,376
Where was it? You have to tell me now!

702
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:44,617
Someone is dying?

703
00:55:45,586 --> 00:55:46,847
Who?

704
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:56,097
- Hi. - I found out...

705
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,597
where Manager An was 20 years ago.

706
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:58,997
Where?

707
00:55:59,066 --> 00:56:01,796
An orphanage in Sosan-myeon, Seosan-gu.

708
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:04,436
But I can't call them because there's no phone number.

709
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:08,936
I see that he lived there from 2000 to 2002,

710
00:56:09,006 --> 00:56:10,276
so this must be the place.

711
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:13,006
Bosin-ro 23, Sosan-myeon, Seosan-gu?

712
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:15,316
Okay.

713
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:17,577
Sung Jun.

714
00:56:17,577 --> 00:56:18,986
Don't go.

00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:20,947
You really don't remember anything?

722
00:57:21,677 --> 00:57:23,617
We had decided to escape.

723
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:27,416
The one who betrayed us...

724
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:29,256
was Number Seven.

725
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:33,657
We found out where Manager An is.

726
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:35,396
Detective Ryu is on his way there now.

727
00:58:08,756 --> 00:58:10,227
Number 25.

(Brother)

729
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:42,296
Pick up, Sung Jun.

730
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:15,117
Stop.

731
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:17,486
Get back here.

732
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:30,296
Where is he? You scumbag...

733
01:00:48,856 --> 01:00:50,117
You psycho...

734
01:00:53,586 --> 01:00:54,796
Stop.

735

(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

736
01:01:28,327 --> 01:01:29,727
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

737
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,997
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

738
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:32,227

Hope Welfare Center was where everything began.

741
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,827
All the kids who were there...

742
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:06,296
Get rid of him.

743
01:02:08,097 --> 01:02:09,296
- Get a taste of it. - Sung Hoon!

745

You think Detective Ryu was behind Manager An's case too?

746
01:02:14,637 --> 01:02:16,776
I thought we were a team.

747
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:18,307
What is he hiding?

748
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:20,707
Why did the serial killings occur?

749
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:22,216
We've got a problem.

750
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:23,977
And the truth behind the real killer.
