1
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,300
Goodness.

2
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:49,549
Who are you?

3
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,011
I'm a producer at a broadcasting station.

4
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,220
I received a tip that children are dying at Hope Welfare Center.

5
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,290
Yoon Jae, stop.

6
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,850
Who are you?

7
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,440
Are you really a producer?

8
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,011
- Can I see your ID? - Sure.

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Here.

10
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,460
I'm filming this in secret, so the staff doesn't know.

11
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,291
Do you guys live in this welfare center?

12
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,990
Why are you locked in here?

13
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,690
What did you do wrong?

14
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,231
You should ask one question at a time.

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,131
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

16
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,701
I was in a rush.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,201
If I tell you everything,

18
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,671
what will you do?

19
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,840
I have to tell the world and save you guys from here.

20
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:56,611
Then save him first.

21
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,090
No way.

22
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:11,530
He got caught trying to run away.

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,460
If he doesn't get treatment soon, he's going to die.

24
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,941
Those jerks.

25
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,959
(Episode 9: Square One)

26
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,400
(There are people in here. Please save 11, 12, and 13.)

27
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,071
Number seven, An Tae Ho.

28
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,440
(24 hours ago)

29
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,050
You betrayed us.

30
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,150
This is why you must die.

31
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,220
But you don't have to be in despair already.

32
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:11,921
I'm planning...

33
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,891
on giving you a chance.

34
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,661
This machine...

35
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,071
is set up to pull up the rope every hour.

36
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:30,171
After 24 hours, your feet will be dangling in the air.

37
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:37,451
But if someone comes to save you in that time,

38
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:39,881
you'll be able to leave here alive.

39
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,290
What do you think will happen?

40
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,751
Do you think people will come to save you?

41
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,290
Or will they turn a blind eye?

42
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,650
I really don't have much time left.

43
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,280
Now that I'm about to die,

44
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,821
I'm reminded of the moments we were together here.

45
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,530
Do you remember how we hid from Crazy Dog...

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,860
and had a water fight in the showers?

47
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:29,431
The reason why...

48
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,670
I was able to endure each day in that nightmare...

49
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,081
was because I spent that time with all of you.

50
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,311
We came up with a plan to escape together,

51
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:46,381
and we talked about the food we wanted to eat once we got out.

52
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,551
If I didn't make that decision,

53
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,261
we might still be living like that.

54
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:00,730
Even in our 40s and 50s,

55
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,270
we would rely on each other like back in the day.

56
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,910
I'm sorry...

57
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:21,280
that this is all I could do.

58
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,090
I'm really sorry.

59
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,321
An Tae Ho! No!

60
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,960
Wake up, An Tae Ho!

61
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
An Tae Ho!

62
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,571
Come on!

63
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,511
Sung Hoon.

64
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,410
An Tae Ho!

65
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,020
Sung Hoon.

66
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,451
- Sung Jun. - An Tae Ho!

67
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,480
Sung Jun.

68
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,650
An Tae Ho. Wake up.

69
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,191
Stop.

70
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,160
It's too late.

71
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,161
I can save him.

72
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,071
Wake up.

73
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,970
- Sung Jun. - I can do it.

74
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,140
- Darn it! - Stop!

75
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,081
An Tae Ho chose this himself.

76
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,821
An Tae Ho chose...

77
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,990
to punish himself.

78
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:19,230
So stop.

79
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,130
Let him go.

Sung Jun!

We finally found you.

86
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,390
Get him.

87
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:13,210
It would've been nice if you had died the last time we caught you.

88
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,980
What do you think you're doing?

89
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:18,050
If you hurt my brother, I will kill you.

90
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,280
I will kill you!

91
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:20,681
If you wanted to save your brother,

92
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,821
you shouldn't have killed my daughter.

93
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:27,090
You should feel the pain of seeing your family die too.

94
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,681
Moon Kang!

95
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,350
Go.

96
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,619
- Round them up! - What is this?

97
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,420
Hurry up!

98
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,590
- Hands in the air! - Freeze!

99
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,930
- Don't move! - Hands in the air!

100
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:08,060
- Freeze! - What?

101
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,271
- Get them. - Go!

102
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,000
- Darn it! - Freeze!

103
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,941
- Hey! - Stop!

104
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,890
(Detective)

105
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,370
(Violent Crimes Team 4)

106
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,171
- Seok Gu, what happened? - You're here.

107
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,970
Is Detective Ryu okay?

108
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,651
Is this your girlfriend?

109
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:35,821
You've got to be joking.

110
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,629
The situation is not good.

111
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,090
He was arrested at the scene where An Tae Ho's body was found.

112
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:48,460
Does the police suspect Detective Ryu in Manager An's case too?

113
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:52,340
Detective Ryu went there to save Manager An.

114
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,040
I can attest to that.

115
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,411
But then the fact that you hid him all this time would be revealed.

116
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,541
- Would that be okay? - That doesn't matter. I'll testify.

117
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,581
No. I don't think Sung Jun would want that.

118
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,820
Then what about Judge Ryu? He must've gone there too.

119
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,421
Didn't you meet him there?

120
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:15,120
We did meet him, but the thing is...

121
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,590
That jerk must be the culprit.

122
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,130
Why the big sigh?

123
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,901
Detective Kang. How is my brother?

124
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,571
He almost died because of Mr. Baek and his men.

125
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,541
My brother is okay, right?

126
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,051
What a touching display of brotherly love.

127
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:13,151
You're this worried about your brother,

128
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:16,291
but your brother is...

129
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,691
- What does that mean? - Ryu Sung Jun.

130
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,560
How do you think we knew...

131
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,191
that you were at Hope Welfare Center?

132
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,740
(Statement)

133
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,980
Can you tell us why you reported it?

134
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,350
Is there any other reason for wanting to know the truth?

135
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,021
What truth do you mean?

136
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,161
Why a serial murder happened...

137
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,161
and who the culprit is. That's what I mean.

138
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,140
Step outside.

139
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:16,810
Don't let anyone in until I call you.

140
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,880
Yes, sir.

141
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,890
Good going.

142
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,931
You should've run for it before the cops got there.

143
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,960
What do you think you're doing, getting dragged in here like this?

144
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,571
You must not know me very well, Chief.

145
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:42,171
I didn't come in here because I didn't know how to run.

146
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,911
Then what?

147
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,110
Do you mean you came in here on purpose?

148
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,490
Have you lost your mind?

149
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,431
Don't you know where we are?

150
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,801
Don't do anything stupid.

151
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,801
Chief.

152
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,970
Just because I bowed to you, do you think you're above me?

153
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,771
The flowers on your shoulder mean nothing to me.

154
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,410
You just have to do as I say from now on.

155
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,910
Do you understand?

156
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,590
(Doing our best, Muyeong Police)

157
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,321
Judge Ryu.

158
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,860
Let's talk.

159
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:41,261
Later.

160
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,531
I'd rather we talk now.

161
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:50,271
I was told you reported Detective Ryu.

162
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,311
Why?

163
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,610
Did you have to go and do that?

164
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:57,011
Why should I explain that to you?

165
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,120
Oh. I get it.

166
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,620
It was my wishful thinking.

167
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,031
I thought we were a team.

168
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,501
If you don't want to explain, don't.

169
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,471
But I need to speak my mind.

170
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:21,471
Did you ever stop to think how Detective Ryu must feel?

171
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:25,741
How it must feel to be betrayed by the brother he trusted?

172
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,350
You'd never get it.

173
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:32,721
Because all you care about are law and principles.

174
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,261
(Muyeong Police, Doing our best for the safety of our residents)

175
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:40,420
Are you here about Sung Jun?

176
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,481
I'll try to...

177
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,390
You said you'd handle it.

178
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,190
Is this you handling it?

179
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,660
I had no choice this time.

180
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,761
You had no choice?

181
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,399
I trusted you and spoke to the media, the whole nation.

182
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,930
And... And what?

183
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,771
You should calm down.

184
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,740
Let's hear what Sung Hoon has to say.

185
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,811
Okay, then. Speak up.

186
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:08,380
What could you not handle...

187
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,350
that got Sung Jun ended up in a cell?

188
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,481
If I hadn't called the police, both Sung Jun and I...

189
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,491
would've died at Baek Moon Kang's hand.

190
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,390
Who is Baek Moon Kang?

191
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,090
Do you not know, Mother?

192
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,461
How would I know someone like that?

193
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,909
Baek Moon Kang was the head of security...

194
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,180
at Hope Welfare Center.

195
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:44,081
His daughter is the victim of the Joker Murder.

196
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,991
Baek Moon Kang believes Sung Jun killed his daughter.

197
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,690
I think he followed me to get to Sung Jun.

198
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:01,061
By the time I'd noticed, it was too late.

199
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,001
The police station...

200
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,670
is the safest place?

201
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:10,169
Okay. You're not entirely wrong...

202
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,771
But I was wrong.

203
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,981
Sung Jun's locked up with Baek Moon Kang.

204
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,950
In the same station.

205
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
What?

206
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,771
You asked to see me?

207
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,311
Yes. What did Yoon Jae say?

208
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,511
Who is "Yoon Jae"?

209
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,211
Did I say "Yoon Jae"?

210
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,481
I was thinking of something else and my tongue slipped.

211
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,560
Did Sung Jun confess?

212
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:04,360
No. As we thought, he denied everything.

213
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,331
Okay. Then pretend to investigate him,

214
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,100
and when you get the chance, take him to Baek Moon Kang.

215
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,741
Do you know what I mean?

216
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,210
Yes, sir.

217
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,170
What's important is what happens next.

218
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:22,180
Once Baek Moon Kang takes care of Sung Jun,

219
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,450
you have to take out...

220
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,221
Baek Moon Kang.

221
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,850
Chief. Are you telling me...

222
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,761
to murder someone?

223
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:39,700
Why are you so surprised?

224
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,001
It won't be your first time.

225
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:51,041
Hello, it's me.

226
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,910
It's done.

227
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,880
Mr. Baek's people took Sung Jun.

228
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,811
Live rounds were fired,

229
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,081
so they won't think we lost him on purpose.

230
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:04,791
I'll report Sung Jun killed Jung Man Chun's wife and son...

231
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,491
No. There isn't a problem.

232
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:14,801
Yes, sir.

233
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,541
Shoot.

234
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,140
Hush. Be quiet.

235
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,541
Be quiet!

236
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,900
Even if I take it down to negligent manslaughter...

237
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:25,629
and you end up with a criminal record with no connections,

238
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,041
do you think you can recover?

239
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,811
To the rich and powerful, a mistake is a memory to look back on.

240
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:36,711
To those with nothing, a mistake equals a crash.

241
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:40,221
It will end your life.

242
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:57,001
Baek Moon Kang.

243
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,100
You dare threaten me?

244
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,070
(Muyeong Community Children's Center)

245
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,380
- This isn't it. - It's not it!

246
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,751
Ms. Jo!

247
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,081
Don't hurt yourself.

248
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:37,140
I wonder if he ate.

249
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,251
Who?

250
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,750
A uniform? Did you go to school?

251
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,860
You told me to sit the exam, so I did.

252
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,590
All the writing sounded foreign to me.

253
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,731
You literally just sat through it.

254
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,870
Good for you, though.

255
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,271
The detective guy got caught?

256
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,940
Yes.

257
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,981
When will the judge come by?

258
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,081
He has no reason to anymore.

259
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:22,781
What? You can't say that.

260
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,390
You called him my mentor.

261
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,961
Call him over now. I have more exams tomorrow.

262
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:33,001
A mentor's not a private tutor that helps you cram the day before.

263
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,071
What's his number?

264
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,600
No, I should just go and see him.

265
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:45,471
He works at Muyeong Local Court, right?

266
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:52,879
(Muyeong Local Court)

267
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,251
It's close by.

268
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,450
Yu Na.

269
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,350
Why are you so interested in Judge Ryu?

270
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:02,620
It's fun.

271
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,900
He looks like he has a lot of secrets.

Sung Hoon.

273
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,690
Sung Jun...

274
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:40,360
is your one and only brother.

275
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,400
Can you...

276
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:47,170
get him out?

277
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,150
About my chief...

278
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:41,821
What's the real reason why he wants me to kill Ryu Sung Jun?

279
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,160
You're the only one who will suffer if you stay loyal.

280
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,130
Once the hunt is over, the hunting dog will be killed.

281

If you tell me what Chief Yeom's secret is,

282
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,311
I'll make sure to save you without letting him know.

Detective Kang.

284
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,321
Did my brother's interrogation end well?

285
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,021
Did he get home safe?

286
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,110
What is this?

287
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:43,481
It's a video I just found.

288

Where's Baek Moon Kang right now?

298
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:26,750
Detective Kang took him to ask him some more questions.

299
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:29,221
Captain Oh, we're in trouble.

300
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:32,261
Detective Kang was attacked by Baek Moon Kang.

301
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,760
What? What do you mean he was attacked?

302
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,800
Well... It was in the bathroom...

303

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,051
and you ended up getting hurt by that piece of trash, Baek Moon Kang.

339
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:28,590
This will never happen again.

340
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,020
I will never drag you into my mess again.

341
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:36,730
So you can stop caring about my affairs too.

342
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,071
It's too late for that.

343
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,951
Tae Ho is dead?

344
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,451
My goodness. How?

345
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,721
The investigation is still ongoing, so I don't know the details either.

346
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:07,230
Actually, Director, the reason I called today is...

347
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:09,030
Would you happen to know anyone...

348
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,161
who has information on Hope Welfare Center?

349
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:14,801
I'm not sure, but I'll look around.

350
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,701
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

351
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,860
Revenge begot revenge.

352
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:44,900
Yes. All of this...

353
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,801
started at Hope Welfare Center.

354
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:50,770
Did you remember anything else when you were there this time?

355
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,170
It's all a mess.

356
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,511
I'm not sure.

357
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,610
Could it be you're instinctively trying not to remember?

358
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:05,451
As I saw Manager An's last moments,

359
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,190
I somehow thought that might be the case.

360
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,031
Hope Welfare Center...

361
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,229
What on earth happened there...

362
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,471
that it left this kind of trauma on you?

363
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,440
And the dozens of kids who were there...

364
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,110
How do you think they're doing now?

365
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,880
I'll keep looking for the kids who were there.

366
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,351
I hope you feel better too.

367
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,420
Can I see your phone?

368
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:55,500
Press that if you're in an emergency.

369
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,940
What's this?

370
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,940
If you're curious, try pressing it.

371
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:02,971
(Emergency alert)

372
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,511
It's an emergency call service.

373
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:14,221
(Emergency alert)

374
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:17,520
I will now give you...

375
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:20,790
an interim investigative report of the Joker Murders.

376
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,760
First, the suspect, Detective Ryu Sung Jun of this police station,

377
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,130
has been cleared of all charges.

378
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,701
We sincerely apologize to Detective Ryu and his family,

379
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:36,871
as well as the public, for causing confusion.

380
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:41,250
(Jung Man Chun's Family's Murder Case Investigation Update)

381
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,980
The culprit of the Jung Man Chun Family Murder Case is...

382
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:52,190
the father of the Joker Murder victim, Mr. Baek Moon Kang.

383
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,590
(Jung and Baek's relationship)

384
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:57,189
We have arrested Baek Moon Kang for the murder of Jung Man Chun...

385
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,960
by pushing him off of the hospital roof on April 22,

386
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:04,371
and also for the murders of his wife and son...

387
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,741
who were staying in a motel.

388
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,011
Next, I will describe Baek Moon Kang's crime methods.

389
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,741
The suspect, Baek Moon Kang,

390
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,680
killed Jung Man Chun's wife and son at the motel,

391
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,581
then went to the hospital to kill Jung Man Chun.

392
00:43:19,081 --> 00:43:20,950
The button found at the scene, which belonged to...

393
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,721
Detective Ryu Sung Jun,

394
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:27,359
was confirmed to have been taken by the suspect's subordinate.

395
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
(Security footage from outside the motel)

396
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:32,661
Also, he seriously injured a police officer who was watching him,

397
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,230
making him lose consciousness.

398
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,899
And he testified that...

399
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,540
he used the fact that Ryu had been there and attempted to frame him.

400
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,440
(The assailant, Baek)

401
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:51,920
(Mother)

402
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,820
Yes, Mother.

403
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,761
Son. You did well.

404
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,560
There's no need for that.

405
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,831
I only did what I had to do.

406
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:24,081
He will be buried at an arboretum near the unwed mothers' shelter.

407
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,581
I went there and saw the place too.

408
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:29,321
The view is great, so I'm sure Manager An will like it.

409
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:32,420
I'll leave it to the two of you.

410
00:44:32,661 --> 00:44:35,460
I wish I could help, but I'm not well enough.

411
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,761
Are you ill?

412
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:40,801
No, I just saw the news that the culprit had been caught.

413
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,371
I felt so relieved and had a lot to drink for a few days.

414
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:44,971
My stomach feels terrible.

415
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,839
Actually, I always woke up around 3am every night...

416
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,471
because of some stomach issues.

417
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,810
But today,

418
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,681
I was rolling on the floor. Gosh, I feel like I almost died.

419
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,420
Should I get you some medicine?

420
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,250
It's fine. I'm sure it'll get better with time.

421
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,920
What's this about the culprit being caught?

422
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,391
Watch the news, will you?

423
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,491
They say Detective Ryu Sung Jun has been caught.

424
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:13,560
I'm only saying this now,

425
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:15,801
but I met the culprit when he was young.

426
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,940
Who knew that it would turn out to be Ryu Sung Jun?

427
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,610
Why?

428
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:35,790
Gosh, why are you all looking at me like that?

429
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,060
You fool.

430
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,931
You're the one who doesn't watch the news, not me.

431
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:43,060
My gosh.

432
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,460
Here.

433
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:52,801
("Joker Murder Investigation Back to Square One")

434
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,011
(The Rooftop Hero has been cleared of all charges.)

435
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:58,110
So the killer...

436
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:01,250
They still haven't caught the killer?

437
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:03,880
Goodness.

438
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,081
Judge Ryu.

439
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,551
What are you doing out here?

440
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,821
I came here to offer my condolences. I was just about to leave.

441
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,650
Bye.

442
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,650
I'm sorry about the other day.

443
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,531
I got the wrong idea.

444
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,761
I have a short fuse.

445
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,230
- I'm sorry. - You don't need to apologize.

446
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,641
It was my fault that you got the wrong idea.

447
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:02,210
Eun Ki, you're here.

448
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,479
I'm late, aren't I? Is everyone here?

449
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,110
Yes, they're at the cafeteria.

450
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,081
You know Judge Ryu, right?

451
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:11,551
Of course, I do.

Right, hello.

454
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:19,920
In Seong, what happened to your lips?

455
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,431
Oh, this?

456
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,701
It's cracked, probably because I'm tired.

- I'll get going, then. - Okay.

Okay, I'll contact her and meet her in person.

Mr. Baek and Detective Kang never called each other.

00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:53,499
Does it mean Detective Kang wasn't the one who leaked my info?

Hello?

00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,549
(In Seong's Place)

476
00:50:30,399 --> 00:50:31,540
Don't mind us.

477
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,030
When Chief Yeom and Chang Wook suspected you,

478
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:08,540
I should've put my foot down and stopped them.

479
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,609
I'm sorry, Sung Jun.

480
00:51:18,149 --> 00:51:20,049
Just blame my incompetence.

481
00:51:22,419 --> 00:51:23,990
Both you and Chang Wook...

482
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,689
Chang Wook, that fool...

483
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:41,569
Captain.

484
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,609
- What do you know about Chief Yeom? - Chief Yeom?

485
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,249
All he cares about is moving up the ranks.

486
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:52,819
Don't even get me started.

487
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,149
His palm lines are gone from all the fawning and begging.

488
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,359
So he struggled to get to where he is now.

489
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,959
Is that why he has a lot to hide?

490
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,269
What do you mean?

491
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,240
The person Mr. Baek has been talking to most frequently these days...

492
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,379
is Chief Yeom.

493
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:24,149
They spoke very often on the phone. They can't just be acquaintances.

494
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,819
They must be really close.

495
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,490
What is it...

496
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,089
that Chief Yeom is hiding?

497
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,040
Hey!

498
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,478
Where is Chief Yeom? Tell him to come out!

499
00:52:55,479 --> 00:52:57,409
- Captain, please. - Darn it!

500
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,850
Hey, Chief Yeom! Darn you...

501
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,249
Hey, where is Chief Yeom?

502
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:05,560
Where is he? Gosh.

503
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,018
What's with Captain Oh?

504
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:09,529
He said he had to speak with you in person, sir.

505
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,759
- Is that Chief Yeom? - Yes.

506
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,899
Oh!

507
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,100
Chief... Chief, my foot.

508
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,899
If you're a chief,

509
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:21,208
I am the president of this country, you jerk!

510
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:22,640
Have you completely lost your mind?

511
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,479
On top of drinking while on duty,

512
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,640
you dare to yell at your boss in a drunken frenzy!

513
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,510
Captain Oh!

514
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,350
I'm giving you a zero on your performance review!

515
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,490
Hey.

516
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:39,060
I don't care whether I get a zero or below zero.

517
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:43,629
I'm embarrassed that a jerk like you is evaluating me.

518
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,259
I don't want it!

519
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,970
- You little... How dare you! - Hey!

520
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:52,470
- Stop. Hey! - How could you...

521
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,338
- How could you do such a thing? - Hey, get him off me!

522
00:53:55,339 --> 00:53:57,568
- Why do you even live? - Hey!

523
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:58,809
- Captain, that's enough. - You punk!

524
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:01,849
- You're despicable! - Goodness.

525
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,048
How...

526
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:06,620
You call yourself a chief?

527
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:09,319
- Gosh. - How...

528
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:12,919
How could you...

529
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,359
That idiot.

530
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,540
(Recents)

531
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,809
(Mr. Baek, Min Ho, Mr. Baek)

532
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,779
(Min Ho's babysitter, Detective Kang Chang Wook, Mr. Baek)

533
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,010
Mr. Baek...

534
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,580
(Messages)

535
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,849
(Detective Kang Chang Wook: Yes, sir.)

536
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,789
(My daughter Hye Jin, Video)

537
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,818
(April 19)

538
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:48,930
April 19?

539
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:52,930
But Yeom Hye Jin died on April 15.

540
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:55,700
Open it.

541
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:57,330
(My daughter Hye Jin, Video)

542
00:54:57,999 --> 00:54:59,040
What is this?

543
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:05,839
Why are you doing this to me?

544
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,580
Why am I doing this?

545
00:55:09,209 --> 00:55:11,850
Ask your father, Chief Yeom Ki Nam.

546
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:19,019
I don't know what my father did to you,

547
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,959
but I apologize on his behalf.

548
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:24,560
Please forgive him.

549
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,760
My son is waiting for me at home.

550
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:30,669
Please don't kill me.

551
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,240
Chief Yeom Ki Nam, are you watching this?

552
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:42,479
Your daughter is begging me not to kill her.

553
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,149
Chief Yeom.

554
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:50,189
Open your eyes wide and watch.

555
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:56,890
Your poor daughter has to die because of you.

556
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:44,088
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

557
00:58:44,089 --> 00:58:45,429
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

558
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,699
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

559
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,999
(but with doubles and dummies.)

560
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:11,490
(Blind)

561
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:14,490
If they're all connected to Hope Welfare Center,

562
00:59:15,129 --> 00:59:16,290
the killer's next target will be...

563
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:22,569
You said your name was Jung Yoon Jae before you were adopted.

564
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,769
I think that memory is false.

565
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,140
If it's not Jung Yoon Jae, who could it be?

566
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:29,970
Someone who resents you enough...

567
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,978
to want to kill your daughter.

568
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:34,310
The suspect in Kang Ha Na's murder?

569
00:59:34,879 --> 00:59:37,148
So far, all the victims were their family members.

570
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:38,819
- My daughter, Eun Ki... - Eun Ki!

571
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:41,019
Sung Hoon. Who are you, really?
