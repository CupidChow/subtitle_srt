1
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,247
Sung Hoon...

2
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,148
was Number 11?

3
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,866
(Calls, My Brother)

4
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:04,938
(My Brother)

5
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,136
The person you have called can't come to the phone right now.

6
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,077
Please leave a message after the beep.

7
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:18,986
Hey, Seok Gu.

8
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:22,087
Can you track my brother's current location?

9
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,587
Yes, right now.

10
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:57,387
(Episode 11: The Ultimate Suspicion)

11
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:01,627
The controversial appointment...

12
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:04,067
of the Minister of Health and Welfare has finally ended.

13
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:07,267
Candidate Na Guk Hee, who received criticism because of her son,

14
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,937
has become the new Minister of Health and Welfare.

15
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,676
Newly appointed Minister Na started as a civil servant...

16
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:14,777
worked at the Ministry of Health and Welfare...

17
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,377
to become an expert in welfare administration.

18
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:19,647
She constructed welfare systems to help the socially weak...

19
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:41,097
What kind of nonsense is that?

20
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:44,008
What do you mean by adoption?

21
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:47,777
I don't know what you heard from where, but it's not true.

22
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,077
You and your brother...

23
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:52,517
are both my biological sons whom I gave birth to.

24
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,498
This photo is of Sung Hoon in front of the orphanage he lived in.

25
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:17,238
Are you still going to deny it?

26
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,207
Where...

27
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:23,407
did you get this?

28
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,448
Why are you lying to me?

29
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:29,548
Is there a reason why you must hide that Sung Hoon was adopted?

30
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,087
Well...

31
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:35,428
That's because...

32
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,087
Mom!

33
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:40,597
It was all for your brother's sake.

34
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:49,108
Even if the world has changed,

35
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:53,238
if people hear that he was adopted, people will become prejudiced.

36
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:54,738
That's still how it is here.

37
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:59,618
Your mom and I didn't want people to see Sung Hoon like that.

38
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:01,378
We wanted to raise him well.

39
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,988
There's nothing more to it.

40
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,318
How did you find out about Hope Welfare Center?

41
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:12,257
I don't know. How did we find out about it?

42
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:13,657
Well...

43
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:17,298
We found out about it purely by chance.

44
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,396
The director got arrested,

45
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:23,537
so they didn't have anyone to run it any longer.

46
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:27,508
We heard there were older kids there that had nowhere to go.

47
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:29,447
To be honest,

48
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:33,317
I was hesitant because Sung Hoon was an older kid.

49
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:34,378
But...

50
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,147
But, Sung Jun...

51
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:40,657
Do you know...

52
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:45,198
why I decided to adopt your brother?

53
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:48,897
It was because of you.

54
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,136
I felt bad for you because you were always alone.

55
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,037
So you wouldn't have to be lonely.

56
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:01,948
Sung Jun.

57
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,048
This may come as a big shock to you.

58
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,488
But just forget about all of it, okay?

59
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:13,587
At this point, what does it matter that Sung Hoon is adopted?

60
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,227
For 20 years, we've been a family.

61
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:19,027
And we will continue being a family in the future.

62
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:21,597
Just forget about it?

63
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:24,868
What does it matter? We're a family?

64
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,267
For the past 20 years, I...

65
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:35,808
For the past 20 years? What?

66
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:40,048
I thought...

67
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,548
you two weren't my biological parents.

68
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,858
I thought I was the one who was adopted!

69
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:51,156
What do you mean?

70
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:52,797
Why would you think such a thing?

71
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,298
I know, right? I also wonder...

72
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,668
why I came to think that way.

73
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,068
I don't know who I am.

74
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:39,937
My goodness.

75
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,948
About the adoption... Sung Jun doesn't know yet, right?

76
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,777
- My goodness. - It's so funny.

77
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:49,346
- Right, honey? - Gosh, cut it out.

78
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,347
Sung Jun.

79
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:53,257
Just don't do anything and sit still, okay?

80
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,327
That's how you can help your mom.

81
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,528
Because you always cause trouble.

82
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,797
How long must we be worried about you?

83
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,768
If Sung Hoon said you did good, that means you did.

84
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:04,097
Right?

85
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,408
Aren't you embarrassed about making Mom and Dad worry...

86
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:11,038
at your age?

87
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:13,308
Behave yourself.

88
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:34,726
Hey, Seok Gu.

89
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,326
Judge Ryu's phone is turned off,

90
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,466
so we can't trace it.

91
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,298
But we did confirm the last location it was used in.

92
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:40,996
Where is the last location?

93
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,467
It's the Children's Center.

94
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,138
And Sung Jun.

95
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:47,778
We found traces of blood in the yard of the Children's Center.

96
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,977
- Traces of blood? - Yes.

97
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:51,408
Let me talk to him.

98
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:54,217
Hold on. I'll put Captain on the line.

99
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:55,847
Thanks.

100
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,388
Hey, Sung Jun.

101
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,757
There's not a lot of blood. It's only a little.

102
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,658
It's near the front doors.

103
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,596
There's a security camera near the entrance,

104
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:06,957
but someone has damaged it on purpose.

105
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:12,298
I think the culprit targeted Eun Ki from the beginning and broke in.

106
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,437
The streets that lead from the main road to the center...

107
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:21,577
are here and here.

108
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:22,707
They're the only two.

109
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:26,977
There was only one car that came out of this street around 9pm.

110
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,018
Should I look into the car?

111
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,587
No, I know whose car this is.

112
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,956
Please track the direction this car went in.

113
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:37,028
Oh, okay.

114
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:03,318
I can't track it any further.

115
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:05,987
It seems the car entered an area that doesn't have security cameras.

116
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:10,327
That's the last location where the suspected car was caught on camera.

117
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:15,528
Where's Eun Ki?

118
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,558
Where is Eun Ki?

119
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:21,497
Why?

120
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:23,568
Do you think I might've abducted her...

121
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:26,068
and buried her in the ground?

122
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,857
I found it dead on the road.

123
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,558
I couldn't just pass by it.

124
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:55,997
Detective Ryu.

125
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,188
Yes, Captain.

126
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,987
I found Jo Eun Ki.

127
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,257
Yes, I'll tell you the details later.

128
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,668
- What happened? - Well, the thing is...

129
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,216
If something like that happened,

130
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:27,517
you should've called me or gone to the police.

131
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,058
I told her not to tell you.

132
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,327
I can't trust the police.

133
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:32,928
What?

134
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,236
And what about you? Why did you go to the center?

135
00:14:39,237 --> 00:14:40,637
I had something to discuss with Eun Ki.

136
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:41,798
About what?

137
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,407
Why?

138
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,178
Is it a secret I'm not supposed to know?

139
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,107
Who on earth are you?

140
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,318
Why do you have so many secrets?

141
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,778
So what is it you want to say?

142
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,117
Hope Welfare Center.

143
00:14:58,587 --> 00:14:59,658
Number 11.

144
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,587
That's you.

145
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:22,507
Why did you hide it?

146
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,778
I asked why you hid it!

147
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,028
Why did I hide it?

148
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:38,428
What would happen if I revealed that I was Number 11?

149
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:41,227
It's obvious everyone will suspect me.

150
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,997
If you had been me, would you have been able to say it?

151
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,236
Can you really not trust me?

152
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,068
Even you are suspicious that I might be the culprit.

153
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,077
Fine. I'm Number 11.

154
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,486
If I could erase it, I'd erase all of it.

155
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:03,948
That's how terrible those memories are.

156
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,818
Sure, Hope Welfare Center.

157
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,688
I was there.

158
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,227
But...

159
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:16,668
I'm not the culprit. Whether you believe it or not,

160
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,737
that choice is up to you.

161
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,077
(Caller ID Restricted)

162
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:34,477
(It's because of you.)

163
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,717
(Caller ID Restricted, May 22, 12:44am)

164
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:44,727
Kwon Yu Na.

165
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:46,957
She's in danger.

166
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,897
- What about her? - Where did you last see her?

167
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:51,997
She was at the center. We talked and she left...

168
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:01,178
Darn it.

169
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,427
Keep calling Yu Na.

170
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,227
- I'll go that way. - Okay.

171
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,517
Yu Na!

172
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,517
Eun Ki.

173
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,317
Yu Na!

174
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:47,408
No.

175
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:35,985
(Muyeong Police Station)

176
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:46,396
Why did the culprit send you that text?

177
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:51,136
He must've been angry.

178
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,906
I'd thwarted him.

179
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,236
Why did you go to the center?

180
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,876
I was going to apply to be Kwon Yu Na's patron.

181
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:08,216
Eun Ki would know better than anyone what kind of help Yu Na needed.

182
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,656
So you went to the center...

183
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:14,355
and happened to see the culprit?

184
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,426
Did you see their face?

185
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:20,866
- No. - You can't even guess who it was?

186
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:22,835
Not at all.

187
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,255
When did you find out Yoon Jae was dead?

188
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,716
Shortly after I was adopted.

189
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:49,495
You went to Hope Welfare Center with Yoon Jae's older sister.

190
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:54,265
Where is she now?

191
00:21:58,535 --> 00:21:59,535
I don't know.

192
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,976
We parted as soon as we reached the welfare center,

193
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:05,045
and I never heard from her since.

194
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:12,646
What about Number 12?

195
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:15,916
Do you know anything about him?

196
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:20,956
No.

197
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,065
In that place,

198
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:26,765
we were forbidden to talk about ourselves.

(Learn and Enlighten Yourself to Serve Your True Purpose)

200
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,535
The place was a huge prison.

201
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,976
We were small, powerless prisoners serving a life sentence.

202
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:40,244
Every day, morning to night,

203
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:42,916
we were put to work at an incineration plant.

204
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:47,616
Whether you were young or sick, there was no exception.

205
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:52,895
All we got to eat was doenjang broth with rotten vegetables...

206
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,255
and a ball of rice.

207
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:57,126
We were always hungry.

208
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,794
Kids who died of an illness or a beating...

209
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,206

The unlucky ones...

213
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:13,175
got donated to the university to be dissected, we were told.

214
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:14,646
(Thank you for giving way.)

215
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,015
Why was I stupid enough...

216
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,486
to put up with it?

217
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:22,926
Of course,

218
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,456
we tried to escape.

219
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:29,525
We failed each time.

220
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:34,696
The last time we tried, An Tae Ho betrayed us, as you know.

221
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,505
I totally get why he did.

222
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,545
He was beaten the most out of us all.

223
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:49,815
They knew very well what the most efficient way...

224
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:52,245
to tame us was.

225
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:06,436
But the real reason we had no choice but to live like that...

226
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:10,736
wasn't the physical violence.

227
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,736
What was the real reason, then?

228
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:19,275
At first, I thought we were being treated that way...

229
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:22,146
because of a few evil people.

230
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:27,355
I was wrong.

231
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:31,386
Other people thought exactly the same.

232
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,696
That's when I realized...

233
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:38,065
we were just...

234
00:24:42,136 --> 00:24:43,335
a pack of dogs...

235
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:47,176
they didn't know what to do with.

236
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:55,245
People didn't care how bad the situation was in there.

237
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:57,416
They didn't care...

238
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,755
who was in there and whether they ended up...

239
00:25:01,956 --> 00:25:03,426
getting killed illegally.

240
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:16,765
The despair that I was completely cut off from the world...

241
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:23,176
made me accept that inhumane treatment as if it were fate.

242

I'm not Ryu Sung Hoon, the human being.

I'm Boy Number 11.

244
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:38,055
Like that.

245
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:43,926
Who is that?

Hello, sir.

247

Who's that man sitting in front of Ryu Sung Jun?

248
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,035
It's Judge Ryu Sung Hoon.

249
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:56,745
- Sung Jun's older brother. - Ryu Sung Jun's brother?

Yes, sir.

00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:51,396
I just found out.

258
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:54,436
The boy that couple adopted wasn't Ryu Sung Jun.

259
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:56,396
It was his brother.

260
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,406
I was fooled by the necklace.

261
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:01,075
He admitted to it himself,

262
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,146
so I'm sure of it.

263
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:05,845
So?

264
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,545

You don't know?

266
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:13,656
We need to get rid of him before he says anything more.

267

If you're afraid of your past coming out,

268
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:21,196
you should take care of him yourself.

I don't what that sneaky punk, Detective Kang said,

I got a call from the police earlier today...

and went to the morgue.

316

They say if you're born unlucky,

At times like this,

320
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:55,035
shouldn't the country do something for the bereaved?

For emotional compensation.

322
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:00,716
They give you all sorts of support funds,

323
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:03,116
so why don't they have compensation for those who were murdered?

324
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:05,545
No.

She had no connections to me in her life,

337
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:17,045
but I...

338
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:22,875
wanted to act like a good adult, so I kept her close.

339
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:32,986
If...

340
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,596
If I could go back in time,

341
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:44,636
I wouldn't have acted like I knew her.

342
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:59,116
Yu Na really liked you.

343
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,155
She said you were the first person...

344
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:05,685
who helped her unconditionally.

345
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:09,826
She said...

346
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:15,065
she wanted to become...

347
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,736
a good person like you.

348
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,875
Whenever I was with Yu Na...

349
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:26,475
I felt at ease somehow.

350
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:37,225
Maybe, it was like I knew the pain she was going through.

351
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:40,895
And I felt bad for her too.

352
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:46,696
I also wanted to help her.

353
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:53,705
But I couldn't do anything for her in the end.

354
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:05,645
I'm back.

355
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,295
Eun Ki, why are you...

356
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,496
I told her she could stay here for the time being.

357
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:22,736
I thought it would be hard for her to stay at the center right now.

358
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,274
I'll only stay for tonight.

359
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:30,545
No, stay here until the culprit is caught.

360
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:33,775
You can use my room.

361
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,715
No, I can just sleep on the sofa.

362
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:37,716
No.

363
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:39,545
Use my room.

364
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:41,386
Go ahead.

365
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:51,165
Gosh, this is...

366
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,266
My room is usually clean.

367
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:58,466
I've been so busy lately. I'm usually very tidy.

368
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,334
You don't have to clean.

369
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:02,935
No, I'll be done quickly.

370
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:07,616
- The blanket is clean. - Okay.

371
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:12,716
Get some rest.

372
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,196
Eun Ki, so...

373
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:34,005
When I'm not around, keep the door locked.

374
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:35,605
And...

375
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:41,016
From now on, a security detail will follow you whenever you go out.

376
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,175
Is that necessary?

377
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:46,185
It wasn't a coincidence that the culprit targeted you.

378
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:49,616
All the jurors, including you,

379
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,225
were related to Hope Welfare Center.

380
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:57,525
In other words, you are also a target of the culprit's revenge.

381
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,076
What are you doing?

382
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:16,645
Darn it. Officer Lee!

383
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:21,556
Hurry up.

384
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,325
Come here.

385
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,685
Mr. Baek, calm down. Come here.

386
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,696
Sir, calm down. Let's sit down and talk.

387
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,236
Apparently, he went totally insane.

388
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:44,076
If that's true, what will happen to Baek Moon Kang now?

389
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:46,176
I guess they'll send him to a mental institution, at least.

390
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:50,076
If he ends up committing suicide, they'll all be questioned.

391
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:51,685
Would the chief let that happen?

392
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:54,486
Are all the jurors under protective watch?

393
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:55,755
Oh, right.

394
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,754
I assigned a security detail to Eun Ki.

395
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,754
And I gave the rest of the jurors a smartwatch.

396
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,395
- And Producer Bae? - We checked if he left the country.

397
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:04,926
It looks like he didn't.

398
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:06,795
And his phone hasn't been used.

399
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:09,335
There's no credit card usage.

400
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:14,176
This means there are no signs of life.

401
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:16,505
This is just my own theory,

402
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:18,375
but what if the culprit already got to him?

403
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:20,676
That can't be.

404
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:23,346
Recently, the culprit hasn't been hiding his crimes at all.

405
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:27,185
If Producer Bae had been killed, we would've found the body.

406
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:31,286
If he's still alive, then did he get abducted?

407
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:33,525
Let's declare Producer Bae missing.

408

There was a nurse at Hope Welfare Center.

- That nurse is your mother. - Goodness.

couldn't help it.

I wanted to help those kids too, but...

You wanted to help,

but why couldn't you?

There is no way that you would ignore it...

430
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:09,915
when kids were being abused and killed in a place like that.

431
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:15,616
I've always been grateful and proud that you were my mom.

432
00:42:20,656 --> 00:42:21,855
But not anymore.

433

It's not too late, Mom.

434
00:42:29,435 --> 00:42:31,165
You reveal it to the world yourself.

435

It was painful for me too.

00:42:51,855 --> 00:42:54,596
So I called the TV station.

440
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:57,766
That producer came to the welfare center...

441
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,196
and secretly filmed it.

442
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:02,966
He said he would reveal everything on TV.

00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:35,735
The last one isn't any different.

501
00:48:35,736 --> 00:48:37,065
I just do what I always do.

502
00:48:37,536 --> 00:48:40,835
But knowing that you were watching me in the audience...

503
00:48:41,806 --> 00:48:42,975
made me a little nervous.

504
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,145
How do you feel to be leaving the court?

505
00:48:49,446 --> 00:48:52,286
Well, it's bittersweet.

506
00:48:54,585 --> 00:48:56,556
Do you have regrets...

507
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:59,025
about any of the rulings you've made over the years?

508
00:48:59,986 --> 00:49:01,025
Regrets?

509
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,795
Yes, of course. I'm human too, after all.

510
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:10,295
I just...

511
00:49:10,996 --> 00:49:14,406
did my best not to repeat the same mistake.

512
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:20,275
What's wrong?

513
00:49:20,946 --> 00:49:22,475
Is something bothering you?

514
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,085
No.

515
00:49:25,446 --> 00:49:27,346
This is boring. Come on, let's go.

516
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:29,185
You're free this evening, right?

517
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:33,426
Let's grab a drink together. It's been too long.

518
00:49:34,355 --> 00:49:37,025
I've got plans. I'm sorry.

519
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:38,866
Oh, really?

520
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:41,736
Well, don't worry about it then.

521
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:49,205
(Court)

522
00:49:59,906 --> 00:50:01,775
Eun Ki, why are you looking for Bae Chul Ho?

523
00:50:01,776 --> 00:50:04,074
He worked on a story on the welfare center.

524
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:05,645
He might still have the footage.

525
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,615
That footage...

526
00:50:07,616 --> 00:50:10,085
will help reveal the truth behind Hope Welfare Center.

527
00:50:10,086 --> 00:50:11,955
(Muyeong Police Station)

528
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:14,156
To tell you the truth,

529
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:16,995
we're looking for him too.

530
00:50:17,325 --> 00:50:18,366
Why?

531
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:21,966
Sung Jun!

532
00:50:22,696 --> 00:50:24,295
We received a tip-off from a witness.

533
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:25,406
He was spotted at the terminal.

534
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:27,836
Let's talk later, Eun Ki.

535
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:29,676
- Let's go. - Okay.

536
00:50:39,185 --> 00:50:40,585
(Missing Person, Bae Chul Ho)

537
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:42,116
It was this man.

538
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:44,216
Over there.

539
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:47,455
I think he put something in one of the lockers and left.

540
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,895
Do you happen to remember the locker number?

541
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:54,096
It was...

542
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:04,336
It was 17. Number 17.

543
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:19,426
Darn it.

544
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:32,405
(Gwangju, Jeonju, Gangneung)

545
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:33,805
We were right.

546
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:37,506
Producer Bae staged his own disappearance.

547
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:39,176
He faked his own disappearance.

548
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:41,145
We were worried for nothing.

549
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,145
(Gwangju, Jeonju, Gangneung)

550
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:46,946
Could we find out when it was picked up from the locker?

551
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:49,285
One moment, please.

552
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:56,695
Here.

553
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,366
It was picked up the next day.

554
00:52:01,736 --> 00:52:02,736
Sung Jun.

555
00:52:02,737 --> 00:52:04,034
That guy with a black hat...

556
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:05,336
Isn't he the suspect in Kang Ha Na's murder?

557
00:52:05,435 --> 00:52:07,006
The one who impersonated Yoon Jae.

558
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:18,446
Sung Jun!

559
00:52:23,915 --> 00:52:25,825
It's your first time here, right?

560
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:27,455
Yes.

561
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:29,096
Are you meeting someone here?

562
00:52:29,656 --> 00:52:30,656
No.

563
00:52:30,657 --> 00:52:32,596
If you want company, just let me know.

564
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:33,426
- When did you get here? - Just now.

565
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:36,196
Where were you?

566
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:39,325
The court. Where else?

567
00:53:42,395 --> 00:53:43,596
Are you looking for something?

568
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:46,966
No.

569
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:54,446
Sung Hoon.

570
00:54:01,216 --> 00:54:02,216
You know,

571
00:54:03,316 --> 00:54:05,325
I have to write a report on Mr. Baek's case.

572
00:54:06,386 --> 00:54:09,256
What day was it when you found the drone?

573
00:54:09,526 --> 00:54:11,696
It was an advertising balloon, not a drone.

574
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:13,926
Really?

575
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:17,696
I guess I was mistaken.

576
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:21,165
So when did you find the advertising balloon?

577
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:23,205
I'm pretty sure I already told Captain Oh...

578
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:25,776
that I found it the day when I dropped off the footage.

579
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,175
Do you remember when he stopped by to pick up the footage?

580
00:54:31,176 --> 00:54:33,546
About 3 to 4 days after we floated the advertising balloon.

581
00:54:34,886 --> 00:54:35,915
I see.

582
00:54:37,855 --> 00:54:38,855
Okay.

583
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:30,975
Darn it.

584
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,816
Sung Hoon!

585
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,386
He just left.

586
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:50,855
What's going on with Producer Bae? Did you find him?

587
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:52,486
I'll fill you in later.

588
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:02,336
Shoot.

589
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:45,136
Sung Hoon!

590
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:51,105
Sung Hoon.

591
00:58:53,145 --> 00:58:54,145
Sung Hoon!

592
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:57,176
Darn it.

593
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:02,015
Hey, stay with me. Sung Hoon!

594
00:59:08,696 --> 00:59:09,954
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

595
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:11,354
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

596
00:59:11,355 --> 00:59:12,624
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

597
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:13,895
(but with doubles and dummies.)

598
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:36,756
(Blind)

599
00:59:36,986 --> 00:59:38,986
I think I've figured out who the killer is.

600
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:40,825
Who is it?

601
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:43,494
It was a sashimi knife.

602
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:44,926
He's hiding something.

603
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:50,336
You bought me vanilla ice cream, my favorite.

604
00:59:50,736 --> 00:59:51,966
What are you doing?

605
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:56,906
Impersonating Jung Yoon Jae...

606
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,506
Where is your brother?

607
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:02,145
What if Yu Na's dying message wasn't a name?

608
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:03,776
Jung Yoon Jae?
