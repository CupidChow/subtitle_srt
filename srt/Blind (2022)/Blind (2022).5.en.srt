11

22

27

How dare you disobey an order from your drill sergeant?

28

32
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:04,397
I know.

33
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,266
But this punk isn't cleaning properly.

34
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,296
I don't like it.

35
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:14,636
Hurry up and clean!

36
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,356
It was about three years ago on a routine inspection day.

37
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:35,527
One of the kids gave a note to a guest that came.

38
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:37,497
"Help me."

39
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:40,666
"I'm locked up in here."

40
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,266
What do you think that guest did?

41
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:49,136
He came to me with that kid's note.

42
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:54,777
That kid was 13 years old at the time, I think.

43
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:56,717
How unfortunate.

44
00:03:57,777 --> 00:03:59,847
If he hadn't done something so foolish,

45
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:03,617
he wouldn't have been beaten to death at the age of 13.

46
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,196
Let's not do anything stupid.

47

Unless you want to end up dead like that kid.

48
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,316
Give me my necklace back.

49
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,327
- Yoon Jae. - My sister...

50
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,926
gave me that necklace.

51
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:44,767
Give it back.

52
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,967
Number 13. Do you want to go to the storage room?

53
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,777
Give it back! Give my necklace back!

54
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:58,976
Stop it, you punk!

55
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,816
I'm sorry. This will never happen again.

56
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:05,387
I'm sorry.

57

Yoon Jae. That hurt, didn't it?

58
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,666
I'm so sorry.

59

- Why did you do that to me? - What?

60
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:33,507
You should've gone after Crazy Dog and gotten the necklace back.

61
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:34,976
Why did you hit me?

62
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,517
Because I had to protect you.

63
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,957
I promised Yoon Jung that I'd protect you.

64

No matter what happens,

65

00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:23,627
Nothing yet.

No.

No way. It mustn't be true.

Let's give it time. The truth will come out.

182
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,857
I'm worried about Sung Hoon.

183

to cover up your brother's crime.

191

Some people even sued you for dereliction of duty.

192

How about you take a break until things die down?

193
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,487
You lost him? Are you that useless?

194
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,096
I practically handed him over to you,

195
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,296
and you couldn't get rid of him?

196
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,697
You always get sloppy toward the end.

197
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,237
You pathetic fool.

198
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:46,376
He's smart, so he won't show himself.

199
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:48,046
He won't last long on his own.

200
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:51,046
He'll go to someone for help.

201
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:55,086
Who do you know that he can call for help?

202
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,586
If I tell you, will you abduct that person too...

203
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:58,727
and torture them?

211

You're all here?

Sure thing.

You came all this way on a weekend? I'm honored.

235
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:53,356
I think I heard one of your regulars is a detective.

236
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,457
Have you heard anything about Detective Ryu?

237
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:58,056
Yes, I'd been wanting to know. How are things looking?

238
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:00,626
- Was he arrested? - No, he's still at large.

239
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:04,167
Everyone's on standby and detectives haven't been home in days.

240
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:06,336
But they found no trace of him yet.

241
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:10,177
Do you think they're pretending they didn't catch him...

242
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:12,546
while in reality they're hiding him?

243
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,207
The detectives are already suspecting each other,

244
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,947
and they're all quite hostile.

245
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:23,316
Eun Ki, you don't think he's a murderer, do you?

246
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,556
- What? - I don't either.

247
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,957
How likely is a guy who risked his life...

248
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:30,296
to save a hostage a serial killer?

249
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:33,427
I wouldn't be so sure. No job is as ideal...

250
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:36,197
as being a cop to hide their serial killer identity.

251
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:38,967
Dogs.

252
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:44,076
That detective was afraid of dogs.

253
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:46,876
That's so random. What dog?

254
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:50,217
When I met the detective last time.

255
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:53,046
I saw into his childhood.

256
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:57,417
There was a hound this big and he cowered in fear.

257
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:00,386
He trembled and said, "Go away."

258
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:04,556
Did you see anything other than a dog?

259
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:06,126
Excuse me.

260
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:09,096
We have rules and morals too.

261
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,596
We don't divulge our clients' secrets.

262
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:13,336

00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,336
Rules and morals, my foot.

264
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:18,977

265
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,546

266
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:23,217
No. Aren't we here to discuss your daughter?

267
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:24,616
Well...

268
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:26,717
Let's have a look.

269
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,487
I'll start the brief on Man Chun's family's murder.

(Movements)

272
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,586
At 1:40pm, shortly after Jung fell to his death, Ryu Sung Jun...

273
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,697
left the basement level parking...

274
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:39,427
and headed to the motel where Jung's wife and son were.

275
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:41,626
(Security footage from outside of motel)

276
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:43,336
Ryu Sung Jun was caught on the CCTV cameras...

277
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:44,497
outside of the motel.

278
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:47,237
Ryu Sung Jun went straight into the room...

279
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,876
and murdered Jung Man Chun's wife, Yang Ji Rim,

280
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,576
and his son, Jung Won Woong.

281
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:56,177
These are the crime scene photos from when they were murdered.

282
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,346
Ryu Sung Jun then got into the car and left the motel.

283
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:00,717
(Travel Route)

284
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:03,257
Then he left the car in a tunnel about 10km away and ran.

285
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:06,027
We did an extensive search in the area...

286
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,656
where the car was found,

287
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,556
but we have yet to find any traces of him.

288
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,427
We have had no witness...

289
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:14,427
nor do we have any record of his credit cards being used.

290
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:16,296
Wasn't Jung Man Chun's son seven years old?

291
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:18,596
What's the motive behind killing such a young child?

292
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,537
Everything's still speculation at this point,

293
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:22,007
but the working theory...

294
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,076
is that he's the real culprit behind the Joker Murders.

295
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,677
In court, Jung Man Chun testified...

296
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:30,546
that Baek Ji Eun was murdered by Ryu Sung Jun.

297
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:32,546
If this is true,

298
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:34,846
Ryu Sung Jun framed Jung Man Chun for murder,

299
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:37,116
and when he found out that he witnessed the murder,

300
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,457
he tried to get rid of any future trouble.

301
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:41,826
Are you keeping an eye on everyone...

302
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:44,027
- Ryu Sung Jun would contact? - Yes, sir.

303
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:45,967
The Violent Crimes Team...

304
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,727
is taking shifts watching Ryu Sung Jun's family,

305
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,767
and they've compiled a list of acquaintances to question.

306
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:42,787
- What are you doing? - Oh, my gosh!

307
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:48,356
Are you re-enacting a scene from "Misery?"

308
00:25:48,356 --> 00:25:50,596
Why weren't you breathing? I thought you were dead.

309
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:52,296
Wait. Hold on.

310
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,167
What do you mean by "Misery?"

311
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:02,977
I need to live too. You might really be a murderer.

312
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:13,346
Why would you buy sushi for a potential murderer?

313
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:16,917
Well, I guess you could say it's a type of torture.

314
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:18,687
"Torture?"

315
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:23,997
Tell me what happened.

316
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,727
Is what they're saying on the news true?

317
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:29,336
Did you really kill all those people?

318
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:32,866
Then what's with all your injuries...

319
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:35,066
and who were those people last night?

320
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,507
If you're not honest with me, I won't give you food.

321
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:42,346
Can you untie me first?

322
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:45,876
I'm dying to know what's going on too.

323
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:00,896
Why would you untie me so easily?

324
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:02,737
What if I really was a murderer?

325
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,566
I gave it a lot of thought too.

326
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:06,537
"Should I report you to the police?"

327
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:09,576
"Will you try to go somewhere else once you got better?"

328
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,906
But I decided to trust you.

329
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:14,906
You're not only the person who saved my life,

330
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:16,677
but you're also Judge Ryu Il Ho's son.

331
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,146
You know my father?

332
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:23,187
Of course. The Scolding Judge.

333
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,296
Hey...

334
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:32,296
Can you give me your cellphone? I want to see the news.

335
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:45,707
("Suspect of Jung Man Chun’s Wife and Child's Murder is a Detective")

336
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,076
(Murderer Jang Man Chun's wife and child found dead in a motel.)

337
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:52,177
(The prime suspect of their murder is Detective Ryu Sung Jun.)

338
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:54,747
Won Woong is dead?

339
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,806
You shouldn't sigh in front of food.

340
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:19,106
It takes away luck.

341
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:21,146
I have no luck to begin with.

342
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:26,517
Ma'am. Have you heard from Sung Jun?

343
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,586
- No, right? - If he contacted me,

344
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:33,287
do you think I would tell you guys?

345
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,197
I guess you don't know the law yet.

346
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,596
If you hide a criminal, you'll be punished for harboring a criminal.

347
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:47,366
Do as you please. I'm not afraid of such things.

348
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:51,237
You don't deserve to eat.

349
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,546
(In Seong's Place)

350
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:57,846
Eat.

351
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,187
You won't be able to go on a stakeout if you're hungry.

352
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:06,326
You should be careful too.

353
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,626
I'm sure you want to believe that Ryu Sung Jun's not the culprit,

354
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:11,326
but the identification reports and the autopsy reports...

355
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:14,527
all point to Ryu Sung Jun as the culprit.

356
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:17,636
I get it, so sit down and eat.

357
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:20,967
Eat your food, you punk.

358
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:26,977
- Why are you getting so mad? - What are you talking about?

359
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,646
I'm taking care of my team!

360
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,017
Detective Kang, sit down and eat.

361
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:34,846
Hey. Have these side dishes and eat all of this too.

362
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:36,517
Hey. You can have my soup too.

363
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:38,086
Eat up.

364
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,957
(In Seong's Place)

365
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:51,396
Yes, this is Detective Kim Seok Gu. Who may I ask is calling?

366
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:53,906
- Seok Gu. It's me. - Sung Jun?

367
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,106
Where are you?

368
00:29:58,277 --> 00:29:59,806
Let's talk about that later.

369
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:02,207
Is it true that Jung Man Chun's son was found dead?

370
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:04,677
Yes. He was found dead at the scene.

371
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:10,517
- What's the cause of death? - Sung Jun. You didn't do it. Right?

372
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:12,856
Detective Kang is claiming you killed Jung Man Chun's family...

373
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:15,457
and that you're behind the Joker Murders.

374
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,427
- But that doesn't make any sense. - What's the cause of death?

375
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:22,066
It was asphyxiation by occlusion of the nose and mouth.

376
00:30:24,796 --> 00:30:26,636
Where are you right now? I'll go to you.

377
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,207
It won't be easy since Detective Kang is always close by,

378
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,336
but I'll do everything I can to excuse myself.

379
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,846
So just tell me where you are, and I'll...

380
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:47,687
Who was it?

381
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:51,296
Well...

382
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:54,467
- It was my girlfriend. - The number isn't saved,

383
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:56,667
but it's your girlfriend?

384
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,737
I only asked her out a few days ago.

385
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,207
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,066
(Calling)

387
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:09,247
Seok Gu. We suddenly got disconnected.

388
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,977
I was inside an elevator.

389
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,187
I know you're busy, so get back to work.

390
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,017
Let's talk again later.

391
00:31:25,227 --> 00:31:26,497
Get in line with the right people.

392
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,277
Why aren't you following me?

393
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,376
I'm your superior now.

394
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,106
Stay by my side until we get Ryu Sung Jun.

395
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:43,576
Yes, sir.

396
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,126
You should eat something.

397
00:31:57,527 --> 00:31:59,326
You need to eat well to recover fast.

398
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:15,806
Listen to me as you eat.

399
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:17,576
This place you're in...

400
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:19,987
is the storage room in the backyard of the center I work in.

401
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:22,687
People rarely come back here,

402
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:24,886
so you won't have any issues hiding out here.

403
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,787
But just in case, try to avoid going outside.

404
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,156
Who's at the center right now?

405
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:31,626
It's just me.

406
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:34,467
The employees and kids come during the week at 9am,

407
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:35,896
and they all leave at 6pm.

408
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,096
Do you live here?

409
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,906
Yes. After what happened, I moved out of the rooftop room.

410
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:44,076
I see.

411
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:50,717
I have absolutely no memory of how I got here.

412
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,146
I don't think you want to know how you got here.

413
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,146
I'm sorry.

414
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:58,487
I'll repay you after I clear my name.

415
00:32:58,487 --> 00:32:59,626
"Clear your name?"

416
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,626
So you've been framed?

417
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,796
I feel so much better after hearing you say that.

418
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:09,667
Hold on. Why did you choose me?

419
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:12,636
Am I the only person who can help you regardless?

420
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,537
What do you take me for?

421
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:18,306
Do you think I'm the type to latch onto you...

422
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:20,277
and rely on you while I'm in hiding?

423
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:25,146
It just so happened that I had your business card in my pocket,

424
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:26,787
so I had no choice but to call you.

425
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:28,116
As for other people...

426
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:32,586
I couldn't remember anyone else's numbers.

427
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:35,787
These stupid smartphones are ruining our memory skills.

428
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,167
Then what about you, Eun Ki?

429
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,136
Tell me how many phone numbers you remember.

430
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:44,967
None, right?

431
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:46,707
Fine.

432
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:50,376
I'll be back in the evening. Make sure to eat everything. Okay?

433
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:57,417
Oh, right. Can you take off the clothes you have on right now?

434
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:00,346
I'll have them washed.

435
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:04,017
Well...

436
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:05,787
I won't look.

437
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:26,477
Won Woong was definitely alive when I left the motel.

438
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,107
What happened?

439
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:46,497
You know I'm not supposed to do this, right?

440
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,267
If you don't want to, I'll be off.

441
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:52,037
You're really different from Sung Jun.

442
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:55,207
I meant, I'm not supposed to, but I'll make an exception for you.

443
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,006
(National Institute for Scientific Investigation)

444
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:07,747
(Jung Man Chun Case Autopsy Report)

445
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:12,116
Is there any direct evidence that proves Sung Jun murdered anyone?

446
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:13,727
Yes.

447
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:17,627
His fingerprints were found on the weapon used to kill Jung's wife.

448
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,397
And his hair was found on the clothes of the child,

449
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:21,897
who died of asphyxiation.

450
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:23,337
(Evidence 2, hair)

451
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,596
I don't think a strand of hair can become direct evidence.

452
00:35:25,736 --> 00:35:27,806
Still, it's better than nothing.

453
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:33,176
And we ran a DNA test,

454
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:35,906
but it was no use since the child was wet.

455
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:39,616
Considering how there was water in the boy's duodenum and stomach,

456
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:41,846
he probably tried to drown him but failed...

457
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:43,417
and suffocated him with the pillow instead.

458
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:46,256
When someone is suffocated with a pillow,

459
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:48,627
you can find hints of hypodermal bleeding around the nose and mouth.

460
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,526
(Hypodermal bleeding confirmed around nose and mouth)

461
00:35:55,326 --> 00:35:57,497
By the way, aren't you shocked?

462
00:35:58,437 --> 00:35:59,437
By what?

463
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,767
Sung Jun would never have left this kind of evidence.

464
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:04,676
He's not smart like you,

465
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:07,006
but leaving behind his fingerprints, footprints,

466
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:09,707
and even a strand of hair at the scene?

467
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:11,176
He's not that big an idiot.

468
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:13,446
I wouldn't be surprised if he committed the perfect crime.

469
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:17,656
How does it look for Jung Man Chun's side?

470
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:18,957
Did you get some evidence there?

471
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:21,087
On that side,

472
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:23,957
we found a button with Sung Jun's fingerprint...

473
00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:25,397
near the railing.

474
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:26,457
(Button found near the railing of the rooftop)

475
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,667
Oh, no. This looks like it'll come off.

476
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:37,636
Sung Hoon. Do you have any thread?

477
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:46,573
(Do not cross.)

478
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:05,153
(Under construction)

479
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,103
- Oh, no. - Hey!

480
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:37,373
What happened?

481
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,042
The person I saw back then... Could it be Sung Jun?

482
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:56,563
Go away.

483
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:03,703
Go away.

484
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,442
Go away.

485
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:13,743
Go away...

486
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:17,712
No.

487
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,123
Go away.

488
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:31,732
Hello?

489
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:33,763
Yes, hello.

490
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:37,002
It's been a while since Yu Na came to the center.

491
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,303
Goodness. Is that so?

492
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:18,643
Hey! Are you crazy?

493
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,013
You can't cut in like that!

494
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:22,413
What do you want?

495
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:24,252
What do you want?

496
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,192
Taxi.

497
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:39,362
(Empty)

498
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:44,272
Yu Na!

499
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,172
Darn it. Not again.

500
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:51,013
Yu Na. Talk to me for a bit.

501
00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:52,772
Come on.

502
00:39:54,212 --> 00:39:56,743
What? How rude.

503
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:59,382
Yu Na. I have something to say. It won't take long.

504
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:05,252
Yu Na!

505
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:15,433
Where to?

506
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:16,533
Yu Na!

507
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:19,072
Hey, Kwon Yu Na.

508
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,542
- Yu Na. - Oh, gosh.

509
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,913
Hey, Yu Na! Are you okay? Are you hurt?

510
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:28,482
Get off me! Darn it.

511
00:40:29,612 --> 00:40:32,353
I broke my heel because of you, lady!

512
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:34,123
This is so annoying!

513
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:37,752
Your school called earlier.

514
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,792
You're going to be suspended if you miss your exams again.

515
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,322
Let them do whatever they want!

516
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:44,192
Suspension or expulsion, I'm not afraid of anything.

517
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,033
You don't want to study, right?

518
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:51,502
Is there something you want to do besides studying?

519
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:52,632
If there's anything you want to learn, tell me.

520
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:56,603
I'll look into free courses or academies for you.

521
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:59,373
And next week, I think we'll have a spot open up at the shelter.

522
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,283
You can stay at the shelter and think about what to do...

523
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:02,442
Gosh, darn it!

524
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,953
Butt out, will you?

525
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,623
You must think you're really important or something.

526
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:10,192
You're just a social worker.

527
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:17,433
Kwon Yu Na. Do you know what the really scary thing is?

528
00:41:18,962 --> 00:41:21,433
Expulsion? Sure, that's not scary at all.

529
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:22,703
The really scary thing is when...

530
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:24,973
you find yourself in a position where you're being wronged,

531
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:27,303
and you scream for help at the top of your lungs,

532
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:30,072
but nobody sees you.

533
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:33,413
And nobody is by your side. Do you really want that?

534
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:38,953
Then look me in the eyes and say it.

535
00:41:39,953 --> 00:41:41,322
If you really want,

536
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:44,152
I'll let go...

537
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:47,362
of this hand.

538
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:56,333
Did I ask you to hold my hand?

539
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:25,933
What on earth are these dreams?

540
00:42:29,603 --> 00:42:31,232
They feel like memories from my childhood.

541
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:33,942
Even when you were young,

542
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,772
your eyes were different from the other kids.

543
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:39,212
Mr. Baek spoke as if he knew me since I was young.

544
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:43,382
But why do I have no memory of him?

545
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:45,152
Why did you kill her?

546
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:48,083
Did you get revenge for what I did to you on her?

547
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:50,623
On her 20th birthday?

548
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:52,853
If killing Baek Ji Eun...

549
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:55,522
was a way to get back at Mr. Baek,

550
00:42:57,962 --> 00:42:59,163
then what about Yeom Hye Jin?

551
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,502
You killed my daughter, Chief Yeom's daughter,

552
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,132
and Jung Man Chun and his family.

553
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:06,232
Serial killer Jung Yoon Jae.

554
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:08,743
He said the killer's name was Yoon Jae.

555
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:13,783
Someone killed people in my name?

Who are you?

00:45:46,993 --> 00:45:48,533
Why did you sneak in here?

563
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,373
Are you the driver they sent?

564
00:45:57,243 --> 00:45:59,342
- Do you work here? - I asked you a question first.

565
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:01,743
I'm looking for someone.

566
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,013
Can I take a look inside the storage room?

567
00:46:07,623 --> 00:46:08,982
Why would you look for someone here?

568
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:11,053
This is where we store the donated goods.

569
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:12,853
I'll have to see for myself...

570
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,462
to confirm whether that's true or not, young lady.

571
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,792
Don't move!

572
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,433
Police? I'm calling from Muyeong Community Children's Center.

573
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,942
We have burglars here. One of them is holding a knife.

574
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:30,103
Please hurry.

575
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:39,583
Do you happen to know...

576
00:46:40,752 --> 00:46:42,652
Detective Ryu Sung Jun?

577
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:45,692
Ryu Sung Jun? Who's that?

578
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:34,373
The man who was here just now...

579
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:36,603
is the one I saw in front of the payphone the other day.

580
00:47:36,902 --> 00:47:39,112
Why is he looking for you?

581
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:41,542
That man is Baek Ji Eun's father.

582
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:44,482
I'm sorry I got you into trouble.

583
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:46,353
I'll leave.

584
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:48,422
If I stay here, you'll be put in danger too.

585
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:49,882
You'll leave, then what?

586
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:52,252
- Do you have a plan? - I never have plans.

587
00:47:52,993 --> 00:47:54,822
You need help right now.

588
00:47:54,822 --> 00:47:56,022
You said someone framed you.

589
00:47:56,163 --> 00:47:57,862
You have to catch the killer to clear your name.

590
00:47:57,862 --> 00:48:00,732
And to do that, you'd need a car, money, and information.

591
00:48:01,203 --> 00:48:03,033
I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that.

592
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:05,933
However, I can't let you leave alone in that state.

593
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:15,212
Other than Detective Kim Seok Gu, is there anyone who can help you?

594
00:48:16,813 --> 00:48:17,813
No, no one.

595
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:20,453
What kind of life have you led...

596
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:22,482
that you can't think of a single person who would help you?

597
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,553
Back in school,

598
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:27,493
I was busy beating up those who got on my nerves...

599
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:28,962
that I never had the time to make friends.

600
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:32,493
And I've been busy catching perps ever since I became a cop,

601
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:34,632
so I have more enemies now and no friends.

602
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,303
Then what about your family?

603
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,002
Why won't you tell your family?

604
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:41,842
Because you don't want to worry them?

605
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:44,143
But they're your family. If not them, who would...

606
00:48:44,143 --> 00:48:45,373
I was adopted.

607
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:18,107
Since I was little,

608
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,678
I've always failed to meet my parents' expectations.

609
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,348
But maybe it's only natural.

610
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,288
I don't even know who birthed me...

611
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:30,558
or where I come from.

612
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:35,158
The only thing I was ever good at was beating people up.

613
00:49:37,697 --> 00:49:41,067
It's been a very long time since my parents...

614
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,337
started regretting their decision to adopt me.

615
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:48,337
They regret it? How do you know?

616
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:52,208
When I was young,

617
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:58,288
I happened to overhear them talking about it.

618
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,458
That must've made you very upset.

619
00:50:06,058 --> 00:50:08,558
But if your parents had truly regretted it,

620
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,627
they would've filed for dissolution.

621
00:50:16,237 --> 00:50:18,438
They care too much about how other people would judge them.

622
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,078
Right.

623
00:50:23,507 --> 00:50:25,277
That matters to adults.

624
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:34,417
I rarely talk about this stuff with anyone.

625
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:36,717
You're the first one.

626
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:40,797
I didn't think you'd give up unless I let you in on my secret.

627
00:50:41,627 --> 00:50:44,368
Thanks for letting me be the first one to hear about your secret,

628
00:50:44,368 --> 00:50:45,868
but I still won't give up.

629
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:51,438
- What about your brother? - My brother?

630
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,607
I mean, he's a judge. Won't he help you?

631
00:50:53,607 --> 00:50:58,377
My brother puts the law and his principles above all else.

632
00:50:59,047 --> 00:51:00,447
If he finds out where I'm hiding now,

633
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:02,618
he'll be the first to call the cops on me.

634
00:51:04,987 --> 00:51:07,888
I don't want to get anyone roped into this and put them in a pickle.

635
00:51:10,018 --> 00:51:12,627
I understand that you don't want to get him roped into it, but...

636
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,697
Are you afraid?

637
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:18,397
That he'd actually reject your call for help?

638
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,638
What? Come on.

639
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:27,538
Honestly, you have no idea what my brother is like.

640
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:29,877
Then why don't we try?

641
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,877
You said you weren't afraid.

that's never been broken.

645
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:58,007
Every day, he wakes up at the same time and works out.

He always arrives at work at the same time.

I'm sure he goes for lunch around the same time every day.

658
00:53:10,877 --> 00:53:12,777
I know what you think of me,

659
00:53:12,908 --> 00:53:14,518
but trust me just this once.

660
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,147
I really need your help right now.

661
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:20,987
Meet me there at 7pm today.

662
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:31,627
I'm giving this a shot because you want me to,

663
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,237
but don't get your hopes up. I know I'm right about this.

664
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:38,007
Okay. If he doesn't help you,

665
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,408
don't be disappointed.

666
00:53:40,638 --> 00:53:42,837
(Muyeong Local Court)

667
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,217
My brother got in touch with me.

668
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:07,197
It's me.

669
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:09,598
Ryu Sung Jun showed up.

670
00:54:12,938 --> 00:54:15,708
You'd better not make a mistake this time. Got it?

671
00:54:19,078 --> 00:54:20,078
Oh, no...

672
00:54:34,598 --> 00:54:37,458
(Happy birthday, Ji Eun.)

673
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:59,888
Oh, boy. They sent so many officers.

674
00:55:00,848 --> 00:55:02,987
This is just my guess,

675
00:55:03,587 --> 00:55:07,587
but I don't think he and Sung Jun are real brothers.

676
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:09,697
Not all siblings are close.

677
00:55:09,998 --> 00:55:11,567
Some people feel closer to strangers.

678
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:16,098
Captain, do you think Sung Jun really sent that note?

679
00:55:17,438 --> 00:55:18,438
"Sung Jun?"

680
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,507
Must you call a suspect so fondly?

681
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:26,647
Detective Kim, get your act together.

682
00:55:27,007 --> 00:55:29,047
If you lose Ryu Sung Jun on purpose,

683
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:31,788
I'll get you fired. Do you understand?

684
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:33,087
Yes, sir.

685
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:38,357
All right. Since we're already in this mess,

686
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,688
let's catch him with our own hands.

687
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,498
He may be a murder suspect now, but he was like our family.

688
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:46,998
I can't let the others cuff him.

689
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,138
Do you understand?

690
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:50,438
- Yes, sir. - Oh, boy.

691
00:55:55,737 --> 00:55:58,908
(Electric Supply)

692
00:56:26,737 --> 00:56:27,808
Look.

693
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:34,947
Ryu Sung Jun is here. Stay frosty.

694
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:47,998
Sung Hoon.

695
00:56:56,737 --> 00:56:58,138
It's Ryu Sung Jun. Get him!

696
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:08,717
It wasn't you, was it?

697
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:26,928
Get him!

698
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:34,777
- What's going on? - My gosh!

699
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:36,638
Gosh!

700
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,748
Go!

701
00:57:41,748 --> 00:57:43,678
This way. Go, hurry!

702
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:12,377
Ryu Sung Jun. You have the right to remain silent.

703
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:45,308
(Grilled Fish)

704
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:46,678
Go this way.

705
00:58:48,978 --> 00:58:51,018
(Briquette-grilled Pork Belly, Grilled Fish)

706
00:59:14,408 --> 00:59:17,308
Who are you? What's your problem?

707
00:59:38,998 --> 00:59:40,167
Shoot.

708
00:59:42,237 --> 00:59:43,268
Darn it!

709
01:00:27,078 --> 01:00:28,147
I told you...

710
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:31,147
that my brother would never help me.

711
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,317
I believe you were wrong.

712
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:31,107
Sung Hoon.

713
01:01:42,018 --> 01:01:43,217
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

714
01:01:43,217 --> 01:01:44,587
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

715
01:01:44,587 --> 01:01:45,928
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

716
01:01:45,928 --> 01:01:47,288
(but with doubles and dummies.)

717
01:02:06,947 --> 01:02:10,678
(Blind)

718
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,618
- It's not for your sake. - Jung Man Chun told me.

719
01:02:14,018 --> 01:02:15,857
He said that's where the recording was.

720
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,087
What recording?

721
01:02:19,658 --> 01:02:21,728
Do you not believe your brother?

722
01:02:21,728 --> 01:02:24,257
There's one piece of evidence the police haven't explained yet.

723
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:30,938
He said the killer was in court that day.

724
01:02:30,938 --> 01:02:33,467
The report on the jurors' texts and locations at the time.

725
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:35,837
At her time of death, only Choi Soon Gil was at the park.

726
01:02:35,837 --> 01:02:38,178
- Yu Na! - I found the killer.
