At dawn on the morning of Routine Inspection Day.

12
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,159
Okay.

13
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,869
I'll pretend not to know, so just do what they say.

What are you going to do?

15
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,979
Have you tried hare coursing?

16
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,749
No, sir.

17
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,478
If you want to catch a rabbit,

18
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,148
you have to go from the top of the mountain down.

19
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,848
The thing with rabbits...

20
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,859
is their back legs are longer than their front legs.

21
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,089
So they're really bad at going down things.

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,958
When a rabbit escapes its cage...

23
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,169
and hops its way to the top of the mountain,

24
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:44,139
it'll be happy and relieved that it's safe.

25
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:46,708
Then at that moment...

26
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:50,079
you show up and drive them down.

27
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:55,678
Then the flustered rabbit will flounder about...

28
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:59,549
and get caught in a snare or get eaten by a wolf.

29
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,559
What do you think? Doesn't it sound fun?

30
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:12,368
You'll be okay since you're a good kid.

31
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,469
Are you...

32
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,439
going to let me go?

33
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,739
Of course I will.

34
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,878
Okay. You can go now.

35
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:29,418
Before the other kids get suspicious.

When I saw our detectives all over that place earlier,

Why did you meet Jung Man Chun?

That jerk called me to the rooftop, saying he had something to tell me.

And what did you talk about?

87

He said that Baek Ji Eun's murderer...

paid him to pretend to be the perp.

89

Does that make any sense?

90
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,749
So I thought he was messing with me,

91
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,149
and I almost smacked him on the head.

He did what he did because of the money,

95

but he was afraid that the real culprit might kill his son.

102
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,578
So, did you find it?

No.

- Then why did you run? - I didn't run.

126
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,458

127

00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,519
You're headed to the courthouse, right? I'll give you a ride.

148
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,149
I'd like the know the reason.

149
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,659
Why would you take on such a risk to help Sung Jun?

150
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,058
I was trying to repay his kindness and ended up like this.

151
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,458
And if Sung Jun gets arrested,

152
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,198
you might face legal consequences too.

153
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,629
I know that much too.

154
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:29,099

00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,519
Do you think I don't know what goes on outside since I'm stuck in here?

171
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:21,249
Do you think I don't know...

172
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:22,659
that you dropped the cell phone on purpose...

173
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,119
to ruin the arrest?

174
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:28,129
You. Turn in your ID.

175
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,159
Get lost.

176
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,729
A guy like you who only protects his own...

177
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,729
doesn't deserve to serve the people!

178
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,568
- Got anything? - Hello? Hey.

179
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:41,409
Gosh, this is torture.

180
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,078
No, I'm still waiting.

181
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,639
Did you hear anything?

182
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,279
What?

183
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,818
If you heard from Sung Jun,

184
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:51,479
you should've let us know first.

185
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,989
Why did you let the police know...

186
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,019
and make things even more complicated?

187
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:56,318
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:00,788
Sung Hoon must've thought he was doing what was best for Sung Jun.

189
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:03,328
If he cares so much about Sung Jun,

190
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,399
how does he not know what his brother is up to?

191
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:11,538
Gosh, I'm sorry.

192
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,369
You must be in a tough spot because of Sung Jun too.

193
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:16,208
I've been on edge.

194
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,409
Don't say that.

195
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,448
Like you said,

196
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,818
I didn't pay close enough attention to Sung Jun.

197
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,149
Since then, have you not heard from Sung Jun again?

198
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:28,889
No.

199
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,058
- Gosh. - My goodness.

200
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:35,759
- Here she comes! - She's here!

201
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,159
- Here she is! - She just stepped outside.

202
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,769
Ms. Na, have you gotten in touch with your son?

203
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,668
Is your son a serial killer?

204
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,139
Do you have any intention of stepping down?

205
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,538
- Please give us a statement. - Please answer the question.

206
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,609
Perhaps, if you're thinking of giving up your nomination,

207
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,879
don't do it, Mother.

208
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:55,519
Sung Jun isn't the culprit, right?

209
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,718
I can't say for sure at the moment,

210
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,889
but I will take care of the matter with Sung Jun.

211
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,288
So please continue on your own path, Mother.

212
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:06,288
Just like you have until now.

213
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:10,099
- Please say something. - Over here!

214
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:15,798
My son risked his own life...

215
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,839
in the recent hostage situation to save a woman's life.

216
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,968
He is a righteous police officer.

217
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,508
I don't know why he was framed for murder,

218
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:27,379
but I believe and trust my son.

219
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,918
The truth will come out when he returns.

220
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,319
Please bear with us.

221
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:36,089
Will you not step down from your minister candidacy?

222
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,789
Why should I resign when I'm ashamed of nothing?

223
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,329
No.

224
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:48,799
Hey.

225
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,609
Help me.

226
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:02,649
Brother.

227
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,718
Help me.

228
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,488
Please.

229
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,028
Hey.

230
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,688
Brother.

231
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,208
- What are you doing? - Standing by.

232
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:33,708
If you're awake, sit up so I can clean your wound.

233
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,518
No, wait.

234
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,859
Do you have a doctor or nurse license?

235
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,889
My mom's a nurse.

236
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,069
You must've had a dream. It didn't sound like a romance.

237
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:58,238
It was horror.

238
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,839
I'm a kid being chased by a monster.

239
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:03,708
However hard I try to get away, I just can't.

240
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,248
I always get caught in the end,

241
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,809
and wake right before I'm eaten.

242
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:08,819
I see.

243
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,948
Not bad for a horror flick.

244
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:17,119
At least you're with your brother.

245
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,399
How do you know I was with my brother?

246
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,998
You kept calling for him.

247
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,738
Did I say anything else?

248
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,468
No.

249
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,238
You just called for your brother.

250
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:38,909
How much taller will you get...

251
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,748
if you're having scary dreams at your age?

252
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,248
Do you feel very anxious?

253
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:47,889
I don't feel anxious at all.

254
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,829
I have a completely safe hideout...

255
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:55,258
and a dedicated caregiver.

256
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,198
I'm not anxious at all.

257
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,839
I'll wash your bloody clothes. Change into this.

258
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:07,768
Did you buy clothes for me?

259
00:20:10,238 --> 00:20:11,708
You can't.

260
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,008
If the cops run your credit card transactions and see...

261
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:17,849
you bought men's clothing, they'll suspect you right away.

262
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:20,718
This is why I should've taught you...

263
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:22,819
how to dupe the police.

264
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,018
What should we do?

265
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,258
They're my clothes.

266
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,228
Oh, okay.

267
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,869
They're unisex clothing.

268
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,599
Try them on.

269
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:38,539
Get changed.

270
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:41,708
But...

271
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,829
Eun Ki lent me a shirt.

272
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,928
It suits you.

273
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,198
Change into this.

274
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:12,468
Okay.

275
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,248
Wow, handcuffs.

276
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,218
I haven't seen these in ages. I missed them so much.

277
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,228
Cash to spend for now.

278
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:47,069
Eun Ki. The food, medicine, and other expenses I incurred,

279
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,139
I'll pay in full from here.

280
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,609
Great, thanks.

281
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,278
Transport.

282
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:00,688
- Where is it? - Mall parking, across the street.

283
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,559
B13, basement level two. You'll find a motorcycle parked.

284
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,188
A bike?

285
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:10,059
And these are phones we'll use to contact each other.

286
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,629
- You use this from now on too. - Me too?

287
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:15,299
Back out if you want to. There's still time.

288
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:17,968
I can't back out now.

289
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,309
Eun Ki. Isn't my brother incredible?

290
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,748
He isn't just meticulous at work.

291
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,748
He's like that in everyday life too.

292
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:32,089
The sight of our fridge would shock you.

293
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,619
Everything's in a line.

294
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,258
He has robotic organization skills.

295
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,758
You're in no position to crack jokes.

296
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:40,089
Right.

297
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,958
Jung's recording of his talk with Baek's killer was at the motel?

298
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,198
- Yes. - Did Jung say exactly where?

299
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,168
No. He said if I went to the motel his wife would give it to me.

300
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:54,569
If his wife had it, it's likely the police found it.

301
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:57,539
Shall I find out if the police have it?

302
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,889
(Girlfriend)

303
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:14,159
(Detective Kim Seok Gu)

304
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,799
Hey, honey. What's up?

305
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,268
Are you on your own?

306
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,668
I'm on a stakeout with a senior detective.

307
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,268
Then answer yes or no to my question.

308
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:30,909
Among the evidence from the motel, was there a recording?

309
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,708
The killer's voice is on it.

310
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:34,178
No, miss.

311
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,379
Nope, it wasn't there.

312
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,149
Okay, thanks. Bye.

313
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:43,688
(Detective Kim Seok Gu)

314
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,458
If the police don't have it, the killer does.

315
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,498
Why else would he have gone to the motel?

316
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:58,539
Is there nothing left to prove who the real killer is?

317
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:12,448
Right.

318
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,119
There's one left.

319
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,668
Do you want to know who I am?

320
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:34,069
My name is Yoon Jae. Jung Yoon Jae.

321
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,789
Why did you ask to see me?

322
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:30,028
You know Sung Jun appeared a few days ago, don't you?

323
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,498
Yes. I saw it on the news.

324
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:36,268
He passed me a note that day with surprising information.

325
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,208
That you abducted and tortured him and even...

326
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:40,869
tried to kill him.

327
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,339
That can't be.

328
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:47,748
There's also talk that you heard the killer's voice.

329
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,319
Could I hear it as well?

330
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,649
I have no idea what you're talking about.

331
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:56,559
Sung Jun said he was framed.

332
00:25:58,258 --> 00:25:59,928
And you believe him?

333
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:04,028
Why are you so convinced that Sung Jun's the killer?

334
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:17,708
- Yes? - Honey.

335
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,349
Do you know who just came over?

336
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,718
Ji Eun's boyfriend.

337
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,829
Ji Eun's boyfriend?

338
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,768
Where could it be?

339
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,178
Darn it.

340
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:11,119
Honey. What are you doing?

341
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,518
Hurry up. The candles are all melting.

342
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:25,329
Happy birthday to you

343
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,539
Happy birthday to you

344
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:35,109
Happy birthday dear Ji Eun

345
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:40,278
Happy birthday to you

346
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,879
No. Stop!

347
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,518
No, don't take it down!

348
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:45,149
No! Honey.

349
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:46,918
No.

350
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,258
Ji Eun's coming home soon. She's coming after.

351
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:50,359
- Let go! - Stop it.

352
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,589
Ji Eun's cake!

353
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:56,359
No!

354
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:06,329
I didn't find anything.

355
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:09,998
- You didn't? - I didn't.

356
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:14,708
I looked in the living room, the big room, and the small room,

357
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:16,309
but I couldn't find anything.

358
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,409
What if it was never there to begin with?

359
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:27,789
If that's not it,

360
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:29,859
maybe the culprit got there before me.

361
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,539
Don't resent me.

362
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,508
This is all Yoon Jae's fault.

363
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:02,319
(Baek Ji Eun Murder Case)

364
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,488
Okay. Let's start from square one.

365
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,629
You're the prime suspect in these three cases.

366
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:09,958
Under the pretense...

367
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,159
that the murderer behind Baek Ji Eun, Yeom Hye Jin,

368
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,198
and Jung Man Chun's family is the same person,

369
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:17,899
if we can get evidence regarding even one of these cases,

370
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:20,139
we can clear your name from the serial murder charges.

371
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,238
First, this.

372
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,839
(Muyeong Hospital Rooftop Fall)

373
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,508
There's a piece of evidence from the rooftop...

374
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:29,178
where Jung Man Chun fell from that the police haven't figured out.

375
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,119
What is it?

376
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,649
Right after Jung Man Chun fell,

377
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,289
there was a man on the roof.

378
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,218
How can we find a man...

379
00:32:38,218 --> 00:32:39,629
that the police couldn't find?

380
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,688
Right before Jung Man Chun fell,

381
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:45,428
I was waiting at the crosswalk in front of the hospital.

382
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,909
At that time, there was a drone in the air.

383
00:32:56,938 --> 00:33:00,478
That drone might've filmed something on the roof.

384
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,579
It's illegal to fly drones inside the city,

385
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,748
so if we ask the police, we can find out who was flying it.

386
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,718
Should I call Seok Gu?

387
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:12,119
No. I'll look into the drone.

388
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:13,928
Sung Jun,

389
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:17,198
go over everything on Baek Ji Eun and Yeom Hye Jin's murders...

390
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:19,329
and try to see if we missed anything.

391
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:20,428
Sung Hoon.

392
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,968
You just want me to sit here and go over everything?

393
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,738
What else can you do right now?

394
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,139
I'm sure I can find something.

395
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,139
Why are you guys fighting? We're on the same team.

396
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:29,708
Let's cheer up. Okay?

397
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,008
Come on.

398
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,278
Eun Ki. Keep an eye on him,

399
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:36,819
so he doesn't do anything stupid.

400
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:47,028

401
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,238

(Taxi)

404
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:22,798
Welcome. Where can I take you?

405
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,409
Are we there?

406
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:58,599
(Yu Na)

407
00:36:02,482 --> 00:36:04,053
You told me to mind my own business.

408
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:05,593
What is it?

409
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:07,363
Save me.

410
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:09,022
Yu Na.

411
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,693
What do you mean? Yu Na?

412
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:13,403
I...

413
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:15,703
Ms. Jo...

414
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,203
Please save me...

415
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:19,903
Yu Na, where are you?

416
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:21,573
Yu Na.

417
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,843
Where are you now? I'll come get you. Just tell me...

418
00:36:29,343 --> 00:36:30,953
I'm sorry.

419
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:48,102
All right. Everyone, check the batteries on your flashlights.

420
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:49,973
You each have your batons, right?

421
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:52,133
This is the current situation.

422
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:57,243
We tracked Kwon Yu Na's phone and the signal...

423
00:36:57,812 --> 00:37:00,082
was last pinged in this vicinity.

424
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:02,482
- Once we get backup... - Yu Na!

425
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:03,982
- Hey, wait. - Yu Na!

426
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,013
Kwon Yu Na!

427
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:07,953
- Darn it. - Yu Na!

428
00:37:07,953 --> 00:37:09,283
- Kwon Yu Na! - Come on, we should all go.

429
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:11,593
- Let's go. - Kwon Yu Na!

430
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,962
- Officers go that way! - Kwon Yu Na!

431
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:15,292
Yu Na!

432
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,462
You there, go up that way.

433
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:18,832
- Yu Na! - Kwon Yu Na!

434
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,162
- Kwon Yu Na! - Yu Na!

435
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:23,272
Kwon Yu Na!

436
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,772
- Yu Na! - Kwon Yu Na!

437
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,872
This way. Kwon Yu Na!

438
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,243
Officer Park. Get over here.

439
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:35,013
Go farther up.

440
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:37,712
Yu Na!

441
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:48,363
Hey, what are you doing here?

442
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:49,763
Why are you sleeping out here?

443
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:52,493
Get up, now.

444
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:55,203
Get up. Let's go.

445
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:57,232
Let's go.

446
00:37:58,533 --> 00:37:59,602
Get up.

447
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:01,872
Let's go buy you some shoes.

448
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:07,283
I'll empty out my bank account and get you a really nice pair.

449
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:12,582
Yu Na. You can't do this.

450
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:15,323
You can't go like this.

451
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:23,662
Poor Yu Na. What am I supposed to do?

452
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:30,303
Yu Na!

453
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:39,982
Gosh, you're so loud.

454
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:51,423
So, to summarize,

455
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:55,193
you left the club and got in a taxi.

456
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:59,093
You dozed off, and when you woke up...

457
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:03,673
the taxi driver suddenly dragged you to the forest and did this, right?

458
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:06,743
Darn it. How many times do I have to tell you?

459
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:10,542
We just have to be sure.

460
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,943
Do you remember the license plate or the cab company?

461
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:16,953
I don't even remember the driver's face.

462
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,513
Would I remember something like that?

463
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:23,892
I'm curious about one thing. Why are you so angry?

464
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:26,763
You're making me angry, that's why.

465
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:28,462
You're not out there catching the culprit.

466
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:31,062
Why are you bothering me when I'm hurt?

467
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,832
Okay, Yu Na. Get some rest.

468
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:36,533
Detective, let's stop here for now.

469
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,533
I'll let you know if Yu Na remembers anything.

470
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,602
Yes, I think that would be the best.

471
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:43,812
I can't say anything.

472
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,243
- Let's go, Seok Gu. - Okay.

473
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:48,243
A tattoo.

474
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:53,122
That jerk had a tattoo on his arm.

475
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:57,153
Darn it.

476
00:39:57,892 --> 00:39:59,823
Look at you. Did you just dodge?

477
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:02,493
I'm going to kill you.

478
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,703
Darn this thing.

479
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:18,312
Darn...

480
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:30,053
Darn it!

481
00:40:45,772 --> 00:40:47,803
(Hoonyoung Driver's Diner)

482
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:02,953
But this really is unexpected.

483
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:04,993
Ryu Sung Jun being Yoon Jae, I mean.

484
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,593
I had no idea.

485
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:12,162
Wasn't the guy you saw in court Yoon Jae?

486
00:41:12,732 --> 00:41:16,803
No, the guy I saw wasn't Yoon Jae. It was number seven.

487
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:17,932
Number seven?

488
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:20,743
You know, the rat with the burn mark.

489
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,482
Moon Kang. There must be a reason...

490
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:32,912
these guys showed up at once.

491
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:37,292
You mean they colluded and killed Ji Eun and Chief Yeom's daughter?

492
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:38,923
They're definitely capable of it.

493
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,323
I'll look into number seven.

494
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:47,232
(Taxi)

495
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,332
It's been a while.

496
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:52,533
It's me, Mr. Choi.

497
00:41:53,673 --> 00:41:55,372
Crazy Dog is looking for you.

498
00:41:56,142 --> 00:42:00,042
But should I hand you over to him or not? I'm not sure.

499
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,712
The thing is, I need some money.

500
00:42:04,513 --> 00:42:05,982
I'll decide after I see what you do.

501
00:42:07,383 --> 00:42:08,852
Let me know when you're ready.

502
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:12,792
(Rat)

503
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:22,462
Darn it!

504
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:27,943
He had this tattoo on his arm.

505
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:31,312
Is she sure it's this tattoo?

506
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,312
Seok Gu was also surprised to see this tattoo earlier.

507
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:37,653
Why is that?

508
00:42:38,513 --> 00:42:40,982
I saw it on Mr. Choi's arm before.

509
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:47,093
Could I see a photo of Yu Na's current state?

510
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:52,562
This was how she looked this morning.

511
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:00,743
Sung Hoon. Look at this.

512
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,243
She was hit in the face and torso the most.

513
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:09,682
It's similar to Yeom Hye Jin.

514
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:15,383
Then are you saying Yeom Hye Jin's killer is Mr. Choi?

515
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,693
Mr. Choi used to beat his wife habitually.

516
00:43:21,522 --> 00:43:24,533
When she ran away, he would've needed an outlet for his anger.

517
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,332
And maybe that outlet was to beat up women like Yeom Hye Jin and Yu Na...

518
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:29,062
who were going home alone late at night.

519
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:32,703
It's a plausible theory.

520
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:38,443
But these photos and his record aren't enough to make a case.

521
00:43:39,212 --> 00:43:40,212
I know that.

522
00:43:40,943 --> 00:43:44,453
We need foolproof evidence like a witness or DNA.

523
00:43:55,363 --> 00:43:57,292
(Yeom Hye Jin Murder Case, Victim: Yeom Hye Jin, 33 years old)

524
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:59,162
(Found in a flower bed at Muyeong Park by a guard)

525
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:00,932
Right.

526
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:05,403
Didn't she say the guy had a wound on his arm as well as the tattoo?

527
00:44:05,403 --> 00:44:08,943
Yes, she said he had scratch marks on his arm.

528
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:14,712
(Victim: Yeom Hye Jin, 33 years old)

529
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:18,553
Sung Hoon. What if the person who gave him that wound...

530
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:20,153
(Yeom Hye Jin)

531
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:21,182
was Yeom Hye Jin?

532
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:29,263
Then Mr. Choi's DNA would've been found during the autopsy.

533
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:31,633
What if they couldn't find any because her nails were broken?

534
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:34,102
Don't you think it's too late to find the broken nails?

535
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:37,272
No, it's not too late.

536
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:39,272
Because...

537
00:44:41,173 --> 00:44:42,343
I've already found it.

538
00:44:43,573 --> 00:44:45,743
(April 19, 2022, The day after Yeom Hye Jin's body was found)

539
00:44:45,743 --> 00:44:47,982
As fast as you can. I'm asking you as a friend.

540
00:44:53,153 --> 00:44:56,383
Hey, come on. Just take a look.

541
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:57,622
It's Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail.

542
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:00,423
Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail?

543
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:07,932
You're right. It's the same nail gel as Yeom Hye Jin's...

544
00:45:09,803 --> 00:45:12,703
But where did you get this?

545
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:15,073
At the park where Yeom Hye Jin's body was found.

546
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:18,042
I scoured the entire trail to find it.

547
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:19,513
You see this bloodstain, right?

548
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:22,812
Don't you think something might be in there?

549
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:45,203
Are you a pheasant?

550
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:47,642
Hey, Ryu Sung Jun.

551
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,703
Will you turn me in? If so, then I'm leaving.

552
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:52,412
You crazy jerk! Where have you been?

553
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:55,743
What... Are you okay?

554
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:58,953
Gosh, I never thought I'd hear you say that.

555
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,252
How do you think I feel...

556
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:03,352
watching you go on the run when you used to chase suspects?

557
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:07,022
- What happened? - It's a long story.

558
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:10,432
It's a 2.5-hour long blockbuster. I'll tell you when we have the time.

559
00:46:10,662 --> 00:46:12,892
Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail that I brought in that day.

560
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:14,002
Do you have the test results?

561
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:16,602
Gosh, seriously... Of course, I have them.

562
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:22,203
We found an unknown person's DNA from her fingernail.

563
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:28,142
- "Unidentified?" - That's right.

564
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:30,482
It means they ran it...

565
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,453
in the police's DNA database and didn't find a match,

566
00:46:32,712 --> 00:46:36,553
which means I'm no longer a suspect...

567

in the murder of Yeom Hye Jin.

568
00:46:42,193 --> 00:46:44,863
Do the police know about this?

569
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:46,133
Yes. Of course, they know.

570
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:50,903
All clear.

Yes.

582
00:47:39,352 --> 00:47:41,923
He asked them to analyze the evidence behind our backs,

583
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:43,953
which is certainly suspicious.

584
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:45,252
He may be trying...

585

and those who work in the lab. That's it.

Like you said,

591

this could cause confusion in the investigation,

592

Now that I'm retired,

642
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:02,382
even sending out these invitations is a struggle.

00:53:51,132 --> 00:53:52,862
Congratulations, Mr. Kang.

664
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:54,331
Thanks.

665
00:53:55,331 --> 00:53:56,632
All right.

666
00:53:56,632 --> 00:54:00,201
Are we just waiting for Mr. An and Mr. Choi now?

667
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:53,782
What happened?

668
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:13,371
Hello?

669
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:18,172
Mr. Choi. It's me, In Seong. We were on the jury together.

670
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:21,511
Mr. Choi?

671
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:24,851
Isn't this Mr. Choi's number?

672
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:44,471
All good?

673
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:46,572
Let's go.

674
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,232
Captain, I don't think anyone is here.

675
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:15,232
Hold on.

676
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:29,911
He's still breathing. Call an ambulance now.

677
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:32,152
- Yes, sir. - Hurry.

678
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,522
(Detective)

679
00:58:05,712 --> 00:58:07,382
This crazy punk.

680
00:58:23,002 --> 00:58:25,572
Ryu Sung Jun. What are you doing?

681
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:27,132
Mr. Choi got whacked.

682
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:30,272
- What? - He's been hit in the head.

683
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:32,971
He seemed to be in critical condition.

684
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,911
- You went to Mr. Choi's place? - Yes.

685
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:40,152
I clearly told you not to go anywhere without my permission.

686
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:41,982
What's with you? You little...

687
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:46,652
No, you've always been like this.

688
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:51,092
All your life, you never cared about others...

689
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,761
and always did whatever you wanted.

690
00:58:53,561 --> 00:58:55,761
Do you know what the family is going through because of you?

691
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:57,601
Of course, you won't know.

692
00:58:58,371 --> 00:59:00,402
You only care about yourself, you selfish jerk.

693
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:02,741
I had no choice.

694
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:05,072
Why is that your excuse every time?

695
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:11,411
Detective Kang hid the report from the National Forensic Service.

696
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,782
My colleagues aren't investigating the case,

697
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:14,982
and you want me to do nothing?

698
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,252
Look.

699
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:24,431
It's from the day when Yeom Hye Jin died.

700
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:28,362
It shows the jurors' texts and their locations at the time.

701
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:29,831
(Choi Soon Gil, Yeom Hye Jin)

702
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:31,502
Choi Soon Gil was the only one...

703
00:59:31,502 --> 00:59:33,201
who was at the park when she was murdered.

704
00:59:33,572 --> 00:59:35,272
If he really is the one who killed her,

705
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,572
the DNA under her nail must belong to him.

706
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:39,172
So I wanted to get his toothbrush or something.

707
00:59:41,482 --> 00:59:44,712
I feel bad that you're going through this because of me,

708
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:47,482
so I wanted to clear my name. That's why I did it. Happy now?

709
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:52,791
Sit down.

710
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:08,971
Other than Mr. Choi, was there anyone else at the scene?

711
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:09,971
I didn't see anyone else.

712
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:11,471
Did you see anything suspicious?

713
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:18,511
I found this hidden on top of his wall clock.

714
01:00:22,482 --> 01:00:23,782
(Recording 001)

715
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,962
What is it?

716
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,561
There's a recording.

717
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:33,391
It's from today.

718
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,831
(Recording 001)

719
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:44,002
Come in.

720
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,152
I thought it might be you.

721
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:02,692
I was right.

722
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:05,891
That day...

723
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:08,362
Was it in the courtroom?

724
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:17,442
I happened to glance at you during the trial,

725
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,942
and it looked like you recognized him.

726
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:26,282
Back then, you guys called him Crazy Dog.

727
01:01:33,552 --> 01:01:35,462
You were glaring at Crazy Dog.

728
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:39,132
The moment I saw the burn scar...

729
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,931
on the back of your hand,

730
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:47,072
I realized that you were there that day.

731
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:49,471
You're Number Seven.

732
01:01:56,482 --> 01:01:58,581
Don't tell me you came here empty-handed.

733
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:02,252
I warned you that Crazy Dog was looking for you.

734
01:02:03,522 --> 01:02:06,351
- Number 24. - Number 24?

735
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:13,991
You're making all this fuss because of Number 24?

736
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:16,831
Come on.

737
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:20,431
Let's be honest. Number 24 died because of you.

738
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:23,342
Had you not been such a tattletale,

739
01:02:23,601 --> 01:02:26,241
Number 24 would still be alive.

740
01:02:33,652 --> 01:02:35,282
Number 24...

741
01:02:48,761 --> 01:02:51,331
He said the culprit was in the courtroom that day.

742
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:54,701
Where was Mr. Choi sitting that day?

743
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:02,311
He was sitting in the back.

744
01:03:04,482 --> 01:03:05,511
The second seat from the end.

745
01:03:07,982 --> 01:03:12,092
How many people's hands could you see from that seat?

746
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:17,761
You can probably see almost everyone...

747
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,761
except for those sitting in the last row of the audience.

748
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:26,002
If we exclude women and elderly people...

749
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:29,942
The culprit was in that room that day.

750
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:16,652
(Recording 001)

751
01:04:18,991 --> 01:04:20,052
Come in.

752
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:33,701
(Do Not Cross)

753
01:04:52,052 --> 01:04:53,252
This man walked slowly.

754
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,522
Was it intentional?

755
01:04:59,632 --> 01:05:01,132
(Recording 001)

756
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,802
I thought it might be you.

757
01:05:04,032 --> 01:05:05,302
I was right.

758
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:39,591
The left and right footsteps sound different.

759
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:45,902
A difference in stride means...

760
01:06:55,982 --> 01:06:56,982
Hey, Sung Hoon.

761
01:06:56,982 --> 01:06:58,811
Go down the stairs in time with the recording.

762
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:00,582
Okay.

763
01:07:46,992 --> 01:07:49,101
(Muyeong Local Court)

764
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:50,532
You won't come to the dinner?

765
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:54,942
You go ahead. I'll follow.

766
01:07:55,202 --> 01:07:56,301
Promise.

767
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:13,952
I found the killer.

768
01:08:18,022 --> 01:08:19,292
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

769
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:20,492
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

770
01:08:20,492 --> 01:08:21,832
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

771
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:23,162
(but with doubles and dummies.)

772
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:46,692
(Blind)

773
01:08:47,152 --> 01:08:48,761
Don't trust anyone.

774
01:08:48,761 --> 01:08:49,921
Not even Sung Jun.

775
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:51,891
Or me.

776
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,532
If you don't hand over Yoon Jae,

777
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:57,961
The son you really cherish will get hurt.

778
01:08:58,532 --> 01:08:59,832
In the container...

779
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:01,572
was a wedding invitation with blood on it.

780
01:09:02,942 --> 01:09:04,942
These three have some sort of connection.

781
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:08,442
The truth about who the killer is.

782
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:11,711
Do you know who I am?

783
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:13,881
Number 13, Jung Yoon Jae.
