Why did you come here if you have a mom?

41
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:36,348
Did your mom abandon you like Number Seven's mom?

42
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,778
No. My mom said she was just going to the bathroom.

43
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,388
But...

44
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:45,458

There are a lot of kids like that here.

48

Everyone thinks they lost their moms at first.

49
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,768
They have no idea their moms abandoned them. They're so naive.

50

Want me to kill her?

51

- Who? - Your mom.

52
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:18,817
Oh, right. You said you missed your mom.

53
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:22,228
Fine. Keep missing her.

54

If you change your mind, tell me.

By the way, why did you do that back then?

70

What do you mean?

71
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:03,187
The woman wearing a gray coat, beige pants,

72

and white sneakers...

73
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,028
didn't lose her son at the amusement park.

74
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,028
You abandoned me, right?

75
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,247
- Sung Hoon. - You're here.

76

He's awake now.

77

I'm going to the restroom. I'll be right back.

Mom. The ice cream...

82
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,148
Sorry.

83
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,547

In Seong...

88
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,408
No, you have it all wrong.

89
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,347
I just went to the restroom.

90
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,547
You disappeared while I was away...

91
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,418
You're saying the same thing that Number 12 said.

92
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,018
What?

93
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,918
No, don't eat that!

94
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:22,658
You're allergic to peaches.

95
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,858
If you eat that, you can't breathe...

96
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:27,158
You used to be like that.

97
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,437
Is that so?

98
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:34,898
That's strange.

99
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,108
I loved peaches since I was young.

100
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,248
Oh, I must have...

101
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,118
gotten it mixed up with another fruit.

102
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,758
That must be it.

103
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,778
Is there anything you remember?

104
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:22,518
And the riverbank? How did you know to go there?

105
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,687
And how did you know I was at the riverbank?

106
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:30,087
To be honest,

107
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:32,957
I tailed you.

108
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,427
Why?

109
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:36,697
I thought that you were the culprit.

110
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,097
Because I'm Number 11?

111
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,238
Not just that.

112
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:47,238
You knew that Jung Man Chun's murderer was Mr. Baek.

113
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:49,908
You also knew that An Tae Ho wasn't at Choi Soon Gil's place,

114
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,347
but you pretended like you didn't know.

115
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:55,447
Also, black clothes were hidden inside the trunk of your car,

116
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,587
and there were sneakers with yellow paint on them.

117
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:01,288
I don't know about the other stuff, but I definitely saw the culprit...

118
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:03,927
wearing sneakers with yellow paint on them.

119
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,398
I couldn't help but suspect you.

120
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:08,697
And now?

121
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,727
Do you still suspect me?

122
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:12,138
No.

123
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:14,097
I saw the culprit stab you.

124
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,608
Then it was a good thing that I was stabbed.

125
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,977
That helped clear my name.

126
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,518
But I still need to hear an explanation.

127
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,547
Why did you lie?

128
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,388
As you said, I knew early on...

129
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,618
that Mr. Baek killed Jung Man Chun.

130
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:37,888
There was only one reason why I didn't report him.

131
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,858
I wanted to catch the real culprit.

132
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,498
Mr. Baek was searching for the culprit, just like us.

133
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,567
You almost died.

134
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:49,337
I thought, if I didn't take the risk,

135
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:51,467
I wouldn't be able to catch the culprit.

136
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,947
Then what about the black clothes and sneakers?

137
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:58,977
What were those?

138
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:00,677
Until I became sure,

139
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:04,148
I was tailing the culprit in secret, on my own.

140
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,388
The black clothes in my trunk...

141
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,858
are the clothes I wore while tailing him.

142
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,158
The yellow paint got on the sneakers...

143
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:14,128
while I was tailing him as well.

144
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:17,268
They happened to be doing some paintwork at the park.

145
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:19,498
The guy you were tailing...

146
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:22,408
is the culprit who stabbed you?

147
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,207
Who is that person?

148
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:36,847
Jung In Seong.

149
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:52,097
Captain. Jung In Seong is the culprit.

150
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:53,868
Let's get an APB out on him right away.

151
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:55,368
Okay. Got it.

152
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,177
Hello.

153
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,278
We're from the police.

154
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:09,788
Is there a Mr. Jung In Seong here?

155
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:20,957
Mr. Jung In Seong?

156
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,567
Yes?

157
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,868
You're Jung In Seong?

158
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,778
Yes, that's me.

159
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:34,577
Why do you ask?

160
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:41,847
They just had the same name.

161
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,748
The Jung In Seong that we knew...

162
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:46,717
never worked here in the first place.

163
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:50,888
Ryu. This is just like the movie, "Helpless."

164
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,097
By the way, Sung Jun.

165
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,168
We've confirmed the location of the diner owner...

166
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:57,498
at a guest house on Ganghwa Island.

167
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,108
(In Seong's Place)

168
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,087
Mom.

169
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,018
Where's Jung In Seong?

170
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:22,557
What? In Seong went out.

171
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,878
Mom. You said you wouldn't do a DNA test.

172
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:43,547
Did you come this far to say that?

173
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,878
You have nothing better to do?

174
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:48,378
I don't need a DNA test.

175
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:50,687
A mom and a son can recognize each other.

176
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:53,087
That's what it means to be drawn to family.

177
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,858
Listen carefully and don't be too shocked.

178
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,587
Leave it. Now go, get out of here.

179
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:59,028
You could be in danger.

180
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:02,227
Sung Jun.

181
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,028
In Seong's my son.

182
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:10,467
Every second I spend with him means the world, it's that special.

183
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,878
I met him after all these years.

184
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:18,548
So go.

185
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:21,918
Leave.

186
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:40,568
- Here. - What's this for?

187
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:44,408
List up what you want to do once you're discharged.

188
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:47,707
Things you want to eat, places you want to visit,

189
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,977
hobbies you want to try out...

190
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:53,618
Or people you'd like to see.

191
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:58,048
It can be as simple as you like. Write whatever you want.

192
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:02,487
Why are you doing this?

193
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,027
There's nothing else to do here. It's to kill time.

194
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,197
Keep out anything work-related.

195
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,338
(Sosoo)

196
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:39,628
Do you think he's really connected to Jung In Seong?

197
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:43,328
Would he risk being framed to hide him if he weren't?

198
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:53,838
What's the result?

199
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,648
Jung In Seong and Kim Sook Hee aren't related.

200
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:00,578
The 14-year-old female skeleton and Jung In Seong...

201
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,418
have the same mitochondrial DNA.

202
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,517
They're siblings.

203
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:19,568
Mom.

204
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:26,638
(Police Son)

205
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:34,707
I like eyeballs like yours.

206
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:38,048
Eyeballs filled with utter fear.

207
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:40,848
It's pitiful.

208
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:46,017
Why are you doing this to me?

209
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,888
Why did you do that to me?

210
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:55,227
I don't know what I did wrong,

211
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,497
but I apologize.

212
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:02,298
You don't know what you did wrong,

213
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,737
but you hid the tapes and pretended they were missing?

214
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:09,707
Oh, well... That was...

215
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:11,677
Why did I do that?

216
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:14,578
How shall I kill you?

217
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,318
Your cheeks. Shall I slit them?

218
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,558
No, you can't.

219
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,358
In Seong, no...

220
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:24,687
Yoon Jae, I'm sorry for everything.

221
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:28,628
I'm sorry for it all, everything, so please forgive me.

222
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:31,068
I...

223
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:34,868
You're so pathetic.

224
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:38,868
Don't worry.

225
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:42,338
I won't kill you yet.

226
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,967
(Muyeong Police Station Chief Yeom Ki Nam)

227

(Calling)

228
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:41,568
Who are you?

229
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:42,967
It's me.

230
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:45,568
Bae Chul Ho.

231
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:59,558
If you bring him 100,000 dollars, he'll hand over the evidence?

232
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:05,287
Bae Chul Ho the producer is mad for money,

233
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:08,828
but he doesn't have the guts to blackmail a police chief.

234
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:11,527
Yoon Jae put him up to this.

235
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:14,568
It's for the better.

236
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,638
This is a great opportunity.

237
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:19,277
A chance...

238
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:22,177
to eliminate Yoon Jae and the evidence.

239
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,848
At last, I get to meet Yoon Jae.

(Juror Jung In Seong)

242
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,068
Mom.

243
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:26,138
(Juror Jung In Seong)

244
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:27,878
Hello?

245
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,108
Did you get the photo?

246
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:34,048
Jung In Seong. What did you do to my mom?

247
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:37,118
I haven't killed her yet.

248
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:38,447
Hey!

249
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,588
If you so much as touch my mom,

250
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:43,027
you'll pay dearly for it.

251
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:45,027
For what you did to Yu Na too,

252
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,298
I will kill you.

253
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,098
Will you calm down?

254
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,298
You're not usually like this.

255
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:55,967
Where is my mom? Tell me now.

256
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:57,537
Listen carefully, Eun Ki.

257
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:03,808
Nurse Jo's life is in your hands.

258
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,618
Leave the apartment now and head to the taxi stand.

259
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:12,787
Oh, and don't come with your police tail.

260
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:15,017
Remember.

261
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:16,987
The moment the cops find out,

262
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:19,058
your mom dies.

263
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:48,017
- Mother? - Yes.

264
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:51,888
Her aide said she left on her own to meet someone for lunch.

265
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:53,027
But her phone is off.

266
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:57,568
And she withdrew a huge sum of money without running it by me.

267
00:25:58,128 --> 00:25:59,868
I have a bad feeling about this.

268
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:01,437
Do you know what it could be about?

269
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,207
No, not really.

270
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:10,648
I'm sorry.

271
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:13,677
I went to the toilet, and he was gone when I got back.

272
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:16,487
That's what it's like.

273
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:18,747
The perp always shows up right when...

274
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:20,588
you take a poop break during a stakeout.

275
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:22,457
Who can't we reach so far?

276
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,358
Jo Eun Ki, Jo In Sook, the diner owner,

277
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,727
Lee Jung Soo, Eungam-dong Kwon Kyung Ja, Minister Na Guk Hee,

278
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:33,497
and our piece of trash chief.

279
00:26:33,497 --> 00:26:34,668
It's a total of seven people.

280
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:37,868
No. It's eight people including Producer Bae.

281
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,037
Oh, right. There's Producer Bae.

282
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:41,707
Did you locate the smartwatch?

283
00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:43,878
- Why are you asking me? - Darn it.

284
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:45,477
It's probably Jung Yoon Jae.

285
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:52,118
Do you think Jung Yoon Jae is gathering everyone in one place?

286
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:58,058
We don't have time, so don't look for everyone at once.

287
00:26:58,457 --> 00:27:00,058
Just focus on 1 or 2 people.

288
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:02,257
Sung Jun, you focus on Jo Eun Ki.

289
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,128
Detective Na and Seok Gu...

290
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:06,168
locate the smartwatch. Got it?

291
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,237
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

292
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,237
Go.

293
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:20,017
Hey, Seok Gu.

294
00:27:20,717 --> 00:27:21,878
Are you sure...

295
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,687
Kwon Kyung Ja's emergency call came from here?

296
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:26,687
Yes. This is the right location.

297
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:29,628
Kwon Kyung Ja!

298
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:32,058
Kwon Kyung Ja!

299
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:36,527
Sir.

300
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:39,298
Over there.

301
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:07,298
Mom!

302
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:20,838
Mom!

303
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:25,848
It's Detective Ryu Sung Jun's mother, Minister Na Guk Hee.

304
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:31,487
Minister Na. Wake up.

305
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:34,388
She's still sleeping.

306
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:35,888
She should be getting up soon.

307
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:38,358
She must be really tired.

308
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:39,697
Where's my mom?

309
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:41,997
If you wait patiently, you'll meet her soon.

310
00:28:41,997 --> 00:28:43,368
How soon?

311
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:46,368
He promised to let my mom live if I came alone.

312
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,237
Your mom must be so happy...

313
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:51,138
to have a daughter who worries so much about her.

314
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:52,338
Why are you doing this?

315
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,507
You weren't even at Hope Welfare Center!

316
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:57,677
Is it because of your brother?

317
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:00,247
It's not because of my brother.

318
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:02,177
Think about it.

319
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:05,048
It's not like my brother can come back if I get revenge.

320
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,687
But my family can't be put back together after being torn apart.

321
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:10,927
I don't care about that.

322
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,898
Then why are you doing this?

323
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:16,927
I can't let him take the fall alone.

324
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,068
Him?

325
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:23,368
Jung Yoon Jae?

326
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:47,158
There's nothing here that could be a clue.

327
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,628
She wouldn't leave without saying anything.

328
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,068
Maybe she was blackmailed.

329
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:54,437
What's this drawing?

330
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,267
That was drawn by someone who was at Hope Welfare Center.

331
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,368
Number 45.

332
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:00,507
Number 45?

333
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,338
Why? Do you know him?

334
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:05,608
I don't know.

335
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:07,918
I think I saw him in passing.

336
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:23,598
Two, four, zero?

337
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:26,638
This wasn't here before.

338
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,068
Two, four, zero?

339
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:31,608
Two, four, zero.

340
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:36,947
- The vacation home. - The vacation home?

341
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:38,348
The address...

342
00:30:38,348 --> 00:30:40,418
of the vacation home where Yoon Jung was locked up was 240.

343
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,898
- Jung Yoon Jae. - You found this place fast.

344
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,408
Did my brother tell you?

345
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:40,838
Where is everyone?

346
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:42,507
They're all alive in there.

347
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:45,148
I was waiting for you to get here before I killed them.

348
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:47,378
You lunatic.

349
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,548
The moment you open that door...

350
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,618
that house will go boom.

351
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:55,517
You'll end up being the one killing them all.

352
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:04,997
I prepared a gift for you.

353
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:07,368
Do you see that drum?

354
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:15,078
Open it.

355
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:54,777
Yes, there's a dead body in the front yard.

356
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:57,548
Send Forensics and the Bomb Squad.

357
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,247
Yes. As fast as possible.

358
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:25,908
Jung Yoon Jae.

359
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:30,048
Eun Ki.

360
00:33:34,217 --> 00:33:35,287
Mom.

361
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:42,997
Something seems strange.

362
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:44,767
What?

363
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,197
Considering the number of people inside,

364
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:48,767
isn't it too quiet?

365
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,868
I thought he said they were inside here.

366
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,868
He said that they were alive.

367
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:57,648
The moment you open that door that house will go boom.

368
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,148
"That house?"

369
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:02,777
Sung Hoon.

370
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:05,918
I don't think Jung Yoon Jae and everyone else...

371
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:08,757
is inside that house.

372
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:13,558
The homemade bomb, the CCTV camera,

373
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:16,427
the body inside the drum,

374
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,967
and the fact that Eun Ki gave us the address to this place...

375
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:22,197
I think it was just bait to tie us up here.

376
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,537
Where is this punk?

377
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:30,347
There's only one other place near here...

378
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,347
that Yoon Jae would go.

379
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:35,517
Hope Welfare Center.

380
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,916
My head.

381
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,146
It's been a while, Mr. Dirty Cop.

382
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:35,327
It was you.

383
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,157
Yoon Jae.

384
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,227
You don't seem very surprised.

385
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:44,836
You must've expected that I'd be waiting here.

386
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,497
I'm none other than the chief of police.

387
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,867
I'm on a different level from those bottom feeders.

388
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,316
You've collected so many.

389
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,046
Right?

390
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,316
What you did to us back then...

391
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:05,686
was on a different level too.

392
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:07,457
What I did to you kids,

393
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,327
I paid it all back with my daughter Hye Jin's life.

394
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:13,057
We're even now.

395
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:18,396
Even?

396
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:25,637
Says who?

397
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:34,186
That's 200,000 dollars.

398
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,347
Just hand over the evidence.

399
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:48,697
Oh, by the way...

400
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,097
You didn't actually trust me, did you?

401
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:55,936
No way.

402
00:37:58,736 --> 00:37:59,977
It's over for you today.

403
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:08,716
Why?

404
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,787
Is someone supposed to be coming?

405
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:21,666
Darn it. Baek Moon Kang, that punk...

406
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:23,697
How dare he betray me?

407
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,537
Goodness, Chief Yeom.

408
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:33,037
Will you be okay?

409
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,157
You punk!

410
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,497
You punk, where did you go after betraying me?

411
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,497
You didn't show up on time and ruined everything!

412
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,166
What will you do now?

413
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,207
Get off me!

414
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,526
(Hope Welfare Center)

415
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,387
Mom...

416
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,327
Are you okay? Get up, Mom.

417
00:41:35,686 --> 00:41:37,657
Mom?

418
00:41:37,856 --> 00:41:40,367
- Eun Ki. - Mom, are you okay?

419
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:41,697
Are you hurt?

420
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:44,566
- No. What about you? - I'm fine.

421
00:41:45,097 --> 00:41:46,466
Let's get up, okay?

422
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:48,307
- Oh, gosh. - Good.

423
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,006
What on earth is happening?

424
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:02,646
Hold on.

425
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:22,166
- Ms. Kwon. - Eun Ki.

426
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:25,677
- Did you get dragged here too? - Yes.

427
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,707
What happened?

428
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:31,646
I was all excited because someone asked me to perform...

429
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:33,177
an exorcism ritual.

430
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,887
And the office worker was waiting there for me.

431
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:40,256
Hey. That kid, In Seong. He's the murderer, right?

432
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:45,296
Yes.

433
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:46,796
I knew it.

434
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,126
I felt a weird coldness whenever I went near him.

435
00:42:51,796 --> 00:42:55,466
But where in the world are we?

436
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,307
I'm not sure either.

437
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:05,646
It's full of ghosts who died unfairly.

438
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:12,486
My gosh.

439
00:43:32,006 --> 00:43:34,707
Hey! Over here!

440
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:40,347
There are people down here!

441
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:44,816
What is that?

442
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:48,727
Is that a bomb?

443
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:57,966
Oh, no.

444
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,236
Is everyone awake?

445
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:15,916
You're right. That's a bomb.

446
00:44:18,216 --> 00:44:19,756
What do you think you're doing right now?

447
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:21,957
Open the door this instant!

448
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:25,197
That civil servant lady is still so bossy.

449
00:44:26,526 --> 00:44:29,197
Hey, does the police chief have anything to say?

450
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:34,637
What is it you want?

451
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,037
What I want is...

452
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:44,916
Your lives.

453
00:44:56,057 --> 00:44:59,057
Look at all your eyes full of terror.

454
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,197
Are you really that afraid to die?

455
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:06,336
I'll tell you a way you can stay alive.

456
00:45:12,637 --> 00:45:14,046
One of you can die for everyone else.

457
00:45:14,907 --> 00:45:16,546
Then I'll let the rest of you live.

458
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:34,466
You will spare the rest of us if one person dies, right?

459
00:45:34,727 --> 00:45:36,927
You won't change your word later, will you?

460
00:45:37,197 --> 00:45:40,267
You're free to choose whether you want to believe me or not.

461
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:45,207
You've got ten minutes.

462
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:48,207
Decide in ten minutes, or you'll all die together.

463
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:49,447
My gosh.

464
00:45:56,646 --> 00:45:57,686
Gosh!

465
00:45:58,017 --> 00:46:00,957
- No! - Hey, stop!

466
00:46:03,057 --> 00:46:05,927
- Stop that thing... - Stop!

467
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:07,966
Everyone, calm down!

468
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,767
Calm down!

469
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:12,537
Don't tell me you actually believe him.

470
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,236
He's a serial killer.

471
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:18,037
Don't let him trick you.

472
00:46:18,037 --> 00:46:20,477
Let's find a way for all of us to get out of here alive, okay?

473
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,977
As long as that door is locked,

474
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,477
we can't get out of here.

475
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:26,517
You heard that, right?

476
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:28,887
We've got no choice.

477
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:30,787
One of us must die!

478
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:37,497
Minister Na. You agree with me, right?

479
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:41,197
Sometimes, it's unavoidable...

480
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:42,796
to sacrifice one person for the greater good.

481
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:45,896
Let's pick one person!

482
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,006
Let's do it.

483
00:46:58,776 --> 00:46:59,847
Let's do it.

484
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:02,646
However,

485
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,256
how will we pick that one person?

486
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:10,157
Draw a random name out of a hat?

487
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:18,836
I'll...

488
00:47:21,066 --> 00:47:22,307
die.

489
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:27,747
Ma'am, no.

490
00:47:27,747 --> 00:47:29,506
- In Seong. - Ma'am!

491
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:31,977
I will die, so let these people go.

492
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,847
- No, please... - In Seong!

493
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:35,486
Ma'am! Don't do this.

494
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:36,747
Really?

495
00:47:39,086 --> 00:47:40,287
Sure, all right.

496
00:47:40,787 --> 00:47:42,057
Who will kill her, then?

497
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,506
I'll do it.

498
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,046
No.

499
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:17,334
What are you doing?

500
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,774
It's already been three minutes. Step aside at once!

501
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:21,274
She did nothing wrong.

502
00:48:21,945 --> 00:48:23,405
If one of us must die,

503
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:24,874
it should be someone who's done a wrong deed.

504
00:48:24,874 --> 00:48:26,575
Eun Ki is right.

505
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:29,215
Why kill someone who did nothing wrong?

506
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:32,254
Twenty years ago,

507
00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:34,984
I saw that man over there...

508
00:48:34,984 --> 00:48:38,254
drag a few kids. That's all.

509
00:48:38,254 --> 00:48:40,155
I didn't do anything!

510
00:48:40,155 --> 00:48:41,294
I see.

511
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:44,365
So you were that shaman.

512
00:48:45,164 --> 00:48:47,095
The one who told me to kill Yoon Jae.

513
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:53,334
You're not completely innocent, after all.

514
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:55,475
What?

515
00:48:56,805 --> 00:48:58,175
What about you?

516
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:02,314
What on earth did you do to the kids that you ended up here?

517
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,644
Hey, lady!

518
00:49:04,785 --> 00:49:07,655
I only came here...

519
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:10,454
to uncover the truth behind this darned welfare center.

520
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:11,894
Darn it.

521
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:13,155
Stop lying.

522
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:16,495
You concealed the truth.

523
00:49:16,725 --> 00:49:18,195
Nurse Jo!

524
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:22,734
You have no right to say that.

525
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,234
They were on the verge of dying. Instead of sending them to a doctor,

526
00:49:26,234 --> 00:49:29,075
you treated them yourself when you had no qualifications!

527
00:49:31,274 --> 00:49:32,414
You...

528
00:49:34,115 --> 00:49:36,945
and those scumbags were all in it together!

529
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:43,684
As a nurse, I had no power.

530
00:49:43,954 --> 00:49:46,155
That's why I sent you the tip-off.

531
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,965
Why did you break your promise?

532
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:52,095
You promised me that you'd run the show.

533
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:53,965
Why did you lie to me?

534
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:57,204
No! That is not what happened!

535
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:03,374
It was all her.

536
00:50:07,015 --> 00:50:08,515
She told me to just bury it.

537
00:50:45,515 --> 00:50:46,615
Me?

538
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:48,655
I ordered you to do it?

539
00:50:51,555 --> 00:50:53,294
You wanted to send your kid to a school abroad,

540
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:54,725
so you accepted the chump change I offered.

541
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:56,325
How dare you blame me?

542
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:01,604
You were the most proactive in trying to cover it up!

543
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:03,004
Chief Yeom.

544
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:05,734
You used the kids to make money.

545
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:08,175
To get the support fund,

546
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:11,015
you locked up the missing children at the welfare center...

547
00:51:11,015 --> 00:51:13,075
and lied to their parents that you couldn't find them.

548
00:51:13,075 --> 00:51:15,285
Did you think I wouldn't know?

549
00:51:20,084 --> 00:51:21,285
Chief Yeom.

550
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:23,584
Is this true?

551
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:26,024
Yes?

552
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:29,765
Excuse me.

553
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:32,234
My son... He's gone.

554
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:35,064
Help me find my son. Please?

555
00:51:35,064 --> 00:51:37,035
Where did you lose your son?

556
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:38,175
At the park.

557
00:51:38,175 --> 00:51:40,274
We were at the park together earlier.

558
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,604
I had to go somewhere quickly. When I came back,

559
00:51:42,774 --> 00:51:44,575
my son was gone.

560
00:51:45,414 --> 00:51:47,144
I was only gone for a moment!

561
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:50,285
Officer, please find my son.

562
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:53,115
He doesn't know this area well at all.

563
00:51:53,385 --> 00:51:55,385
And he gets scared very easily.

564
00:51:55,385 --> 00:51:57,725
He must be crying now.

565
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:01,095
- Have we received any reports? - No, sir.

566
00:52:01,095 --> 00:52:03,064
- Have we received any calls? - No, sir.

567
00:52:03,064 --> 00:52:04,124
Nothing, sir.

568
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:05,995
Ma'am.

569
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:10,104
Gosh, what was I thinking?

570
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:14,874
I don't even deserve to be called a mother.

571
00:52:17,874 --> 00:52:19,715
Ma'am, please calm down.

572
00:52:19,715 --> 00:52:23,845
It's not like beating yourself up will help you find your son.

573
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:25,285
Officer.

574
00:52:26,885 --> 00:52:28,524
I can find my son, right?

575
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:29,925
What's your son's name?

576
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:32,925
In Seong. Jung In Seong!

577
00:52:34,294 --> 00:52:37,325
How could you do this to me?

578
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:42,265
You, of all people, know how hard I tried to find In Seong!

579
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:45,004
How could you do this?

580
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:47,274
Darn you.

581
00:52:47,274 --> 00:52:49,044
Why did you leave the kid alone in the first place?

582
00:52:54,245 --> 00:52:57,285
Chief Yeom, you did the most horrible things.

583
00:52:57,914 --> 00:53:00,984
You went into that girl's room at the vacation home.

584
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:02,825
I have it on tape.

585
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:04,995
It was him.

586
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:08,624
It was his fault that Yoon Jung died.

587
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:16,965
Why was it my fault?

588
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:20,774
I wasn't the only one who received such favors.

589
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,715
Na Guk Hee. What about your husband?

590
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:27,245
What is this gibberish now?

591
00:53:27,615 --> 00:53:28,945
Do you have proof?

592
00:53:30,484 --> 00:53:32,314
Looks like we've made...

593
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:35,484
our decision.

594
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,234
No! Get off me!

595
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:50,604
It's him.

596
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:53,405
He's the biggest scumbag here, not me!

597
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,044
You saw the torture chamber, right?

598
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:58,644
In the torture chamber, that psycho hung the kids upside down...

599
00:53:58,644 --> 00:53:59,874
and beat them to a pulp.

600
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:03,314
Then he let hunting dogs off leash and killed the kids!

601
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:07,155
Do you even know how many kids he killed?

602
00:54:07,785 --> 00:54:10,984
Over ten were donated as cadavers.

603
00:54:10,984 --> 00:54:13,555
He should die, not me!

604
00:54:13,555 --> 00:54:14,624
Ten?

605
00:54:17,394 --> 00:54:20,434
No. 20, at least.

606
00:54:21,504 --> 00:54:23,064
And you call yourself human?

607
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:24,234
When you're human,

608
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:27,874
you must know your place.

609
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:30,945
Even if I were to go back in time,

610
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:33,015
I would make the same decision.

611
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,144
Everyone must know their place?

612
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:36,245
They had no parents. That's all.

613
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:39,084
Everyone's life matters, whether they have parents or not.

614
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:41,925
Do you realize you're no different from that serial killer?

615
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:44,385
Eun Ki!

616
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,995
No!

617
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:49,925
You sure take after your mother.

618
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:52,865
Just like her, you're too compassionate for your own good.

619
00:54:56,234 --> 00:54:57,265
Just one?

620
00:54:58,334 --> 00:54:59,934
Just kill one, and we're free to go?

621
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:03,144
Yes. I don't care who it is.

622
00:55:04,144 --> 00:55:05,445
Just kill one person.

623
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:12,854
No!

624
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:19,655
Stay away!

625
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:23,465
Stop! She's your daughter.

626
00:55:25,564 --> 00:55:28,704
Look at you trying to pull your crazy antics to save your daughter.

627
00:55:29,704 --> 00:55:31,334
I would never lie about something like this.

628
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,104
Why would I tell such a lie?

629
00:55:35,044 --> 00:55:36,075
Eun Ki is...

630
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:38,675
your daughter!

631
00:56:06,504 --> 00:56:07,504
This girl...

632
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:11,104
She really is my daughter?

633
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,314
Mom.

634
00:56:24,225 --> 00:56:26,524
I'm sorry, Eun Ki.

635
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,164
I'm...

636
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:35,265
- I'm sorry. - Mom, what are you talking about?

637
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:19,274
Hey, Jo Eun Ki.

638
00:57:20,515 --> 00:57:21,785
You really had no idea?

639
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:27,354
Crazy Dog raped Jo In Sook. That's the story behind your birth.

640
00:57:55,914 --> 00:57:56,945
What? Come on.

641
00:58:00,055 --> 00:58:01,385
Seriously, no one knew?

642
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:09,765
You folks are no fun.

643
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:21,905
Yoon Jae! I'm sorry.

644
00:58:21,905 --> 00:58:25,175
So please, let me get out.

645
00:58:25,175 --> 00:58:27,414
Okay, Yoon Jae? I'm sorry.

646
00:58:29,515 --> 00:58:30,914
I'm sorry.

647
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:35,285
Don't kill me, please!

648
00:58:40,294 --> 00:58:41,325
Oh, boy.

649
00:58:46,465 --> 00:58:47,765
(Hope Welfare Center)

650
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:11,695
There he is. Ryu Sung Jun.

651
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:17,495
Let us out! Hello? Anybody around?

652
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:19,734
Open the door, please!

653
00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:22,704
We're... Darn it.

654
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,044
- My goodness. - Mom.

655
00:59:31,745 --> 00:59:32,745
What should we do?

656
00:59:34,615 --> 00:59:36,445
Sung Jun!

657
00:59:36,684 --> 00:59:37,885
Hey, what are you waiting for?

658
00:59:37,885 --> 00:59:40,184
Let us out before the bomb goes off!

659
00:59:40,184 --> 00:59:41,285
Sung Jun, run!

660
00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:43,725
Get out of here. The bomb will go off any second now.

661
00:59:44,024 --> 00:59:45,195
Run, now!

662
00:59:51,365 --> 00:59:53,434
Hey, Ryu Sung Jun. What took you so long?

663
00:59:56,504 --> 00:59:58,604
I was very close to killing the others first.

664
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:04,845
Jung Yoon Jae.

665
01:00:05,015 --> 01:00:07,675
Do you think nothing will happen to you if you kill everyone here?

666
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:12,454
I'm not killing people here.

667
01:00:13,684 --> 01:00:15,024
I'm just playing by the rules.

668
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:22,624
All right, then. The fiery pit is waiting for you all.

669
01:00:24,064 --> 01:00:25,064
Goodbye.

670
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:28,604
Mom!

671
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:35,475
- No! - Gosh!

672
01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:46,385
What?

673
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:51,254
What's wrong with this?

674
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:53,325
What is going on?

675
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:16,745
Hey.

676
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:33,195
I caught you, Jung Yoon Jae.

677
01:02:45,635 --> 01:02:46,975
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

678
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,234
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

679
01:02:48,234 --> 01:02:49,544
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

680
01:02:49,544 --> 01:02:50,874
(but with doubles and dummies.)

681
01:03:10,524 --> 01:03:14,334
(Blind)

682
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:17,434
- It was all you, right? - Do you have evidence?

683
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:20,334
All the data on Jung Yoon Jae's laptop and phone are gone.

684
01:03:21,704 --> 01:03:23,274
You didn't betray me, right?

685
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:25,845
I'm asking you to explain what it means.

686
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:26,845
The playground.

687
01:03:28,745 --> 01:03:31,814
Do you still not know who made you like that?

688
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:35,655
You mean he's regained all his lost memories?

689
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:39,195
Be honest.

690
01:03:39,495 --> 01:03:41,865
I bet you're afraid of finding out the truth.
