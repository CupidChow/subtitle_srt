00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:25,674
Yu Na, let's eat.

169
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,842
(Bam)

170
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:30,283
Yu Na, put that down and eat.

171
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:38,592
Don't you think you should treat me a bit nicer?

172
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,694
Are you claiming bragging rights because you looked after me?

173
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,063
I didn't ask you to sleep here.

174
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:46,562
Do you know how much a guardian is needed around here?

175
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:48,964
A hospital is where you feel worst if you have no one with you.

176
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,803
The one with the most power here is the guardian,

177
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:53,443
so don't fight me.

178
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,143
Eat up so I can go to work.

179
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:57,013
You're such a nag.

180
00:19:57,644 --> 00:19:59,414
Are all women over 30 like you?

181
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,414
I hope I die in my 20s.

182
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:03,552
Hey!

183
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:06,522
What kind of guardian hits a patient?

184
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,224
You deserved it.

185
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,523
Also, I'm not yet 30.

186
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,523
No way. You're in your 20s?

187
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:17,332
Why do you look so old?

188
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,694
- Watch it. - Neener.

189
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:21,403
That's how it's going to be? Come over here.

190
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,873
- I'll teach you a lesson. - No, don't.

191
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,803
- You should eat... - Detective, save me.

192
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,743
It's not what it looks like.

193
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:33,444
You made me look bad.

194
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:38,684
Is that true?

195
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,793
Yes. I rushed over to tell you as soon as I got the results.

196
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:45,194
I'll pass it on to him right away.

197
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:46,993
Detective Ryu will be so pleased.

198
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:49,023
I have to go.

199
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:51,763
(Admission, Payment)

200
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,463
(Explanation of Test Results)

201
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,532
(Theoretical background of DNA testing)

202
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,272
(Explanation of test results)

203
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,974
(Sample 1 and Sample 2 are a 99.99 percent match.)

204
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:13,624
Detective Kang.

205
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:15,654
Come here.

206
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:22,934
You hid the report from the NFS?

207
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:28,864
The DNA found under Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail.

208
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:33,803
It was identified.

209
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:40,582
(Explanation of test results)

210
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,913
(DNA from victim Yeom's fingernail compared...)

211
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,283
(to DNA from suspect Choi's toothbrush.)

212
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,653
Detective Kim took Mr. Choi's DNA sample...

213
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:50,194
to the NFS so the result is undeniable.

214
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,964
Now it's time for you to explain.

215
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,863
Why did you hide the fact that DNA that wasn't Sung Jun's...

216
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,303
was found under Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail?

217
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,833
Why?

218
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,073
I can't work with people beneath me.

219
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,174
What?

220
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:08,374
Do you need me to explain that to you?

221
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:09,573
Hey, you.

222
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,974
Will you stop crossing the line?

223
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,944
Have you forgotten what the most incriminating piece of evidence...

224
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:17,914
in Baek Ji Eun's murder is?

225
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,653
Jung Man Chun's knife with Baek Ji Eun's blood on it.

226
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:22,184
What happened to Jung Man Chun?

227
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,124
The same thing just happened.

228
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:27,193
Choi Soon Gil's DNA was found under Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail.

229
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,093
And look what happened to him!

230
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:32,934
So you went and hid a clue?

231
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,733
Do you think you're investigating while we're just fooling around?

232
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,542
Do you think we're slacking off to save Sung Jun's skin?

233
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:41,302
- Are you not? - What?

234
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:43,543
If you're right and Ryu Sung Jun's innocent,

235
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:47,513
who do you think killed Mr. Choi?

236
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:50,253
You...

237
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,394
Mr. An Tae Ho?

238
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:58,224
Why are you here?

239
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:00,593
I'm turning myself in.

240
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:06,634
Choi Soon Gil. I killed him.

241
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:12,533
(Ryu Sung Hoon)

242
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:19,013
(Why?)

243
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,423
(Choi Soon Gil murdered)

244
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:29,183
(An Tae Ho, Number 7)

245
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,993
(Assaulted Choi Soon Gil, Resides in a container)

246
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:32,964
Right.

247
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:35,723
(Choi Soon Gil murdered)

248
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,394
(Ryu Sung Hoon, Why?)

249
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,263
They weren't after Sung Hoon.

250
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:42,262
They were after An Tae Ho.

251
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:43,403
(Ryu Sung Hoon, Why?)

252
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:44,572
(Choi Soon Gil, An Tae Ho)

253
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:46,374
These three are connected somehow.

254
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,904
But how?

255
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,123
(Recording 001)

256
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:03,793
Number 24.

257
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:05,293
Number 24?

258
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:13,033
Are you causing all this trouble because of Number 24?

259
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,533
What's up with you?

260
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,773
Let's be honest. That kid died because of you.

261
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:22,604
If you didn't rat him out,

262
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:25,444
that kid wouldn't have died.

263
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,614
Darn it.

264
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,733
Mr. An. Why did you do it?

265
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:48,703
Who cares about the reason?

266
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:52,272
We need to know the motive to know if it was accidental or not.

267
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:55,174
So what if it was accidental or premeditated?

268
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,714
I killed him.

269
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:01,414
Quit wasting your energy and indict me.

270
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:08,124
Choi Soon Gil.

271
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:10,424
He isn't dead yet.

272
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,533
He's not dead?

273
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:21,333
The punk...

274
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,634
is still alive, is that it?

275
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:32,043
No, that makes no sense.

276
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,714
Why is he still alive?

277
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:37,553
Choi Soon Gil.

278
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,983
He should not, cannot be alive.

279
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,954
He must not be allowed to live!

280
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:48,964
He should've died 100 times over!

281
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,002
Where is he? Where is he right now?

282
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:55,033
- Get in there. - Darn it.

283
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:57,833
Where is he?

284
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:00,273
- Let go of me! - Relax!

285
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,542
I'll kill him!

286
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:04,714
An Tae Ho's working with Yoon Jae.

287
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:07,783
He'll know where Yoon Jae is.

288
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:17,093
Detective Ryu.

289
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,724
Detective Ryu. Wake up.

290
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:31,733
Can you sit up?

291
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:42,143
What happened? Why are you on the floor?

292
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,384
I suddenly got a splitting headache.

293
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:47,924
Then my memory...

294
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,194
Does it happen often?

295
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:56,694
Well, sometimes.

296
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,493
I'll be fine.

297
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,733
I met Seok Gu at the hospital.

298
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:08,974
They found Mr. Choi's DNA under Hye Jin's fingernail.

299
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:13,783
Oh... I see.

300
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:18,114
Why the long face? I thought you'd be pleased.

301
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:21,124
Sung Hoon said...

302
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:23,454
evidence found by the suspect...

303
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:25,753
was tainted evidence.

304
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:30,934
Yeom Hye Jin's fingernail. I found that on my own.

305
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:36,333
In a park without anyone else. I was alone.

306
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:39,704
Tainted evidence...

307
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,474
Clearing yourself of murder.

308
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:46,513
I expected it to be hard, but it really isn't easy.

309
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,322
Didn't you just hear a door open?

310
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:57,354
Was I mistaken?

311
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,904
(Recording 001)

312
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:22,243
(Recording 001)

313
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,154
It's from Mr. Choi's recording.

314
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:30,793
(Recording 001)

315
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:52,644
Mr. Choi Soon Gil.

316
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:54,684
Do you recognize me?

317
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,384
It's not just Manager An.

318
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:04,954
Someone else came in.

319
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:13,093
I heard the recording that you hid.

320
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:17,802
About 35 minutes after Manager An...

321
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,144
hit you with a bottle of alcohol,

322
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:23,543
someone else came into to your home. Right?

323
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:57,914
Darn, that little rat.

324
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:03,983
That person saw you were still alive and hit you across the head again...

325
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:06,553
with a glass bottle.

326
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:09,083
Did you see that person?

327
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:44,373
Ryu Sung Hoon?

328
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:03,193
Choi Soon Gil.

329
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:09,603
There's also talk that you heard the killer's voice.

330
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:12,232
Sung Jun said he was framed.

331
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,853
Can you trust me just this once?

332
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,452
I believe I'm the best candidate...

333
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,552
for the Minister of Health and Welfare.

334
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:30,453
The president will withdraw his nomination...

335
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,592
upon his return from his overseas tour.

336
00:32:57,913 --> 00:32:58,913
Why?

337
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:00,952
Why?

338
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:02,923
Why?

339
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,072
What do you want?

340
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:25,442
- Hurry up and talk? - Where is that punk?

341
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:30,212
What?

342
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:32,752
I know you hid him.

343
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:35,452
Yoon Jae. Where is that punk?

344
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:37,753
Who is Yoon Jae, and why are you acting like this?

345
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:39,253
Get lost.

346
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:43,492
I doubt you're covering for him because he's your kid.

347
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:45,832
Were you afraid...

348
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,703
of ruining your reputation once you showed your true colors?

349
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:52,071
If you adopted him while acting like good people,

350
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,042
you should've raised him right. Not as a serial murderer!

351
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:57,672
Adopt? What are you talking about?

352
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:00,543
I gave birth to all my sons.

353
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:04,253
Of course.

354
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:06,652
This is who Na Guk Hee really is.

355
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:10,692
You might be able to fool other people, but not me.

356
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:14,322
If you don't give me Yoon Jae,

357
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:17,933
your son, whom you cherish so dearly, will get hurt.

358
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,203
How dare...

359
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:29,373
a piece of trash like you blackmail me?

360
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:34,442
Honey.

361
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:36,683
Oh, my.

362
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:43,623
- Who is that man? - Oh, a reporter.

363
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,453
I managed to get away from him, but he's back. What a leech.

364
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:49,922
You don't need to worry. Let's go inside.

(Autopsy Report)

366
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:00,542
There was a fracture in his skull,

367
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:02,143
and I found an epidural hemorrhage.

368
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:05,312
His skull filled with blood and put pressure on his brain,

369
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:06,672
and he died from respiratory distress.

370
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:09,482
How many times was he hit in the head with a soju bottle?

371
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,313
He was hit a total of two times.

372
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:15,652
(Cerebral Fracture X-ray)

373
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:18,453
- Are you sure it was two times? - Yes.

374
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,123
You can see the lines of his fracture here.

375
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:25,563
Multiple lines can't form from being hit just once.

376
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:29,262
The long fracture was made when he was hit the first time,

377
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,301
and the short fractures underneath...

378
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:33,132
were made when he was hit a second time.

379
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:36,772
Seeing as to how the blood dried differently,

380
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:38,643
he wasn't hit twice in one attack.

381
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:41,942
There was some time between the two attacks.

382
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:55,623
(A 3rd person)

383
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,862
Ultimately, this means a third person killed Mr. Choi.

384
00:36:01,802 --> 00:36:03,103
A third person...

385
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,572
Who could it be?

386
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:08,373
Number 13.

387
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,712
"Number 13?"

388
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:15,043
You keep referring to people by numbers.

389
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:17,552
What is all of this?

390
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:19,712
I don't know either.

391
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,152
I heard it when I went to see Mr. Choi today.

392
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:23,892
He said...

393
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:26,692
the person who came after Manager An left was Number 13.

394
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,192
Really?

395
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:36,032
Mr. Choi really said Number 13?

396
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:39,873
Why? Do you know who that is?

397
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:41,942
No.

398
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:45,212
It's not someone I know.

399
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,612
It's just odd.

400
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:55,483
I know. They call people by numbers instead of their names.

401
00:36:56,683 --> 00:36:58,893
Did he say anything else other than Number 13?

402
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:01,563
No.

403
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:05,262
Mr. Choi just said Number 13.

Let him go.

409
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:29,422
- Sir? - You said he wasn't the murderer.

410
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:30,692
Let him go.

411
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,192
As I wrote in the investigation report,

412
00:37:33,623 --> 00:37:36,062
it's true that An Tae Ho initially assaulted the victim,

413
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:37,393
so that means he can be charged with assault and battery.

414

Do you think I can't read?

415

What is up with you these days?

416

Don't think of raising your arrest rates with these small fries.

Bring me the actual culprit. The real killer, Ryu Sung Jun!

418
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,612
Detective Kang said he saw...

419
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:01,683
Ryu Sung Jun's motorcycle outside Mr. Choi's house.

420
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:04,223
Ryu Sung Jun must have killed Mr. Choi as well.

421
00:38:04,793 --> 00:38:05,793
Chief, is there...

422

some kind of other evidence on Sung Jun that I don't know about?

Hey!

Yoon Jae...

00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:01,703
You haven't had alcohol in a while, right?

434
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:23,262
There's something I've learned while working at a children's center.

435
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:27,362
Most of the kids that come here have wounded hearts.

436
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,603
They don't express their feelings very much.

437
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,672
Since I've been spending lots of time with these kids,

438
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:36,902
I could see it a little.

439
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:39,973
Right.

440
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,313
That kid is smiling but probably crying on the inside.

441
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:51,192
Right. That kid is really lonely right now.

442
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:58,733
Right. This kid is lying right now.

443
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:04,802
You know who Number 13 is, don't you?

444
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:15,683
You do know.

445
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,353
Then why?

446
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,712
Is it hard to say?

447
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:39,603
I got into an accident when I was seven years old.

448
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:46,313
I lost my memory back then.

449
00:41:49,212 --> 00:41:51,552
I don't remember anything else.

450
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:56,183
But somehow I remember my name from before I was adopted.

451
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,123
And my number too.

452
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:02,723
Number 13.

453
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:04,933
Jung Yoon Jae.

454
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:12,433
That's me.

You're Number 13?

456
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:20,543
I don't know why Mr. Choi mentioned Number 13,

457
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:22,242
but it really isn't me.

458
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:28,552
Why?

459
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,652
Does it look like I'm lying?

460
00:42:32,523 --> 00:42:35,063
No, it doesn't seem like you're lying.

461
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,433
It just looks like you're having a tough time.

462
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:52,813
Sometimes, I have nightmares.

463
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:54,612
But I'm not sure...

464
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:57,313
if they're dreams or memories.

465
00:42:58,583 --> 00:42:59,652
You mean the horror ending?

466
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:05,753
In the dream,

467
00:43:07,023 --> 00:43:08,092
I'm Number 13 too.

468
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:40,523
Do you still not know?

469
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:43,663
I told you.

470
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:47,532
Since I left...

471
00:43:48,302 --> 00:43:50,802
the welfare center 20 years ago,

472
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:55,072
I haven't seen Yoon Jae!

473
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:06,612
If you say where Yoon Jae is,

474
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:08,753
you get to live.

475
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:11,453
Number seven,

476
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:14,163
you're a good kid.

477
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:24,572
Are you smiling?

478
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:30,473
Crazy Dog.

479
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:36,442
You said the same thing 20 years ago.

480
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:40,882
You said you'd let me go if I betrayed my friends.

481
00:44:43,953 --> 00:44:45,552
You'll be okay.

482
00:44:46,123 --> 00:44:47,253
You're a good kid.

483
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:51,433
Will you...

484
00:44:53,262 --> 00:44:55,362
let me go then?

485
00:44:55,962 --> 00:44:57,801
Yes, of course.

486
00:44:57,802 --> 00:45:00,003
I fell for those sweet words...

487
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:03,842
that I ended up betraying my friends.

488
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:08,183
My friends who were like family to me!

489
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,092
Hey, Crazy Dog.

490
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:22,822
Even if I knew...

491
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:26,632
where Yoon Jae was,

492
00:45:27,703 --> 00:45:30,103
I wouldn't tell a guy like you.

493
00:45:31,132 --> 00:45:32,172
Got that?

494
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:43,543
You fool.

495
00:45:45,782 --> 00:45:46,782
Bury him.

496
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,592
That's good. Get out of there.

497
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,282
Ma'am!

498
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:47,210
Ma'am, please help me.

499
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:48,211
Ma'am!

500
00:47:57,122 --> 00:47:58,162
Oh, dear.

00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:03,091
Gosh, is it because I'm going through menopause?

502
00:48:03,762 --> 00:48:07,032
I get cold flashes and keep seeing things.

503
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:13,302
Oh, boy.

504
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:27,122
Gosh!

505
00:48:51,182 --> 00:48:53,082
- Are you going somewhere? - Yes, a wedding.

506
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:55,552
Mr. Kang's daughter is getting married today.

507
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:57,682
He invited all the jurors.

508
00:48:58,622 --> 00:49:00,052
I brought lunch.

509
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:02,852
Oh, no. I was just about to head out too.

510
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:04,461
Where are you going?

511
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:06,361
I'm stepping out to meet Manager An.

512
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:09,332
I think our pasts are intertwined somehow.

513
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:12,432
I want to meet him and ask him what he knows about me.

514
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:18,041
Does Judge Ryu know that you're planning to meet him today?

515
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:29,952
(Brother)

516
00:49:32,782 --> 00:49:34,082
(Brother)

517
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:43,261
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

518
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:44,532
Extra charges may apply...

519
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:48,032
Hey, I tried calling you.

520
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:50,001
Don't blame me later.

521
00:50:57,072 --> 00:50:58,901
(Spring Light)

522
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:03,072
(Wedding Invitation, Choi Hyun Sik and Kang Ha Na)

523
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,481
(Wedding Invitation, Choi Hyun Sik and Kang Ha Na)

524
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,421
(Groom Choi Hyun Sik, Bride Kang Ha Na)

525
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:17,822
(You are cordially invited.)

526
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,392
Mr. Kang's daughter is getting married today.

527
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:23,432
He invited all the jurors.

528
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:27,532
(Bride Kang Ha Na, eldest daughter of Kang Young Ki and Kim Ok Rim)

529
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:32,901
- Hey, you made it! - My gosh!

530
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:38,681
Where is the bride?

531
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:39,881
They're the groom's parents.

532
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:50,250
Well, shouldn't we take some pictures...

533
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:52,161
so he'd remember that we were here?

534
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:53,991
Gosh, forget it.

535
00:51:53,992 --> 00:51:55,662
He saw us, so it's all good.

536
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:57,860
We're neither his relatives...

537
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,832
nor his co-workers.

538
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:02,670
Oh, boy.

539
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:05,040
It must've been a lot of work for Mr. Kang to plan all this.

540
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,102
Let's eat.

541
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,151
Excuse me. I have to go to the men's room.

542
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:27,992
Yes, eat as much as you want.

543
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:42,841
Where is he?

544
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:51,750
Detective Ryu.

545
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,122
I think I just saw Manager An. I followed him out,

546
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,992
but I think I lost him.

547
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:57,920
It must be him.

548
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,960
Why do you think he came here?

549
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:01,432
I'm not sure,

550
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:03,461
but he's certainly not there to congratulate them.

551
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:07,731
I found the invitation at his place, but there's blood all over it.

552
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:10,170
I'll come now.

553
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:12,840
Make sure you're surrounded by people until I get there.

554
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:14,302
We have no idea what he'd do.

555
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:16,671
Okay, be careful.

556
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:28,891
I'll take it now.

557
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:30,552
One, two, three!

558
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:33,321
- Thanks. - Hey.

559
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:35,230
- You look so stunning today. - Oh, stop.

560
00:53:35,231 --> 00:53:36,361
- You really do. - You look gorgeous.

561
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:40,401
- Congratulations. - One, two...

562
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:42,202
There.

563
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:58,751
- I'll take it now. - There he is.

564
00:53:58,881 --> 00:54:00,121
- One, two. - Congratulations.

565
00:54:00,122 --> 00:54:02,221
- My gosh, thank you. - Congratulations.

566
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:03,391
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

567
00:54:03,392 --> 00:54:04,452
- You've been well, right? - Yes.

568
00:54:17,202 --> 00:54:19,972
Why aren't you eating? Do you not like the food?

569
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,512
No, it's not that.

570
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:26,082
I keep thinking about Mr. Choi. He died just a few days ago.

571
00:54:26,381 --> 00:54:27,981
I have no appetite right now.

572
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:31,822
Is that why I saw blood?

573
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:34,791
Gosh, no.

574
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:39,061
Blood? Where?

575
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:44,662
This morning,

576
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:47,162
I woke up from a bizarre dream...

577
00:54:47,302 --> 00:54:51,642
and saw that my water bowl was filled with blood.

578
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:56,341
- Goodness. - Pardon my reach.

579
00:54:57,872 --> 00:54:59,012
I'm good.

580
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:02,381
I drank too much last night.

581
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:04,481
- I think we're good. - Okay.

582
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:21,001
Did anyone here send the invitation to Manager An?

583
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,072
I didn't.

584
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,242
Why? Is Manager An coming?

585
00:55:28,611 --> 00:55:30,111
No, I was just curious.

586
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,151
May I have your attention, please?

587
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:42,150
I'm Kang Young Ki,

588
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:43,322
the father of the bride.

589
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:54,261
I sincerely thank you all for taking time...

590
00:55:54,262 --> 00:55:57,931
out of your busy schedule to join us on this special day.

591
00:55:57,932 --> 00:55:58,941
Thank you.

592
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:04,440
I guess...

593
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:08,581
it's taking a while for Ha Na to change into her wedding dress.

594
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:12,081
The truth is, my wife needs about an hour...

595
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:15,392
just to put on her makeup whenever she's going out.

596
00:56:17,122 --> 00:56:19,762
I suppose Ha Na takes after her mother.

597
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:22,960
Hyun Sik, I hope you're prepared to put up with this.

598
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:24,032
Yes, Father.

599
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:25,631
Gosh, honey!

600
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:30,400
While she's busy putting on her dress,

601
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:32,972
I'd like to give a little speech.

602
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:39,012
Ha Na is my only child.

603
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:45,282
When Ha Na was young,

604
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:49,452
I worked for a food company in their sales department.

605
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:52,521
The job was so stressful and intense...

606
00:56:52,822 --> 00:56:57,432
that I often wanted to just quit and walk out on them.

607
00:56:57,932 --> 00:56:59,432
But whenever I had that urge,

608
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:02,901
I thought of Ha Na and calmed myself down.

609
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:06,102
Looking back now,

610
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:08,642
I realize that I didn't really raise Ha Na.

611
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:11,242
Rather, she helped me grow.

612
00:57:13,611 --> 00:57:16,711
Let's raise our glasses to my dear daughter Ha Na...

613
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:18,751
and her happy future.

614
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:20,822
Let's all raise our glasses.

615
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:31,560
Here's to Ha Na's happy future!

616
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:32,961
- Cheers! - Cheers!

617
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:54,821
- Oh, no! - What's going on?

618
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:56,392
- My gosh. - What happened?

619
00:58:03,492 --> 00:58:04,492
Mr. Kang, are you all right?

620
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:06,262
Can someone call 911?

621
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:07,761
Mr. Kang!

622
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:09,901
- Oh, no. - Mr. Kang!

623
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:11,102
- Mr. Kang. - Are you okay?

624
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:16,642
They're here.

625
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:26,552
What's going on?

626
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,051
Sorry, coming through!

627
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:32,391
- My gosh! - Oh, no.

628
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:34,861
- Mr. Kang! - Make way!

629
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:37,761
What happened?

630
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:39,162
- My gosh. - What happened to him?

631
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,231
- Oh, dear. - Did he faint?

632
00:58:42,372 --> 00:58:43,472
- Gosh. - This is insane.

633
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:47,642
I can't believe this. What do we do?

634
00:58:52,182 --> 00:58:54,642
- What should we do? - What happened?

635
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:19,901
Sung Hoon?

636
00:59:40,492 --> 00:59:42,591
Ms. Kang!

637
00:59:51,032 --> 00:59:52,472
- No! - My gosh!

638
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:55,141
- Oh, gosh. - Ha Na!

639
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:56,142
Ha Na...

640
00:59:57,512 --> 01:00:00,011
- No! - My gosh.

641
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:01,912
- What do we do? - Ha Na!

642
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:03,512
Ha Na!

643
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:04,711
Ha Na...

644
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:13,461
Ha Na.

645
01:00:13,492 --> 01:00:15,061
- What happened? - No...

646
01:00:15,162 --> 01:00:18,730
- Ha Na! - What happened to her?

647
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,231
- My gosh! - What do we do?

648
01:01:35,341 --> 01:01:36,670
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

649
01:01:36,671 --> 01:01:38,141
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

650
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:39,411
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

651
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:40,611
(but with doubles and dummies.)

652
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:06,171
(Blind)

653
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:09,541
An Tae Ho is connected to this case.

654
01:02:10,211 --> 01:02:11,311
Where is An Tae Ho now?

655
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:14,142
Is there something you know about this case?

656
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:18,520
To the killer, this is like a game.

657
01:02:18,521 --> 01:02:21,852
Can't we catch the killer by tracing the IP address?

658
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:24,892
An Tae Ho will die if you keep barking up the wrong tree.

659
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:26,722
I've seen this before.

660
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:28,731
Where was I adopted from?

661
01:02:29,532 --> 01:02:31,832
I'm really sorry.

662
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:33,702
What are these memories?
