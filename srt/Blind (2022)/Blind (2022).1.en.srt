How was it this time?

91
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:08,606
How do you think it was like?

92
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:10,876
I'll see if there are any cameras.

93

How is there not a single camera?

If not for the dog, we'd never have found the body.

95
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,106
How did they find such a place?

96
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,106
Isn't it usually a spot the perp knows well or has been to before?

97
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,146
Usually, yes.

If you roll a body in a bag from that height,

101
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:04,955
there's no way it lands sitting up.

102
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:06,656
It will land on the side...

103
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:09,096
or earn a few scratches or fractures on the way down.

104
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,965
If they were going to discard it like trash,

105
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:16,666
why did they carry all that weight down there to place it carefully?

Hey.

112
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:51,796
The insides of her arms and knees are bruised.

113
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,735
There are no scratch marks,

114
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,366
so I think she was tied to a smooth pole or stick.

115
00:19:58,366 --> 00:19:59,376
A smooth pole?

116
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:03,376
What about the cuts by her mouth?

117
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,245
No marks of hesitation and the cuts are clean.

118
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,015
It was done in one swipe.

119
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:11,646
The weapon moved from the corner of the mouth outward,

120
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:14,886
and the cuts are 5cm each.

121
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,425
They're exact, as if they were measured.

122
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,455
They painted a picture with great effort?

123
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,556
Oh, and look at this.

124
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,435
What do you see?

125
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,465
Flesh.

126
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,106
It's not cut through and through.

127
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:36,346
The cuts are very shallow, just 5mm deep.

128
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:39,416
I bet it was to avoid the cheekbones and arteries.

129
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,745
Even after death, if you cut an artery,

130
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:43,086
there'd be lots of blood.

But because of a text she'd sent,

That she'd be home late and they shouldn't wait up.

the phone was near her home when the text was sent.

Did you see this woman in the alleyway?

173
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:05,985
I don't know.

174
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,316
Darn it.

175
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,826
Yes.

176
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,695
After celebrating Ji Eun's birthday at the club,

177
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,525
we parted at around 10pm.

178
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:21,166
But 10pm is when clubs really get going.

179
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:22,666
Why did you leave so early?

180
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,366
We wanted to stay longer.

181
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:27,136
But there was this lunatic who was a VIP.

182
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:31,675
His eyes were out of focus, like he was high on something.

183
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,416
He kept trying to force Ji Eun to drink alcohol.

184
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,245
She refused,

185
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:39,556
and he put a knife to her face and yelled.

186
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:40,816
Who was that lunatic?

187
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,056
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

188
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,425
What? Are you bored?

189
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:54,836
Get off me.

190
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:03,205
Let's see...

191
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:16,126
Drink. It's something nice.

192
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,025
It's a killer.

193
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:22,495
As if it's a killer. You psycho.

194
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:28,935
Are you a party of two?

195
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:40,175
Drink it.

196
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:41,945
Try it.

197
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:43,816
Drink.

198
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:47,416
Gosh. Everything you do is so lame. I can't stand it anymore.

199
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:49,056
You can have the good stuff all to yourself,

200
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,455
you junkie.

201
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:52,025
Guys, let's go.

202
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:58,666
I like everything about you,

203
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:03,005
but your mouth is too small.

204
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:05,705
Want me to fix it for you?

205
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:21,185
- Who are you? - This is who I am.

207
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:29,096
Darn it. You stupid pig.

208
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:30,765
Wait right here.

209
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,566
You little brat.

210
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:37,705
You rude wench! How dare you reject me?

211
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:40,005
- Do you want to die? - Darn it!

212
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:55,455

What's this? I caught you red-handed, you punk.

217
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,616
Hey.

218
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,116
Hey. Where are you going?

219
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:26,816
I'm going to the bathroom.

220
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:28,755
Hey. The bathroom's that way.

221
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:31,785
- Follow me. - Excuse me.

222
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,025
What are you doing?

223
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:44,435
Why are you grabbing her hand and forcing her to follow you?

224
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:45,866
At a police station no less. How bold.

225

(Public Servant ID, Ryu Sung Jun, Mooyoung Police Station)

226
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:58,445
It's not that. I'm sure you had a reason.

227
00:27:58,445 --> 00:27:59,685
Right, Detective Ryu?

228
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:04,455
Who are you?

229
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:06,495
Hello. I'm Kwon Yu Na's guardian.

230
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,626
What's your relationship with her?

231
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,495
- Well... I'm... - What is it to you?

232
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:14,166
My guardian's here, so I can go. Right?

233
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:15,866
Hey.

234
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,205
What is it this time?

235
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:19,935
Listen to me carefully.

236
00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:21,705
If you meet another psycho like today,

237
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:23,975
hit him with your elbow like this.

238
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:26,046
Then for about 15 seconds, he'll be out of it like this.

239
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:28,916
Then take that chance and knee him in the groin.

240
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,386
If that doesn't work,

241
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,985
then use the side of your hand and hit him in the neck.

242
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:34,715
Then knee him in the groin again.

243
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,725
Then he'll be like this.

244
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,685
Hey.

245
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:41,626
Hey, don't forget!

246
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:43,965
But try to avoid hanging out in those places if you can. Okay?

247
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:45,925
Can you tell me what happened to Yu Na?

248
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,735
- Are you really her guardian? - What?

249
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,735
It doesn't seem like she was being taken care of.

250
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:57,546
Something bad almost happened when she met a junkie at a club.

251
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:59,046
Since you're her guardian,

252
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:01,316
you should watch over her well so that this doesn't happen again.

253
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,515
Thank you, sir.

254
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:07,316
Yu Na.

255
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:12,826
Hey, Yu Na.

256
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,965
How did you know I was here?

257
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,096
Why do you want to know? As long as I'm here. Right?

258
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,435
Did you drink?

259
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:29,606
- Do you want to sober up? - Why are you like this to me?

260
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:33,616
My parents and my homeroom teacher don't say anything,

261
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:36,346
so who are you to interfere with my life?

262
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:37,846
You're nothing but a social worker.

263
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:39,015
That's my job.

264
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:41,856
Protecting you although your parents and your teachers gave up on you.

265
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:43,985
Gross.

266
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,556
You still have a long way to go to complete your community service.

267
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:48,195
If you don't want to go to school,

268
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:49,965
don't roam around aimlessly and come to the center.

269
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:52,225
Why don't you stay at a shelter?

270
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:55,195
That sounds good. I'll find out if any shelters have room.

271
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:58,965
You should separate yourself from the crew of runaways too.

272
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:02,376
Do you think I would change if you do this?

273
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,005
I don't know.

274
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:05,945
It's up to you to change or not.

275
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:12,616
Yu Na. Let's get something to eat.

276
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,465
You met this woman...

277
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:31,106
at a club on January 5. Right?

278
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:33,735
Oh, her?

279
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:35,735
I did.

280
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:39,646
I was going to show her a good time,

281
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:42,816
but she kept rejecting me, so I let her go.

282
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,846
- Is that it? - Of course it is.

283
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:52,685
You.

284
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:54,955
You can't stand it when someone looks down on you. Right?

285
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,096
When Baek Ji Eun pushed you away, you got mad. Right?

286
00:30:58,096 --> 00:30:59,225
Were you so mad...

287
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:01,535
that you went after her to kill her?

288
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:03,406
You think I have time for that?

289
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,465
The world is filled with women.

290
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,646
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes?

291
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:15,876
His alibi checked out.

292
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:21,816
You're in trouble now.

293
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:23,225
My dad's really rich.

294
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:26,056
My uncle is a lawyer at a large law firm.

295
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,326
I'm going to put you in prison...

296
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:29,995
for doing this to me.

297
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:42,505
Hey. My dad is a judge.

298
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,076
A Supreme Court judge at that.

(Video Investigation Room)

300
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:03,965
Hey. My brother's a judge too, you punk.

301
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:15,005
It's Judge Ryu.

302
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:17,406
Sir, let's go eat with him.

303
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:19,876
Forget it. Judge Ryu prefers to eat alone.

304
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,346
He doesn't eat with people.

305
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:23,945
"All corruption starts with a meal."

306
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,185
It's Judge Ryu's desperate attempt...

307
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:28,156
to avoid having people ask him for favors about trials.

308
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:31,156
That's why people say he's going to be the future Chief Justice.

309
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:39,066
Sir. Well...

310
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:41,836
You have a guest...

311
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,205
He's the former chief judge...

312
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:47,906
We don't need any tea.

313
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,846
(Judge Ryu Sung Hoon)

314
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:56,245
I was passing by, so I thought we could have some tea.

315
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,586
I'm sorry. I have a meeting with my associate judges soon.

316
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:03,255
Is that so? Then let's have some tea another time.

317
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:04,886
I'll get straight to the point today.

318
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:07,056
I don't know if it's a coincidence or I'm lucky,

319
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,166
but the first case I'm in charge of after opening my firm...

320
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:12,866
was assigned to you.

321
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:21,475
I see. What case is it?

322
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:24,576
It's nothing big. It's drugs.

323
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:28,876
He's a med school student. He's smart, and he's a good kid.

324
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,285
But it seems he couldn't overcome the temptation,

325
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:32,445
and he made a mistake.

326
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:35,386
You know how kids are at that age.

327
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:38,586
Once is a mistake,

328
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:41,025
but after the second time, it's called a habit.

329
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:43,765
The med school student whom you say is a good kid...

330
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:46,535
has already been on probation for dealing and taking drugs.

331
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:49,935
Then he committed the same crime before his probation even ended.

332
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,806
So it's inevitable that he'd get additional punishments.

333
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:54,076
I know that too.

334
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:56,846
But if you were to set the trial date...

335
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:58,606
to after his probation ends...

336
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:00,146
Is there a reason I must do that?

337
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:04,745
Do you know Detective Ryu Sung Jun?

338
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:08,455
He beat up my client and put him in the hospital for five weeks.

339
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,556
He's going on about suing him,

340
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:13,255
but if our talk goes well today, I can make that go away.

341
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:14,626
Sue him.

342
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,765
Isn't Detective Ryu Sung Jun your brother?

343
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:18,925
He is.

344
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,396
If someone did something wrong, even if it's my brother,

345
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:22,396
they should be punished.

346
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,305
If you're going to consider kinship, regionalism,

347
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,606
school ties, and personal connections,

348
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,135
why do we need laws and rules?

349
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:28,905
Do as the law says.

350
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,685
And I'm disappointed in you.

351
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:40,316
You once had a prestigious reputation as a judge,

352
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,756
but you're here trying to strike a deal like this.

353
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:46,185
I will report what happened today to the Office of Administration.

354
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,495
What? "Strike a deal?"

355
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:51,095
Why you...

356
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:57,566
(The citizen's country, Righteous Korea)

357
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:02,336
(Father)

358
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:08,046
Hello, Father.

359
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,416
Hey, Seok Gu. What's for lunch?

360
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,946
We'll be eating Auntie's Soup with Rice.

361
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:15,015
At this rate, I might end up marrying the Auntie.

362
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:16,155
Ryu Sung Jun!

363
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:20,896
I told you to go after a murderer. Why did you arrest the wrong person?

364
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:23,126
He beat up a minor, and he's a junkie...

365
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,166
who habitually uses drugs. Why is he the wrong person?

366
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:26,896
And although he failed,

367
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:29,166
he tried to drug Baek Ji Eun as well.

368
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:30,805
He's a scumbag!

369
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,336
It would've been better if the junkie got to her.

370
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:37,176
Then at least she wouldn't have been so brutally killed!

371
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,245
Chief, that's a bit...

372
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:43,316
Anyway, Ryu Sung Jun. You've been sued for direct assault!

373
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:46,586
Again?

374
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:51,555
So... I'll take good care of Detective Ryu's case again.

375
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,225
Chief. Have you had lunch?

376
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:55,356
Let's go. It's on me today.

377
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:57,365
You like puffer fish stew, don't you?

378
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,966
- Gosh... - It's fine, let it go.

379
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:02,166
What a troublemaker.

380
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:08,435
Hey, Sung Hoon.

381
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:10,305
Hey. Family meeting.

382
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:12,046
Come home by 6:30pm.

383
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:34,196
Gosh, Sung Hoon. I'm investigating a murder case these days,

384
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,466
so I'm super busy.

385
00:36:35,836 --> 00:36:38,205
Can you smooth things over with Mom and Dad for me?

386
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:43,176
So? Are you really not coming?

387
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:45,606
Aren't you a member of this family?

388
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,135
You were looking over like this.

389
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:12,006
- My goodness. - It's so funny. Right, honey?

390
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:13,876
Gosh, cut it out.

391
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:19,905
- Do you have enough? - Hey.

392
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,776
Hey, come and sit.

393
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:24,115
- I'm home. - Hey, what's gotten into you?

394
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,685
You're right on time.

395
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:27,916
Have a seat.

396
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:32,586
Did you get into a fight again?

397
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:38,725
No, this was from taking down a suspect.

398
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:41,995
How nice would it have been if you became a judge like your brother?

399
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:43,506
It's not like anyone can become a judge.

400
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:47,106
- Let's raise our glasses, Dad. - Yes.

401
00:37:47,276 --> 00:37:49,205
Now that our whole family is here,

402
00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:51,506
let's raise our glasses.

403
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:55,245
For Ms. Na Guk Hee, the nominee for Minister of Health and Welfare.

404
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:56,276
For Mom.

405
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:01,986
Congratulations, Mom.

406
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:04,426
I worked really hard.

407
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:08,225
Although, I know you had to go through a lot because of me.

408
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:11,966
Of course he did.

409
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:13,495
Both of us were always working late.

410
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:16,336
And his only brother...

411
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:19,506
was always getting into trouble like an untamed horse.

412
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:24,376
You worked hard looking after this kid, Judge Ryu.

413
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:25,676
It's nothing.

414
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:28,776
But this worries me.

415
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:32,646
I don't think Sung Jun has come to his senses yet.

416
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:34,115
What should we do with him?

417
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:37,586
If you explain this case at the hearing,

418
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:40,095
I'm sure the committee will understand.

419
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,126
Thankfully, the guy who sued Sung Jun...

420
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,865
is getting a lot of hate from the public.

421
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,435
Is that so?

422
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:49,196
He's the defendant in one of my trials.

423
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,435
It's a relief that this case will turn out fine.

424
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:54,035
But if he does this again...

425
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:56,575
Sung Jun.

426
00:38:56,805 --> 00:39:00,115
Just don't do anything and sit still, okay?

427
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:01,776
That's how you can help your mom.

428
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:05,245
Son, please help me out.

429
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:09,356
Let's drink.

430
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:13,026
Here.

431
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:23,736
(Starlight Park, Mooyoung District Court)

432
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,095
Sung Hoon. About that junkie...

433
00:39:48,725 --> 00:39:50,495
I was really going to let it go.

434
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,026
But that punk...

435
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:54,435
beat up a young girl right in front of me.

436
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,765
Would I or wouldn't I lose my cool?

437
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:58,535
You probably know since you saw the records,

438
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:00,106
but I didn't just beat up a random guy.

439
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,705
Do you want to have a drink?

440
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:10,285
Sung Hoon! Are you really mad at me?

441
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:24,865
Ryu Sung Jun. Why did you become a cop?

442
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:27,635
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

443
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:42,975
When we were in school,

444
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:46,916
I was always nervous to see you beating kids up in the alleys.

445
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:50,185
I thought you might end up killing someone at that rate.

446
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:52,986
Sung Jun!

447
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,776
But when you turned yourself around and said you wanted to become a cop,

448
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:10,905
a part of me was surprised while the other part was relieved.

449
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:12,905
I no longer had to worry...

450
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:16,446
that I might have a murderer for a brother.

451
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,916
But today, a thought popped up in my mind.

452
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:22,986
Maybe you became a cop...

453
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:26,055
for a different reason.

454
00:41:27,756 --> 00:41:28,756
What reason?

455
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:34,265
You'd know the answer to that better than me.

456
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:16,703
(Funeral parlor 6)

457
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:27,350
Have you found the culprit?

458
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,390
I'm sorry.

459
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:34,390
Is there perhaps someone who might have a grudge against your daughter?

460
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,600
After my daughter went missing,

461
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,830
I met with almost everyone Ji Eun knew.

462
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,299
My Ji Eun...

463
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,609
There wasn't anyone...

464
00:43:54,149 --> 00:43:55,210
who would kill Ji Eun so brutally.

465
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,250
Then was there anyone who used a knife?

466
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,390
A knife?

467
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:06,259
Yes. The perp is skilled at using...

468
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:08,230
a small, thin blade.

469
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:15,100
I was wondering if your daughter had a boyfriend or anyone in her life...

470
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,699
who used a knife, such as a medical student or a chef.

471
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:22,440
No, there wasn't anyone.

472
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,980
Honey. Could it be him?

473
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,109
- What about Mr. Jung? - Don't talk nonsense.

474
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:32,620
Who is Mr. Jung?

475
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:34,890
I don't know.

476
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,319
My wife...

477
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,819
is still traumatized by what happened.

478
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:41,690
She should get some rest.

479
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:43,830
Let's go inside.

480
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,640
Baek Moon Kang, born in 1964.

481
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:54,969
As for his family, it's just him, his wife, and Baek Ji Eun.

482
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:56,540
Just the three of them.

483
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:00,239
- He served in the special forces. - What does he do now?

484
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,680
He runs a company called Hope Foods.

485
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:04,480
It's located...

486
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,949
Jangmae-dong, 53-1.

487
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,419
Jangmae-dong?

488
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,759
The area where Baek Ji Eun's body was found?

489
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:13,190
Yes. I just checked the map.

490
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,989
Her body was found about 2km away...

491
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:17,600
from her father's company.

492
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,339
(Hope Foods)

493
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,020
A small, sharp double-edged knife.

494
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,660
A single decisive stroke that shows no hesitation.

495
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:20,629
Sometimes, it goes in deep. Sometimes, it's shallow.

496
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:22,390
They're precisely removing the meat...

497
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,629
without touching the bones at all.

498
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:28,870
Our knifeman must be someone who works here.

499
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,390
Excuse me?

500
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,040
I'm looking for someone.

501
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,540
You have an employee who goes by the name of Mr. Jung, right?

502
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,980
- No, we do not. - That's odd.

503
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,020
I heard he worked here.

504
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,710
Maybe it's a different company.

505
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,410
Sorry about that. Have a good day.

506
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:47,279
Gosh, it's cold in here.

507
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:54,919
(Hope Foods)

508
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,390
(Hope Foods)

509
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,949
Hey, it's me.

510
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,810
A detective came by looking for you.

511
00:48:24,879 --> 00:48:27,379
No, he didn't say much.

512
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:29,190
He asked if "Mr. Jung" worked here.

513
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:33,419
No.

514
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:36,129
Well, I am working on it,

515
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,000
but it's not easy.

516
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:42,669
Right, I'll get it ready soon and call you.

517
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,239
All right.

518
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,980
My gosh.

519
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,509
Well...

520
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,719
Hello.

521
00:48:58,279 --> 00:48:59,449
What is it?

522
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:03,049
There must've been some misunderstanding.

523
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,790
Look.

524
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:10,589
- Man Chun? - No, that's just my friend.

525
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:11,859
Jung Man Chun?

526
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,960
Hold on. Could it be this one?

527
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:17,430
- No, I don't think so. - Right? My gosh.

528
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,140
My eyes hurt so much.

529
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,879
Captain.

530
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,750
We found a witness near the spot where Baek Ji Eun went missing.

531
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:43,259
(Dashcam Footage)

532
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,660
You sure are a Police University graduate.

533
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:09,489
This is Jung Man Chun, right?

534
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,790
No.

535
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,960
It is him. Your friend, Man Chun.

536
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,489
Jung Man Chun.

537
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:21,930
- Where is he now? - I don't know.

538
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,739
I really don't know.

539
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:26,500
Let me see your ID.

540
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,410
Oh, my ID...

541
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,210
Look, mister.

542
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:36,049
You're here illegally, aren't you?

543
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,819
You are an illegal alien.

544
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,219
Why are you doing this to me?

545
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Mister.

546
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:49,129
Jung Man Chun is a murder suspect.

547
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,930
If you keep your mouth shut to protect him,

548
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,859
you'll go to jail for hiding a criminal.

549
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,339
So tell me.

550
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,009
- You must know where he is. - He's...

551
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,279
Over there.

552
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,140
Darn it.

553
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:19,419
Seeing blood makes you laugh? You're too gutsy for your own good.

554
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:46,339
Darn it.

555
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:49,940
Jung Man Chun.

556
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,779
You are under arrest for the murder of Baek Ji Eun.

557
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,180
- What? - You have the right to an attorney.

558
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,419
You will be given a chance to explain yourself.

559
00:53:58,419 --> 00:53:59,750
And this really annoys me, but you may...

560
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,719
request the court to review the legality of the arrest.

561
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,419
I didn't kill anyone.

562
00:54:04,419 --> 00:54:06,259
I told you that you'll be given a chance to explain yourself!

563
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:08,330
(January 18, 2022)

564
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,160
(Suspect of Baek Ji Eun's murder, Jung Man Chun arrested)

565
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:23,609
Hey, hurry up.

566
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,879
- Hey, put him in the car. - Stay still.

567
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:32,919
Hey, come here. What's with the blood?

568
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:34,850
You fool.

569
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,819
Did you mess with someone who had a knife?

570
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,819
What did I tell you?

571
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,460
The perp can be caught tomorrow,

572
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,060
but tomorrow will never come if you die today. I told you!

573
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,399
- I won't die. - You little...

574
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:47,359
I'll live until I go senile, so don't worry.

575
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,100
Hurry up and get in the car. Hey, take him.

576
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,129
Take him.

577
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,669
- Hey! - Come here, you scumbag.

578
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:53,399
My goodness.

579
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,080
- Get in the car, you jerk. - Darn you...

580
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:01,910
- You little... - Hey, head down.

581
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,410
I said, down!

582
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,460
Oh, boy. This is nuts.

583
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,339
How did it go? Has he confessed?

584
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,549
No, not yet.

585
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,949
Still?

586
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:39,379
What the heck.

587
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,649
Look, Jung Man Chun.

588
00:55:43,819 --> 00:55:47,290
How much longer will you deny everything?

589
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,230
What did I even do?

590
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,399
We have solid evidence that you killed Baek Ji Eun.

591
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:54,230
How dare you keep playing dumb?

592
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,230
Evidence?

593
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:01,410
Do you think you can mess with me because I'm Korean-Chinese?

594
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:05,580
Do you think you can just pin the murder on me?

595
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,879
I told you that I did not kill Baek Ji Eun!

596
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,960
I have nothing else to say.

597
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,830
Take me to court.

598
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,699
(Murder, desecration, and concealment of body, Jung Man Chun)

599
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,710
Yes.

600
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,949
(Judge Ryu Sung Hoon)

601
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:46,180
Sir, Jung Man Chun...

602
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,350
submitted this request.

603
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,390
(Request for Jury Trial, Jung Man Chun)

604
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:55,330
Will you grant his request?

605
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,489
Is there a reason I should not?

606
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:00,899
No, it's not that. But when I see violent criminals...

607
00:57:00,899 --> 00:57:04,270
using jury trials to earn sympathy votes, it makes me uncomfortable.

608
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:08,410
Who says it's easier to get sympathy votes with ordinary civilians?

609
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,140
More violent offenders are found guilty...

610
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,410
at jury trials than at regular trials,

611
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,109
which means jurors...

612
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:16,810
are more unforgiving toward violent offenders.

613
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:19,980
Although I'm not sure if he submitted this knowing that.

614
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,819
(Presiding Judge)

615
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,120
This request has been approved.

616
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:28,596
Do you remember the college girl who was brutally murdered...

617
00:57:28,596 --> 00:57:30,196
on her 20th birthday?

618
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,596
This case is better known as the Joker Murder.

619
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:34,806
The accused in the case, Jung Man Chun,

620
00:57:34,806 --> 00:57:36,866
requested a jury trial.

621
00:57:36,866 --> 00:57:39,576
Judge Ryu Sung Hoon at the Mooyoung District Court...

622
00:57:39,576 --> 00:57:41,335
approved the request,

623
00:57:41,475 --> 00:57:43,875
which means that a jury trial will be held for Jung Man Chun.

624
00:57:44,145 --> 00:57:46,016
The accused, Jung Man Chun,

625
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:48,245
- is still denying all charges. - Hey.

626
00:57:48,446 --> 00:57:50,145
- But due to the solid evidence, - Turn it off.

627
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:51,315
the police are convinced that...

628
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:55,556
Everyone wants a jury trial these days.

629
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:57,156
Do they think...

630
00:57:57,156 --> 00:58:00,056
that people will allow them to get away with murder?

631
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:01,355
Captain.

632
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:06,295
Maybe Jung Man Chun is up to something.

633
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:07,795
Like what?

634
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:12,736
You know, in those mystery movies,

635
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:15,375
there's always a twist when you think the culprit has been caught.

636
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:17,806
This is just what I think,

637
00:58:18,716 --> 00:58:21,486
but Jung Man Chun pled the Fifth throughout the investigation,

638
00:58:21,486 --> 00:58:23,986
and he wants a jury trial now.

639
00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:30,326
I'm telling you. He's trying to turn the tables somehow.

640
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:38,536
Hey, stop watching so many movies. Turn the tables, my foot.

641
00:58:38,536 --> 00:58:39,565
Believe me!

642
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,105
All the movies I've watched had one thing in common.

643
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:45,636
It's not over until it's really over.

644
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:48,846
Hey, Detective Na. Be quiet.

645
00:58:49,545 --> 00:58:52,145
And you, Sung Jun. You're sure nothing happened...

646
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:54,145
when you were arresting Jung Man Chun, right?

647
00:58:54,346 --> 00:58:55,486
Yes, I told you nothing happened.

648
00:58:56,645 --> 00:58:58,516
What is with this brat?

649
00:58:58,516 --> 00:58:59,685
Don't you worry.

650
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,156
That scumbag, Jung Man Chun, won't get out of this one.

651
00:59:04,355 --> 00:59:06,696
Sung Jun, can you take a look at this?

652
00:59:06,995 --> 00:59:08,295
It came from the court,

653
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,326
but I have no idea what this means.

654
00:59:11,935 --> 00:59:12,935
Here.

655
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:14,266
What is this?

656
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:16,335
(Juror Candidate: Kim Sook Hee)

657
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:19,736
Here, look. "Submit reasons for not attending..."

00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,506
"and other supplementary materials."

659
00:59:22,006 --> 00:59:24,375
You're a juror candidate, Mom.

660
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:26,076
Juror?

661
00:59:27,446 --> 00:59:30,145
Oh, you heard them talking about...

662
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:32,216
a jury trial on the news earlier, right?

663
00:59:32,216 --> 00:59:34,185
- Yes. - Jurors are the people...

664
00:59:34,185 --> 00:59:36,625
who attend jury trials and decide whether or not...

665
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,326
the accused should be found guilty.

666
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,355
My goodness. I know nothing about the law.

667
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:43,065
That's why they want you as a juror.

668
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:45,435
They want to see what ordinary people like us would do...

669
00:59:45,435 --> 00:59:47,435
as opposed to the judges, who are often highly educated...

670
00:59:47,435 --> 00:59:48,435
and privileged.

671
00:59:48,435 --> 00:59:49,536
I see.

672
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:51,466
Don't worry. And they can't arrest anyone...

673
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:54,176
based on the jury's decision anyway. It's just for reference.

674
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:56,946
What? Then why make me go to court?

675
00:59:56,946 --> 00:59:58,475
I'm a busy lady.

676
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:02,346
By the way, how did they find me and send me this?

677
01:00:02,346 --> 01:00:03,346
You were chosen randomly.

678
01:00:03,815 --> 01:00:05,085
You know what that means, right?

Have fun with your friends.

I have to do my jury duty today.

Hello?

688
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:37,475
Hello, ma'am. I'm the tenant in the rooftop room.

689
01:01:37,545 --> 01:01:39,346
I have a favor to ask.

690
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:43,216
Oh, I'm in a rush to go to the court for...

691
01:01:44,545 --> 01:01:47,455
No, I'm not the one being tried.

Number 57 has been selected.

695

You can only find out on the day of the trial...

whether or not you'll be on the jury.

697

Number 24 has been selected.

Should I sit here?

- Hello. - Oh, hello.

703
01:03:08,466 --> 01:03:10,835
- I'm number 1. - I'm number 2.

Nice to meet you.

(April 14, 2022, Jung Man Chun's Jury Trial)

706

Gosh, it's so cold in here.

707
01:03:17,346 --> 01:03:18,346
My gosh.

708
01:03:20,116 --> 01:03:21,275
Is it not cold in the back?

709
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:22,815
No, I'm fine. Are you cold?

710
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:24,685
Come on. It's nice and cool in here.

711
01:03:26,016 --> 01:03:28,725
I've never worn a court look before and it's a bit stifling.

712
01:03:31,426 --> 01:03:34,395
"Court look?" What's that?

713
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:37,895
Is it because it's a murder case?

714
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:41,806
The room's so chilly and it gives me the creeps.

715
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:56,815
Darn you!

716
01:03:56,815 --> 01:03:59,016

- Die! - You don't deserve a trial!

01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:17,366
What is the matter with you?

726
01:04:17,366 --> 01:04:19,176
Why are we even bothering with this?

727
01:04:19,176 --> 01:04:20,506
Just die!

728
01:04:20,506 --> 01:04:22,306

Before the trial, I'd like to remind...

732
01:04:46,036 --> 01:04:48,466
the jury of nine of something.

733
01:04:48,736 --> 01:04:51,906
The decision you make today decides the fate of one man.

734
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:54,335
Don't take that lightly.

735
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:57,176
Without any bias or prejudice against the defendant,

736
01:04:57,176 --> 01:05:00,045
name him guilty or not based only on the evidence...

737
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:01,516
brought up in court.

738
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:07,585
We'll start the trial of Civil Case 2022-1004,

739
01:05:07,855 --> 01:05:10,725
on the charges of murder, damage,

740
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:14,256
and concealment of the victim's body against defendant Jung Man Chun.

741

743
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,105
I have a question for the defendant.

744
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:25,136
(Defendant)

745
01:05:25,136 --> 01:05:26,176
Late night on January 5,

746
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,506
you put a knife to Baek Ji Eun's throat...

747
01:05:28,506 --> 01:05:29,775
and abducted her, yes?

748
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:34,245
I did put a knife to her, but I didn't abduct her.

749
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,986
Why did you hold a knife to her throat?

750
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:40,056
Her father.

751
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:43,125
Baek the CEO didn't pay me my salary.

752
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:45,855
I'd waited for months,

753
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:49,725
but instead of paying what he owed, he treated me like an insect.

754
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:53,435
He makes money off illegal immigrants.

755
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:55,196
He can't do that to us.

756
01:05:55,866 --> 01:05:57,906
I wanted to teach him a lesson,

757
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:00,406
so I just tried to scare his daughter.

758
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,605
How much salary does Baek Ji Eun's father owe you?

759
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:04,806
Over 5,000 dollars.

760
01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:07,576
No, it'll be over 7,000 dollars.

761
01:06:07,576 --> 01:06:09,645
- Darn you. - Oh, come on.

762
01:06:09,645 --> 01:06:11,486
Seven grand? That's it?

763
01:06:11,486 --> 01:06:12,955
How could you?

764
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:13,986
What?

765
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:16,685
For just 7,000 dollars you killed my daughter?

766
01:06:17,185 --> 01:06:18,696
What did she do wrong?

767
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:21,395
You were an illegal immigrant with nowhere to go.

768
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,065
We took you in out of pity...

769
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:24,866
and this is how you repay us?

770
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:27,665
You're less than a beast.

771
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:30,335
Bring my daughter back. Bring back my daughter!

772
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:32,705
I want my daughter back!

773
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:33,875
My daughter!

774
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:35,976
I want her back!

775
01:06:37,445 --> 01:06:40,016
Bring my daughter back!

776
01:06:40,016 --> 01:06:41,646
My daughter.

777
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:45,356
I want my daughter back.

778
01:06:47,316 --> 01:06:49,825
Bring my daughter back!

779
01:06:49,825 --> 01:06:53,256
Bring my daughter back, you punk!

780
01:06:55,526 --> 01:06:58,596
My poor daughter.

781
01:06:58,596 --> 01:06:59,735
Kill him!

782
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,365
How could he?

783
01:07:02,566 --> 01:07:04,535
You murderer!

784
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:07,035
Kill him! He should die!

785
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:10,506
My daughter...

786
01:07:12,615 --> 01:07:15,216
- You evil thing! - You should die too!

787
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:18,115
Kill him too! Execute him!

788
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:20,516
Die!

789
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:23,455
Please be silent.

790
01:07:23,926 --> 01:07:27,726
It is true that I briefly considered doing something terrible.

791
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,295
But I did not kill her.

792
01:07:30,795 --> 01:07:32,136
Believe me, judge.

793
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:34,436
Jury, believe me.

794
01:07:34,436 --> 01:07:35,806
I'm not the killer.

795
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:43,476
Can you prove you're not the killer?

796
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:47,146
Yes, I can.

797
01:07:49,985 --> 01:07:53,455
There that day, there was someone other than me.

798
01:08:11,535 --> 01:08:12,676
Help me.

799
01:08:15,205 --> 01:08:16,346
Help me.

800
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:19,216
He's trying to kill me.

801
01:08:59,516 --> 01:09:01,756
Mooyoung Police Station's Detective Ryu Sung Jun.

802
01:09:03,726 --> 01:09:05,186
It was him.

803
01:09:06,096 --> 01:09:08,495
He killed Mr. Baek's daughter.

804
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:09,766
- Lie! - Liar!

805
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:11,325
Are you trying to get away with it?

806
01:09:11,325 --> 01:09:13,495
- What? - Blame a police officer?

807
01:09:13,495 --> 01:09:16,335
- How could you? - What's wrong with you?

808
01:09:45,195 --> 01:09:46,266
Here you are.

809
01:10:08,785 --> 01:10:10,226
(Our priority is to protect child actors and animals.)

810
01:10:10,226 --> 01:10:11,226
(The dangerous scenes...)

811
01:10:11,226 --> 01:10:12,825
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

812
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:14,195
(but with doubles and dummies.)

813
01:10:33,945 --> 01:10:37,615
(Blind)

814
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:41,016
The reason I was convinced that Jung Man Chun was the killer...

815
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:44,325
Will you kill me too?

816
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:47,926
"I'm not the killer." It sounded sincere.

817
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:49,726
He's sentenced to life in prison.

818
01:10:51,096 --> 01:10:52,566
You will all die...

819
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:55,566
because of what you did today.

820
01:10:55,705 --> 01:10:58,066
He escaped on the way to prison.

821
01:10:58,566 --> 01:10:59,735
Did you do it?

822
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:02,676
Part of the list of jurors' details went missing after the trial.

823
01:11:02,976 --> 01:11:04,375
The culprit's next target is...

824
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:06,346
- Help me! - among them.
