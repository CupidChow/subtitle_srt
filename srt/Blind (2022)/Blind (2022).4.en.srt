(are not based on reality.)

4
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,069
It's okay. You should eat it.

5
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,939
Take it. Don't wake up hungry in the middle of the night.

6
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,991
Eat up.

7
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,930
The D-day is the day of the upcoming routine inspection.

8
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,370
Don't look at me and keep eating.

9
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,180
That day at dawn, we're going to leave this place.

10
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,851
Even if Crazy Dog figures out we're gone,

11
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,391
he won't be able to come after us until the public official...

12
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,861
leaves after the inspection.

13
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:33,230
By the time he starts coming after us, we'll be long gone.

14
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,060
Prepare yourselves.

15
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,161
When I get out of here, I want to do that.

16
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,991
A family picnic.

17
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,030
I want to pack a bunch of good food like gimbap and sandwiches,

18
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,361
spread out a blanket at a park, stuff my face with food,

19
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,870
and then ride a bike with my brother.

20
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,400
What about you? What do you want to do first?

21
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,271
I'm not going to do anything.

22
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,211
I'm not going to do anything and just lounge around and play.

23
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,350
Until I die.

24
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,180
I want to eat the food my mom makes for me.

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,321
White rice with bulgogi on top.

26
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:41,761
For me,

27
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,530
I want to do the things other kids my age get to do.

28
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,440
Go to school, do my homework, and play soccer.

29
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,440
What about you, Yoon Jae?

30
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,280
Don't you have anything you want to do if we get out of here?

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,021
I'll wait until I become an adult.

32
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,090
What do you want to do when you become an adult?

33
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:08,921
I'll tell you then.

34
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:10,991
You'll probably like it too.

(Episode 4: A Very Old Future)

36
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,611
(Muyoung Police Station)

37
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:21,701
As previously mentioned,

38
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,030
the body that was found in Muyoung Park...

39
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,241
is my daughter.

40
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,670
According to the autopsy, her time of death...

41
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,211
was between midnight and 2am on the 15th.

42
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,951
The cause of death...

43
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:44,881
has been confirmed as asphyxiation.

44
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,590
Yes.

45
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,321
The perp's method of crime...

46
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:51,521
is supposedly similar to that of the Joker murder case.

47
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,831
Was this case also the doing of Jung Man Chun?

48
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:57,461
Jung Man Chun has an alibi for the estimated time of death.

49
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,371
He has been excluded from the list of suspects.

50
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,771
If it's not Jung Man Chun, then is this a copycat?

51
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,540
Are there other suspects?

52
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,840
As of now, we assume it is the act of a copycat.

53
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,850
And I ask for your understanding as we cannot divulge further details...

54
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,081
regarding the ongoing investigation.

55
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:18,181
Thank you.

56
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,970
Which of the eight jurors don't have an alibi?

57
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,600
Choi Soon Gil, the taxi driver,

58
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,071
and An Tae Ho. Just these two.

59
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,670
An Tae Ho claims he drove himself home...

60
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,311
after the dinner.

61
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,311
But the area he resides in does not have security cameras installed,

62
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,511
so we can't confirm what time he got home.

63
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,920
Seok Gu.

64
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Mr. Baek Moon Kang, Baek Ji Eun's father,

65
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,150
is a former special forces officer, right?

66
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,790
Yes, so...

67
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,160
From 1986 to 1995,

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,990
he served as a non-commissioned officer in the reconnaissance unit.

69
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,600
Why do you ask?

70
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,730
Choi Soon Gil also served in the same unit at the same time.

71
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,730
What?

72
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,501
But then...

73
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,141
that means Choi Soon Gil and Mr. Baek know each other.

74
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:18,581
- Fascinating. - It could happen.

75
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,610
They say everyone in the world knows each other...

76
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,181
if you just count 3 or 4 degrees of separation.

77
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,191
What do they call that?

78
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,590
There's a famous actor's name in it.

79
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:30,490
- The Kevin Bacon Theory. - What?

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,860
The six billion people in this world were proven to have a connection...

81
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,961
if you just count six degrees of separation.

82
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:41,131
Now that we live in an age of the Internet, it could be smaller.

83
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,100
Who might you be?

84
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:46,311
- Sung Hoon. - Wait, your brother?

85
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm Judge Ryu Sung Hoon.

86
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,641
I was in charge of Jung Man Chun's jury trial.

87
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:53,110
I brought something that might be of help...

88
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,181
in solving Yeom Hye Jin's murder case.

89
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,150
(Messages)

90
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,251
The night that Jung Man Chun was holding a victim hostage,

91
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,461
I sent the jurors a text message.

92
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,360
All eight jurors except for Yeom Hye Jin texted back.

93
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,331
The time of their responses was between 11:30pm to 1am.

94
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,800
If it's between 11:30pm to 1am,

95
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,030
it's Yeom Hye Jin's time of death.

96
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,441
If we track the location of the phones when they sent those texts,

97
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,711
we'll know where these people were during that time.

98
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,811
That's right.

99
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,740
- Seok Gu, did you get that? - Yes.

100
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,610
I'll track the numbers right away.

101
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,191
How did you know that we were looking into the jurors' alibis?

102
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:41,090
I happened to watch your chief's press conference.

103
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,701
If Jung Man Chun wasn't the culprit,

104
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,470
then you'd want to know the alibis of the people...

105
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,030
who were with Yeom Hye Jin before she died.

106
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,800
I guess you really do have a sexy brain.

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,511
What? Is there something on my face?

108
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,410
- Where were you during that time? - Me?

109
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,951
I was trying to find Jung Man Chun,

110
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,780
looking around every corner of Yeonju-dong.

111
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:06,621
And I later found out...

112
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,621
that I missed Cho Eun Ki by a hairs breath.

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,490
I had just left when Cho Eun Ki arrived in a taxi.

114
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:14,160
If only I stayed there another minute, we would've met.

115
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:16,461
So you mean you were in Yeonju-dong during that time too?

116
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,501
Yes.

117
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,431
- Did you go alone? - I was alone sometimes,

118
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,240
and I was with Detective Kim at other times.

119
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:26,610
He's the one who took a photo of your phone earlier.

120
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,311
He's my partner, Detective Kim Seok Gu.

121
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,081
He used to compete in judo.

122
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,980
He won a bronze medal at the Asian Games.

123
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,850
He's pretty reliable to have around.

124
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,550
Hey, did you bring your car?

125
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,121
If you didn't, I'll drop you off at the courthouse on my way.

126
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,631
I'm on my way to meet Mr. Baek anyway.

127
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,331
- Mr. Baek Moon Kang? - Yes.

128
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,301
- Why are you meeting with him? - To ask him about Choi Soon Gil.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,331
It turns out Choi Soon Gil and Mr. Baek were...

130
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,340
Never mind. I'll tell you after I get back.

131
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,411
- You'll ride with me, right? - No, thanks.

132
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,480
(Muyoung Police, Doing our best for the safety of our residents)

133
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,551
Thanks!

134
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:11,720
Please wait here.

135
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,831
Ji Eun is already 20 years old.

136
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:32,571
Happy birthday, Ji Eun.

137
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,291
Both my wife and I...

138
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,490
are stuck in the moment that Ji Eun died.

139
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:53,390
Help yourself.

140
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,531
Thank you.

141
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,500
That's a unique tattoo.

142
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,610
Oh, this.

143
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:11,610
I used to run a small security company back in the day.

144
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,850
The employees and I got matching tattoos.

145
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,321
We thought stuff like this was cool back then.

146
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,490
Was Mr. Choi Soon Gil one of those employees too?

147
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:25,490
Yes.

148
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:29,600
But how do you know Soon Gil, detective?

149
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,831
Mr. Choi was...

150
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,600
a juror in Jung Man Chun's trial.

151
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,181
(The day of Jung Man Chun's jury trial)

152
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:52,890
It's been a long time, Moon Kang.

153
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,691
Soon Gil?

154
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry to hear...

155
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,201
about your daughter.

156
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,041
You let the man who killed your only child stand trial.

157
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:14,411
This isn't like you.

158
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:17,740
A punk detective got involved too quickly.

159
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:20,911
How have you been?

160
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,421
I'll tell you about that later.

161
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,691
Do you know who I just saw?

162
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,191
One of the kids who were there back then.

163
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,760
- Which one? - Well...

164

I'm not sure yet.

165
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,171
I'll call when I am.

166
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,610
Oh. Was he?

167
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,441
I was a bit out of sorts that day.

168
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,651
I had no idea who the jury even was.

169
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,151
Soon Gil...

170
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,380
He should've said hi if he saw me there.

171
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,691
I get why you didn't greet him,

172
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,791
but why didn't Mr. Choi greet you?

173
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,860
Same special forces unit, same workplace,

174
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,961
and if you even have the same tat, you must've been close.

175
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,531
We haven't been in touch for over 20 years.

176
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,831
We drifted apart.

177
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,071
Did something happen back then?

178
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,181
Soon Gil quit work.

179
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,581
He went crazy looking for his wife who'd run away.

180
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:29,321
Why did his wife run away?

181
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,220
He beat her half dead whenever he got drunk.

182
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,090
How could she not?

183
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,360
Since the day his wife left him,

184
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,691
Soon Gil's temperament changed.

185
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,791
How so?

186
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,831
Well...

187
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:50,171
He turned violent, should I say?

188
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,740
Enough to kill?

189
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,571
Did Soon Gil kill someone?

190
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:55,840
I don't know.

191
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,651
But you won't say he's not the kind to kill.

192
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,880
Well...

193
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,360
By the way,

194
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,661
you're into security, right?

195

196

Were you someone's bodyguard?

197
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,441
No. We watched an ordinary building.

I have something important to say.

Can we talk somewhere quiet?

Let's talk here.

Come along.

211
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,470
- It doesn't feel real. - I know.

212

Oh, dear.

215
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,250
I feel so sorry for him.

216
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:49,760
I bet the kid doesn't yet know what happened to his mom.

217
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:51,921
That kids don't know because they're young.

218
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,590
That's the adults' illusion.

219
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,760
Kids know, however young they are.

220
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,130
I guess you're right.

221
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,441
The child spirit I serve knows everything.

222
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,970
Oh, goodness.

223
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,140
Am I coming down with something? I feel cold again.

224
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,640
Do you want this?

225
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,281
No. Give me a shot of soju.

226
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,821
That will cure any cold.

227

Okay.

Mr. Kang's not coming, then?

Oh, his daughter is getting married soon.

231
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,941
He only sent some money.

You stay away from funerals before a celebration...

in case you jinx it.

234
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:50,581
When is his daughter's wedding?

235
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,651
I don't know, I didn't ask.

236
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:59,090
He'll send out wedding invitations when the time comes.

237
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,461
Someone's marrying off his adult kid,

238
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:07,401
and someone died before hers even started school.

239

Because of a woman I barely know,

242
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,581
I've become a suspect and it really blows.

243

I know that's what you're all thinking.

244

No.

245

A young mom...

246
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,860
went out drinking, pretending to be single.

247
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,230
That got her killed.

248
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,500
Is that what you're thinking?

249
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm sure the police interviewed us just as a formality.

250
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,681
Not because they suspect us.

251

Well, I thought so at first,

Yes. He was with me at the time.

256

258
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,860

wasn't that of someone asking some formal questions.

00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,111
Chief Yeom. Are you watching?

333
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,651
Your daughter wants me to save her.

334
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:03,820
You little jerk...

335
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,050
Who are you?

336

Chief Yeom.

337
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,591
Watch carefully.

338
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,431
Watch your daughter's last moments as she dies pitifully...

339
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:18,601
because of you.

340
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:19,631
Dad.

341
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,631
Dad, please save me.

342
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:24,371
Dad, please save me!

343
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,371
Hye Jin!

344
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
No.

345
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,310
You should smile.

346
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,220
You need to smile to look pretty.

Who are you?

350
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,921
I'm a detective. A homicide detective.

351
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,260
A detective?

352
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,591
Did you catch the bad guy who killed my mom?

353
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,730
Oh, dear. We haven't caught him yet.

354
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,470
Don't worry. We'll catch him soon.

355
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:10,480
I'll...

356
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,510
catch the bad guys with this.

357
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,780
Wow, handcuffs.

358
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,451
Can I touch your handcuffs?

359
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,520
If you do this, it spins around like this.

360
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,421
That's how we catch bad guys. Do you get it?

361
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,431
Try it like this.

362
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,461
If you do it like this...

363
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,300
Why don't you try it?

364
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:39,470
That's right. Press down on that. Then it'll spin around.

365
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:40,970
Watch your hand.

366
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:42,740
That's right.

367
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,480
Here. Try arresting me.

368

You're under arrest as the criminal!

370

Gosh.

371
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,921
Gosh, it's not that.

372
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,060
Hold on. You take this and...

373
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:01,790
Okay? Try it with this hand.

374
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,000

376
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:56,480
Ms. Cho?

377
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:02,790
What are you doing here?

378
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,290
Find someone for me.

379
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,631
Jung Yoon Jae.

380
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,550
- Have you been getting some sleep? - Of course not.

381
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,881
Are you seeing a therapist?

382
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:35,951
Not yet.

383
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,401
You didn't listen to your parents when you were young. Right?

384
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,431
Should I walk?

385
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,300
No...

386
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,310
By the way, what were you doing in the parking lot?

387
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,740
It looked like you were looking for someone.

388
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:01,851
I was looking for Mr. Choi.

389
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:03,881
Why were you looking for him?

390
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,451
I'm not totally sure,

391
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,121
but it seemed like Mr. Choi...

392
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,290
kept looking at the back through the rearview mirror.

393
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,931
I thought he was looking at Hye Jin,

394
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:15,730
but Hye Jin said he was looking at me.

395
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,661
Is that why Ms. Yeom made you get out first?

396
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,770
If Hye Jin got off first and I got off later...

397
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:27,970
like we had initially planned,

398
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,911
what do you think would've happened?

399
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,421
If you're blaming yourself for what happened, don't.

400
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,550
It's not like you went home and relaxed that night.

401
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,891
You almost died that night too.

402
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,461
You saved me that night,

403
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,300
but nobody was by Hye Jin's side.

404
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,270
When she desperately needed someone's help,

405
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:58,800
there was nobody there.

406
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:02,240

There were no records of an adoption.

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,180
It's fine.

501
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,279
I'm fine, so go and get some rest.

502
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,149
You must be tired from watching a vicious criminal.

503
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,060
Then please call me once you're done talking.

504
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,209
It's the perfect weather to die.

505
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,549
And it's the perfect height to die too.

506
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,629
So...

507
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,100
Do you want to see who can push the other first?

508
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:19,649
Please save me.

509
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:21,819
What are you doing all of a sudden?

510
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,290
Are you going to jump me?

511
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,060
I have a son.

512
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,689
He's seven years old this year.

513
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,060
He suddenly collapsed one day, so I took him to the hospital.

514
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:37,029
They said he has a brain tumor.

515
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:40,029
We need money for his surgery.

516
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:42,740
But I couldn't get my paycheck,

517
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:46,169
and it felt like I was backed into a corner.

(ICU Visitation Guidelines)

520
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,229
How did it go? Did you get the money?

521
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,169
Then what do we do?

522
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,810
If we don't have the money, they'll discharge Won Woong tomorrow.

523
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,910
I contacted someone in organ trafficking.

524
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:24,180
- I'll get a call from him soon. - When is that?

525
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,910
What if something happens to Won Woong before then?

526
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,549
You need to get the money right this instant!

527

This is Jung Man Chun.

528
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:46,330
Mr. Jung Man Chun. Do you want to save your son?

If you do as I say,

533
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,379
I'll pay for your son's surgery.

534
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:02,779
Who are you, and why are you playing this gutsy joke?

535
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,589
Don't you want to save your son?

536
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:06,419
If not, forget about it.

537
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,990
Wait.

538
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,560
What kind of errand is it? Why would you give me all that money?

539
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,060
CEO Baek Moon Kang of Hope Foods.

540
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,129
I have a debt to collect from that man.

541
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,100
I don't know how big that debt is, but give up.

542
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:24,839
That jerk won't even pay me my measly paycheck.

543
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,240
He's more leech than human.

544
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,779
Did I ever say I was going to collect the debt in money?

545
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:29,879
If it's not money...

546
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,310
Mr. Baek's daughter...

547
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,020
What are you...

548
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,520
Do you mean you want me to kill someone for money?

549
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,959
No.

550
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,129
You just need to play the part of a falsely convicted murderer.

551
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,399
I'll take care of Mr. Baek's daughter myself.

552
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:49,459
Is that really...

553
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:52,899
all I have to do?

554
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:57,310
Of course, your child's mother must endure some sacrifice as well.

555
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,470
Tell them they can take my organs if they want to.

556
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,779
How can I trust you?

557
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:06,209
The moment you accept this offer,

558
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:07,819
you'll find the money in your account.

559
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,649
However, you must keep this in mind.

560
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,890
If you betray me,

561
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,990
your son will pay for it.

562
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,709
Gosh. Seriously.

563
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,879
What kind of mad dog nonsense is this?

564
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,950
What, then? Are you going to say that the jury trial...

565
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,350
and the hostage situation were his ideas too?

566
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:41,919
I know you won't believe me,

567
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,390
but it was all his idea.

568
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:49,060
Look at you lying without even batting an eye.

569
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,189
I recorded the phone call.

570
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,529
Mr. Baek has the recording.

571
00:40:58,669 --> 00:40:59,700
Mr. Baek?

572
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,499
He came to the hospital and tried to kill me,

573
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,569
saying he must avenge his daughter's death.

574
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,379
So I told him everything.

575
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,439
If you don't believe me, just listen to the recording.

576
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:14,379
Everything you say is a lie, so how am I supposed to believe you?

577
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,180
Who knows? Maybe you manipulated the file.

578
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,890
No, I am not lying. I'm telling you the truth!

579
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,060
If another woman wasn't found dead today,

580
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,060
I'd be taking this to my grave.

581
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,200
But he even killed that woman.

582
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,899
He's extremely ruthless and cruel.

583
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,100
If he finds out that I gave the recording to Mr. Baek,

584
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,640
he will hurt Won Woong.

585
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,879
We must get him before he tries to hurt Won Woong.

586
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,649
This is all in your head.

587
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:47,720
How am I supposed to catch this imaginary caller?

588
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,760
I do have the original recording.

589
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,879
Where is it now?

590
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:28,990
My son's name is Won Woong.

591
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,490
Promise me that you will protect Won Woong,

592
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,029
and I'll tell you where it is.

593
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,839
Okay, sure.

594
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:49,279
I will believe you, knowing very well that you could be lying.

595
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,879
If everything you told me is true,

596
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,279
I will protect your son.

597
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,089
Now, tell me.

598
00:42:58,419 --> 00:42:59,620
Where is it?

599
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,640
It was there?

- What happened? - Is he dead?

605
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:12,729
- I can't believe this. - What happened?

606
00:44:12,729 --> 00:44:15,399
- No idea. - Excuse me.

607
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:16,499
Excuse me.

608
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,600

Excuse me. We're looking for Officer Kang Soo Ho.

00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:11,950
- Over there. - There he is!

615
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,950
Officer Kang! My goodness.

616
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,419
Officer Kang, is your injury serious?

617
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,330
No, I only had to get 20 stitches.

618
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,830
- What happened? - I'm not sure.

619
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,970
Jung Man Chun said he wanted to talk to Detective Ryu in private.

620
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:27,669
So I went down to the lobby to grab a coffee.

621
00:45:28,169 --> 00:45:29,799
About ten minutes later,

622
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,270
I started getting worried because I left the two of them up there.

623
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,279
So I went back up to the rooftop.

624
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,350
I'm not sure what they were talking about,

625
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,319
but they both seemed quite tense.

626
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,790
(Police)

627
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:56,660
You're back already?

628
00:45:57,229 --> 00:45:59,529
- Go take a break. - I was worried.

629
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:02,640
What did he want to talk to you about?

630
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:05,740
Nothing much.

631
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,339
He just wanted to get some fresh air and used me as an excuse.

632
00:46:10,439 --> 00:46:11,649
I let him stab me,

633
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,209
so I guess he thinks I'm a joke.

634
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,680
Anyway, I'm off. Take it easy.

635
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:20,749
Have a good day!

636
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,060
(Police)

637
00:46:27,629 --> 00:46:30,999
Since we already came up here anyway, we can stay here...

638
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,169
until I finish my coffee.

639
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:41,379
What a nice day.

640
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,249
When I woke up,

641
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:49,279
I was lying in the emergency room.

642
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,790
You didn't see who hit you in the head?

643
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,850
No, sir.

644
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:54,689
I'm sorry.

645
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,660
Lie down.

646
00:46:58,129 --> 00:46:59,129
Let's go.

647
00:46:59,129 --> 00:47:00,430
- It must hurt. - Lie down.

648
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,260
Yes, sir. Have a good day.

649
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,499
- Can you not reach Sung Jun? - No, he's not picking up.

650
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:12,410
Why did you go to the rooftop at that hour?

651
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:15,410
Immediately after Jung Man Chun fell,

652
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:17,180
I saw someone on the rooftop.

653
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,910
I went up there to check just in case...

654
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,450
and found a man passed out, covered in blood.

655
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,390
You didn't see anyone else, other than Officer Kang?

656
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,189
No, I didn't see anyone else.

657
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,760
Your brother wasn't there?

658
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:32,790
My brother was on the rooftop?

659
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,160
What were you doing at the hospital?

660
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,629
I came to see Jung Man Chun.

661
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:43,240
I recently found out that one of the jurors, Choi Soon Gil,

662
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,339
knew the father of Baek Ji Eun, the victim.

663
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,410
In other countries,

664
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,839
when things like this come to light,

665
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,549
they can annul the court's decisions.

666
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,649
But of course, it won't happen in this country.

667
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,290
Everyone praises you for your fair judgments,

668
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,220
so what if this ruins your reputation?

669
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,959
I'm really worried for you.

670
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:16,740
Just pay me well,

671
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,740
and I'll make sure your reputation remains unscathed.

672
00:48:30,149 --> 00:48:32,390
Thank you for your concern, but I don't need your help.

673
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:39,660
Then I can't keep my lips sealed.

674
00:48:41,229 --> 00:48:42,359
Sure, talk all you want.

675
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:44,600
TV stations, newspapers, and other media outlets.

676
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,029
Contact everyone you can and give them the tip-off.

677
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:48,270
Agree to interview requests too.

678
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:51,970
If you'd like, I could put you in touch with reporters I know.

679
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:58,109
Now that I know there was an error,

680
00:48:58,109 --> 00:48:59,609
I can't just ignore it.

681
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,879
I came here to tell Jung Man Chun to apply for a retrial.

682
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:06,589
Thank you for your cooperation.

683
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,359
- You may leave. - Wait, Detective.

684
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,459
Earlier, you asked me if I saw Sung Jun on the rooftop.

685
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:19,830
Right.

686
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:24,100
Could you tell me why you asked me such a question?

687
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,879
Right before Jung Man Chun died,

688
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,249
he met with Detective Ryu.

689
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,749
There is a chance that the man you saw...

690
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,080
was Detective Ryu.

691
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,890
Have you talked to Ryu Sung Jun yet?

692
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,620
No, not yet.

693
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:50,600
This is Inspector Kang Chang Wook from Muyoung Police.

694
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,029
I need you to trace a cell phone. It's urgent.

695
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:33,569
(Seok Gu)

696
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,520
Won Woong, make sure your head stays dry.

697
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:44,649
Okay.

698
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:48,819
Oh, no.

699
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:58,569
There.

700
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
Dad!

701
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:06,209
Won Woong!

702
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:07,939
Dad!

703
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:25,589
The phone is currently located...

704
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:27,729
at Lips Motel, at Jicheon-ro 37-gil 9.

705
00:51:27,729 --> 00:51:30,060
(Lips Motel)

706
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:40,870
(Lips Motel)

707
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,870
Ryu Sung Jun!

708
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,140
Oh, hey.

709
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,939
Hands up.

710
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:18,810
I understand why you got the wrong idea,

711
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,850
but I can explain everything. Okay?

712
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,020
Hand over your gun.

713
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:25,149
Now!

714
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,700
We don't have time for this.

715
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:40,470
The perp left a few moments ago.

716
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,499
We must track him down now! Okay?

717
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,870
What are you doing?

718
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,580
You're going to shoot me?

719
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,410
I told you. You got the wrong idea!

720
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,390
It's a live bullet. Have you lost your mind?

721
00:53:51,948 --> 00:53:53,218
(Muyoung Police Station)

722
00:53:53,218 --> 00:53:55,089
I heard Jung Man Chun say in the courtroom...

723
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:57,118
that Ryu Sung Jun was the one who took Baek Ji Eun.

724
00:53:57,488 --> 00:54:00,329
If he killed Baek Ji Eun and my daughter,

725
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:03,028
then killed Jung Man Chun too to silence him for good...

726
00:54:03,928 --> 00:54:05,729
That is absurd, Chief.

727
00:54:06,028 --> 00:54:09,899
Then why did he leave the hospital right after Jung Man Chun fell...

728
00:54:10,198 --> 00:54:11,508
and show up...

729
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:13,368
at the scene of the murder of Jung Man Chun's wife?

730
00:54:13,638 --> 00:54:15,278
I don't care what you say. Go get him!

731
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:17,109
Please give us a little more time.

732
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:20,309
Everyone is out looking for him. We'll get hold of him soon.

733
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:21,318
Hey!

734
00:54:21,448 --> 00:54:23,118
(Muyoung Police Station)

735
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:24,818
You're trying to protect him.

736
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:26,618
But if it turns out that it was all his doing,

737
00:54:26,618 --> 00:54:29,258
he won't be the only one going to jail!

738
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,559
Detective Ryu is...

739
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:35,428
He's like my little brother, Chief.

740
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:39,098
I've managed him since he was a rookie cop.

741
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:42,698
He has a short fuse and causes trouble often because of that,

742
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,638
but he always stands up to injustice.

743
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,968
He'd never kill anyone, Chief.

744
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:50,039
I'm not doing this because I'm ruthless.

745
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,109
I'm trying to prevent bigger problems before they occur!

746
00:54:54,848 --> 00:54:56,118
Bigger problems? Like what?

747
00:54:58,388 --> 00:54:59,488
What do you think?

748
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:02,118
People hate it when they see us trying to protect our own!

749
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,258
Hey, are you disobeying my orders?

750
00:55:08,198 --> 00:55:11,028
How dare you. I've been too nice to you.

751
00:55:11,298 --> 00:55:12,899
Go catch Ryu Sung Jun! Now!

752
00:55:14,098 --> 00:55:15,238
Here, congratulations.

753
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:18,968
My gosh, this is nice.

754
00:55:19,908 --> 00:55:22,738
This is my first time getting flowers from you in so long.

755
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:28,579
By the way, do I have to attend your appointment ceremony?

756
00:55:29,348 --> 00:55:30,379
Of course, you should be there.

757
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:33,789
I wouldn't be where I am now...

758
00:55:34,348 --> 00:55:36,189
if it weren't for you, Judge Ryu Il Ho.

759
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:40,758
My, nothing makes me happier than getting the credit I deserve.

760
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,829
Oh, hold on. What should I wear, then?

761
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:46,829
You should get a new custom suit made.

762
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:48,638
All your suits are over ten years old.

763
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:53,868
No, I have that one. I'll wear that suit.

764
00:55:54,508 --> 00:55:56,209
Oh, that suit.

765
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:58,948
Sung Hoon bought it for you when he got his first paycheck.

766
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:01,178
That's right. It's my favorite suit.

767
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:03,048
I should wear it on this special occasion.

768
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:06,388
You make it so obvious that you favor your eldest son.

769
00:56:06,388 --> 00:56:07,548
It's not like you don't do it.

770
00:56:07,919 --> 00:56:10,289
You also make it very obvious that he is your favorite.

771
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:15,729
Well, that's because Sung Jun is so different from Sung Hoon.

772
00:56:16,629 --> 00:56:18,059
Gosh, enough about that.

773
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,698
I get so upset whenever I think about Sung Jun.

774
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:22,598
My goodness.

775
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:28,979
Who's here at this hour?

776
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:37,278
Hello, sir.

777
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:40,749
Captain Oh.

778
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,158
What brings you by?

779
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:45,158
Is Sung Jun here now, by any chance?

780
00:56:45,258 --> 00:56:46,289
What?

781
00:56:47,428 --> 00:56:50,258
Sung Jun? Why are you looking for him here?

782
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:53,698
Well... How should I put this?

783
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:56,568
Sung Jun is...

784
00:56:59,468 --> 00:57:00,839
They've put out an APB on him.

785
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,789
(No special requests yet)

786

(You have a new message.)

787
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:18,758
You heard about Jung Man Chun, right?

788
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,758
I saw the news just now.

789
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:23,158
Did he cause trouble again?

790
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,459
He's dead.

791
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:28,568
I knew he'd be punished for what he did.

792
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:30,169
What goes around comes around.

793
00:57:30,468 --> 00:57:31,839
I heard he was murdered.

794
00:57:32,638 --> 00:57:33,738
Who killed him?

795
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:35,339
The suspect is a detective.

796
00:57:36,178 --> 00:57:37,209
Police detective?

797
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,579
Yes, and it's someone we know.

798
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:42,419
Detective Ryu Sung Jun at Muyoung Police Station.

803
00:58:25,658 --> 00:58:27,859
Where is Sung Jun? Did you hear what happened?

804
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:29,729
- Yes. - Have you talked to him?

805
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:30,959
No, he hasn't called.

806
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:33,528
Why must he do this now?

807
00:58:33,528 --> 00:58:36,539
My appointment ceremony is in two days. Why now?

808
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:37,899
Calm down.

809
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:40,709
We're not even sure if Sung Jun really did it.

810
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:42,908
The police are looking for him.

811
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:44,948
They wouldn't put out an APB...

812
00:58:44,948 --> 00:58:47,379
on their fellow officer for no reason!

813
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,778
Sung Hoon, let's find him first.

814

We need to find out what happened to come up with a plan.

815
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,189
Where could he be now?

816
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:58,689
I don't know.

817
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:00,528
You don't know?

818
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:02,698
His close friends would know, right?

819
00:59:03,158 --> 00:59:04,359
Have you tried calling his friends?

820
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:08,568
Don't tell me...

821
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:12,209
you don't even know who he is close to.

822
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:15,678
What do you even know?

823
00:59:18,548 --> 00:59:21,778
Did the two of you really not expect this at all?

824
00:59:23,348 --> 00:59:25,589
What do you mean by that?

825
00:59:26,848 --> 00:59:27,888
Are you saying...

826
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:31,158
you knew that Sung Jun...

827
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:34,229
would do something like this?

828

01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:09,129
Is it another dream?

830
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:18,568
Crazy Dog. He's coming.

831
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:20,109
What's going on?

832
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:37,658
Where am I?

833
01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:09,919
Darn.

834
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:19,269
- Mr. Baek Moon Kang? - Are you awake,

835
01:01:19,868 --> 01:01:21,698
Detective Ryu Sung Jun?

836
01:01:21,868 --> 01:01:22,868
No.

837
01:01:23,868 --> 01:01:25,809
I should call you Yoon Jae.

838
01:01:27,439 --> 01:01:29,138
How do you know that name?

839
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:36,379
You said it yourself...

840
01:01:36,919 --> 01:01:38,548
on the phone with Jung Man Chun.

841
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:39,848
What?

842
01:02:10,649 --> 01:02:12,118
I almost ended up...

843
01:02:13,649 --> 01:02:15,888
considering my daughter's killer...

844
01:02:16,218 --> 01:02:20,028
someone I owe my life to.

845
01:02:24,928 --> 01:02:26,468
Why did you kill her?

846
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,198
Did you get revenge for what I did to you on her?

847
01:02:29,198 --> 01:02:30,968
On her 20th birthday?

848
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:32,209
You're out of your mind.

849
01:02:32,568 --> 01:02:34,539
What are you talking about?

850
01:02:34,939 --> 01:02:37,138
If you wanted revenge, you should've killed me.

851
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:39,579
Me, not my daughter!

852
01:02:52,888 --> 01:02:53,959
Yes.

853
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:57,999
Since you were a kid, your gaze was different.

854
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:03,169
You abducted and tortured a police officer.

855
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:05,439
Do you know how serious a crime that is?

856
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,809
Your life is over now.

857
01:03:09,379 --> 01:03:11,278
You're done for, you lunatic!

858
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:12,408
The one who's done for...

859
01:03:14,408 --> 01:03:15,749
is not me.

860
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:18,048
It's you, Yoon Jae.

861
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:35,868
The people outside are looking everywhere to arrest you.

862
01:03:37,738 --> 01:03:39,309
While masquerading as a detective,

863
01:03:39,669 --> 01:03:41,568
you killed my daughter, Chief Yeom's daughter,

864
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,939
and Jung Man Chun and his family.

865
01:03:43,939 --> 01:03:45,678
Serial killer Jung Yoon Jae.

866
01:03:50,419 --> 01:03:54,289
But the police won't be able to find you.

867
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,459
Before they do,

868
01:03:57,818 --> 01:03:59,258
in my presence,

869
01:04:00,028 --> 01:04:03,098
you will be shredded alive.

870
01:04:06,198 --> 01:04:09,399
You'll disappear, bones and all.

871
01:05:13,428 --> 01:05:14,428
Get him!

872
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:28,579
- Go! - Split up!

873
01:05:36,189 --> 01:05:37,318
You punk.

874
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:31,339
- You didn't get far. - You.

875
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:34,679
You have a dreadful habit of harassing people.

876
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:37,749
People should not be exploited.

877
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:41,889
And they're not prey to be hunted. Okay?

878
01:06:43,058 --> 01:06:45,358
I should've listened to the shaman back then.

879
01:06:45,658 --> 01:06:48,898
But Yoon Jae. I'll never make the same mistake again.

880
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:51,129
Get him.

881
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,799
It won't be easy this time either.

882
01:06:57,938 --> 01:06:59,268
I'm quite tough.

883
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:16,289
- Go down and find him. - Yes, sir.

884
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:40,849
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

885
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:42,148
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

886
01:07:42,148 --> 01:07:43,478
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

887
01:07:43,478 --> 01:07:44,818
(but with doubles and dummies.)

888
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:07,539
(Blind)

889
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:09,579
If Jung Man Chun's not the killer,

890
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:11,009
I made the wrong call.

891
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,749
I'll be responsible for my trial.

892
01:08:14,478 --> 01:08:15,818
Detective Ryu?

893
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:17,419
Detective.

894
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:20,688
There's no way Sung Jun would leave proof like this.

895
01:08:20,688 --> 01:08:22,488
How much do you know about Sung Jun?

896
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:23,889
Mr. Baek talked like...

897
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:25,629
he knew me as a child.

898
01:08:25,929 --> 01:08:28,158
But why do I have no memory of him?

899
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:29,829
He won't last long on his own.

900
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:32,499
He'll go to someone for help.

901
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:35,099
Are you afraid your brother really won't help you?

902
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:36,438
Trust me just this once.
