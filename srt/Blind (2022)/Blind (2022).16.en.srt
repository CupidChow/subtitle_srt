3
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,924
- We haven't been here in a while. - You're right.

4
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:51,824
This place...

5
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:56,794
is so quiet. It's as if nothing had happened.

6
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,504
Did you get the photo...

7
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:05,934
of the vacation home?

8
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,445
(My Brother)

9
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,815
How long have you been going to the vacation home?

10
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,694
The statute of limitations has already passed.

11
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,194
I just...

12
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:31,935
want to know the truth.

13
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:38,435
Shortly after the Hope Welfare Center's case was given to me,

14
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:41,105
I got a call from the director.

15
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,605
He said he had something to tell me, so I came to this vacation home.

16
00:01:45,745 --> 00:01:49,485
the director and Chief Yeom were waiting.

17
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,685
They said if something went wrong for them,

18
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,424
your mom would get in trouble too.

19
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,625
When your mom found out about the abuse,

20
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,325
she ordered all the evidence to be destroyed...

21
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:04,825
and to keep everyone's mouths shut.

22
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,565
It was also your mom who persuaded Producer Bae...

23
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,065
and stopped the TV broadcast.

24
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:17,105
Upon hearing that,

25
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:19,845
what should I have done?

26
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:24,115
Should I have put your mom on the stand?

27
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:31,125
No. I had no other choice.

28
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,194
Was Yoon Jung the price of the trial deal?

29
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:42,204
What?

30
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:49,444
Why did you go into Yoon Jung's room?

31
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,414
You received sexual favors at the vacation home,

32
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:55,784
didn't you?

33
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:59,854
That was why you had to let those people go, right?

34
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,054
You tried to cover up your own sins!

35
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:03,185
That's right!

36
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,194
So what?

37
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,565
Do you know...

38
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:18,935
what happened to Yoon Jung after that?

39
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:23,444
She was trampled upon by men old enough to be her father,

40
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,715
and she died.

41
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,155
At least now,

42
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,854
reveal your own sins.

43
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:43,164
And ask for forgiveness.

44
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,465
Sung Hoon.

45
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,134
I have...

46
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,435
no intention of doing that.

47
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:01,984
Is that so?

48
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:05,585
Then I have no other choice.

49
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,984
I must act according to the plan.

50
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,444
I raised you like my own son for 20 years.

51
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,214
And I gave you a chance to live in a different world.

52
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,545
I've done my repentance with that.

53
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,115
But you try to judge me for that after all these years?

54
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,855
Repentance?

55
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:46,824
Dad!

56
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:57,805
Dad!

57
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:59,634
Dad!

58
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:02,675
Dad, put that down now!

59
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,513
- Let go of me! - Put down the gun!

60
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,944
Sung Jun, it's better for Sung Hoon to die here.

61
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,044
We can make it look like a suicide.

62
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,954
Just because you kill Sung Hoon, it doesn't mean what you did goes away.

63
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:15,424
I know that you let Hope Welfare Center get away with everything...

64
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,355
and that you received sexual favors!

65
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:22,365
I knew you would act this way.

66
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,665
So I called Sung Jun.

67
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,764
This was the only way...

68
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:31,004
to have you arrested in the act.

69
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:35,134
Why you little...

70
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:36,904
Dad!

71
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,944
Dad.

72
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,855
You are under arrest for attempted murder.

73
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:53,225
You have the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent.

74
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,495
You may ask for a review of the legality of your arrest.

75
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,225
Are you happy now?

76
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,394
It turned out the way you wanted it to.

77
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,523
Are you happy now?

78
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,795
The sense of betrayal that you must be feeling...

79
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:36,204
How do you think I felt 20 years ago?

80
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,185
Let me ask you one thing.

81
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,154
Did you ever,

82
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:56,754
at least once,

83
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:01,225
think of me as your brother?

84
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,535
No.

Turning you into Yoon Jae...

88
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:23,815
was also to...

89
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,714
get my revenge on those people.

90

00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:08,604
You're a detective. I need you to help me.

171
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,373
Are you asking me to be your accomplice?

172
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:15,275
Son. You can't put it like that.

173
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,684
I had no idea Chief Yeom...

174
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,754
would do such a thing. I really had no clue at all.

175
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,315
If you had no idea,

176
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:26,094
how come you were so calm when you heard he'd been killed?

177
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:30,094
You knew from the start.

178
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,764
You knew Chief Yeom...

179
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:34,764
had ordered the hit and you let it slide,

180
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:36,733
like you ignored what happened at Hope Welfare 20 years ago.

181
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,135
That darn Hope Welfare Center!

182
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:42,704
Just hearing the name of that place makes me sick.

183
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,405
It's all Sung Hoon's fault.

184
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,574
Nothing would've happened if Sung Hoon didn't go digging.

185
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,444
Both your dad and I,

186
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:53,453
we fell into the trap he set!

187
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:56,555
Sung Hoon set the trap, but I alerted the media.

188
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,394
What?

189
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,494
I knew you'd react like this, so I sent in the videos.

190
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:08,694
You scum.

191
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,035
I'm your mom.

192
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:16,144
I'm not some stranger. I'm your mom!

193
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:17,604
What does family mean to you?

194
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,354
You and your dad...

195
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:31,525
You were my everything.

196
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,025
You were my whole life!

197
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,824
Something that couldn't be damaged over some useless orphans.

198
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,765
You were everything I'd built my success and happiness on!

199
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:53,574
Look at our family now.

200
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,245
We crushed the lives of others, and are we happy now?

201
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:00,854
Are we successful?

202
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,424
We're not, Mom.

203
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:30,584
Minister Na Guk Hee.

204
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,485
You're under arrest for abetting the murder of Bae Chul Ho.

205
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:40,424
No! You dare touch me?

206
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:49,805
Sung Jun.

207
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,005
You...

208
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,134
How can you...

209
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,924
Just so you don't get the wrong idea,

210
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,624
I agreed to release the videos from the restaurant...

211
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:21,495
to put away the evil criminals and tell the world about Hope.

212
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,404
It wasn't to aid your revenge.

213
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:30,275
I know.

214
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:34,315
Why didn't you kill me?

215
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:39,384
To use me to get revenge?

216
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,755
You were never...

217
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:48,854
on the list.

218
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:52,195
You killed some and not others.

219
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,594
Who do you think you are?

220
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,604
Under what grounds?

221
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,045
It may sound like an excuse,

222
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,144
but to make known what happened at Hope back then,

223
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:12,285
I thought my method was the best.

224
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:14,985
It was the best?

225
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:21,495
Is that why you killed Yu Na? Was it?

226
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,364
I asked if she was a part of your plan too.

227
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,474
(May 16, 2022, the day An Tae Ho died)

228
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:38,574
It'll be over soon.

229
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,674
Hello.

230
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,315
Hey.

231
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:48,384
Yoon Jae.

232
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:57,795
Sung Hoon.

233
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,394
An Tae Ho.

234
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,565
If we'd left him at Choi Soon Gil's as I'd planned,

235
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:05,965
he wouldn't have died.

236
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:16,114
You're ticked off that I switched the location.

237
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,814
I thought they'd find him too easily.

238
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:21,015
It wouldn't be fun if they did.

239
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:25,755
"Fun?"

240
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:27,894
Did you just say "fun?"

241
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:30,525
Did we start this for fun?

242
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:42,074
It's not my fault Tae Ho's dead.

243
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,343
I didn't know.

244
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,644
I had no idea that he would take his own life.

245
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,914
If you couldn't predict what would happen, you shouldn't have started!

246
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,413
Do you know what kind of results...

247
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:54,084
came from the things you did for fun?

248
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:58,025
Because you framed Sung Jun, Crazy Dog got involved.

249
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:01,255
And Jung Man Chun's entire family got killed.

250
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,324
What about Kang Ha Na?

251
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:05,664
Did you kill her for fun too?

252
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,535
Just get lost.

253
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,344
I don't need the likes of you anymore.

254
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,285
Sung Hoon.

255
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:28,914
I'm sorry.

256
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:31,055
But...

257
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,654
don't say you don't need me.

258
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,975
If Yoon Jae drops out, I'll drop out too.

259
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,755
At some point,

260
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:03,955
it became something I couldn't control.

261
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:08,695
Even Yu Na.

262
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,634
But I still can't forgive you.

263
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,275
Ryu Sung Hoon.

264
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,945
Regardless of what you had to endure there...

265
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,005
and what kind of things happened,

266
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,844
that's no excuse for murder.

267
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,785
Watch carefully...

268
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:38,955

275
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:38,545
Hold on.

00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,144
my dear Ji Eun would still be alive!

338
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:18,824
Back then and even now, you're nothing more than Number 13.

339
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:33,604
Beg me to save your life!

340
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:09,035
I will do to you exactly what you did to Ji Eun.

341
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,164
Number 13.

342
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:38,535
If it weren't for you,

343
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:40,574
Ji Eun...

344
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,374
and I...

345
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:45,404
Ji Eun...

346
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,945
My Ji Eun...

347
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:02,094
So...

348
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:08,265
if you had just killed me back then...

349
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,434
Things wouldn't have gotten...

350
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:18,344
this bad.

351
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:35,295
Okay.

352
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:39,265
By the way, did you hear the news?

353
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:43,035
- News? - Your accomplice, Jung Yoon Jae.

354
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:44,805
I hear he died.

355
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:50,975
Why?

356
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,275
I hear he died fighting with someone.

357
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:56,174
The other guy died too.

358
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,114
Okay.

359
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:01,584
I don't think you need the bandages anymore.

360
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,584
Let's see here.

361
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:18,864
(Sosoo)

362
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,664
Lee Jung Soo.

363
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,704
I'll trust that you'll take good care of Yoon Jae...

364
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,434
if something happens to me.

365
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,845
I'll protect you and Yoon Jae, no matter what.

366
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:34,874
We're family.

367
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,115
It's okay. You should eat it.

368
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:41,584
I knew you'd come back alive.

369
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,954
I want to go with you.

370
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:46,894
Yoon Jae. Wake up.

371
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:48,525
We have to get out of here.

372
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,494
Crazy Dog is coming after us.

373
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,834
You didn't betray me, did you?

374
00:34:58,405 --> 00:34:59,434
Hey.

375
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:02,704
You can't do this.

376
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:21,854
Ryu Sung Hoon.

377
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,825
Whatever you went through in that place,

378
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:28,865
no matter what happened,

379
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:33,034
that can't be an excuse for murder.

380
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:32,873
Ryu Sung Hoon has attempted suicide...

381
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:36,473
He was found close to death from excessive bleeding.

382
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:53,462
He had lots of scarring that looked to be from self-harm.

383
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:57,533
I thought you should know as his family.

384
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:36,933
Do you know why I became a cop?

385
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:42,842
I wanted your acknowledgment.

386
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:49,013
Even though I couldn't live as greatly as you,

387
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:51,953
I wanted you to acknowledge...

388
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:55,092
that I was good for something too.

389
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:00,022
(Ryu Sung Hoon)

390
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:01,493
In my eyes,

391
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,663
you were the coolest guy in the world.

392
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:07,933
I didn't know...

393
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,373
you were so cowardly and evil.

394
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,272
Just because you do this,

395
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:21,112
it doesn't mean your sins go away.

396
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:25,723
Live to the very end...

397
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,592
and live the rest of your life in pain.

398
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:31,592
That's...

399
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:34,592
how you will pay for your sins.

400
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:54,183
(Tell Us About Hope)

401
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:01,652
(We believe.)

402
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:05,723
Hey. How did you come here?

403
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:07,833
Oh, well...

404
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:11,103
I was walking by and ended up here by chance.

405
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:14,802
Well, it doesn't seem that way.

406
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,203
Are things going well?

407
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,572
I'm working hard.

408
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:22,712
Do you need any help?

409
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:28,682
I think I will get myself sorted out...

410
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:30,413
once the case on Hope Welfare Center is resolved.

411
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:36,752
Good idea. Then let's see.

412
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:39,263
- I don't like where the cage is. - Excuse me.

413
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,293
Is there anything I can help with?

414
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:45,533
Oh, right.

415
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,571
I'm Park Mu Hyeok.

416
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:52,103
(Attorney Park Mu Hyeok)

417
00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:57,342
I was actually there too. At Hope Welfare Center.

418
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:03,251
Then you must know Number 11 well.

419
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:04,252
Of course.

420
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:07,453
Number 11's nickname was the Papillon of Hope Welfare Center.

421
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,163
Why do you want to help us?

422
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,063
I tried hard to forget about things until now.

423
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:18,962
It was too horrible to think about it.

424
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:22,271
I thought I was taking revenge if I did well in my life,

425
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,533
so I studied my butt off.

426
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:27,373
But to be frank, I ran away by myself.

427
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:32,283
But as I watched the Ryu Sung Hoon case,

428
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:33,913
I realized something.

429
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,413
I still had...

430
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:39,583
anger and pain inside my heart.

431
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,022
I'm sure the other victims feel the same way too.

432
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:47,421
I learned that victims' silence...

433
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:49,192
only helps the assailant.

434
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:51,732
That's why I decided to pluck up my courage.

435
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:53,962
What can we do?

436
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,602
When the suspect was caught shortly after the murder took place,

437
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:58,901
people were intrigued for a short while.

438
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:02,212
But now that some time has passed, many have forgotten about the case.

439
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:04,683
Well...

440
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:08,212
One moment, please.

441
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,953
- Hello? - Detective Ryu Sung Jun?

442
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:16,421
Yes, speaking.

443
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:18,422
I'm the prosecutor in charge of Ryu Sung Hoon's case.

444
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:21,063
He requested a jury trial.

445
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:23,632
A jury trial?

446
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:34,242
A jury trial for Ryu Sung Hoon, the culprit...

447
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:36,312
in the Hope Welfare Center case as known as "Juror Murders,"

448
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:38,982
is about to take place.

449
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:40,812
This is such a crazy case.

450
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:43,352
- I know. - It's nuts.

451
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:44,782
Right?

452
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:46,322
It's insane.

453
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:49,992
- Hey, look. - Excuse me.

454
00:41:49,993 --> 00:41:51,092
Excuse me.

455
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:02,973
I wonder what will happen.

Case Number 2022GH-2004.

465
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:13,373
We will now begin the jury trial for Defendant Ryu Sung Hoon's...

466
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,672
instigation of murder...

467
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:18,982
and aiding and abetting murder charges.

468

(Court)

Jurors.

470
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:32,663
Twenty years ago, the children at Hope Welfare Center...

471
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:35,163
were assaulted, murdered,

472
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,132
and forced to provide sexual favors.

473
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:41,672
The dead children's bodies were donated as cadavers.

474
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:44,302
Things that you can't even imagine took place at the welfare center.

475
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,841
- My gosh. - That's nuts.

476
00:43:46,842 --> 00:43:48,612
Look at this notebook.

477
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:53,712
This contains a petition which describes the abuse...

478
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:57,013
he had to tolerate while locked up at the welfare center.

479
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:02,223
The defendant was only 15 at the time.

480
00:44:02,493 --> 00:44:03,852
He submitted this petition...

481
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:06,293
to Mr. Ryu Il Ho, the judge in charge of the case,

482
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:08,563
but it was never submitted to the court.

483
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:11,163
In order to protect himself...

484
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:14,433
and his wife, Minister Na Guk Hee,

485
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:17,402
Mr. Ryu Il Ho downplayed the case and covered up this evidence.

486
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:20,243
That's just too cruel for such a young boy.

487
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:25,543
This courtroom was the boy's last hope,

488
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:28,013
but his testimony was ignored,

489
00:44:28,513 --> 00:44:30,513
and the assailants who hurt him 20 years ago...

490
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,882
still haven't paid for what they did.

491
00:44:36,723 --> 00:44:37,752
Mr. Ryu.

492
00:44:38,223 --> 00:44:41,962
When did you decide to take revenge against them?

493
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:46,901
The day I found out Yoon Jung had died.

494
00:44:46,902 --> 00:44:48,172
Who is Yoon Jung?

495
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:50,833
Yoon Jung was like my sister...

496
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,842
when I was young.

497
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:11,522
Yoon Jung.

498
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:13,692
Yoon Jung...

499
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:18,632
Yoon Jung!

500
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,933
Yoon Jung!

501
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:24,373
Yoon Jung.

502
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:29,913
Yoon Jung!

503
00:45:33,842 --> 00:45:36,783
We parted ways as soon as we arrived at Hope Welfare Center.

504
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,182
Yoon Jung...

505
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:41,793
Then I found her body secretly buried in the cold woods.

506
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:46,123
That was the moment when I decided to take revenge.

507
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:49,893
- Gosh. - My goodness.

508
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:54,163
How did you find out that she was buried there?

509
00:45:54,933 --> 00:45:58,103
The nurse at the welfare center told me.

510
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:00,842
Your Honor.

511
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,542
Ms. Jo In Sook was the nurse at the welfare center.

512
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,482
I'd like to call Ms. Jo to the witness stand.

513
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:12,183
(Witness)

514
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:16,993
The people at Hope Welfare Center...

515
00:46:18,563 --> 00:46:21,192
locked the girls in the vacation home...

516
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:26,263
and forced them to provide sexual favors.

517
00:46:27,462 --> 00:46:28,533
That's crazy.

518
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:34,373
Yoon Jung was one of those girls.

519
00:46:39,442 --> 00:46:40,442
My gosh.

520
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:44,822
Hey.

521
00:46:45,453 --> 00:46:46,853
Wake up.

522
00:46:47,322 --> 00:46:49,452
I'll take you to the hospital.

523
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:50,723
Hang in there, okay?

524
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:04,333
No! Hey.

525
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:05,902
Hey!

526
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:14,952
I told Number 11...

527
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:16,283
(Defendant)

528
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:20,322
I mean, that man.

529
00:47:21,723 --> 00:47:25,393
I told him where Yoon Jung was buried.

530
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:31,063
Yoon Jung asked me to, before she breathed her last.

531
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:35,603
Then why didn't you...

532
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:38,502
say that in the courtroom 20 years ago?

533
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:42,942
That's...

534
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:54,893
(Jury)

535
00:47:57,953 --> 00:47:59,723
I was scared. That's why.

536
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,362
The manager...

537
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,132
of Hope Welfare Center...

538
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,243
raped me as well.

539
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:16,672
- Gosh. - My goodness.

540
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:23,382
Because of that,

541
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:26,482
I got pregnant.

542
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:29,422
But I couldn't give up on the baby.

543
00:48:30,993 --> 00:48:34,623
And I absolutely didn't want my child to find out the truth.

544
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:39,002
That's why I lied.

545
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:43,502
I'm sorry.

546
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,103
I'm really sorry.

547
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:51,942
- Oh, dear. - That's horrible.

548
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:54,083
I feel so bad for her.

Mr. Ryu, you chose whom to take revenge on...

550
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,682
and made them sit on the jury...

551

at the jury trial for Baek Ji Eun's case.

552
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,163
Why did you make them sit on the jury?

553
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:07,263
Why did you plan something like this?

The officers who hit and tortured the young children...

were all good husbands and fathers at home.

The nurse who treated the kids.

567

The police station chief who had a duty to protect us too.

568
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:48,001
- They were all ordinary people. - Okay, here we go!

569

Wait, hold on.

I don't see Producer Bae.

Mr. Baek, have you seen Producer Bae?

572

No, I'll look for him.

573
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,652
Sorry! I'm here.

574
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:04,853
Sorry about that. I'm late, aren't I? Sorry.

575
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:08,252
Okay, I'll take it now. Everyone, look at the camera.

Even a small splinter in their kid's finger makes them worry like crazy.

579
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:18,263
But as we were getting pummeled...

580
00:50:19,203 --> 00:50:21,203
and starving to death,

581
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:23,603

when they were parents themselves...

583

and had families of their own.

584
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,842
That's what made me fall into such deep despair.

And that's why...

586
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:43,453
I wanted to ask them this question.

You investigated the Hope Welfare Center murder case...

Then why were they killed?

The victims...

600
00:51:22,727 --> 00:51:26,196
were sacrificed because of the defendant's plan to get his revenge.

601
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,207
Then what exactly did Mr. Ryu Sung Hoon do?

602
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,206
To get his revenge...

(Witness)

604

He came up with the plan for all the murders.

605
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,896
So far, I've lived as the younger brother...

606
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:55,466
of Ryu Sung Hoon, the defendant.

607

My father is Ryu Il Ho, and my mother is Na Guk Hee.

608
00:52:00,997 --> 00:52:03,267
My parents were connected to Hope Welfare Center as well,

609
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,836
and the defendant always lied to me even when we were little...

610
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:08,847
to manipulate my memories.

611
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:11,146
On top of that,

612
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:14,986
once the murders began,

613
00:52:16,486 --> 00:52:20,557
he even made me look like a suspect in the case.

614
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:25,626
In a way, we could say that your family did that to you.

615
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:27,956
Don't you want to get back at him?

616
00:52:27,957 --> 00:52:29,466
Anyone would want to get their revenge...

617
00:52:31,537 --> 00:52:34,437
when they suffered unjustly.

618
00:52:38,066 --> 00:52:42,376
But not everyone in such a situation commits murder.

No motive...

620
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,586
can or should justify murder.

I didn't request a jury trial...

627
00:53:49,207 --> 00:53:51,546
because I thought my revenge was justified...

628

or because I wanted a lighter sentence.

629
00:54:00,457 --> 00:54:01,787

630

confessing to my crimes and uncovering the truth...

I'm Jo Eun Ki, a social worker from Muyeong Community Children's Center.

654
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:29,195
Hope Welfare Center was built in Muyeong in 1990.

655
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,667
In September of 2002, it was suddenly shut down,

656
00:57:31,966 --> 00:57:34,867
so some of the children were adopted by families in different countries,

657
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:37,236
and the others ended up being scattered too.

658

Most people have forgotten about the Hope Welfare Center case,

659
00:57:40,736 --> 00:57:42,605
but the victims are still traumatized...

660
00:57:42,606 --> 00:57:44,477
by what they went through.

661
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:47,346
And many are afraid to talk about their experiences...

662
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:49,387
because of the social prejudice.

663
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:54,086
It is important to punish those who hurt them, but most importantly,

664
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:56,326
we should find the victims who are still hiding...

665
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:58,597
and help them.

672
00:58:14,078 --> 00:58:15,307
Thank you.

673
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:24,586
You must be tired.

674
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:27,887
I must've been very nervous during the press conference.

675
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:35,267
The requirements for the tort suit seemed very tricky.

676
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,666
The prep is coming along smoothly, right?

677
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:39,497
Well, the thing is...

678
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:43,537
It all boils down to whether or not what your mother did...

679
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,105
would be considered abuse of authority...

680
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:46,537
by a person entrusted with public service.

681
00:58:47,676 --> 00:58:49,546
What does that mean?

682
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:51,577
It refers to when the government...

683
00:58:52,276 --> 00:58:56,086
entrusts an individual or organization with public authority.

684
00:58:56,816 --> 00:58:59,957
It all boils down to whether or not my mother abused that authority,

685
00:59:00,657 --> 00:59:02,327
and whether we can prove it.

686
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:05,296
Yes, that's exactly right.

687
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,296
Anyway...

688
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:13,596
Just for 5 minutes... No, can we nap for 30 minutes?

689
00:59:13,597 --> 00:59:14,937
We can talk after that. What do you say?

690
00:59:15,307 --> 00:59:18,437
I'm getting sleepy because it's so warm here.

691
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:22,106
Oh, boy. I should lie down.

692
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:26,316
Nice. I love how private and cozy this room is.

693
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:29,517
Just 30 minutes, okay?

I hope...

699
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:39,017
you can escape the past.

Nice move.

704

If the boys from 20 years ago...

708
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:25,816
had someone like Eun Ki, how would things have changed?

If there were adults...

710

who didn't ignore the truth and fought to the end,

711
01:03:31,486 --> 01:03:35,057
could they have been able to live a life different to the ones now?

712
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:37,596
If so,

713
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:41,566
they'd be living well somewhere out there around us.

714
