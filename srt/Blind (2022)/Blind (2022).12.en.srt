Sung Jun. How's Sung Hoon?

5
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,924
He's still in surgery.

6
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:24,295
What's going on?

7
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:28,165
Who did this? Why?

8
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:30,305
Well...

9
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:33,033
Are you Ryu Sung Hoon's guardians?

10
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:35,704
Yes, I'm his mother.

11
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,704
How's my son doing?

12
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,314
The weapon hit his organs and went into his bones.

13
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,014
He's out of the woods for now,

14
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:44,545
but I can't guarantee that he'll regain consciousness.

15

16
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:49,185
Let's keep an eye on him for now.

(Episode 12: Another Person's Life)

18
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,055
Sung Hoon. Look at me!

19
00:02:58,624 --> 00:02:59,655
Yoon Jae!

20
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,495
Yoon Jae, no!

21

Eun Ki.

22
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,224
- What happened? - He was attacked by the culprit.

23
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:32,995
Why was he attacked?

24
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:40,294
I think he figured out who the culprit was.

25
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:42,965
I had no idea, and I suspected him.

26
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:47,705
Once I started suspecting him, I couldn't stop.

27
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,805
Why would you suspect him? Did something happen?

28
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,715
He was going after the culprit on his own.

29
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,784
I guess I suspected him for no reason.

30
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:18,305
- How's Judge Ryu doing? - Nothing has changed.

31
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:40,794
Darn it.

32
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,135
Gosh.

33
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,395
This is the culprit caught on a wildlife observation camera.

34
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:19,695
- Are you sure this is the culprit? - Yes, sir.

35
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:21,664
He looks like the person I saw...

36
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,604
at Hope Welfare Center on the day An Tae Ho died.

37
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,973
Was he caught on any other CCTV cameras?

38
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:28,505
This is the only camera that he was caught on.

39
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,913
He figured out the locations of all the CCTV cameras in the park...

40
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,174
and moved meticulously to avoid them.

41
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,914
The culprit probably didn't know there was a camera here.

42
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,113
Did you find the weapon?

43
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,784
No. We didn't find anything at the scene of the crime.

44
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:42,325
We found...

45
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,723
a part of the weapon the culprit used in Judge Ryu's body,

46
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,724
so we sent it to Forensics to analyze it.

47
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,094
And the only witness is currently unconscious.

48
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:55,405
Who on earth is this?

49

Out of the five people who escaped Hope Welfare Center,

50
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,843
who hasn't been identified yet?

51
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,705
- Number 12 and Number 24. - What?

52
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,114
An Tae Ho said that Number 24 was dead.

53
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:10,113
We have to find the body.

54
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:11,715
We can't believe anything before then.

55
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:12,913
We can't find it.

56
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,514
How would we know where he was buried?

57
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:17,625
Dong Hwa! My brother was stabbed!

58
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:21,255
Plus, when did we go after something knowing we'd find it?

59
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,525
We look for it because we have to find it!

60
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:24,895
We have to find it no matter what!

61
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,405
I'm sorry.

62

63

I'll find Number 12 and Number 24.

64

65

77
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:26,125

78
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,065

You said the victim had a developmental disability, right?

169
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,235
Yes.

170
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:11,135
His intelligence is around the age of seven.

171
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,834
If he sees a man or if someone calls him by name,

172
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:15,674
he goes into a convulsive panic.

173
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:19,913
Then if the victim's family agrees to it,

174
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,345
I'll try meeting with him.

175
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:25,015
But will you be okay?

176
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,615
You should get some rest.

177
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,355
No.

178
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,054
I think it would be better to do something.

179
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,255
Nothing changes just because I sit around and do nothing.

180
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:41,595
I'll go to the center and get some tools for counseling.

181
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,734
Should I come with you?

182
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,464
No, it's fine. I'll be back.

183
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,044
Hi, In Seong.

184
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,784
- Here. - Thank you.

185
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:37,784
You seem like such a good person.

186
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:40,953
If you don't get any rest because you're looking after others,

187
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:42,424
then who looks after you?

188
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,664
I'm not as good a person as you think I am.

189
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,235
I'm so self-centered.

190
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:54,405
How did we end up getting swept up in this mess?

191
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:58,775
What do you think is the reason?

192
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:04,284
My mom worked as a nurse at Hope Welfare Center.

193
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,314
I only found out recently.

194
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,284
What about you?

195
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,323
I'm not sure.

196
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,755
I don't even know who my birth parents are.

197
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,095
Didn't you hear from Detective Ryu?

198
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,905
I thought you already knew since you two were close.

199
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,105
No, I didn't know.

200
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,933
Have you looked for your birth parents?

201
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,345
No, I didn't look for them.

202
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,804
I didn't want to burden them.

203
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,674
It must've been hard for them to give up their child.

204
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,345
I get it.

205
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:41,155
There are some family members that I'd rather not see.

206
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:46,725
But your parents might be looking for you.

207
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,664
They might have lost you, not given you up.

208
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,664
If they had the will to find me, wouldn't they have already done so?

209
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,265
It's not like this country is as big as the US.

210
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,304
Lots of things don't go according to one's will.

211
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,235
Do what your heart tells you to.

212
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:06,214
Finding your family is a really important decision.

213
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,544
(Apartment Complex 3)

214
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,394
There are lots of numbers.

215
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:29,664
What are all of these?

216
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:34,764
Should I stop talking?

217
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:36,734
Drink this.

218
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:14,003
(Closed on the 2nd and 4th Sunday)

219
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:16,375
(Please help find In Seong)

220
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:26,414
What are you doing there?

221
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:28,013
(Please help find In Seong)

222
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,625
I came to eat, not knowing you were closed.

223
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,555
Sorry.

224
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,924
Stay and eat.

225
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:37,264
It's fine, come in.

226
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,295
It's okay.

227
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:41,734
Come and eat.

228
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:44,434
Come on inside.

229
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,984
You must be hungry. Eat up.

230
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:15,805
What is it?

231
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:19,004
Is the food too shabby? Do you want something else?

232
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,645
No. I'll enjoy the food, thanks.

233
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,785
So...

234
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,595
That boy in the photo. Is he your son?

235
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:43,763
(Please help find In Seong)

236
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:46,335
Yes. That's my son.

237
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,664
He still looks like that when he comes to me in my dreams.

238
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:56,875
It has been 20 years, and I don't know how he'd look now.

239
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:08,914
Do you miss him?

240
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:12,224
Of course, I do.

241
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:15,395
My son's face.

242
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:19,335
I wish...

243
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:23,805
I could see it just once. I'd wish for nothing more.

244
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:31,244
Why would you ask about that?

245
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,115
Twenty years ago,

246
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,714
I lost my mother.

247
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,254
I don't remember anything else,

248
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:48,694
but I remember what she looked like.

249
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,395
She wore a gray coat,

250
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:55,535
beige pants,

251
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,664
and white trainers.

252
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:15,184
And...

253
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:19,295
she bought me vanilla ice cream, my favorite.

254
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,035
How do you...

255
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,045
know that?

256
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:39,943
(Please help find In Seong)

257
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:41,345
The boy in that photo...

258
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:44,585
is me.

259
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:00,865
I'm...

260
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:04,905
your son In Seong.

261
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:07,335
Mom.

262
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,694
In Seong.

263
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:38,734
Are you my son In Seong?

264
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:43,004
Thank you...

265
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,615
Are you In Seong?

266
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,684
Are you my son?

267
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:55,513
My goodness...

268
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:58,484
My son is back.

269
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:05,524
(Please help find In Seong)

270
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,335
My goodness...

271
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,285
This is what Jin Gu drew all day long.

272
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,285
They're all numbers.

273
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:29,785
I think they're the numbers of the kids from the welfare center.

274
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,095
Jin Gu's still stuck in the fear and anxiety...

275
00:23:34,924 --> 00:23:37,595
from 20 years ago with the other kids.

276
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:43,135
It'll take a long time.

277
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:47,305
He might never talk.

278
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,604
It would help me get through to him...

279
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,545
if I knew exactly what happened.

280
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:04,924
I have something...

281
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:08,125
to show you.

282
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,234
The place was a huge prison.

283
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:16,964
Every day, morning to night,

284
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,835
we were put to work at an incineration plant.

285
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:22,274
Whether you were young or sick,

286
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,444
there was no exception.

287
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:27,974
All we got to eat...

288
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,145
was doenjang broth with rotten vegetables...

289
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,285
and a ball of rice.

290
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:35,684
We were always hungry.

291
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:41,325
Kids who died of an illness or a beating...

292
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:44,694
disappeared before anyone knew.

293
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:50,305
The lucky ones got buried in the mountain.

294
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:52,664
The unlucky ones...

295
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:59,145
got donated to the university to be dissected, we were told.

296
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:18,424
Jung In Seong is your son?

297
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,994
Yes.

298
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:23,503
I found him again, thanks to you.

299
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:26,575
My gosh. Congratulations, ma'am.

300
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,434
Congratulations.

301
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:31,674
Thank you. Thank you so much.

302
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:33,944
I still don't believe it.

303
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:37,413
Are you sure? Did you compare your DNA?

304
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:40,214
Why would I even bother doing that?

305
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:42,984
Would a mom not recognize her son?

306
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,654
You'd better all come to the party.

307
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:47,824
Okay?

308
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:49,923
I'll feed you enough...

309
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,933
so that your bellies explode and for free, okay?

310
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,494
- Yes. - Ma'am.

311
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:58,305
This is a police station, and what you said was recorded.

312
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:01,004
We'll starve ourselves for a week before the party.

313
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:05,345
I wish you'd work on the cases this enthusiastically.

314
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:10,944
Sorry. I'm so happy I'm out of my mind.

315
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,584
- Get back to work. - Okay.

316
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,013
- Bye. - Take care.

317
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:16,055
See you.

318
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,723
Gosh. What a coincidence.

319
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:19,724
Chief.

320
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,024
Ma'am. Did you deliver some food?

321
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:25,825
Thank you. I found my In Seong.

322
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,135
You found your son?

323
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:32,365
Yes. Thank you, sir.

324
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:35,733
You tried so hard to find him for me.

325
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,674
I'll make it up to you forever.

326
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,405
Thank you.

327
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:46,115
Let's not do this here. Come to my office.

328
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:48,184
- It's this way. - Okay.

329
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,234
Have some tea.

330
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:07,105
You never know what'll happen, do you?

331
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,805
He was missing for 20 years, and now he's back.

332
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:13,444
I know.

333
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:18,214
If I'd known he was nearby, we could've met sooner.

334
00:27:18,815 --> 00:27:19,815
Yes.

335
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:24,754
Where was your son until now?

336
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:27,855
He doesn't remember.

337
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:30,825
He was in a car crash in the US,

338
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:34,035
and he lost most memories of his childhood.

339
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:37,234
Did he?

340
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:40,934
It's for the better, then.

341
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:45,405
Isn't it?

342
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,494
Don't say anything pointless and just bury it.

343
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:13,204
Some truths are better off...

344
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:15,835
kept a secret.

345
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,754
How pretty!

346
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,895
I'm going to blow bubbles.

347
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:40,135
Do you want to blow bubbles too?

348
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:42,934
Do you want to try it too?

349
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:51,045
How pretty!

350
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:53,514
Here you go.

351
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:58,914
That looks like fun.

352
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,624
You're blowing bubbles.

353
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,885
Go ahead.

354
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:06,994
That's right. Like that.

355
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:19,135
How pretty!

356
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:22,004
It's so pretty.

357
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:23,605
You too.

358
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:30,285
We blew bubbles,

359
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:33,254
and we sang songs while hitting a tambourine.

360
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,984
We even baked cookies and ate them.

361
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:41,625
I saw him enjoy himself like a little boy.

362
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:43,994
and it made me so sad.

363
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:49,664
I thought,

364
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:53,434
"He lost his childhood entirely in that place."

365
00:29:58,575 --> 00:29:59,875
Just like you.

366
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:07,414
When you wake up, let's look for it together.

367
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,055
Your lost childhood.

368
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:18,193
(Sosoo)

369
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:19,564
(We are booked for the day and won't take customers.)

370
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:20,895
(Please come back another time.)

371
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:25,564
- Hug! - Hug!

372
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,904
- In Seong, what are you doing? - Hug.

373
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:29,004
- Hurry up and give her a hug! - Hug!

374
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:35,075
This is so nice!

375
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:39,854
- Love shot! - Love shot!

376
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,155
- Love shot. Drink up! - Love shot!

377
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,524
Goodness.

378
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:50,594
Sung Jun. Why are you just standing there?

379
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,565
- Come on in! - Hurry up.

380
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:57,433
- Congratulations. - Let me formally introduce you two.

381
00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:59,564
This is my biological son,

382
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:03,375
and this is someone who is like a son to me.

383
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:08,044
Thank you for being a son to my mom for me.

384
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,845
No need to thank me. I only did the obvious.

385
00:31:11,315 --> 00:31:12,443
Congratulations.

386
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,183
Goodness. Okay.

387
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:16,855
Today's main dish is coming out.

388
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,795
What is this?

389
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:24,423
Auntie, are you sure you're not going overboard?

390
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,164
Eat as much as you want today.

391
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:31,704
- Here. - Thank you for the food.

392
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:36,674
Then let's all have a drink.

393
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:43,075
You must have a cold again.

394
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,513
Would you like some hot water?

395
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,514
Could you get me some?

396
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:51,554
The guest of honor should stay seated.

397
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:53,224
The youngest member of the team will bring you water.

398
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,125
Auntie.

399
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,365
On a day as happy as today,

400
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:01,694
- we have to get drunk. - Goodness.

401
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,404
Okay.

402
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:05,104
Let's just get drunk today.

403
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:08,204
If I get too drunk, I'm sure my son will carry me home.

404
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:10,904
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

405
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:12,973
- That almost sobered me up! - Goodness.

406
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,974
- Are you okay? - Yes.

407
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:19,744
- Oh, my. - Hey!

408
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:21,785
- Oh, dear. - I'm so sorry, In Seong.

409
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:23,584
It's okay.

410
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,884
It's okay. It could happen to anyone.

411
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:27,953
Goodness.

412
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:31,163
Hold on. I think some of it got onto this leg too.

413
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:33,534
It's okay, Mom. Have a seat.

414
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,963
- Are you okay? - Yes.

415
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:37,734
When they escaped, Number 12's ankle...

416
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:39,835
got caught in a trap,

417
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,234
so he had a really bad scar.

418
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:45,105
Goodness gracious.

419
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,244
There you go. You're fine.

420
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:51,345
Right. My son's so good to me.

421
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:57,385
(Sosoo)

422
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,664
What are you doing outside?

423
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:10,865
I just came out for some air.

424
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:12,135
I see.

425
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:21,875
I saw that you had a deep scar on your ankle.

426
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:26,184
When did you get it?

427
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:27,815
This?

428
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:31,555
My adoptive mother told me I had it before I got adopted.

429
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:36,894
You don't remember...

430
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:39,124
how you ended up with such a scar?

431
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,434
I'm not sure,

432
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:42,694
but I think I got caught in a trap.

433
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,504
A trap?

434
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:47,674
I have nightmares sometimes.

435
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,405
I'm running like crazy in the forest,

436
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:54,014
and I get caught in a trap.

437
00:33:58,815 --> 00:33:59,914
Doesn't it sound terrible?

438
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:06,994
Yes. It really does.

439
00:34:18,164 --> 00:34:19,964
I talked to the adoption agency,

440
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,233
and they confirmed that In Seong was adopted to the US...

441
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,504
from Hope Welfare Center in September 2002.

442
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:27,974
Then we're almost certain that Number 12 is Jung In Seong.

443
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:28,975
Yes.

444
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:30,813
What's the likelihood that he's the culprit?

445
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:32,914
Aside from his connection to Hope Welfare Center,

446
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:34,885
there are no circumstances to suggest that.

447
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,084
Then all we have left is Number 24. Right?

448
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:43,394
Do you think that chef could be Number 24?

449
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:46,765
I saw that he was really good with a knife yesterday.

450
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,464
Lee Jung Soo?

451
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:52,165
No. His older brother, Lee Hyun Soo, is more likely.

452
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,805
Do you have a hunch?

453
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:59,004
Lee Jung Soo's parents know Chief Yeom.

454
00:35:00,874 --> 00:35:03,685
Did you perhaps go to Hope Welfare Center as well?

455
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,685
Hope Welfare Center?

456
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,814
Oh, we didn't go to that place ourselves.

457
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:12,685
The station chief in that area looked into it for us.

458
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:14,325
The station chief?

459
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:18,595
Was the station chief's name Yeom Ki Nam?

460
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:21,265
Yes, that's right. It was Chief Yeom Ki Nam.

461
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:24,963
He worked so hard to try and find our Hyun Soo.

462
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:28,075
I think Chief Yeom acted like he was being kind...

463
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,174
to prevent parents...

464
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,704
from finding their missing children.

465
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:34,344
That's why Auntie...

466
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:36,044
couldn't find her son for 20 years.

467
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:40,084
So for 20 years, he ran interference instead of helping.

468
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:41,554
Oh, my.

469
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:45,155
How could a human do something like that?

470
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:48,454
How long must we feign ignorance in front of that jerk?

471
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:50,523
Until we have definite evidence,

472
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,725
don't act rashly. Got it?

473
00:35:58,104 --> 00:36:00,705
Oh, when I went to the chief's office,

474
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:03,504
I saw a photo he seemed to be hiding.

475
00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:06,143
It looked like a skeleton.

476
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:07,444
- A skeleton? - Yes.

477
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:10,345
Do you think it's the one we found last time?

478
00:36:10,444 --> 00:36:12,213
Are you talking about the skeleton we found...

479
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,583
when we were looking for Manager An?

480
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:14,955
- Do you have the photo? - Yes.

481
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:21,194
- Are those the right photos? - Yes.

482
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:42,629
Based on the wisdom teeth,

483
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,739
it seems to be a girl around the age of 14.

484
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,541
I can't figure out the cause of death.

485
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,939
Can you run a DNA test?

486
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,380
I got some bone marrow cells,

487
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,450
but it's an old skeleton,

488
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:55,911
so I can't seem to get any autosomes.

489
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,951
Instead, I could analyze the mitochondria.

490
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,189
Do you have anyone I can compare it to?

491
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
No.

492
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,190
Can you reconstruct her face?

493
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,791
Of course.

494
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,981
Why did the culprit exhume Yoon Jung's remains?

495
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,380
Why was it Yoon Jung of all people?

496
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,760
Take this.

497
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:14,961
What is it?

498
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:17,831
It's the analysis of the broken weapon found in your brother.

499
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,570
The metal substance is very dense.

500
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,541
It can't even be compared to low-cost knives sold in stores.

501
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,239
Something like this is...

502
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,569
probably the work of a big-name artisan in the country.

503
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,641
Is that so?

504
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,481
I inferred the whole shape based on the broken part.

505
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,211
It was a sashimi knife.

506
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:41,751
And there were signs it was used in the kitchen, so look into it.

507
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,300
Welcome.

508
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,101
We're meeting so often.

509
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,621
Are you interested in this knife?

510
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,931
Do you want to try it?

511
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,780
- Seok Gu. - Got it.

512
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,860
They say chefs have their own knives.

513
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
Is that true?

514
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:55,190
To use knives well, you must break them in, just like people.

515
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,090
A knife that has been broken in...

516
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,061
is like an extension of my body.

517
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
No.

518
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,891
Number 45. Let's go on a picnic today.

519
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,751
Do you have a friend you want to go with?

520
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:27,219
Let's take all of these friends here.

521
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,230
Let's take Number 15, Number 19,

522
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:34,470
Number 24, and Number 7 too.

523
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,681
Number seven isn't here.

524
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,711
Number 24 isn't here too.

525
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:54,220
Why? Where did they go?

526
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:01,190
They ran away.

527
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,400
Tae Ho and Number 24 ran away?

528
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,299
You can't use names.

529
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,170
If you do, you get hit!

530
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,109
- No! - No, it's okay.

531
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,439
It's fine. Nobody will hit you here.

532
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,780
My name is Jo Eun Ki. Nobody hit me, right?

533
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,351
My name is Kim Jung Hee.

534
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:24,420
You can't use names.

535
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,791
You get hit. If you get hit, you die.

536
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,590
And Number 45's name is Kim Jin Gu.

537
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,510
Can you call your son by name?

538
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,121
Jin Gu.

539
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:06,990
Jin Gu.

540
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,061
Jin Gu.

541
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,461
Jin Gu. My son.

542
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,030
That's right. That's your name.

543
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,670
That's right. You did well.

544
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:20,400
You did well. You did so well, Jin Gu.

545
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:24,311
Number 24.

546
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,811
Let's take him on a picnic.

547
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,720
Who is Number 24?

548
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,351
Number 24 is...

549
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,110
- Hey, Eun Ki. - I found out Number 24's name.

550
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,041
Number 24 is...

551
00:42:58,181 --> 00:43:00,280
- Hyun Soo. - Hyun Soo?

552
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:05,650
- Lee Hyun Soo? - Yes.

553
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,030
Got it. Thanks.

554
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,831
Mr. Lee Jung Soo.

555
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,201
Did you know that your brother, Lee Hyun Soo,

556
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,740
was at Hope Welfare Center?

557
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:29,371
No.

558
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,541
Is that the truth?

559
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,760
You can't come in here.

560
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:53,331
What are you... What do you think you're doing?

561
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,601
On May 24, at 10pm,

562
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:32,641
where were you and what were you doing?

563
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,069
You already know, so why are you asking?

564
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,570
Say it yourself.

565
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:37,141
Where and what you were doing.

566
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,820
I went like this to your brother Judge Ryu.

567
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,570
Why didn't you throw out the knife?

568
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:14,411
It'd be such a waste to throw out.

569
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:16,981
It's my most cherished knife.

570
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:18,481

00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,231
- What? - He's not the culprit.

574
00:45:38,271 --> 00:45:39,670
That punk is hiding something.

575
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:08,970
Excuse me.

I'm from Muyeong Police Station.

578
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,481
know if this knife was made here?

Yes, it was.

581

Do you remember who bought this knife?

582
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,621
How would I remember that?

583
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,760
But I did write it down in my ledger.

Oh, here it is.

588
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:11,530
The knife was purchased by someone...

589
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,400
named Jung Yoon Jae.

590
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,001
Jung Yoon Jae?

591
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:19,840
Are you sure his name was Jung Yoon Jae?

592
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:22,410
Yes, he was a young man.

593
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:24,340
He said it was for his brother.

594
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,641
He said his brother owned a Japanese restaurant.

595
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,990
Who gave you this knife?

596
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:43,061
- Someone I dearly care about. - Someone you dearly care about?

597
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:49,900
Is that person Jung Yoon Jae?

598
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,141
Jung Yoon Jae?

599
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,380
I don't know such a person.

600
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,121
If it wasn't Jung Yoon Jae,

601
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,621
then was it someone who is impersonating Jung Yoon Jae?

602
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:16,061
Namely, Lee Hyun Soo, your brother?

603
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,340
Mr. Lee Jung Soo.

604

You're not the culprit.

605

When I found this knife in your kitchen,

606
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,190
you seemed as though you had wanted me to find it.

607

Tell me.

608

You know who stabbed my brother, don't you?

609
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:56,970
You're lying to me right now to protect that person.

the message might be referring to someone else.

00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:38,166
(Hwang Go Eun)

669
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:30,087
(Jung In Seong, Muyeong Adoption Center)

670
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:35,197
(Consent to Intercountry Adoption)

671
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:37,627
(Hope Welfare Center, Director Lee Myung Sin)

672
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:04,587
(Jung In Seong)

673
00:58:13,897 --> 00:58:14,897
Jung Yoon Jae?

674
00:58:15,897 --> 00:58:18,737
Jung In Seong was Jung Yoon Jae?

675
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:50,697
You survived that.

676
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:00,475
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

677
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:01,915
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

678
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,276
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

679
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:04,516
(but with doubles and dummies.)

680
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:28,166
(Blind)

681
00:59:28,706 --> 00:59:30,607
- Mom! - How should I kill you?

682
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:34,246
The day of the final party.

683
00:59:35,147 --> 00:59:36,177
Number 45?

684
00:59:36,516 --> 00:59:37,916
Where is my mom? Tell me now.

685
00:59:39,116 --> 00:59:42,987
Maybe Jung Yoon Jae gathered everyone in one place.

686
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:45,456
I'll tell you what you can do to save yourself.

687
00:59:45,726 --> 00:59:48,326
You've got 10 minutes. Just kill 1 of them.

688
00:59:50,027 --> 00:59:51,696
The moment that door opens...

689
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:52,865
A bomb?

690
00:59:52,866 --> 00:59:54,196
It'll explode.

691
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:55,666
What did you do?
