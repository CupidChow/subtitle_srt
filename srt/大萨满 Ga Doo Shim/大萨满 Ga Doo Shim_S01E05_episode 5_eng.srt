1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:18,560

3
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,420

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,840
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

5
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,390
Look at this, Soo Jung.

6
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,920
Beautiful Bodhisattva?

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,790
What is that?

8
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,250
That is...

9
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,700
a shaman place, and he went in there.

10
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,320
Shaman?

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,420
Did Woo Soo see his compatibility or something?

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,470
I don't know.

13
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,010
And yesterday, Doo Shim came out of Woo Soo's home.

14
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,200
Why did Doo Shim go there?

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,220
I don't know.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,130
What is it that you know?

17
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,550
You wore these shoes again.

18
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,710
Oh... what a sharp observer.

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,980
I like these shoes because they are comfortable and go well with any outfit.

20
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,600
Thanks

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,630
for waking Il Ram up.

22
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,900
Are you that worried for Il Ram?

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,420
You kept looking back at him.

24
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,390
He is my only friend. What will I do if he gets the lowest rank and dies?

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,660
Though he's not one to be killed easily.

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,870
You don't think that the lowest rank students committed suicide?

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,590
Suicide?

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,720
The death of people who can't study well is taken so lightly.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,640
It isn't suicide.

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,460
There is someone.

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,310
A murderer who kills the last rank students.

32
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,480
That's unexpected of you.

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,310
I thought you didn't care about the other students.

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,100
It's because of you.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,940
Me?

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,510
Because of you, I can see and hear ghosts.

37
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,560
They all have things to tell me.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,630
Their unfair and vengeful stories that

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,510
someone should hear.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,950
 Na Woo Soo. This is not you.

41
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,580
 Get your senses together.

42
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,490
 It was a mistake.

43
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,030
 It was you.

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,660
 After I got drunk, I jumped...

45
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,360
 It's true that I'm recently opened,

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,490
 but I'll listen to all your stories,

47
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,440
 so listen to me too.

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,900
 So...

49
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,920
 who wants to go first?

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,850
 Please?

51
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,510
 We were just there.

52
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,780
 How were we supposed to know that the truck driver behind us would fall asleep behind the wheel?

53
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,110
 So what happened?

54
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,010
 They definitely told me that it would be a simple surgery...

55
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,650
 I mixed strawberry, and banana, and yogurt and was going to eat—

56
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,340
 Was I going to eat up my husband or something?

57
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,900
 I didn't know that the Han river was so deep.

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,270
 I couldn't even tell them I was leaving.

59
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,100
 That's unbelievable.

60
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,120
 Now, it's my turn.

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,610
 Someone

62
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,900
 came in here.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,220
 No.

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,130
 A person, not a ghost.

65
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,470
 A person who made my heart beat.

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,030
 She came in here and

67
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,030
 ran with me whenever my heart raced.

68
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,070
 This has never happened before,

69
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,850
 so I don't know what to do.

70
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,990
 What should I do?

71
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,070
 So this is a difficult question for ghosts too.

72
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,770
You...

73
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,790
listened to all of that instead of ignoring them?

74
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,110
I gave you the talisman.

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,910
Doo Shim!

76
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,220
Why are you here?

77
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,860
I...

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,480
That is...

79
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,420
Why are you here?

80
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,040
Me?

81
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,960
I came here because they said that the shaman here is good.

82
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,080
No.

83
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,050
She is not good at all.

84
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,160
The shaman here is a fraud.

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
Fraud?

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,310
When did you come?

87
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,940
You said you hated rumors spreading in school that you were a shaman's daughter. How come you brought a friend?

88
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,960
Welcome.

89
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,140
I heard you were a shaman's daughter.

90
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,350
Doo Shim is your daughter?

91
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,640
That is why Woo Soo asked you to see compatibility.

92
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,630
I'm upset.

93
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,850
You didn't even tell me.

94
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,300
I thought of you as a friend.

95
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,140
Friend?

96
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,210
I'm not that petty.

97
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,290
I'll keep this a secret.

98
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,620
Instead,

99
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,010
tell me what you think of Woo Soo.

100
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,540
Woo Soo?

101
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,110
I don't think of him in any way.

102
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,690
Really?

103
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,660
He's the same as the others.

104
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,580
Just a classmate.

105
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,430
Thank goodness.

106
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,200
Don't cross the line.

107
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,650
Then I won't cross it either.

108
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,380
See you at school.

109
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,870
I thought about it all night.

110
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,370
Something is strange.

111
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,340
I can see other ghosts,

112
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,190
but why can't I see the ghosts of the students who died in our school?

113
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,160
Have you seen them?

114
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,820
What's wrong with you?

115
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm tired of talking about ghosts.

116
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,050
Let's stop talking about it.

117
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,990
What's wrong?

118
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,830
Nothing's wrong.

119
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,950
Why? Tell me what it is.

120
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,330
Let's go.

121
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,670
What happened?

122
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,420
I died?

123
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,620
I didn't do it.

124
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,150
I never intended on dying.

125
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,470
I'm scared.

126
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,580
Remember this right here,

127
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:31,040
and when you read it, combine all the prepositions...

128
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,160
Get lost.

129
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,940
Why?

130
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,400
I said to get lost!

131
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,980
What? You get lost.

132
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,910
No. That's not it.

133
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,960
Really unbelievable.

134
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,340
Do you really want to die?

135
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,180
Let go.

136
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,580
You have to think of your father and stop getting into trouble.

137
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,080
You know you are very annoying, right?

138
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,940
I can be when I want to.

139
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,120
You guys hugged and made such a fuss. Now you guys can't live without each other?

140
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,180
This is getting on my nerves.

141
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,140
Why are you getting involved in my problems? What it has to do with you?

142
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,380
Was that something to get this mad about?

143
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,540
Getting attention is what I hate the most in the world.

144
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,150
But because of you, everyone is whispering about me.

145
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,340
Don't care about that.

146
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,130
It is so annoying. How can I not care about it?

147
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,470
Please let me be.

148
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,250
There is an evil spirit in Songyeong High School.

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,080
It only kills the last rank students.

150
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,010
So, stop worrying about me, and worry about Il Ram instead.

151
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,150

152
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,660
You really have told him that, Ga Doo Shim.

153
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,000
 There is an evil spirit in Songyeong High School.

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,100
 It only kills the last rank students.

155
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,310
 Ghosts come inside people's bodies too?

156
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,240
 Only souls with special powers.

157
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,750
 What? Do you think I'm scared of dying?

158
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,330
 I'm not scared at all.

159
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,780

160
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,620

161
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,480
You didn't need to come out.

162
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,680
What happened?

163
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,170
Didn't you come to see me?

164
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,830
I guess your mother hasn't told you.

165
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,270
She asked me to come home.

166
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,340
I didn't hear from her. Have a nice time.

167
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,570
Where are you going? Are you going to meet Doo Shim?

168
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,770
It won't be good for you if you provoke me.

169
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
You shouldn't be provoking me,

170
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,180
if you don't want me to introduce you to my new friends.

171
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,770
Why do you want to bother me?

172
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,800
I have no intention of disturbing you. I just have something to ask you.

173
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
What is it?

174
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,480
What should we do if there is an evil spirit in the school, as you said?

175
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,260
What do you mean "what should we do"?

176
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,710
He will kill the last rank student again, right?

177
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,460
Is there a way to catch him before he does that?

178
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,860
Do you think evil spirits are like Casper the Friendly Ghost?

179
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,280
We can only hope that it won't be us or our friends.

180
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,300
There's nothing we can do.

181
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,430
What would you do if it was your friend?

182
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,590
I don't have friends.

183
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,220
Okay?

184
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,960

185
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,400
An incompetent student comes from an incompetent Teacher.

186
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,150
I knew this would happen.

187
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,560
 The other problems were quite easy.

188
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,330
 Look at Doo Shim.

189
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,840
Doo Shim.

190
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,950
I heard you are a shaman's daughter.

191
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,270
Am I right?

192
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,080
Tell us. We won't tell anyone else. Am I right?

193
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,130
Look at her expression. You're right.

194
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,850
She is really a shaman's daughter.

195
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,930
I told you, didn't I?

196
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,990
 No matter how hard I try to avoid it, the ending is always the same.

197
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,260
 The more I try to resist it,

198
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,830
 in the end, I still have no choice but to leave.

199
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,450
What are you guys doing right now?

200
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,680
Everyone, get back to your seats.

201
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,590
Guys, the exam scores are out.

202
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,580
The first rank is again from our class.

203
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,250
What about the last rank?

204
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,160
Stop!

205
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,270

206
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,050
Crazy jerk, don't you think of becoming a celebrity later.

207
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,820
I will tell everyone that you were involved in school violence.

208
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,600
I taught you the expected questions.

209
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,620
They were almost the same as those.

210
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,660
- Is that so? 
 - Is that so?

211
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,580
What happened? Tell me, you punk!

212
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,760
It's annoying.

213
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,530
What is?

214
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,260
Not doing it because you want to,

215
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,520
but doing it because you are scared that you will die.

216
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,630
I have no intention of studying.

217
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,920
So you got it wrong on purpose?

218
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,060
No. I honestly forgot everything you taught me yesterday.

219
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,320
Get your bag from the class.

220
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,280
- Why? 
 - Don't ask me why.

221
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,440
Let's go somewhere together.

222
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,950
- Where? 
 - Wherever.

223
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,360
We have to get out of this school for now.

224
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,220
It's time for you to eat.

225
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,180
Listen to me.

226
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,620
Don't worry, you jerk.

227
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,290
I won't die.

228
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,650
If it wants to come at me, tell it to come. I'll rip it to pieces.

229
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,500
What?

230
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,710
What's wrong?

231
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,820
Something is there.

232
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,320
 Doo Shim.

233
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,000

 ~ Preview ~

240
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
 What the hell is it?

241
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
 Why don't you tell me anything?

242
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,850
 The evil spirit that disappeared ten years ago was in Songyeong High School.

243
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,200
 He has been killing the students.

244
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,020
 I can't handle him. I'm going to buy you some time, so run away.

245
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,400
 It has become the school that all the parents in South Korea want to send their kids to.

246
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,470
 How do you know about it in so much detail, Mom?

247
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,280
 Is the evil spirit the chairman of the foundation?

248
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,610
 How can the first rank student be friends with the last rank student of the school?

249
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,100
 I can't kill you, but I can make you suffer.

250
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,490
 Is it possible that something happened to him because of hanging out with her?

251
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,470
 That is the secret of Il Ram.

252
