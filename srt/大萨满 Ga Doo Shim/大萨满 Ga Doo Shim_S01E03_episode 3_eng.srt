1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,480
So in order for the angle of AB to get closer to this...

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,250

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,240
Daebak. Daebak. Hey, big news. They say that, when Jong Geun jumped yesterday,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,590
she was next to him.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,630
What? The transfer student?

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,340
She must have pushed Jong Geun.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,090
She forcefully pushed Jong Geun, who didn't want to die.

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,280
But why would she do that to Jong Geun?

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,290
Maybe she has some grudge against him.

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,230
That could be true.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,240
What?

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,170
It's the rule here to trouble the transfer students for nonsense reasons.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,760
-That's the rule. 
 -That's right.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,220
Excuse me. You.

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,060
Do you happen to read compatibility?

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,750
Can you see the compatibility between me and her?

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,070
If we are compatible or not.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,870
What is he saying?

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,720
Why?

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,530
Why would she read compatibility?

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,080
  - Aren't your grandmother and mom shamans?
 - My wallet disappeared.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,340
 - You must be a shaman too. 
 - You would know if you're a shaman.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,060
 I'm going to go crazy because of my parents.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,480
 - I wish they would just disappear! 
 - Can you see Jong Geun's ghost?

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,900
 Stop it, all of you. Doo Shim might....

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,430
 - Please stop. 
 - ...kill us all.

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,480
Stop!

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,150
Did I do something?

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,250
Maybe she's guilty.

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,230
She's taken such a weird concept for herself.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,480
 I can't hear you.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,290
 I actually heard her.

33
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,640
 Grandma said to me,

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,050
 "Stay safe till you complete eighteen years."

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,660
 "Then you will live a long and happy life."

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,590
 My eighteenth year has fallen in danger.

37
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,590
What is wrong with her?

38
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,270
Is she leaving?

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,520
Scary.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,810
 Eighteen, will I be able to complete it safely?

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,740
Don't go,

42
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,090
Doo Shim.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,570
Grandmother?

44
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,970
 Date her! Date her!

45
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,990
 Date her!

46
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,920
This is crazy!

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,430

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,760
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

49
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,400
♫  I'm going to hold you  ♫

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
What is this?

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,850
The melodrama that I filmed.

52
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,790
How is it?

53
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,980
I never did this!

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,150
What? There is clear evidence here. What are you saying?

55
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,690
Hey!

56
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,740
Ah, what to do?

57
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,380
Why does he have such an expression?

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,620
Come out for a moment.

59
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,240
Why?

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,280
Come out for a moment, I said.

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,680
Is someone boiling ramen? I can hear a boiling sound from somewhere.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,100
Hey, why did you say that?

63
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,770
I don't know how to say this.

64
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,620
- What? 
 - That thing earlier, I didn't do that.

65
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,310
Me hugging you. That is... I didn't hug you.

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,330
I don't remember anything.

67
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,050
You don't remember anything, then how do you know you didn't do it?

68
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,460
What?

69
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,100
That's why I don't remember. It's because I didn't do it.

70
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,670
I felt like something got into me for a moment.

71
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,780
Got into you?

72
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,660
So, what I am saying is, I don't want you to misunderstand it.

73
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,160
Misunderstand? Even if you did it, I'm not interested.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
Thank goodness.

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,220
How about you stop being interested in me? Just because our moms are close, it doesn't mean we have to be, too.

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,860
 Can you hear me?

77
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,720
What?

78
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,620
He is here. The evil spirit that you met ten years ago.

79
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,300
He is killing students here.

80
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,550
Like back then.

81
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,860
What are you saying?

82
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,320
How do you know that evil spirit?

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,090
Doo Shim.

84
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,860
Open your eyes wide and look at me.

85
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,020
Look at the face beyond this face.

86
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,080
What are you saying?

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
Don't joke.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,590
 Doo Shim.

89
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,220
 It's grandma.

90
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,760
I told you not to joke.

91
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,370
Grandma?

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,970
Goosebumps. They are totally stuck to each other.

93
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,100
He might end up kissing her at this rate!

94
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,040
What to do?

95
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,820
What happened?

96
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,640
It's really you, right, grandma?

97
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I will explain later. For now,

98
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,800
he is coming.

99
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,060
-  Myo Shim, it's been a while.  
 - Take cover!

100
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,260
Grandma!

101
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,870
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

102
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,090
Grandma!

103
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,520
 Myo Shim's granddaughter, Doo Shim.

104
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
 You have grown up.

105
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,190
He's gotten even worse.

106
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,990
 Na Woo Soo

107
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,150
What exactly happened?

108
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,120
Who?

109
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,660
Go away.

110
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,970
What?

111
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,060
Oh my God! Doo Shim.

112
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,500
Seems like this jerk can see me.

113
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,220
What? He can really see me?

114
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,560
I said go quickly!

115
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,600
What was that just now?

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Did you really see Hyun Soo?

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,970
Hyun Soo?

118
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,970
There is no way you could.

119
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,720
Here!

120
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,530
This jerk.

121
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,810
What was over there?

122
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,590
A Ghost.

123
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,240
A Ghost?

124
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,490
I can see ghosts?

125
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,760
This is a dream, right?

126
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,270
I think that every day. "I wish it was a dream."

127
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,970
It can't be a ghost. What did you do to me?

128
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,790
Let go. I didn't do it.

129
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,430
Then what is it? What is wrong with me?

130
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,010
I don't know. I don't know!

131
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,710

132
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,920
 Have a good day, sir.

133
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,450
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

134
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,640
Are you crazy?

135
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,920
You can only get inside the body of the school's last rank student. That is our contract.

136
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,230
If you do this again, I will shut you up forever.

137
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,220
Did something happen at school?

138
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,530
No.

139
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,460
I heard you were lying down in the nurse's office.

140
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,760
What happened?

141
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,140
I was just tired. I'm trying to adjust to the school.

142
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,920
You must be tired. It is a very different school.

143
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,580
My daughter, let's get you something good for your body.

144
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,710
Why did you come to school?

145
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,240
Hey, I'm a student, too.

146
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,960
It's normal for a student to go to school.

147
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,390
If someone hears, they would think you studied really well.

148
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,110
Shush!

149
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,910
Do you know how shocked Woo Soo was because of you?

150
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,850
Do you like him?

151
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,640
- What? 
 - What I'm saying is,

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,890
you seem to take care of him.

153
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,330
You like him, right?

154
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,680
Hey, even if you fool a ghost, you can't fool me.

155
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,890
You are a ghost too, you fool.

156
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,230
Ah, right.

157
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,890
But did Woo Soo really see me?

158
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,640
What happened?

159
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,480
Grandma went in and out of his body.

160
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,110
Grandma?

161
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,890
Your grandma?

162
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,640
I'm sure he changed because of grandma.

163
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,610
Son, are you okay?

164
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,220
I heard you were in the nurse's office.

165
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,650
Son!

166
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,370
Here, here. Eat a lot, my daughter.

167
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,820
Here.

168
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,880
What's wrong?

169
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,810
What happened?

170
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,550
I saw grandma at school.

171
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,640
Grandma?

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,470
I never saw her at the mortuary,

173
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,110
but she suddenly appeared at school

174
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,680
So? What did she say?

175
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,020
Well, she said she missed me.

176
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,900
That's it?

177
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,180
Didn't she say a lottery number or anything like that?

178
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:11,160
Ah, right. My mother wouldn't say such things.

179
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,730
Suddenly I feel empty. You aren't going to eat this, right?

180
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,810
Did you run away from home?

181
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,840
Are you finally rebelling?

182
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,730
I saw a ghost.

183
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,510
I thought it was a person, but it was a ghost.

184
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,680
 Oh my God! Doo Shim.

185
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,970
 Seems like this jerk can see me.

186
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,520
She said I saw a ghost.

187
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,020
Who?

188
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,000
Doo Shim.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,110
Doo Shim? The melodrama's female lead?

190
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,060
You have totally fallen for her.

191
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,920
It's not like that.

192
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,060
"It's not like that."

193
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,280
Does that make sense?

194
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,200
Ghosts don't exist.

195
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,850
But today

196
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,220
I saw two during the day.

197
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,870
Woo Soo,

198
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,050
get some fresh air, and come to the food cart.

199
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,810
I will tell my mom and help you rejuvenate.

200
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,920
 He is here. The evil spirit

201
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,930
 that you met ten years ago.

202
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,980
 He is killing students here.

203
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,360
 Like back then.

204
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,690
 Myo Shim's granddaughter, Doo Shim.

205
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,220
 You have grown up.

206
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm really going to go nuts.

207
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Why is the evil spirit in the school that I transferred to, of all places?

208
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,780
 The work is over.

209
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,850
You look like a student. This isn't a place for reading tarot cards.

210
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,500
I didn't come to see my future.

211
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,340
I came to see Doo Shim.

212
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,700
Doo Shim?

213
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,680
Do you know him?

214
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,310
Go away.

215
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,360
- Talk to me. 
 - Talk to me tomorrow at school. Why did you come here at night?

216
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,440
It's urgent. I can't stay like this, not even for a day.

217
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,670
I didn't even believe in ghosts, so why am I able to see them now?

218
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,150
What did you do to me?

219
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,400
Do you think I did it?

220
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,860
Who else could it be, except you?

221
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,100
I will give you however much you want.

222
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,090
Bring me back to normal.

223
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,760
What is it?

224
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,990
You are a shaman, right?

225
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,970
I am the shaman.

226
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,220
Go away.

227
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,770
I didn't do it.

228
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,010
And there is nothing I can do about it, either.

229
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,500
If there is such a method, please let me know.

230
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,120
So I have to live like this?

231
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,060
Seeing ghosts?

232
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,480
I have been living like that.

233
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,830
The world I see has always been like that.

234
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,470
Are you already scared?

235
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,940
You probably still can't see this world well.

236
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,900
Who is scared?

237
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,410
Is the world you see different from what I see?

238
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,460
Yes.

239
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,530
A lot.

240
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,590
How is it different?

241
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,320
It is much clearer for me,

242
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,760
seeing and hearing ghosts.

243
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,050

244
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,820
You think I will end up like you, don't you?

245
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,450
Maybe.

246
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,890
Excuse me.

247
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,360
Can you show me my future in advance?

248
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,010
You will regret it.

249
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,790
I am already regretting it.

250
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,640
From the moment  I asked you to see my compatibility.

251
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,620
Are there any in this area?

252
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,330
Yes.

253
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,170
How many?

254
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,190
Check for yourself.

255
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,520
What are you doing?

256
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,280
Close your eyes.

257
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,950
If you do this, can I really see ghosts?

258
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,140
Welcome to my world.

259
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:09,350

260
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨ 
 ~ Preview ~

261
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,320
 Hey. We have to take another exam!

262
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,270
 Mr. Principal, someone might die again.

263
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,590
 You want me to cancel an exam just because of a rumor?

264
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,180
 You should just focus on helping your students not rank last, Teacher Sa.

265
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,520
 You will be in trouble if Woo Soo has a problem.

266
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,580
 Can't you feel that people are whispering about you?

267
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,790
 The Chairman's wife is looking for me urgently.

268
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,820
 Seems like her son has a problem.

269
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,260
 How did you survive like this all these years? I can't even handle this for one day.

270
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,100
 Even my mother had trouble handling that evil spirit. How do you expect Doo Shim to handle such an evil spirit?

271
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,250
 The one who can handle that evil spirit

272
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,100
 is Doo Shim.

273
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,180
♫  Oh dear my nights  ♫
