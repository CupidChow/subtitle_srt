1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,060
Are you also curious about

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,140
why I'm only close with Il Ram?

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,130
People think there is some special story.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,170
But there is no story.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,090
There is a story.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,980
What?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
You guys were siblings in your previous lives.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,640
A very affectionate older brother and sister who couldn't live without each other.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,390
Who was the younger sister?

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,900
It's Il Ram, right?

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,520
It was you.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,820
You were the younger sister who grumbled to your older brother every day.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,320
That is—

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,130
That is...

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,900
a secret from Il Ram, okay?

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,270
Are you able to...

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,250
- see my future, too? 
 - What?

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,870
You saw my previous life, so what about my future?

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,130
Close your eyes.

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,420
What do you see?

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,420
You can't see anything, right?

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,700
- That is your future— 
 - You.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,340
I close my eyes and I can see you.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,370
No,

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,080
I can see only you.

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,590
Are you my future?

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:31,280

28
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,570
How would I know the future? I can't even see what's in front of me right now.

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,790
I'll explain everything.

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,320
Madam, why are you here— Ouch!

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,560
Mom!

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
I am sure that you two planned and did something to my son.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,650
Do you think I will just stand by and watch?

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,080
Pardon?

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,430
Mom!

36
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,910
Go.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,810
I'll take care of it here, so go.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,530

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,860
I'm sorry, Ahjumma. This is all because of me.

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,210
I'm sorry Doo Shim, I'll leave.

41
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,410
And go where?

42
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,380
I don't like it when people get harmed because of me.

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,170
Don't worry.

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,440
Everything is ruined.

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,940
Looks like we have to close the shop here too.

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,270
You should also transfer schools.

47
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,640
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

48
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,810
Aigoo.

49
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,160
What are you doing instead of studying as I told you?

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,710
Honey, don't worry too much. He will be fine.

51
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,870
This is all because you as a mother have been hanging out with a shaman!

52
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,460
Let me ask you one thing.

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,750
Is that pity or friendship?

54
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,490
How can the first rank student be friends with the last rank student of the school?

55
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,980
If I don't study well, you won't even treat me as your child?

56
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,840
Woo Soo.

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,630
Of course.

58
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,660
Sometimes an adult's thought is like an evil spirit's.

59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,020
What?

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,620
What are you doing now?

61
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,320
Woo Soo!

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,650
Stop the car, secretary Kim!

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,500
Na Woo Soo!

64
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,250
I am so busy, how can you come now? If you are going to do this, then don't do anything.

65
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,420
Welco—

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,230

67
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,300

68
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,890
 What is that?

69
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,460
 It's an axe made from the foxglove tree with a blade of bronze.

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,480
 With this, I have to strike the top of his head.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,960
 Come out of that child's body immediately!

72
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,440
 I will make sure you never set foot on this world!

73
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,950
What will you do?

74
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,160
I can't stop now that I've come this far.

75
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,520
Even if I transfer schools, I will complete what has to be done.

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,470
There is no way you can, but let's assume that you catch the evil spirit in Songyeong High School.

77
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,400
Who would like that?

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,640
No one cares about it.

79
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,090
The students who study well aren't dying, right?

80
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,100
Doo Shim!

81
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,470
Stop it if you don't want your mom to become a laughingstock.

82
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,680

83
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,690
It seems that Il Ram went to school suddenly, saying he left something.

84
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm going to school now. Don't come.

85
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,610
Il Ram is my friend.

86
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,690
What will someone like me do by living?

87
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,730
Useless jerk.

88
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,600
I will kill this guy in the most

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,810
cruel way and

90
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,920
such that Woo Soo

91
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,850
and Doo Shim

92
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,010
are very sad.

93
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,200
Il Ram.

94
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,210
Stay still.

95
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,700
You're here.

96
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,760
My friend.

97
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,480
When did you come? Where's Doo Shim?

98
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,390
I'm here.

99
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,830
I'm tearing up at your friendship.

100
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,520
He's not my friend.

101
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,780
This is my friend.

102
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,780
But he thought of me as his friend.

103
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,740
What will you guys do?

104
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,030
We'll catch you.

105
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,150
Be bound by my words and stop!

106
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,430
You got what you wanted. Now leave!

107
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,030
What do I need to do now?

108
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,430
The evil spirit will come out of Il Ram's body soon.

109
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,650
Then you just have to hit the top of his head.

110
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,720
Have you done it before?

111
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,760
I have seen it.

112
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,850
What happened?

113
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,400
What are you doing right now?

114
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
Woo Soo, Doo Shim, what are you doing?

115
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,110
He's not Il Ram.

116
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,040
What are you talking about?

117
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,330
Let go of me. Woo Soo, release me.

118
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,400
Are you really Il Ram?

119
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,310
Then who else would I be?

120
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,600
He's not. The evil spirit is putting on an act.

121
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,980
There's something you always say to me.

122
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,620
- What? 
 - What do you say when I am annoying you?

123
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,540
What did he use to say?

124
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,390
The most annoying punk.

125
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,130
You really are annoying.

126
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,280
You are more annoying.

127
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,570
Shut up. Come out of Il Ram immediately.

128
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,430
Here, hit me. Don't hesitate, quick.

129
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,240
- I said, come out! 
 - Hit me!

130
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,120
If you hit me right now, I can disappear forever.

131
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,820
Did you think you could stop me with things like that?

132
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,250
When you go to college.

133
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,390
And meet other students from last rank.

134
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,480
Tell the others...

135
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,230
that this is what happens if they don't study well.

136
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,430
No!

137
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,950
Il Ram!

138
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,980
Il Ram!

139
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,750
Il Ram.

140
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,580
What is this?

141
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,160
Did I perhaps die?

142
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,330
I can hear it. His heart is beating.

143
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,860
You can live.

144
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,690
You can't die, you have to live!

145
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,240
We have to take him to a hospital before it's too late.

146
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,350
 It's too late.

147
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,300
You would have to reach the hospital within 5 minutes.

148
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,150
He can't go back into the body after 5 minutes.

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,360
We can't get there in 5 minutes.

150
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,730
I have a friend now.

151
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,640
Go in immediately.

152
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,210
- What? 
 - Go inside Il Ram's body.

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,900
What are you saying?

154
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,930
Hyun Soo.

155
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,980
I'll make sure to find your mom.

156
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,580
Wait for me there.

157
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,980
My motorbike.

158
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,970
Student, you can't just walk in here. Okay?

159
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,220
Student! What are you doing?

160
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,050
 Wait, what is he doing?

161
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,410
What's this?

162
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,960
Student! Are you okay?

163
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,510
I'll ready him for CPR.

164
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,460
Are you okay?

165
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,960
You?

166
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,840
It hurts a lot here.

167
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,110
You'll be okay soon.

168
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,270
But what hurts more is...

169
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,280
this. I'm so frustrated and angry.

170
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,290
How frightening and painful it must have been for the children who died because of him.

171
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,580
For Il Ram too.

172
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,480
I'm so angry, I can't bear it.

173
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,440
Doo Shim, I want to catch that man.

174
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,970
Let's not give up, and catch him.

175
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,120
Yoo Tae Hyun, Kang Ji Soo,

176
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,820
Kim Jun, Lee So Ra,

177
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,960
Oh Jong Geun.

178
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,410
Even among the kids I know, too many have died.

179
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,560

180
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,660

181
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,140
Teacher Sa, you're here early.

182
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,420
Is everything all right?

183
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,220
Why are you doing this? W-Why?

184
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,890
I missed it.

185
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,890
Wh-What?

186
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,490
I missed the bottom ranker!

187
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,590
Because of that girl. Because of Ga Doo Shim!

188
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,780
Ok-Okay.

189
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,140
Let me go first and then talk. Let me go.

190
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,980
I'll kill Ga Doo Shim and take her soul.

191
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,680
Don't get in my way!

192
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,570
If you get in my way—

193
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,430
How you dare mess with me?

194
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,870
Please!

195
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,530
Please let me kill Ga Doo Shim.

196
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,530
Please!

197
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,130
Be bound by my words and stop!

198
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,550
You got what you wanted. Now leave!

199
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,890

200
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,660
 I had forgotten.

201
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,230
 That evil spirits were not my only opponents.

202
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,550
 I had forgotten.

203
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,650
 That there was someone on my side.

204
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,950
♫  I fly higher  ♫

205
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,390
♫  Though I don’t know the end  ♫

206
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,780
♫  I carve my traces into  ♫

207
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,140
♫  The passing clouds.   ♫

208
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,670

~ Preview ~

209
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,720
 Please prepare the evaluation. If any trouble comes up, I will take responsibility.

210
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,730
 When we brought Il Ram here, there was someone who followed the evil spirit.

211
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,850
 Do you also think that evil spirits exist, Doo Shim?

212
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,830
 How did you know? I have never talked about evil spirits.

213
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,590
 Do you feel confident without me?

214
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,580
 I don't know, either.

215
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,890
 Whether you transfer to another school, or drop out. Choose one.

216
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,950
 You don't have a school to transfer to, even if you wanted to.

217
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,480
 It's full of non-human beings!

218
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,510
 No one is going to die in Songyeong High School anymore.

219
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,340
 I want to be first at this game too.

220
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,690
♫   Into the time that blows towards us   ♫
