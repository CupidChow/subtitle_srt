1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,170
Why do we have exams so often?

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,770
I did well on the last mock test.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,780
Another exam?

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,020

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,390
What do you mean?

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,090
It's a secret from the others. I want to be the last rank in this test.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,630
Suddenly, it seems like the last rank is a good position.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,970
Listen carefully.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,360
You seem to look down on the last rank. It isn't that easy.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,760
It is. I only have to beat your score.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,890
You do your best to answer as many questions as you can.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,420
I'll try to get as many wrong answers as I can.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,140
What if your worst is still better than my best?

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,890
I didn't think of that.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,790
Forget it.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,270
I'll be the last rank. Whatever it is, I'll face it. I won't die.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,140
Il Ram was also like that.

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,430
And the opponent is an evil spirit.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,570
What? Evil spirit?

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,000
The evil spirit posses the last rank students and manipulates them.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,480
You can't handle it.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,700
Doo Shim, save me.

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,060
I don't want to die.

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,210
 Hey!

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,960
 You can only kill the last rank students. That is the rule.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,160
 Wait a bit more, I'll give you what you want.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,430
What is it?

29
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,810
You're not planning anything without telling me, right?

30
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,550
Come on, what are you saying?

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,120
Look at me.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,550
Why?

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,670
So that I can see the look in your eyes.

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,320
Do you think I'm fooling you?

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,500
You are very cheesy today.

36
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,320
Can I kiss you?

37
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,360
Can I? I'm asking you, right?

38
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,380
Would I let you? Crazy jerk!

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,370
You! What did you do to me?

40
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,380
What are you saying?

41
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,870
My head hurts a lot and my body is sore.

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,640
What the hell did you do to me?

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,330
It was strange from when you called me over to your house.

44
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,870
It was like something strange suddenly came inside my body.

45
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,970
I don't have any memory from then.

46
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,120
Soo Jung, I'll explain it later.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,000
Tell me now.

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,230
Did Doo Shim ask you to torture me?

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
No.

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,310
You went to the basement with your students and saw an evil spirit?

51
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,190
I didn't see it for myself, but there was something for sure.

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,650
I also didn't believe it at first, but Doo Shim and Woo Soo weren't saying any nonsense.

53
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,320
So?

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,050
What do you mean by "so"?

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,470
We have to cancel the exam immediately and do whatever we can to catch the evil spirit.

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,220
Even if we have to close the school, as long as our students don't die.

57
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,040
Let's just say that an evil spirit exists.

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,870
Who do you think is the better educator?

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,770
Principal!

60
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,740
Is it you, who wastes time on students who don't study or who can't score well even if they study,

61
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,430
or is it the evil spirit, who makes the students study very well on their own?

62
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,880
Principal, let go of me.

63
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,630
Who is the reason that these students go to a good college?

64
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,390
Hey! Answer me.

65
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,440
Is it you? Is it because of you? Is it because of you?

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,510
Tell me. Tell me. Yes?

67
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,650
Answer me, you jerk!

68
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,150
It's the evil spirit.

69
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,070
You should just make sure you aren't the teacher of the last rank student, Teacher Sa.

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,220
What would you do if you find the evil spirit?

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm raising the future generation's famous personalities. Why

72
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,930
does a useless jerk like you come and...

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,330
How did you come out?

74
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,390
I used the exam as an excuse and talked back to my parents. It was much easier than I thought it would be.

75
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,090
For the exam? Does that mean you will do that more often?

76
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,890
When I need to.

77
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,960
What were you doing here? Why is your expression like that?

78
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,060
My heart is breaking.

79
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,660
What?

80
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,150
Just the thought of whether we will be able to catch the evil spirit.

81
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,500
Even if we catch it, will someone even recognize our efforts?

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,660
Did you start this with the intention that someone would recognize your efforts?

83
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,390
That's not it, but

84
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,400
it's too hard.

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
I want to be kicked out of this game.

86
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,150
Get up.

87
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,530
Are we going somewhere?

88
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't think I can keep going this way.

89
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,200
I can't handle the hospital fee either.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,690
Mrs. Kim, please hang in there for a little more time.

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,420
In few days, Il Ram will be helping you at the shop.

92
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,570
I can see it.

93
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,870
We will definitely

94
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,100
save Il Ram.

95
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,110
 I decided to be the last rank student.

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,350
 I will meet the evil spirit.

97
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,100
 I may be able to catch the evil spirit, but

98
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,490
 there is also a chance that I become like Il Ram.

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you for today.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,040
I'll go ahead.

101
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,240
♫  I can’t figure it out, I can’t see it yet,  ♫

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,980
♫  I reach out and look for the small doorknob  ♫

103
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,820
♫  The air that had been stagnant all this time, 
 and the hesitating time now  ♫

104
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,330
♫  open me up   ♫

105
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,210
Can I kiss—?

106
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,710
♫  I fly higher,  ♫

107
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,110
♫  though I don’t know the end  ♫

108
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,670
♫  I carve my traces into  ♫

109
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,820
♫  the passing clouds  ♫

110
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,200
♫  No one knows until they open the door, let go of the light  ♫

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,240
♫  that you locked away  ♫

112
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,550
 This is my first kiss,

113
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,720
♫  Into the sky, I’m flowing with you,  ♫

114
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,820
 and probably my last kiss, too.

115
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,480
♫  I’m running to you,  ♫

116
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,970
♫  my all  ♫

117
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,980

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,770

119
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,630

120
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,830

121
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,120

122
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,690

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,010

124
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,690
You may start.

125
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,740
What?

126
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,010
 Let's do this, We'll exchange the answer sheets.

127
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,000
 At the mock exams, it may be possible.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,690
 Are you sure you will be the last rank student?

129
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,010
 Yes. If I do as I usually do, I am sure of it.

130
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,600
There are only five minutes left.

131
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,170
Why didn't you write your name yet?

132
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,340
It's Doo Shim's.

133
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,980
Pardon?

134
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,620
Doo Shim has her answer sheet, though.

135
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,940
That's mine.

136
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,140
So?

137
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,520
Mine is Doo Shim's and Doo Shim's is mine.

138
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,800
Who am I? Am I Ae Kyung or Doo Shim?

139
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,380
What's wrong with you?

140
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,860
Just sit and write down your name.

141
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,120
Everyone can wrap it up.

142
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,200
I drew a blank when I tried to answer a question I knew the answer to on the questionnaire.

143
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,020
This is the first time I have written the wrong answer on purpose.

144
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,180
I did that thinking we would obviously exchange the answer sheets.

145
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,230
Maybe I shouldn't have written the wrong answer.

146
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,770
The exams aren't over yet.

147
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,420
Let's get our senses together and do well.

148
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,390
Do well in what?

149
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,290
Seems like Ae Kyung messed up the exam, so I was comforting her.

150
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,670
Then you should have studied.

151
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,160
- What? 
 - Did I say anything wrong?

152
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,020
If you are that scared of dying, you should have studied well.

153
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,840
Hey!

154
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,910
Doo Shim, my dad works for his dad.

155
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,730
But his dad doesn't even treat his employees as humans.

156
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,650
My dad has a really hard time.

157
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,370
I'm saying that it's all in his genes.

158
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,640
Doo Shim, this guy is a real jerk!

159
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,340
Why are you talking like that? You jerk.

160
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,420
There are only five minutes left.

161
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,190
Ma'am.

162
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,320
I think someone is cheating.

163
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,970
What?

164
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,570
Thank you, ma'am.

165
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,430
Hey, Na Woo Soo. Why are you sticking your nose in my business?

166
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,270
I'm asking you!

167
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,990
Let me check my answers. This exam is really important to me.

168
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,120

169
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,030
I took a guess in all of the questions and almost everything is right.

170
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,990
I took a guess in all of the questions and everything is wrong.

171
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,130
I'm the last rank student.

172
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,690
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

173
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,660
Bad jerk.

174
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,140
I shouldn't have kissed him.

175
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,920

176
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,990
These are the answer sheets with the wrong answers for all questions.

177
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,360
I did write one correct answer for each subject out of courtesy, though.

178
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,130
But there won't be a problem with getting a last-rank student, right?

179
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,820
Principal, I can't manipulate the grades.

180
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm giving Ga Doo Shim a chance.

181
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,610
A chance to prove her speculation that an evil spirit exists.

182
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,900
Change this quickly.

183
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,800
Principal, please.

184
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,550

185
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,150

186
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,090

187
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,010
- Really? 
 - Did you know that?

188
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,570
You really did?

189
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,660
Come on, have you been there?

190
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,560
Really?

191
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,730

192
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,030
Sir. Is the last rank student from our class?

193
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,780
Sir! Tell us.

194
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,410
Na Woo Soo.

195
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,140
I asked about the last rank student, not the first rank student.

196
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,130
What happened, Woo Soo?

197
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,140
Why are you the last rank student in the whole school?!

198
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,890
 I decided to be the last rank student.

199
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,740
 I will meet the evil spirit.

200
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,570
 I may be able to catch the evil spirit, but there is also a chance that I become like Il Ram.

201
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,140
 This is my first kiss,

202
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,450

203
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,330
 and probably my last kiss, too.

204
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,980
♫  Yeah, dreaming for you remember smile  ♫

205
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,430
♫  Remember this smile now   ♫

206
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,550
♫  every time I  ♫

207
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,270
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨  
  ~ Preview ~

208
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,980
 Do you know what you have done?

209
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,570
 Something dangerous? But I'm relaxed now.

210
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,210
 Why did you do it, knowing everything? Are you rebelling?

211
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,280
 My plan was only to become the last rank student. What are we going to do now?

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,270
 My school has become a mess.

213
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,990
 We can go back to normal only if I destroy this.

214
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,120
 We have to wait till all the students leave.

215
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,770
 We can't fight in front of the students.

216
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,050
 - What's wrong? 
 - The souls of all the dead students are inside the evil spirit.

217
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,540
 How do you know that?

218
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,010
 Na Woo Soo, do you think I can't possess you?

219
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,510
 If the evil spirit gets inside me,

220
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,380
 I will hit your head with the ax.

221
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,280
 You are the real evil spirit!

222
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,110
 You answer. It's your turn to take the test.

223
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,390
♫  Yeah dreaming for you remember smile  ♫
