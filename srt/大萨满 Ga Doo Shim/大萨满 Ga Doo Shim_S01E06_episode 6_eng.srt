1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,870

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,200
Crazy jerk, don't you think of becoming a celebrity later.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,300
I will tell everyone that you were involved in school violence.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,790
I taught you the expected questions. They were almost the same as those.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,840
- Is that so? 
 - Is that so?

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,830
What happened? Tell me, you punk!

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,070
It's annoying.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,780
What is?

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,810
Not doing it because you want to, but doing it because you are scared that you will die.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,970
I have no intention of studying.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,970
So you got it wrong on purpose?

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,390
No. I honestly forgot everything you taught me yesterday.

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,150
Get your bag from the class.

15
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,220
Why?

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,780
Don't ask me why. Let's go somewhere together.

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,070
- Where? 
 - Wherever.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,880
We have to get out of this school for now.

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,440

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,510
It's time for you to eat.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,020
Listen to me.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,410
Don't worry, you jerk. I won't die.

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,940
If it wants to come at me, tell it to come. I'll rip it to pieces.

24
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,010
What?

25
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,880
What's wrong?

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,220
Something is there.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,500
 What should we do if there is an evil spirit in the school, as you said?

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,260
 What do you mean, "what should we do"?

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,610
 He will kill the last rank student again, right?

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,240
 Is there a way to catch him before he does that?

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,730
 Do you think evil spirits are like Casper the Friendly Ghost?

32
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,120
 We can only hope that it won't be us or our friends.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,490
 There's nothing we can do.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,650
 What would you do if it was your friend?

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,580
 I don't care what happens to Il Ram.

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,530
 He's not my friend.

37
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,230
He's not my friend. I don't have any friends!

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,020
We know. We all know.

39
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,290
Did she see a ghost?

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,350
 Doo Shim.

41
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,130
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

42
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,010
Doo Shim.

43
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,620
Did it run away?

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,960
It's here. Can you see it?

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
No.

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,920
Listen to me carefully.

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,870
When the evil spirit strikes back, run out through the school gate with Il Ram.

48
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,320
You want to handle it by yourself?

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,390
No. I can't handle him.

50
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,590
I'm going to buy you some time, so run away

51
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,560
I'll fight too.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,270
For now, you will only be a disturbance.

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,260
Excuse me, can someone explain–

54
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,970
Shut up. I don't have any intention of saving you.

55
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,400
This is all because of your friend.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,130
So, live.

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,150
I'm going crazy. What on earth is happening?

58
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,190
It's coming.

59
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,450
Run!

60
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,340
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

61
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,750

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,180
- Faster, faster! 
 - I'm exhausted!

63
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,120
Where are we going?

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,760
Come quickly!

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,550
I didn't even bring my bag.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,820
Are you okay?

67
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,350
What on earth...?

68
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,990
What is this?

69
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,760
Are you okay?

70
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,630
I don't get what the problem is.

71
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,420
Isn't Doo Shim freaking cool?

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,480
What did she say there? "You got what you wanted. Now leave!"

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,950
She was like an action star.

74
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,660
Totally my type.

75
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,780
Now I know why idiots live a long life.

76
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,670
What?

77
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,130
Yes. Enjoy the moment.

78
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,120
You'll be crying soon anyway.

79
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,530
 Grandma, what should I do?

80
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,740
Run!

81
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,660
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

82
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,850
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

83
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,560
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you want—

84
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,710
Is it friendship or pity?

85
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,210
How can the first rank student be friends with the last rank student of the school?

86
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,390
Shut up.

87
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,120
I can't kill you,

88
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,940
but I can make you suffer.

89
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,760

90
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,430
Why is everyone making a fuss for a guy who doesn't have the right to live?

91
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,240
Are you talking about yourself?

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,300
Is Myo Shim also here?

93
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,560
No.

94
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,160
What will you do by yourself?

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,430
I'm not alone.

96
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:48,920

97
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880

98
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,080
What happened?

99
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,530
I told them I would listen to their stories if they helped me.

100
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,910
When will I finish listening to all of their stories?

101
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,600
I'll listen to them with you.

102
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,310
Are you okay?

103
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,640
What about you?

104
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,490
About what?

105
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,960
Everyone found out, right?

106
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,880
 I heard you are a shaman's daughter.

107
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,220
 Am I right?

108
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,200
Nothing can be done about that. For now, saving Il Ram is more important.

109
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,220
Thank you.

110
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,400
Il Ram survived thanks to you.

111
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,000
♫  When you smile  ♫

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,590
What are you doing?

113
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,400
What on earth is happening?

114
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,730
Why aren't you guys telling me anything?

115
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,790
For now, let's avoid it.

116
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,430
 You're saying there's an evil spirit?

117
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,550
And it only kills the last rank students?

118
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,310
The evil spirit that disappeared ten years ago was in Songyeong High School,

119
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,940
killing students.

120
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,660
Okay, let's say it exists. Why is it killing them?

121
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,510
Is he jealous of being last rank in the whole school?

122
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,820
What the hell does the evil spirit want?

123
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,210
He is an idiot. Can't you figure that out by yourself?

124
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,260
What is it? Do you know, Ahjumma?

125
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,840
What happened when last rank students of Songyeong High School kept dying?

126
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,740
What do you mean by what happened? Students who can't study well were scared and started studying harder.

127
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,200
Right. So what happened?

128
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,230
So?

129
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,060
Students started studying like crazy.

130
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,740
You're right. Starting then, Songyeong High suddenly became a prestigious school.

131
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,690
It has become the school that all the parents in South Korea want to send their kids to.

132
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,830
Is the evil spirit the chairman of the foundation?

133
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,490
Anyway, students will keep dying.

134
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,370
Unless someone stops it.

135
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,900
How do you know about it in so much detail, Mom?

136
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm... the Beautiful Bodhisattva, Lee Hyo Shim.

137
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,010
 What?

138
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,870
Be bound by my words and stop!

139
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,050
Be bound by my words and stop!

140
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,750
 - Wait.  
 - Another chance will come.

141
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,400

142
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,290
I still don't know.

143
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,390
I want to go.

144
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,930
Sit down.

145
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,260
Evil spirit?

146
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,880
I'm taking back what I said about Doo Shim being cool.

147
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,410
Did something happen to you while hanging out with her?

148
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,230
You can continue your honeymoon.

149
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm going to go help my mom.

150
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,260
Your father says he's sad that

151
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,290
your little toe is bent because

152
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,010
he couldn't buy you new shoes when you needed them.

153
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,320
That is a secret.

154
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,060
How did—

155
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,330
Did you tell her?

156
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,630
I found out about that just now.

157
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,390
Your father says his heart hurts whenever he sees the scar you got

158
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,420
when he looked away for a moment, and you got bit by a dog when you were seven years old.

159
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
Stop it. If you're joking—

160
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,740
When you were accused as a thief in 6th grade, and he went and knelt down in school—

161
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,960
Stop it. Don't lie!

162
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you know everything?

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,750
There is nothing my father has to be sorry to me for.

164
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,710
Do you know why?

165
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,870
Because your father saved you when you fell in the water and died instead of you?

166
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,020
He says he's sorry for that too.

167
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,320
For dying on the happiest day when

168
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,630
you all went as a family on a picnic for the first time,

169
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,600
for making you remember that day as a sad day.

170
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,100
So stay put for your father.

171
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,570
If you safely get through your 18th year, you'll also live until your old age.

172
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,660
When did you talk to Il Ram's father?

173
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,760
When you were teaching Il Ram in the stall.

174
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,020
 You see, what happened to Il Ram's little toe is...

175
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
 I couldn't buy him proper shoes when he needed it.

176
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,550
 I looked away for a moment, and he got bit by a dog when he was seven years old and got a scar.

177
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,660
 I shouldn't have died on that day.

178
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,410
You also listen to ghosts' stories.

179
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,430
I didn't listen to him. He just kept talking by himself.

180
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,680
Il Ram is lucky because so many people care for him.

181
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,650
Don't you care for him the most?

182
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,450
Me?

183
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,020
Are you also curious about why I'm only close with Il Ram?

184
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,030
People think there is some special story.

185
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,080
But there is no story.

186
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,880
There is a story.

187
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,820
What?

188
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,960
You guys were siblings in your previous lives.

189
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,980
You were a very affectionate elder brother and younger sister.

190
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,320
Who was the younger sister?

191
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,800
It's Il Ram, right?

192
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,440
It was you.

193
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,630
You were the younger sister who grumbled to your older brother every day.

194
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,640
That is—

195
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,040
No matter what, don't tell Il Ram, okay?

196
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,750
Are you able to... see my future, too?

197
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,860
What?

198
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,610
You saw my previous life, so what about my future?

199
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,430
Il Ram will live until his old age. What about me?

200
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,900
Close your eyes.

201
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,530
What do you see?

202
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,610
You can't see anything, right? That is your future—

203
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,160
You.

204
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,850
I close my eyes and I can see you.

205
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,860
No, I can see only you.

206
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,890

207
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,020

208
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,620
Are you my future?

209
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,820
♫  Even for you, remember smile  ♫

210
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,380
♫  Please remember this smile right now  ♫

211
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,700
♫  Every time I feel you falling in my heart  ♫

212
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,920
♫  I'll always embrace you  ♫

213
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,900

214
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,320
 Il Ram went to school suddenly, saying he left something.

215
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,070
 Everything's ruined. Looks like we have to close the shop here too.

216
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,450
 You should also transfer schools.

217
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,820
 I can't stop now that I've come this far.

218
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,460
 Even if I transfer schools, I will complete what has to be done.

219
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,060
 I'm going to school now. Don't come.

220
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,230
 Il Ram is my friend.

221
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,050
 My friend is here.

222
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,760
 The students who study well aren't dying, right?

223
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,150
  - Doo Shim! 
 - Come out of Il ram immediately.

224
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,340
 I said, come out!

225
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,440
 Did you think you could stop me with things like that?

226
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,660
 Tell the others that this is what happens if they don't study well.

227
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,900
 No!
