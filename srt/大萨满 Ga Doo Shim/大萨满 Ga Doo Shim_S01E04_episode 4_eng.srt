1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,550
Are there any in this area?

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,230
Yes.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,590
How many?

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,510
Check for yourself.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,660

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,430
Close your eyes.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,700
If you do this, can I really see ghosts?

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,300
I'm going to go crazy.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,990
Seriously.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,650
Welcome to my world.

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,830
Do something.

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,750
You asked me to show you.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,560
But, I didn't know there would be this many!

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,860
If you can't avoid it, endure it.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,490
It would be even better if you could enjoy it.

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,090
Doo Shim.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,670
Ga Doo Shim!

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,290
Ga Doo Shim!

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,210
Move.

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,990
I said move!

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,650
He will be fine, right?

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,490
He was the first one who wanted this.

23
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,000
Seeing the future will also end soon anyway.

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,940
Something is wrong.

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,280
This is a dream.

26
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,460
I think he can see us.

27
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,820
No way.

28
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,970
Excuse me.

29
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,560
Can you see us?

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,910
I'm right.

31
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,730
We made eye contact.

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,540
Ahjussi! Go quickly.

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,290
Ahjussi!

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,310
Excuse me.

35
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,930
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

36
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,840
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,690
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,680
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,590
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

40
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,540
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

41
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,380
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,190
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

43
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,010
Excuse me.

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,130
Hey!

45
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,860
Can't you hear us?

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,950
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

47
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,980
"Because cleaning the glass alone at night

48
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,810
is a lonely and magnificent evaluation,

49
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,050
like a blood vessel in the lungs getting torn.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,710
You flew away like the mountain birds."

51
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,980
That was poet Jung Ji Yeong's poem "Glass Window".

52
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,770
The theme of the poem is bereavement.

53
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,860
It has a similar message to the poem "Tears" that we read before.

54
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,480
Do you know why Woo Soo didn't come today?

55
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,300
Why are you asking me about him?

56
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,040
Something happened between you two yesterday, right?

57
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,820
I don't know.

58
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,860
You will be in trouble if Woo Soo has a problem.

59
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,770
Can't you feel that people are whispering about you?

60
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,120
I heard she is the one who pushed Jong Geun.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,310
She made such a fuss with Woo Soo.

62
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,670
He also didn't come to school today.

63
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,370
What?

64
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,080
She must have done something to him.

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,440
No way!

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,350
Hey!

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,560
We have to take another exam!

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,830
 Ah. Seriously.

69
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,590
We have to take an exam?

70
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,870
What do you mean, "cancel the exam"?

71
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,480
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,380
It's an extra evaluation.

73
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,240
It is best if we avoid tests that are not necessary—

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,390
What is the reason?

75
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,910
The exam will be conducted as planned.

76
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,800
Mr. Principal,

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,010
someone might die again—

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,820
You want me to cancel an exam just because of a rumor?

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,150
If we cancel the exam, it'll be no different from accepting the rumor.

80
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,700
Instead of worrying about who will die, you should just focus on helping your students not rank last, Teacher Sa.

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,100
That's what you should be doing to help students.

82
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,830
But, why didn't Na Woo Soo come today?

83
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,930
Hey!

84
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,600
Can you do me a favor?

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,150
Favor?

86
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,460
What is it?

87
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,640
Please stop by at Woo Soo's house.

88
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,480
His house?

89
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,940
He isn't picking up calls. I think something happened.

90
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,180
I will tell you the address so—

91
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,300
If you are that worried, why don't you go yourself?

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,940
His parents hate me a lot.

93
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,100
Do me a favor.

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
I'm busy.

95
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,190
Aren't you worried about Woo Soo?

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,510
Do you also think Na Woo Soo didn't come to school because of me?

97
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,130
No. That's not it.

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,950
Okay.

99
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,210
It's not my fault.

100
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,430
The top rank student in the school didn't come in today, and the school is making such a fuss.

101
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,760
They didn't even care when the last rank student died.

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,060
One hell of a school.

103
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,320
But,

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,180
for real, why didn't Woo Soo come today?

105
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,450
You don't know?

106
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,360
It's because of Doo Shim.

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,000
Doo Shim?

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,700
Didn't you see them make a fuss yesterday?

109
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,570
Woo Soo seemed like he was possessed by a ghost.

110
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,910
I am sure that Doo Shim did something.

111
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,670
Hey!

112
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,970
What could that be?

113
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,350
What are we going to eat?

114
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,960

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,640
What are you looking at?

116
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,980
Webtoon.

117
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,390
Everyone was reading this, so I checked it out. It's fun and fascinating.

118
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,680
Is that so? Is there something I can see too?

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,810
Yes.

120
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,480
There may be a lot that you would like, too.

121
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,370
Where are you going?

122
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,050
The Chairman's wife is looking for me urgently.

123
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,970
Seems like her son has a problem.

124
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,740
What problem?

125
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,790
They say he's gone crazy.

126
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,700
They made him study a lot so that he could be the next chairman.

127
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm sure something happened because he studied too much.

128
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,370
I will go too.

129
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,400
What's up with you?

130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,190
You were scared that there would be rumors that you are a shaman's daughter.

131
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,610
Stop acting so weird. Why are you acting like you don't experience it?

132
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,900
That’s a lot of customers.

133
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,900
Customers?

134
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,940
Welcome, Beautiful Bodhisattva.

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,670
Lady, you look so pale.

136
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,480
What is all this?

137
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,420
I know, right?

138
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,470
He was screaming all night.

139
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,650
No one was there, but he was shouting, "Get out!", "Get lost!"

140
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,570
He was screaming so much,

141
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,490
and it was such a mess.

142
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,140
What should I do?

143
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,330
I am here now, so don't worry.

144
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,000
Where is your son now?

145
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,370
Isn't he the one who came home yesterday?

146
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
He's the son of the Chairman's wife?

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,360
Shush! Be quiet.

148
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,320
What is it? What happened to him?

149
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,260
Mom, get out. I will take care of this.

150
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,590
What do you mean "get out"? I'm the shaman.

151
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,600
Get out.

152
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,650
Please!

153
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,600
You too.

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,390
You too.

155
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,630
Get out.

156
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,390
Are you okay?

157
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,560
Paste this in your room, then they won't be able to enter.

158
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,940
How did you stand this until now?

159
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,850
I can't stand it for even a day.

160
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,530
Ghosts are the same as people.

161
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,080
At first, they appear in front of you all day and all night.

162
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,590
If you ignore them and pretend you can't see them, they give up in the end.

163
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,500
Rumors spread among ghosts too.

164
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,040
They won't come only if they hear rumors saying you are an annoying person.

165
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,970
Do you hear things like that?

166
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,720
I am the most annoying girl in the universe to them.

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,830
They also visit you just because you are newly opened in this new world.

168
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,890
Newly opened?

169
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,890
When a shop is newly opened, customers come, right?

170
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,030
If a rumor that the taste is bad spreads,

171
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,550
customers stop coming.

172
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,920
That will happen to you too.

173
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,680
So, ignore them and

174
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,250
pretend that you can't see them.

175
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,150
It seems hard.

176
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,750
But it is fascinating.

177
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,650
What is?

178
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,380
Even shamans possessed by a god aren't visited by this many ghosts.

179
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,110
I think you have a hidden talent.

180
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,010
Are you saying I could be a good shaman?

181
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,940
Well, it could be.

182
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,960
You're coming to school tomorrow, right? We have an exam.

183
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,270
Exam?

184
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,290
You have to come if you don't want to lose your first rank.

185
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,140
Lose it? To whom?

186
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,580
What do you mean, "whom"? To me.

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,930
Do you perhaps use the help of ghosts when you take exams?

188
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,850
Annoying!

189
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,320
I should hear that from the ghosts and not you.

190
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,120
Are you okay, son?

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,010
I'm okay now thanks to Doo Shim.

192
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,960
You really are talented.

193
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,640
You are better than your mom.

194
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,150
Doo Shim isn't a shaman.

195
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,350
She only came to cheer me up as a friend.

196
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,090
 Acting all cool.

197
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,970
Thanks.

198
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,140
Don’t mention it. It's a given because I'm your friend.

199
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,500
Is that so? Didn't you say that your daughter will become a shaman too?

200
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,350
What?

201
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,190
What parent would want their child to become a shaman? We should make them study.

202
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,050
I will go out with Doo Shim for a moment.

203
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,660
Okay.

204
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,110
Go where?

205
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,440
Let's get some air.

206
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,200
We have an exam tomorrow. I have to study.

207
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,770
Doo Shim, go ahead.

208
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,870
Get some fresh air with your friend.

209
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,070
Refresh your mind, too.

210
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,960
We will be back.

211
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,990
Where are we going?

212
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,240
To save a person.

213
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,300
Save a person?

214
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,360
- We're going to pay now. 
 - Okay.

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
- Excuse me! 
 - Get me a bottle of soju.

216
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,010
Yes, Sir.

217
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,040
- Aigoo, have another drink. 
 - Sure.

218
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,380
- Hello! 
 - Oh, Woo Soo!

219
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,400
Na Woo Soo.

220
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,500
- Oh! 
 - Auntie, please send some fish cake soup and Il Ram here, please.

221
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,060
Do you want a glass of soju?

222
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,920
If you drink, you attract more ghosts.

223
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,670
A drunken soul is easy to possess.

224
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,890
I guess I will have to abstain from drinking my whole life.

225
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,980
What is this? You didn't even come to school and avoided my calls.

226
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,300
Why did you come here?

227
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,730
Did you study or not?

228
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,120
I tried, but I couldn't concentrate on studying.

229
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,210
I knew it.

230
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,230
I jotted down some expected questions. Solve them.

231
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,370
Annoying jerk.

232
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,900
What? Do you think I'm scared of dying? I'm not scared at all.

233
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,750
This isn't the time for you to hold your pride.

234
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,300
Il Ram, I saw a new world.

235
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,530
If I see you in that world, I will get annoyed.

236
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,400
What nonsense is he saying?

237
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,650
Why? Did something come?

238
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,530
Let's start.

239
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,190
Start what? I have to help my mom.

240
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,290
Eat up and leave.

241
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,270
Your father wants to see you study.

242
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,940
He says that's his wish.

243
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,010
What's wrong with you? My father passed away long ago.

244
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,390
Is she crazy?

245
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,770
Sit down. Didn't you hear Doo Shim?

246
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,270
Sit down and study.

247
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,850
- Woo Soo, please help him. 
 - Sure.

248
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,210
Look here.

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,890
Then this becomes a positive number.

250
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,520
x + 0 is greater than zero, and x + 1 would also be greater than zero.

251
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,440
Did you understand till here?

252
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,120
Now, you have to change

253
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,200
 the given inequation and solve it.

254
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,220
You understood up to here, right?

255
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,470
 What are you saying, mom?

256
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,570
 What do you mean we should make Doo Shim transfer schools?

257
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,840
 I found out where that evil spirit is.

258
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,710
 Songyeong High School.

259
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,050
 He is there.

260
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,200
 So, you want me to send Doo Shim there?

261
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,350
 He is too much for even you to handle. How can Doo Shim handle him?

262
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,350
 Only Doo Shim

263
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,530
 can handle him.

264
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,810
 How will she fight him alone?

265
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,730
 I only hear it as telling Doo Shim to die.

266
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,350
 There is someone who will fight with her.

267
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,310
 Me?

268
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,110
 You also know that I'm a novice shaman.

269
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,340
Ghosts come inside people's bodies too?

270
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,310
Only souls with special powers.

271
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,890
Or if a person with special powers casts a spell.

272
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,110
Is it only possible with people? What about animals?

273
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,970
Dogs, cats, the goldfish in the bowl.

274
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,940
It's possible, even flies.

275
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,220
Really?

276
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,830
Plants are given, but they can go in drawings and even dolls.

277
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,930
That's fascinating.

278
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,580

279
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,450
I'm sure someone else's soul went inside me that time.

280
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,450
What?

281
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,830
When I hugged you. Someone was inside me.

282
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,610
I don't remember hugging you.

283
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,330
If a person is desperate, sometimes they do things without knowing, right?

284
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,700
They don't even remember what they did.

285
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,570
Don't put all the blame on the souls.

286
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,460
I did hug you, but I don't  have any memory of it,

287
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,650
and I can't remember how it felt.

288
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,950
It's too unfair.

289
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,660
♫  It can not be seen yet  ♫

290
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,210
♫  Spread your arms wider  ♫

291
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,510
♫  Let's stay here a little longer  ♫

292
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,470
I will keep this memory.

293
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,840
Stop doing this.

294
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,530
I will kill you.

295
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,910
There's one thing good about being able to see ghosts.

296
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,360
I can run home like crazy.

297
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:03,300

298
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,200
 That night, the one who ran was Woo Soo.

299
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,540
 And also my heart.

300
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,200
♫  Fly in front of my eyes  ♫

301
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,230
♫  Even if you don't know the end  ♫

302
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,590
♫  Walking past each other  ♫

303

 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨ 
 ~ Preview ~

304
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,860
 I will listen to all of you, so listen to me too.

305
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,450
 Doo Shim is your daughter?

306
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,310
 I heard you are a shaman's daughter.

307
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,810
 I'm tired of talking about ghosts. Let's stop talking about it.

308
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,140
 Where are you going? Are you going to meet Doo Shim?

309
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,190
 It won't be good for you if you provoke me.

310
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,390
 You shouldn't be provoking me if you don't want me to introduce you to my new friends.

311
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,620
 There is an evil spirit in Songyeong High School. It only kills the last rank students.

312
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,340
 The first rank is again from our class.

313
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,640
 What about the last rank?

314
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
 You don't think that the last rank students committed suicide?

315
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,860
 It isn't suicide. There is someone.

316
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,010
 A murderer who kills the last rank students.
