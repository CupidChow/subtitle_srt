1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,960

3
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,390
Sir. Is the last rank student from our class?

4
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,770
Sir! Tell us.

5
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,610
Na Woo Soo.

6
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,050
I asked about the last rank student, not the first rank student.

7
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,910
What happened to you, Woo Soo?

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,890
Why are you the last rank student in the whole school?!

9
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,000

10
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,360
 âœ¨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shimâœ¨

11
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,550
I feel a bit relaxed now.

12
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,400
- What? 
 - I was always bothered about my mom slapping yours.

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I have paid my debt.

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,780
Do you know what you have done just now?

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,630
Something I have never done before in my life.

16
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,370
Something dangerous?

17
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,180
Knowing that, why did you do it?

18
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,700
Did you hit puberty? Are you rebelling?

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,400
- Why exactly? 
 - Then why did you do it?

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,650
- What? 
 - Why did you try to be the last rank student?

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,440
How do you know that?

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,230
Did Ae Kyung tell you?

23
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,350
So it wasn't a dream.

24
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,760
 Did you, perhaps...

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,610
Become the last rank student because of me?

26
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,610
This exam is invalid.

27
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,640
There was a misunderstanding. An exam that wasn't supposed to happen, took place.

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,780
Explain it to all the parents and students without leaving out anyone.

29
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,170
Tell them that this exam is invalid.

30
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,100
You get it? Get it?

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,180
You should have stopped me then.

32
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,900
Why don't you speak? I'm telling you to go out and explain.

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,160
Yes, I get it, sir.

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,920
Invalid. Invalid.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,370
What will I do about him? What will I do?

36
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,170
If it wasn't for you, I would have been the last rank student.

37
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,130
You really are capable.

38
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,230
You answered everything wrong except one question.

39
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,540
I didn't do it.

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,770
- What? 
 - This isn't my grades. Someone manipulated it.

41
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,480
Who?

42
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,790
It must be the person who wants to get rid of me from this school and this world.

43
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,430
I couldn't even imagine that you would mess it up, though.

44
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,100
I took it on myself.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,440
It is me who took it on myself.

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
What are you going to do now?

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,340
What?

48
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,190
You must have a plan for after becoming the last rank student, right?

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,030
I only planned till becoming the last rank student.

50
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,200
What are you going to do now? You are going to protect me, right?

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,250
You, seriously!

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,320
What happened?

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,230
No! No. You can't open the door.

54
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,460
You can't come out!

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,860
Never!

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,520
 I have evolved thanks to you.

57
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,420
 It's not your world anymore.

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,040
 Who is the last rank student in this exam?

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,250
I'll give you Doo Shim.

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,710
I'll give you Doo Shim.

61
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,180
 It's not Doo Shim?

62
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,360
 I don't care.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,630
 Because I'm going to do as I wish from now on.

64
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,630
I just don't understand.

65
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,410
- What's wrong with her? 
 - Hey! What are you doing?

66
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,440
I think I left something at school.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,980
What?

68
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,240
Friends.

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,150
- Lee Ae Kyung! 
 - Where are you going?

70
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,700

71
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,460
Aren't we supposed to fight it now?

72
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,020
We have to wait till everyone leaves.

73
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,780
We can't fight in front of the students.

74
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,960
Doo Shim.

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,560
If the evil spirit gets inside me,

76
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,590
then...

77
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,390
I will hit your head with the axe. I will not hesitate when the time comes.

78
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,210
Try wearing it. My mom made it stitch by stitch to bind talismans within.

79
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,210
A talisman that protects you from the attacks of the evil spirit.

80
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,890
I don't know how effective it will be, though.

81
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,990
We will know soon.

82
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,830
What are you guys doing?

83
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,020
Were you guys...

84
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,720
You guys what?

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,170
You guys...

86
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,750
were going to leave me and catch the evil spirit?

87
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,990
Go back. It's very dangerous.

88
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,320
You're annoying, so stay away.

89
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,500
You took away my last rank.

90
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,090
This is my place.

91
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,320
Doo Shim. We'll help you.

92
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,980
"We"?

93
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,720
Why would you come here?

94
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,620
I heard it all from Ae Kyung.

95
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,520
I am also sorry about Doo Shim.

96
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,080
I need to save Na Woo Soo.

97
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,280
I know this because I have fought a lot.

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,970
You can win only if you are superior in numbers.

99
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,660
I will also fight the evil spirit.

100
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,910
Okay.

101
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,540
There's something you guys can do.

102
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,770
Listen to me carefully from now on.

103
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,300
This is my plan...

104
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,460
 The evil spirit will appear when Woo Soo comes.

105
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,110
 We will use talismans.

106
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,850
 It will make sure he can't move from there.

107
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,380
 He will try to escape, but he would already be trapped.

108
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,700
 That's when you guys will come out from the classroom.

109
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,480
 When he gets distracted by you guys,

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,840
 right at that moment.

111
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,970
 Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

112
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 Hey!

113
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,590
How is my plan?

114
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,880
It's perfect.

115
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,160
When did you stick the talismans?

116
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,170
You guys should go and stick it now.

117
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,200
Can we also see the evil spirit?

118
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,840
Close your eyes.

119
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,340
It's a request.

120
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,650
Please don't get hurt.

121
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,760
 Don't worry.

122
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,160
What's wrong?

123
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,390
It's nothing.

124
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,620
Doo Shim.

125
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,030
Don't go away from me.

126
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,080
You are the last rank student.

127
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,390
Stay right next to me.

128
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,660

129
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,380
Can you see it?

130
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,500
Yes, I can.

131
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,650
 You're here?

132
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,220
Yes, we are.

133
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,140
 Who is ranked last in this school?

134
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,080
You answer it. It's your turn to take the test.

135
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,130
If you don't know, then take a guess.

136
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,150
 I know the answer.

137
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,520
 Here I come!

138
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,440
You're ready, right?

139
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,830
Don't worry about me.

140
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,700
You also don't worry about me.

141
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,040
I will live the life I want to live after safely completing my eighteenth year.

142
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,710
This is ridiculous.

143
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,230
The talismans aren't working.

144
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,730
He is stronger than when it was Il Ram's turn.

145
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,300
What happened?

146
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,120
The souls of all the dead students

147
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,880
are inside the evil spirit.

148
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,670
He has eaten all of them up.

149
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,170
 Na Woo Soo, have you evolved too?

150
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,600
 It's not over by just dying.

151
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
 You will still be tested.

152
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,080
Hey!

153
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,510
 Are you playing "house"?

154
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,060
 Do you think I can't possess you?

155
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,170
Hey!

156
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,140
 Oh! Wait a moment. Your turn is after Woo Soo's.

157
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,930
No, I'm going to chew all of you in-side out just like what you're worth.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,590
Be bound by my words and stop!

159
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,840
You got what you wanted. Now leave!

160
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,710
Be bound by my words and stop!

161
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,910
You got what you wanted. Now leave! Doo Shim, quickly!

162
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,140
 I told you, right? You can't stop me now.

163
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,000
Doo Shim.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,990
Let's bind our strength.

165
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,880
Hold my hand.

166
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
 Be bound by my words and stop!

167
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,810
You got what you wanted. Now leave!

168
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,140
 Be bound by my words and stop!

169
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,370
You got what you wanted.

170
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,910
 Now leave!

171
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,570
An ax. We have to find the ax.

172
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
I didn't want to believe it.

173
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,860
Let me go. It is all because of her.

174
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,050
After you came, my school has become a mess.

175
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,530
It will only go back to normal if you disappear.

176
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,600
You are the real evil spirit!

177
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,570
What did you say? Let go of me, I said!

178
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,400
It's all because of Ga Doo Shim, let go!

179
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,860
Don't move.

180
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,510
I worked so hard to

181
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,800
make this good image of Seongyeong High School.

182
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,200
Would they have found it? Woo Soo and Doo Shim must be fine, right?

183
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,980
You should check it for yourself if you're worried.

184
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,960
I don't want to.

185
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,770
This was a school that had no hope.

186
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,730
Seongyeong High School.

187
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,640
I made the worst school in the nation,

188
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,840
the best, reputed school in the nation.

189
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,140
I did it. Who can curse

190
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,190
a person like me? Who would dare?

191
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,190
Damn it!

192
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,260
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

193
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,080
I swore at you on behalf

194
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,110
of the students who died because of you.

195
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,550
Let's find the evil spirit first.

196
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,230
Damn it!

197
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,040
This is on behalf of my grandmother.

198
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,620
The rooftop.

199
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,250
I'm the school's first rank student. I have no intention of dying.

200
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,270
Soo Jung!

201
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,970
Save me, please.

202
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,640
I don't want to die.

203
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,310
Soo Jung. Get your senses together.

204
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,520
I got you.

205
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,960

206
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,790
Can you see you dying?

207
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,160
Can you see it?

208
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,270
No.

209
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,260
Of course not, because I will save you.

210
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,780
â™«  Oh dear my nights, oh dear our dreams,  â™«

211
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,750
â™«  even if itâ€™s a long night, youâ€™ll meet a better dream   â™«

212
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,980
â™«  Oh dear my nights,  â™«

213
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,740
 âœ¨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shimâœ¨ 
 ~ Preview ~

214
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,230
 Beg for forgiveness from the dead students.

215
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,030
 Would someone even care if you died?

216
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,930
 Hang in there, Woo Soo.

217
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,580
 Doo Shim, I can see myself dying.

218
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,420
 He became weak. The students died because of you.

219
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,080
 There must be students who are in pain because of the evil spirit. I pity them.

220
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,170
 Doo Shim, what will you do if you graduate?

221
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,170
 I want to leave this place.

222
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,130
 Now you have to choose, Doo Shim.

223
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,770
 I was completely fooled by my grandma.

224
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,770
 Where is Il Ram? Il Ram!

225
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,400
 This is too unfair. I will be able to live a long and happy life, right?
