1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,100
Why would you look for a priest, monk, or reverend?

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,100
If something like that happens, you should look for me, the "Beautiful Bodhisattva". You wasted your money.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,220
I will be there shortly, so prepare the cash.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,310
Where are we going?

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,450
Cheongdam-dong, then Songyeong High School.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,040
Are you crazy, Mom?

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,230
Today is my first day at the new school. Drop me off at Songyeong High School before you go to Cheongdam-dong.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,780
You are transferring schools thanks to me.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,210
You... aren't you going to become independent after you graduate high school?

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,900
Did you agree to help me until then, or didn't you?

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,950

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,010
Doo Shim, save me!

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,680
What? You're not pretending?

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,060
Don't.

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,530
Doo Shim, save me–

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,860
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted, now leave!

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,190
Ah, really.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,030
That's enough!

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,260
How are you going to deal with the repercussions?

20
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,200
Be bound by my words and stop.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
You got what you wanted, now–

22
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm late for school.

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,060
Doo...

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,420

25
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,780
Hey, hey, quiet!

26
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,200
You all got your report cards, right? The exam tomorrow— What was that?

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,010
 Oh my gosh.

28
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,410
 What is all this?

29
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,220
 What is it? What is it?

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,100
 Hey, hey, hey!

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,340
Someone jumped from the rooftop!

32
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,150
I think he's Jong Geun from Class Three.

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,550
Don't you hear me?

34
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,990
Go back to your seats!

35
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,150
I knew it would be Jong Geun this time.

36
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,750
 Are you serious?

37
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,120
 Is he dead?

38
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,220
 Hey, go back to your seats.

39
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,370
 Jong Geun!

40
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,210
 Listen to your teacher!

41
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,710
 Why?

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,500
Chang Do!

43
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,650
Chang Do, and Ae Kyung, get back to your seats.

44
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,380
You guys.

45
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,210
Excuse me, Teacher.

46
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,800
Who are you?

47
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm the transfer student.

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,360
Right, a transfer student was joining today.

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,580
Introduce yourself later. First...

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,370
What happened to your face?

51
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,990
Are you okay?

52
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,830
There was an accident on the way.

53
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,590
Okay, go take the empty seat.

54
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,240
Chang Do, Ae Kyung, sit down. Come on, sit down.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,570
Everybody, study on your own

56
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,000
until I come back.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,400
- Don't look outside, okay? 
 - Yes.

58
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,950
Nice to meet you. You didn't get to introduce yourself.

59
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm Jo Soo Jung.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,420
Oh... I'm Ga Doo Shim.

61
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,570
Are you good at school?

62
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,860
Why?

63
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,830
I want to be friends with you,

64
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,920
but I can't if you die too soon.

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,150
What do you mean?

66
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,420
At this school, you die if you don't get good grades.

67
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,030
You saw the kid who jumped, right?

68
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,320
He was almost certainly going to rank last in the entire school this time.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,330
And sure enough...

70
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,020
So you mean that the person who ranks last commits suicide?

71
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,970
It's not suicide, though it's not murder either.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,500
Anyway, you die.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,350
So if you don't want to die, study really hard.

74
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,550
That's how Songyeong High School works.

75
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,580
Then I'll get going now.

76
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,830
Well...

77
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,480
She would be perfect as my maid.

78
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,240
Then what about me?

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,670
You?

80
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,670
You are my slave.

81
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,060
This is a headache.

82
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,500
Were there any problems with this student?

83
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,810
There weren't any.

84
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,460
Then let's say it was problems at home.

85
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,840
There weren't any problems at home either.

86
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,830
How would others know about family problems?

87
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,660
The student had issues with his parents, so he confided in his teacher a few times.

88
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,240
Create some records.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,770
That would be—

90
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,810
Then what?

91
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,580
Should we say he had problems with his homeroom teacher,

92
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,230
so he confided in another teacher a few times? Is this how we should handle it?

93
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,510
I understand.

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,480
Be very clear with the students.

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,790
Not only will any student who spreads false rumors be punished accordingly,

96
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,750
they will be sued for damaging the school's reputation.

97
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,410
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes.

98
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,510

99
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,690

100
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,020

101
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,290

102
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,910

103
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,530

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,730

105
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,650
Why? Are you scared?

106
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,400
Who is scared? I won't lose to you in anything except academics.

107
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,980
So he broke open the locked door to the roof, and jumped without hesitation?

108
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,610
That doesn't make sense.

109
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,610
Jong Geun was the icon of cowardice.

110
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,560
What in the world is it?

111
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,510
Why are you so interested in other people's busisness? It doesn't suit you.

112
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,310
Because it isn't other people's busisness.

113
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,450
It's about my friend who's in trouble.

114
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,210
What?

115
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,530
There are a lot of kids

116
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,220
who think you're going to rank last in the next exam.

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,860
You listen to other people's words?

118
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,200
I think so too.

119
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,230
Hey!

120
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,370
Ae Kyung and I are neck to neck!

121
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,830
Why do you think it will be me?

122
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,970

123
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,620

124
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,090
How does it feel?

125
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,070
Starting at Korea's top high school, thanks to your mom.

126
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,900
There was an accident the moment I got there.

127
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,760
An accident? Oh no.

128
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,860
Someone committed suicide.

129
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,260
Suicide?

130
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,680
There's something strange about this school.

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,180
What is?

132
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,890
A ghost—

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,990
Never mind.

134
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,290
How long will you keep denying your powers?

135
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,430
Do you think I wanted to become a shaman?

136
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,840
There's such a thing as an unavoidable destiny.

137
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,550
I said I won't do it, I hate it.

138
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,720
I don't have the talent.

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,870
I was like that too when I was your age.

140
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,210
I shouted at your grandmother and cried.

141
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,480
Mom,

142
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,310
you asked that CEO's wife or whoever to keep it a secret, right?

143
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,210
That I'm a shaman's daughter.

144
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,720
Did you? If someone at school finds out—

145
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
What? So what if they find out?

146
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,140
Is it really that embarrassing that I'm a shaman?

147
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,000
You are not embarrassing.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Then what?

149
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,720
Then what?

150
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,580
 Aren't your grandmother and mom both shamans?

151
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,650
 - Then you will become a shaman too. 
 - Doo Shim, catch a ghost.

152
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,880
  - The wallet disappeared. 
 - Stop troubling Doo Shim.

153
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,050
 What if she curses us?

154
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,030
 Stop!

155
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:37,390

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,640
This is my room. Get out.

157
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,340
I told you not to come in here.

158
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,990
Bodhisattva is going crazy looking for me.

159
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,130
I'll just stay for a bit before I go.

160
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,120
That's why you shouldn't have acted up.

161
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,900
 Be bound by my words and stop.

162
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,760
 You got what you wanted, now—

163
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,970
I mean, you always make me work and don't keep your promise!

164
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,870
How long has it been since you said you'd help me meet my mom?

165
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,700
It's been ten years. Ten years!

166
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,400
Don't complain to me. Go complain to my mom.

167
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,310
Doo Shim, can't you find my mom for me?

168
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,680
I would find her if I had any memories,

169
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,740
but I don't remember anything.

170
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,510
I just remember that I had a mom.

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,630
 Hyun Soo, why are you there?

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,800
Doo Shim, please!

173
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,710
Get out, before I tell my mom that you are here.

174
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,350
 Of course.

175
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,990
  - Madam.  
 - Aish!

176
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,550
 My daughter seems to like the school a lot.

177
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,470
 But there seems to have been an accident at the school.

178
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,010
 Oh, you didn't know.

179
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,110
I know, right? That poor thing.

180
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,350
He will become a lost soul unless we send him off properly.

181
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,350
Mom!

182
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,210
Do you happen to know his mother's number?

183
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,210
We should at least do a Jinohguigut for him— 
  (T/N: a traditional ritual for sending off dead spirits to the Underworld)

184
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,010
What are you doing?

185
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,460
Why would you contact a dead kid's mom?

186
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,120
So that they can tell everyone?

187
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,770
That Ga Doo Shim from Class Five is a shaman's daughter?

188
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,210
What are you saying?

189
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,230
I just pitied the dead boy.

190
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,340
Stop it.

191
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,880
Was this the reason you made me transfer schools?

192
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,350
- What? 
 - You wanted to use me to approach new clients,

193
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,630
since there are so many rich people?

194
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,380
I'm right.

195
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,080
You made me transfer

196
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,400
so you could gain wealthy clients.

197
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,860
You are smart, my daughter.

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,650
She is worth keeping around.

199
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,830
She is obsessed with money, but I guess her skills pay off.

200
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,700
She told me that I would be getting luck money from the West, and I didn't know what she was saying. 
   (T/N: Luck money - Considered a mascot to pray for luck and can act as a talisman to ward off evil spirits)

201
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,400
The business you are conducting in Jordan this time...

202
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,430
Jordan is in the... West, right?

203
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes.

204
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,570
Isn't there a transfer student who joined your class today?

205
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,460
She's that shaman's daughter.

206
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,410
She has a lot of unique powers. She can also communicate with ghosts.

207
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,390
Use her when you need to. She'll be useful.

208
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,540
I don't believe in that. It's all a fraud, mom.

209
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,250
What are you saying?

210
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,050
That shaman probably told her daughter to keep an eye out for me.

211
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,620
To scare you into spending money if she finds anything.

212
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,610
It's obvious.

213
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,190
That's my son. He is smart.

214
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,600
Mom, your son is doing great.

215
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
You don't have to worry.

216
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,780
Excuse me.

217
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,570
That's mine.

218
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,880
If you get into a motorcycle accident, will your parents leave me alone?

219
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,650
They will kill you. It's fun even when I imagine it.

220
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,380
You are pleasantly annoying.

221
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,850
I wrote out all the steps to solving all the problems. Memorize every single one.

222
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,700
I will save my only friend no matter what.

223
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,660
Die? Who will die?

224
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,810
I can't ride when the roads are busy. Let me ride with you!

225
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,370

226
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,640
Hurray for Dooshim's Independence. Until that day comes.

227
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,400
So, in order for the angle of AB to get closer to this...

228
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,890
Daebak. Hey, big news.

229
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,150
They say that, when Jong Geun jumped yesterday,

230
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,440
she was next to him.

231
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,510
What? The transfer student?

232
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,320
She must have pushed Jong Geun.

233
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,600
She forcefully pushed Jong Geun, who didn't want to die.

234
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,050
She was so hurt when she came in yesterday.

235
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,470
I'm getting goosebumps. Isn't she crazy?

236
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,820
But why would she do that to Jong Geun?

237
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,790
Maybe she has some grudge against him.

238
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,710
That could be true.

239
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,060
What?

240
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,580
It's the rule here to trouble the transfer students for nonsense reasons.

241
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,350
-That's the rule. 
 -That's right.

242
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,090
Excuse me. You.

243
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,750
Do you happen to read compatibility?

244
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,180
Can you see the compatibility between me and her?

245
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,580
If we are compatible or not.

246
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,710
What is he saying?

247
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,070
Why? Why would she read compatibility?

248
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,470
 Aren't your grandmother and mom shamans?

249
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,420
 My wallet disappeared.

250
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,200
 You must be a shaman too.

251
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,770
 You would know if you're a shaman.

252
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,480
 I'm going to go crazy because of my parents.

253
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,840
 I wish they would just disappear!

254
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,320
 Can you see Jong Geun's ghost?

255
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,370
 Stop it, all of you. Doo Shim might....

256
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,380
Please stop.

257
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,030
 ...kill us all.

258
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,020
Stop!

259
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,630
Did I do something?

260
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,570
Maybe she's guilty.

261
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,550
She's taken such a weird concept for herself.

262
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,310
 I can't hear you.

263
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,730
 I actually heard her.

264
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,130
 Grandma said to me,

265
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,400
 "Stay safe till you complete eighteen years."

266
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,420
 "Then you will live a long and happy life."

267
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,720
 My eighteenth year has fallen in danger.

268
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,240
Is she leaving?

269
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,280
Scary.

270
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,420
 Eighteen, will I be able to complete it safely?

271
00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:01,010

272
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,740
Don't go, Doo Shim.

273
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,080
♫  Oh dear my nights  ♫

274
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,000
♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

275
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,880
♫  It's going to be a long night  ♫

276
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,030
♫  I'll get a cooler dream  ♫

277
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,540
♫  Oh dear my nights  ♫

278
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,280
♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

279
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,470

~ Preview ~

280
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,350
 I don't want you to misunderstand. I don't remember anything.

281
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,920
 I felt like something got into me for a moment.

282
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,420
 How about you stop being interested in me?

283
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,590
 What's over there?

284
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,460
  - A ghost. 
 - It can't be.

285
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,620
 What have you done to me?

286
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,020
 You think I did that?

287
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,600
 Then who else?

288
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,120
 Then do I have to live like this? Seeing ghosts?

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,750
 Welcome to my world.

290
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,180
 I didn't do that!

291
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,900
 There's evidence too. What are you saying?

292
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,680
 Do you know how much Woo Soo was shocked because of you?

293
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,610
 Do you like him?

294
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,380
 He is here.

295
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,830
 The evil spirit that you met ten years ago.
