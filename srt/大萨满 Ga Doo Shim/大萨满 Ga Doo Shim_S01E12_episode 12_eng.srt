1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,800
Don't move.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,370
I worked so hard for

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,620
Songyeong High School.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,240
This was a school that had no hope. Songyeong High School.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,820
 What kind of a school is this?

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,370
 What kind of a principal is he?

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,070
 It's total crap, I say.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,450
 Now my whole family needs to move so I can get in another school!

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,170
 We managed to get a reasonable house and land fee, but this place is crap!

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,350
 The principal should take responsibility.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,700
 He's just so incapable.

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,690
 I am a useless being. I have to die.

14
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,210
 I don't want to die. Who the hell are you?

15
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,200
 Would someone even care if you died? You're just an incapable principal.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,580
 No. If I get the chance, I can do well.

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,640
 Give me a chance please.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,720
 A chance?

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,830
 Listen to me. So whenever an exam is over

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,120
 the last rank student dies. What will happen?

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,830
 No one would care.

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,540
 The students will study hard because they are scared of dying.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,690
 What will I get from that?

24
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,460
 Anything. I'll do anything for you.

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,380
 Catch Myo Shim for me. Then I'll do whatever you want me to do.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,850
I chased your grandma like crazy.

27
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,940
I learned a lot.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,710
From the spell that makes the evil spirit tremble

29
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,330
to making the talisman that would not let the evil spirit move.

30
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,330
A way to live.

31
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,720
I finally could catch your grandmother.

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,050
I controlled the evil spirit.

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,360
Thanks to that,

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,120
I was able to save a school that was almost ruined.

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,030
The students died

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,930
because of you.

37
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,430
Beg for forgiveness from the dead students.

38
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,200
That is what you have to do.

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,210
One genius can feed

40
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,480
the whole country.

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,760
I nurtured students who had the potential for that.

42
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,280
By myself.

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,170
I sent them on the right path.

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,060
I am...

45
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,690
the first rank in the principals in this country.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
You, guys,

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,440
can't win against me.

48
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,210
You, guys, can never win against me.

49
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,130
We will.

50
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,450
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,230

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,710
Hang in there, Woo Soo. You can do it.

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,600
Doo Shim, I can see myself dying.

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,640
Get your senses together.

55
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,670
See what you want to see. Please.

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,310
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,110
 The students are helping us.

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,140
 The evil spirit is now weak.

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,020
Ae Kyung!

60
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

61
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,650
Doo Shim.

62
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,360
Are you okay?

63
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,730
 Myo Shim.

64
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,230
Doo Shim and Woo Soo have done a good job.

65
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,190
 I told you, right?

66
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,110
 That the world won't change just because you caught me.

67
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,430
I told you too, right?

68
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,980
That it is not us but the children who change the world.

69
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,130
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

70
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,900
 Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave!

71
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,290
The ax!

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,470
Grandma.

73
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,450
You did well.

74
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,460
Doo Shim and Woo Soo, you did a good job.

75
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,270
You don't know how I was on the edge.

76
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,870
Were you watching over us all the time?

77
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,400
This is too much.

78
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,670
From now on, it is your own work to do.

79
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,510
There is no answer.

80
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,410
You have to choose now, Doo Shim.

81
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,090
I'll now

82
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,830
take the children along with me.

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,610
Don't go, grandma.

84
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,870
I have to go now.

85
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,040
It's been too long.

86
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,910
I will live a happy and long life from now on, right?

87
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,060
I can't see the future.

88
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,310
It's a lie that

89
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,540
shaman's can see the future.

90
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,830
But, I believe

91
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,640
that it will be so.

92
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,540
A blind eye will lead to the truth of your heart.

93
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,520
Everything will be fine now.

94
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,290
I was fooled. I was totally fooled by my grandma.

95
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,020
Game over... is what I thought.

96
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,530
- Hyun Soo. 
 - Il Ram.

97
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,360
Il Ram is in the graveyard where grandma is.

98
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,580
- Hyun Soo! 
 - Hyun Soo!

99
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,210
Doo Shim.

100
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,240
I kept doing this and remembered my house.

101
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,350
Really?

102
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,850
I'll see my mom and leave. Stay safe.

103
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,700
Hyun Soo, thank you.

104
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,390
Goodbye.

105
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,370
Bye.

106
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,470
Then, I will go and find Il Ram.

107
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,560
Ae Kyung, what's wrong?

108
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm very happy.

109
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,110
I am definitely the last rank student next time.

110
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,230
But I don't have to die, thanks to you.

111
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,500
Doo Shim.

112
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,940
I will live confidently even if I become the last rank student.

113
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,580
I will become a popular webtoon artist and tell your story.

114
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,200
Ah, damn! I'm dead.

115
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,580
Il Ram!

116
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,330
Il Ram! Where are you?

117
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,260
Il Ram!

118
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,060
Na Woo Soo!

119
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,340
Il Ram.

120
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,670
Jerk. What took you so long?

121
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,420
I thought I was going to die.

122
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,880
Il Ram! Il Ram.

123
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,140
Il Ram. Il Ram.

124
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,970
Il Ram.

125
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,380
Il Ram.

126
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,730
Oh, God, thank you.

127
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,590
Excuse me.

128
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,600

129
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560

130
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,560
Teacher, Il Ram is sleeping.

131
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,790
Kim Il Ram. How can you sleep after sleeping for such a long time?

132
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,530
Okay, be quiet and complete the exam.

133
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,740
 Okay.

134
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,700
 The death of the principal was forgotten faster than that of the students.

135
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,440
 Thanks to the rich and powerful parents he trusted and relied on,

136
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,430
 thanks to the competitive atmosphere he so desperately emphasized,

137
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,350
 the incident was rushed to a close as an accident.

138
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,080
 And...

139
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,510
 The dead students started becoming memories to the rest of the students.

140
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,980
 The shadow of death left the school.

141
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,550
 Instead, it was filled with the smiles of the students.

142
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,600
It must be tasty.

143
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,200
- Take everything safely. 
 - Okay.

144
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,530
Here. It must be tasty, right?

145
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,170
My mom says you guys can eat whatever you want. It's her treat today.

146
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,570
Really? Daebak!

147
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,150
I will be buying today, for I am the school's first rank student.

148
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,800
We still don't have our results.

149
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,080
It's obvious, even if we don't look at it.

150
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,730
My anger is raising.

151
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,560
Ae Kyung, shall we just eat ramen?

152
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,750
Of course.

153
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,930
Please give us a ramen here, aunty.

154
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,070
Okay! I'll double the eggs!

155
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,280
I'd love that!

156
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,310
You make it and eat. Why are you ordering my mom?

157
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,850
Doo Shim, what will you do after graduating?

158
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,690
Me? I haven't thought about it yet.

159
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,700
I want to leave this place.

160
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,510
Leave? Where?

161
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,970
Overseas?

162
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,640
If I can,

163
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,530
I will move out and live alone.

164
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,440
 Are you really going to move out?

165
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,830
 You promised me.

166
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,760
 Well, I did promise.

167
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:18,170
 But, in the world, there are still students that have been in pain because of evil spirits.

168
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,640
 I pity them.

169
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,790
 Give me money.

170
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,530
 What? Money?

171
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,750
 You must have some money that you saved, right?

172
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,290
 You need to give me my share when I move out.

173
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,150
 Don't even talk about money.

174
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,730
 If people go after money,

175
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,650
 evil spirits go after them.

176
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,800
 Forget it. Just forget it.

177
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,350
 Anyway, I'll move out.

178
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,850
Moving out is good. Everyone, lift your glasses.

179
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,160
When I say "To Doo Shim moving out" you guys say "Cheers."

180
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,340
To Doo Shim moving out!

181
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,630
 Cheers!

182
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,350
What will you do after graduating, Woo Soo?

183
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,410
I'm not sure. I have never thought about it.

184
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,750
I need to think about it from now on.

185
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,480
I have never done anything other than what was planned for me by my parents.

186
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,650
Before I met you,

187
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,620
I did everything my parents and teachers told me to do.

188
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,380
No, I did it even before they told me to.

189
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,970
Should I live like that hereafter, too?

190
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,010
You can see the future a little bit, right?

191
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,290
I can't see that far in the future.

192
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,000
Just this much, I guess.

193
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,120
Shall I tell you what I see?

194
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,180
Na Woo Soo who is a genius will go to Seoul University and study medicine.

195
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,900
Then, you'll have a peaceful internship, and land a job in the severe trauma center.

196
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,880
Oh, you even get married.

197
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,850
- With whom? 
 - That I don't know.

198
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,550
Your wife must have it hard because of your mom.

199
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,940
Anyway, you should move out and get a Suite room in a Penthouse.

200
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,410
When you're barely thirty.

201
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,550
Anyone can predict that much.

202
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,630
You're annoying.

203
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,980
But, that is not fun.

204
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,690
I don't want to live like that.

205
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,380
Doo Shim. After we're independent... do you want to get together?

206
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,850
What?

207
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,380
I want to be with you.

208
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,530
Immobility charm. Stop.

209
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,980
We had our last kiss.

210
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,860
Let's go home, it's getting late.

211
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,430
♫  With a smile, come into my arms

212
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,680
A blind eye will lead to the truth of your heart.

213
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,400
Yes, everything will be fine.
