1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,980

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,050
 It's Woo Soo.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,940
 - The top student. 
 - A real genuis

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,140
 The school's treasure.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,430
 Oh Jong Geun?

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,420
 Kang Ji Soo?

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,800
 Kim Ji Min.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,170
 Hye Seon.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,330
 Yoo Tae Yang.

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,790
 Doo Shim.

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,040
Ga Doo Shim!

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,070
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

13
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,550

14
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,440
Are you okay?

15
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,310
Here...

16
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,660
The students are here.

17
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,470

18
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,830
There were more student's whom I didn't know than the students whom I knew,

19
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,890
if what I saw in my dream was right.

20
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,120
I think that they are—

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,430
The last rank students of this school.

22
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,120
I think they are the ones who died in this school.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,820
Then do you mean the evil spirit has locked up the dead students forever? Why?

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,360
We will be able to find the reason if we catch it.

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,550
What are we going to do now?

26
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,200
You should come up with a strategy. What should we start with?

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Do you think this is a game?

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,370
You said that this is a game. You said that you wanted to get the first rank.

29
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,520
If this is a game, we would need teammates, right?

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,100
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,360
Class is starting soon.

32
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,490
Sir.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
Evil spirit?

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,050
Yes, there is an evil spirit in this school.

35
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,600
It only kills the last rank students.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,720
It was that evil spirit that did that to Il Ram.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,300
So you guys want me to believe what you guys are saying?

38
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,690
Okay.

39
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,750
I'll believe you.

40
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,870
Really?

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,750
I wouldn't have believed it if you said all this alone. Since Woo Soo is also saying the same, I'll believe it.

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,890
The first ranks student is so different.

43
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,360
I'm actually on duty today. I'll wait for you with the keys to the basement.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Come later.

45
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,410
 - This is made from a 500-year-old foxglove tree, and it has a bronze blade. 
 - Okay.

46
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,360
Once the evil spirit comes out, you have to hit the top of its head like this.

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,590
The top of its head?

48
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,880
Yes, the top of the spirit's head.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,700
Look at that. What are they doing?

50
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,050
They have finally gone crazy.

51
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,750
They have gone crazy.

52
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,160
Does it look like they're crazy to your eyes?

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,820
They are catching a ghost.

54
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,080
What? Ghost?

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,350
From which angle?

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,200
We can't see it, but they both can see it.

57
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,020
Looks like they caught it.

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,330
Son.

59
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,890
Will you be able to come out at night?

60
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,620
Mrs. Na.

61
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,680
Oh, Soo Jung!

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
Hello!

63
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,390
Ah, nice to meet you.

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,060
How have you been?

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,340
My mom asked me to convey her regards.

66
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,680
Is that so?

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,690
Yes, come over to our place.

68
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,680
 Okay, I will come.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,130
Looks like your mom likes Soo Jung a lot.

70
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,350
She does, very much.

71
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,450

72
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,150
Where are you going again? Are you crazy?

73
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,720
You can't go.

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,020
Doo Shim.

75
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,250
I am regretting a lot sending you to this school.

76
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,900
I made a mistake. Let's get you transferred to another school.

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,200
I won't transfer schools.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,950
Why? Why?

79
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,420
What do the dead students have to do with you?

80
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,390
I'm not doing this for the students.

81
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,190
Then?

82
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm doing this for myself.

83
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,630
I won't run away.

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,640
Doo Shim.

85
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,440
It's so out of the blue

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,530
you calling me to study together.

87
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,350
What?

88
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,800
Did you get your senses together now?

90
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,620
Soo Jung. I'm sorry.

91
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,240
For what?

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,600
Go in quickly.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,630
Where?

94
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,390
No. Not you.

95
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,890
Go in quickly, please.

96
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,000
You only use me whenever you need me.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,160
Hyun Soo, right?

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,690
 Hyun Soo, do me a favor just this once.

99
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,040
 No I won't.

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,380
 Hyun Soo.

101
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,530
 I don't want to, I won't.

102
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,560
Let's go, you jerk. We don't have time.

103
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,000

104
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,440
There was this kind of place in this school?

105
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,720
Sir, the keys, please.

106
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,290
Here.

107
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,530
Promise me that you will stay in front of me for sure.

108
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,620
Why suddenly?

109
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,890
Are you scared?

110
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,900
Promise me.

111
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,240
None of the keys match.

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,670
There are only a few left now.

113
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,560
I can trust you guys, right?

114
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,680
Where are they?

115
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,290

116
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,670

117
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,300

118
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,020
It opened.

119
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,170
You should go upstairs.

120
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,750
Hey, I'm a teacher.

121
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,990
How can I leave you guys here?

122
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,350
Then you should stay in the back.

123
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,360
Should I?

124
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,390
Th-there's nothing here.

125
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,800
Do you see them?

126
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,890
I see them. The kids are here.

127
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,110
What about the evil spirit?

128
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,690
It's not here.

129
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,970
It can appear from anywhere, so you better beware.

130
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,810
It's Woo Soo.

131
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,220
Oh Jeong Geun?

132
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,190
It's the top ranker.

133
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,170
It's Woo Soo, the genius.

134
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,930
- Why are you here? 
 - Why aren't you wearing the uniform?

135
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,180
 That's strange.

136
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,960
It doesn't make sense. Why are you here?

137
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,090
Why are you here?

138
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,310
We have to be here.

139
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,880
- Why? 
 - The teacher said we have to.

140
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,650
Which teacher?

141
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,170
Keep quiet. We'll be in trouble if the teacher finds out.

142
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,910
Let's go first and then we can talk.

143
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,460
Please be quiet. We'll be in trouble if he finds out.

144
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,680
I understand, so let's leave before he comes—

145
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,950
What are you saying? He's standing behind you.

146
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,130
In my time,

147
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,160
teachers didn't use words.

148
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,120
If the fist didn't work, then a cane would do.

149
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,300
If the cane failed too, then

150
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,180
they would use a club. It was all for your sake!

151
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,480
Hey!

152
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,180
I almost killed the top student.

153
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,720
Be bound by my words and stop!

154
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,850
You got what you wanted. Now leave!

155
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,880
Ga Doo Shim, it isn't my meal time, but I want to eat you as soon as possible.

156
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,270
Right now!

157
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,180
Doo Shim.

158
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,070
Doo Shim! The ax!

159
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,950
What are you doing? Quick!

160
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,320
I don't have it.

161
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,700
Doo Shim!

162
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,770
I found out who it was. The one who killed your grandmother is your principal!

163
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,410
 I've caught you after ten years.

164
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,690
Hyun Soo!

165
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,270
No.

166
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,630
Hyun Soo.

167
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,390
I had to find Hyun Soo's mom.

168
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,200
Hyun Soo's last words... What did he mean?

169
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,160

170
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,010
All of this was the principal's work.

171
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,690
What are you going to do? Do you have evidence to prove that?

172
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,350
Let go.

173
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,160
Who do you think is going to believe us?

174
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,260
People believe the word of adults, and we're going against an adult.

175
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,450
Also, he can control the evil spirit.

176
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,900
We'll suffer if we act without thinking.

177
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,730
Then what are we supposed to do?

178
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,810
Let's hold on, wait for a while. I'll think of something.

179
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,730
The evil spirit took those guys and disappeared to some place.

180
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,410
The Principal is definitely behind this. What do we do?

181
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,950
We have to find the evil spirit first.

182
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:02,460
Only then we'll be able to find those guys and Hyun Soo. And no one else will die.

183
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,610
You're right. If we find the evil spirit, the Principal will start moving.

184
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,800
Then we'll be able to find evidence.

185
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,300
No matter how,

186
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,380
I will make him confess that he killed my grandmother.

187
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,240
But how do we find the evil spirit?

188
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,860
Did you think of something?

189
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,650
Il Ram.

190
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,450
Only Hyun Soo knew where Il Ram is.

191
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,590
What do we do if he wakes up?

192
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,050
Hyun Soo, is that you?

193
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,430

194
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,660
 Is it me? I didn't see it.

195
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,170
Hey!

196
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,130
We have a mock test this week!

197
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,450
- Are they crazy? 
 - What is all this?

198
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,070
It hasn't been long since we had our last exam.

199
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,100
Just kill us all, why don't they? Geez.

200
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,030
I'm really not going to die, right?

201
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,140
I'm going to become a webtoon artist, right?

202
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,620
Answer me! Am I really not going to die?

203
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,230
You can just study.

204
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,660
 The evil spirit can only kill the last rank student.

205
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,930
 In other words, the evil spirit will definitely come for the last rank.

206
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,060
 But how do we find the evil spirit?

207
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,850
 If I can't find it...

208
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,130
 I'll have to make it find me.

209
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,700
♫  Oh dear my nights  ♫

210
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,620
♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

211
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,540
♫  It's going to be a long night  ♫

212
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,820
♫  You’ll meet a better dream.  ♫

213
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,110
♫  Oh dear my nights  ♫

214
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,180
♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

215
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,090
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨ 
 ~ Preview ~

216
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,860
 We'll exchange the answer sheets.

217
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
 Madam, looks like someone has cheated.

218
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,050
 Na Woo Soo, why are you interfering in someone else's business?

219
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,160
 This test is important to me.

220
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,920
 I'm giving Ga Doo Shim a chance.

221
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,410
 What did you do to me? Did Doo Shim ask you to torture me?

222
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,890
 If you're that scared of dying, you should've studied.

223
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,560
 Wait just a bit longer, I'll give you what you want.

224
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,250
 I can't manipulate the grades.

225
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,120
 Who do you think is the better teacher?

226
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,620
 Answer me, you bastard!

227
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,150
 This is a secret from others. Last rank of the school, you have confidence, right?

228
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,860
 You're not planning something behind my back, are you?

229
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,820
 Why are you the last rank student?
