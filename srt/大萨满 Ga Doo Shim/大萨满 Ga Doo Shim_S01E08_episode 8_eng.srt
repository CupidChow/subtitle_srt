1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,690

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:08,060

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,930
 I had forgotten

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,190
 that evil spirits were not my only opponents.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,060

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,660
 I had forgotten

7
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,940
 that there was someone on my side.

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,860
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,340
What did you say?

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,200
Choose whether you will

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,850
transfer schools or drop out of this school.

12
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,040
What is the reason?

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,350
Son, you stay quiet.

14
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,160
Ruining the atmosphere conducive to academic pursuit,

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,670
she disrupted the class and left school early without permission.

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,120
I also did that with her.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,230
Then, I will also transfer schools or drop out of this school.

18
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,220
Are you crazy?

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,890
I won't transfer schools.

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,890
I won't drop out of this school, either.

21
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,300
Ga Doo Shim, this isn't a simple problem.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,320
You were with Il Ram when he was about to commit suicide, right?

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,760
If the police took over the issue, then it would have been a big headache.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,380
We barely stopped that from happening.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,900
I was there with her.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,200
That must be because Ga Doo Shim forcefully threatened you or something—

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,870
I was the one who forcefully threatened her.

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,040
So that she would help my friend.

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,460
What are you going to do?

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,200
Don't worry, madam.

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,510
We will transfer her.

32
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,160
I'll give you one more chance.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,970
As an educator,

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,250
I shouldn't give up on students easily.

35
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,800
I'll take responsibility and teach them.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,390
Are you testing my patience?

37
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,680
You were the one who made Ga Doo Shim transfer to our school.

38
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,540
I did that for Songyeong High School—

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,890
Everyone, please leave.

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,120
Ga Doo Shim can stay.

41
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,300
Please, madam.

42
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,100
Don't be too concerned.

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,160
Aigoo. Madam.

44
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,420
I... ran over here while in the middle of an exorcism, so I'm dressed this way.

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,770
What happened to my Doo Shim?

46
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,330
The principal has decided that she needs not transfer schools.

47
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,670
Really?

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,280
What sound is that?

49
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,340
Ah... Yes.

50
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,730
This bell rings only if there are ghosts nearby. Why is it ringing?

51
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,230
Ah!

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,560
Ah!

53
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,300
Will you be able to devote yourself to studies without distraction?

54
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,720
You really aren't making me transfer schools?

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,340
As long as you don't talk nonsense like "evil spirits" or whatever.

56
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,770
How did you know?

57
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,350
About what?

58
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,050
I have never talked about evil spirits.

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,460
I heard the rumor that was spreading among the students.

60
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,180
Do you also think that evil spirits exist, Doo Shim?

61
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,820
Yes, there is.

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,490
I think you should be careful too, Doo Shim.

63
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,360

64
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,460
Why is it that at our school, the momentum falls rapidly after a mistake or two?

65
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,630
If I believed that an evil spirit existed, I would focus on my studies.

66
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,050
What?

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,730
Okay.

68
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,530
You may go.

69
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,860
Not first rank or eleventh rank, why am I a hundred and first rank?

70
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,960
This isn't that bad. You're right in the middle.

71
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,050
"Anyway, I am first rank," is that it?

72
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,460
Does it sound like that to you?

73
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,320
I was also first rank in my previous school.

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,670
But does this make sense?

75
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,250
Is this important now?

76
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,380
We don't know what will happen to Il Ram, and if the evil spirit is still here.

77
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,950
I've already moved the spirit of Il Ram.

78
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,450
Moved him? Where to?

79
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,020
I don't know, either.

80
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,240
I asked Hyun Soo to never tell me.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,710
Why?

82
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,200
Because the evil spirit will know if he comes inside me.

83
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,390
Why?

84
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

85
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,180
My grades are better than yours,

86
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,410
but you are smarter than me.

87
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,010
Let's stop talking about the grades.

88
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,200
Till when will Il Ram be able to hang on?

89
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
We don't have much time.

90
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,490
If his mother agrees to remove the respirator device–

91
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,300
That can't happen.

92
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,090
We have to catch him before that happens.

93
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,950
 The mock test is ready.

94
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,020
The mock test?

95
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,110
It has been only a few days since the last exam, and you are talking about another exam?

96
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,140
We need to push the students before the CSAT, so they can get a better score.

97
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,340
But the last rank got into an accident this time, too.

98
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,910
The students are already anxious as it is.

99
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,590
The students...

100
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,560
are anxious?

101
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,660
 And the books in chinese text...

102
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,480
They are studying well.

103
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,670
Don't worry and get it ready.

104
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,940
If a problem arises I will take responsibility.

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,500

106
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,750
 Idiot. Fool.

107
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,660
 The next one to be last rank is me.

108
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,850
 I will die too, right?

109
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,300
 No. No. That won't happen.

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,410
 No.

111
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,820
 I will die too.

112
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,700
What is it?

113
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

114
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,340
You are a Shaman, right?

115
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,380
Can you see me dying

116
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,490
in the next exam?

117
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,180
Can a Shaman see it?!

118
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,480
We aren't friends, right?

119
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,580
What?

120
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,110
Don't make me think I don't care if you die or not.

121
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,830
Don't ridicule me when

122
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,340
I am thinking about whether I should save you or not.

123
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,290
What nonsense are you saying now?

124
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,740
What happened?

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,480
My instincts are not good.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,520

127
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,260
 Lee Ae Kyung.

128
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,570
 Listen to me carefully.

129
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,470
 You won't die.

130
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,380
I'll leave your bag here. See you tomorrow at school.

131
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,860
What a fool. The last rank student dies anyway.

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,380
The next last rank will be me.

133
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,120
Everyone wants me to die.

134
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,960
That is how they can live.

135
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,850
 Hey! Lee Ae Kyung, are you trying to die now?

136
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,090
 Do something!

137
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,250
 Hey Ae Kyung! Hey Ae Kyung! Wait a moment.

138
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,780
 Would she stop with just that?

139
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,630
 Ae Kyung, let's talk for a bit.

140
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,910
Excuse me.

141
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,510
 Ae Kyung.

142
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,800
 Here. Here.

143
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,900
 Ae Kyung, look here.

144
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,330
 Yes, here.

145
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,260
 Hey Ae Kyung! Are you going to die just like that?

146
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,510
 It's very unfair for our stories to end like this.

147
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,450
 Can you please reconsider?

148
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,290
 Yes, you and us. It's very cruel for us to

149
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,910
 face our end before we even start.

150
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,680

151
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,880
Who wants you to die?

152
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,730
There are many people who want you to live.

153
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,520
What happened?

154
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,240
- What? 
 - The characters that I drew...

155
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,440
Did you do that?

156
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,040
Is your dream to become a webtoon artist?

157
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,620
How did you know? I didn't tell anyone about that.

158
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,430
If you manage to overcome this long enough, you'll become a famous webtoon author.

159
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,590
Do you see that?

160
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,590
No, I can't see the future.

161
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,770
I'm saying that because your drawing skills are good.

162
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,000
No one's going to die at Songyeong High School anymore.

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Doo Shim and I are going to make sure of that.

164
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,130
No one's going to die at Songyeong High School anymore?

165
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,580
Are you confident?

166
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,610
I can't do it alone.

167
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,250
You acted as if you're so confident.

168
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,600
Do you feel confident without me?

169
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,820
Yes, I can do it alone.

170
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,590
What do you mean by that? Are you worried that I might get hurt?

171
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,490
I'm worried I might get hurt.

172
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,560
If it works, we have to fight with the school and your parents.

173
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,020
Fighting with evil spirits is enough fighting for me.

174
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,320
There must be a reason why this ability has been given to me.

175
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,090
I am clumsy because I started this game just now.

176
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,820
But if you, who are already used to this game, help me, I'll become accustomed to it.

177
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,620
And like that, there will be something with which I can help you.

178
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,000
This isn't a game.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,060
I've decided to think of it as a game.

180
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,530
An eighteen-year-old high school student fighting an evil spirit

181
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,170
and saving his friends. Is this possible in real life?

182
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,460
I want to be at the top of this game too.

183
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,110
What about Il Ram?

184
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,410
I've hidden him well.

185
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,890
- But there are a lost of ghosts there— 
 - Don't say anything more.

186
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,020
- I remembered. 
 - I told you not to say anything.

187
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,200
Not that.

188
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,400
When I brought Il Ram here, there was someone who had followed the evil spirit.

189
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
What?

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,720
 Be bound by my words and stop!

191
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,880
 Be bound by my words and stop!

192
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,510
 Wait, another chance will come.

193
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,080

194
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,460
 Who was it?

195
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,450
I've... definitely seen him somewhere.

196
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,250
I don't remember.

197
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,010
Hyun Soo, repeat after me.

198
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,560
Draw a circle with your left hand, and a triangle with your right.

199
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,660
This is the best to help your memory.

200
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,230
If you do that, you'll remember that person and your mom too.

201
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,550
Really?

202
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,620
My mom?

203
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,030
Okay.

204
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,470
A triangle... Aish!

205
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,280
What are you doing?

206
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,340
What happened, Mom?

207
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,090
You need to transfer schools immediately.

208
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,330
- What? 
 - Immediately.

209
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,210
Leave that school.

210
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,920
What are you talking about?

211
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,790
There is something in your school.

212
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,550
I know. The evil spirit.

213
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,610
It's not just the evil spirit.

214
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,120

215
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,870
 Under the school

216
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,620
 it's full of non-human beings!

217
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,550
 Does that mean they're watching us?

218
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,250
 It's Woo Soo.

219
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,360
 The top student.

220
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,860
Oh Jong Geun?

221
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,850
Kang Ji Soo?

222
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,210
Kim Ji Min.

223
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,620
Hye Seon.

224
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,590
Yoo Tae Yang.

225
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,400
Doo Shim.

226
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,650

227
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,290
♫  Oh dear my nights  ♫

228
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,180
♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

229
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,500
♫  It's going to be a long night  ♫

230
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,720
 ✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨ 
 ~ Preview ~

231
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,960
 The last rank students. I think they're the ones who died in this school.

232
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,180
 Then do you mean the evil spirit has locked up the dead students forever? Why?

233
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,150
 I'm really not going to die, right?

234
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,600
 Answer me! Am I really not going to die?

235
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,660
 I found out who he is. He's your principal!

236
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,770
 All of this was the principal's work.

237
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,940
 Do you have evidence to prove that?

238
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,050
 Who do you think is going to believe us? People believe the word of adults. We're facing the adults.

239
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,720
 I won't run away.

240
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,260
 No matter how, I will make him confess what he has done.
