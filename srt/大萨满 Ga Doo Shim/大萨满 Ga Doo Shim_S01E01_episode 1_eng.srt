1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,970

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,600
Can you see it?

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,880
Yes, I can.

4
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
 You're here?

5
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
Yes, we are.

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,880
 Who is ranked last in this school?

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,100
You answer it. It's your turn to take the test.

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,330
If you don't know, then take a guess.

9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,680
 I know the answer. Here I come!

10
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,340
 My grandmother once told me that,

11
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:06,800
 if I safely make it past the age of eighteen, I could live a long and happy life.

12
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,820
 Whether or not I go to college, or earn a lot of money,

13
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,530
 whatever I do, I could live the life I wanted.

14
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,170
 Eighteen, will I be able to live beyond that?

15
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,650

16
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,600
 Doo Shim, get up quickly!

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,850

18
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,260
Doo Shim, get up quickly.

19
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,780
Doo Shim, we have to hurry.

20
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,660
Doo Shim, we have to go up.

21
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,780
What is this?

22
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,810
 - Where are you?  
 - Mom!

23
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,160
The other students all came out, why haven't you?

24
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,450
You get bad grades, and now you're rebelling?

25
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,660
Mom, it's not like that.

26
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,240
 Just die if you're going to worry me so much!

27
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,250
I think I'm really going to die.

28
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,700
What are you talking about?

29
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,590
 What are you doing up there?

30
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,890
Are you all right, Grandmother?

31
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,570
Doo Shim,

32
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,100
this is the last.

33
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,850
What are you saying?

34
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,940
From now on, you have to do it.

35
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,550
Why?

36
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,540
What is it?

37
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,480
You have to catch him.

38
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,780
That evil spirit who takes those poor kids with bad grades.

39
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,990
No!

40
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,900
I don't want to do those things like you and Mom!

41
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,910
I know, but you're the only one who can do it.

42
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,810
The only one who can save that child—

43
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,170
I don't want to!

44
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,220
I won't ever become a shaman!

45
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,250
 Hyun Soo, please!

46
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,140
 Hyun Soo, come down immediately!

47
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,390

48
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,830
 Hyun Soo, are you crazy?

49
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,340
You tell me to die every day, that I don't deserve to live.

50
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,660
I'm going to do as you say this time.

51
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,560
Hyun Soo!

52
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,460
Just once, just this once.

53
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,360
Doo Shim!

54
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,630
What should I do?

55
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,310
Be bound by my words and stop.

56
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,300
Be bound by my words and stop.

57
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,880
You got what you wanted. Now leave.

58
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,140
You got what you wanted. Now leave.

59
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,310
Be bound by my words and stop!

60
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,960
You got what you wanted. Now leave.

61
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,940

62
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,960
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted. Now leave.

63
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,550
You got what you wanted. Now leave!

64
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,080
I thought Myo Shim would come. Who are you?

65
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,510
I'm Myo Shim's granddaughter, Doo Shim.

66
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,200
Doo Shim? What are you going to do?

67
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm going to catch you.

68
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,420
Be bound by my words and stop! You got what you wanted.

69
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,490
Now leave!

70
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,990
What are you doing?

71
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,440
Now leave!

72
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Now leave!

73
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,880
This is the right incantation.

74
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,130
You're not that smart, are you?

75
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,850
You will meet me later then.

76
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,670
I would have killed you immediately if you were eighteen years old.

77
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,930
 If you want to live, study like your life depends on it.

78
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,040
 If you don't want to end up like this guy.

79
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,010

80
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,200
Be bound by my words and stop.

81
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,430
You got what you wanted.

82
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,550
 Now leave!

83
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,210
Doo Shim did well.

84
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,220
I said I didn't want to do it.

85
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,630
I said I wouldn't do it.

86
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,670
 Listen here, Myo Shim. I'll help you get wealth and honor.

87
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,150
 I will go into rich children's bodies and disappear when you arrive.

88
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,270
 Then you will make a lot of money.

89
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,100
I don't need money.

90
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,300
 Do you think the world will change if you catch me?

91
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,670
The children will change the world.

92
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,170
Not old people like me.

93
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,330
Capture the spirit. Lead the way.

94
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,080
Capture the spirit. Give salvation.

95
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,760
 Stop it, I said!

96
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,380
 - Do you think I won't get out?  
 - Lead the way.

97
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,230
 - You think I can't get out, right?  
 - Give salvation.

98
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,870
 - Your granddaughter!  
 - Capture the spirit.

99
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,120
 When that brat turns eighteen years old, I will go inside her body.

100
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,870
 - I will kill her in the most painful way.  
 - Capture the spirit. Give salvation.

101
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
 I will kill her.

102
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,610
Give salvation.

103
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,410
Dear child.

104
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,970
 Who are you?

105
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,340
You should say goodbye to your mom before you leave.

106
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,670
I will take you to her.

107
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,610
Grandmother.

108
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,670
Grandmother!

109
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,980
Grandmother. What happened to my Grandmother?

110
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,270
Grandmother!

111
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,850
Doo Shim.

112
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,080
What's wrong with you, Grandmother? Who did this to you?

113
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,310
My dear Doo Shim, you did such a good job.

114
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,320
But I made a mistake

115
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,580
and the evil spirit escaped.

116
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,120
My dear Doo Shim,

117
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,330
I didn't want to make it hard for you.

118
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,740
What can I do?

119
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,190
Grandmother, let's go to the hospital.

120
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,480
The ambulance is out front, so I will bring someone.

121
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,590
Doo Shim,

122
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,400
listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

123
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,130
I can't hear you!

124
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,220
Protect yourself. Protect yourself.

125
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,010
From all the evil spirits.

126
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,370
Everything will be all right, Doo Shim.

127
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,910
Grandmother!

128
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,410
Grandmother!

129
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,240
Grandmother!

130
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Grandmother!

131
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,430
Grandmother!

132
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,030
Grandmother!

133
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,140

134
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,210
Grandmother, I have come.

135
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,550

136
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,650
You should go.

137
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,660
I don't talk to dead people.

138
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,000
I told you to go! It's annoying, and I'm tired.

139
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,650
I'm sorry.

140
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,070
Did you ask your grandmother nicely?

141
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,910
Ask what?

142
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,270
I told you to ask her to watch over you because you are transferring schools.

143
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,610
You didn't ask her?

144
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,080
I can't see ghosts. I can't hear them either.

145
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,230
I've told you many times.

146
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,070
You're better off trying to fool ghosts.

147
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,070
I know you can see and hear them, and you're just pretending otherwise.

148
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,740
There is a ghost standing behind you, but you are pretending not to see it.

149
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,750
The ghost behind you is sticking to you and touching your hair like this.

150
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,570
You are scared, right?

151
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,370
You are scared to death, but you're putting on an act, right?

152
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,540
Yes, madam, hello.

153
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,070
Why would you look for a priest, monk, or reverend?

154
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,220
If something like that happens, you should find me,

155
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,190
the "Beautiful Bodhisattva".

156
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,060
You wasted your money.

157
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,590
I will come immediately, so prepare the cash.

158
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,950
Where are you going?

159
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,430
Cheongdam-dong, then Songyeong High School.

160
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,210
Are you crazy, Mom?

161
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,040
Today is my first day at the new school.

162
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,100
Drop me off at Songyeong High School before you go to Cheongdam-dong.

163
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,400
You are transferring schools thanks to me.

164
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,130
You know how hard I worked to have you transferred to Korea's best high school, Songyeong High School,

165
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,660
don't you?

166
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,510
So can't you help your mother out a little?

167
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,650
Did I say I wanted to go to Songyeong High School?

168
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,930
- I don't want to do it. 
 - Aigoo!

169
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,730
People treat you better if you run a business with a kid.

170
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,180
You... aren't you going to become independent after you graduate high school?

171
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,970
Did you agree to help me until then,

172
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,070
or didn't you?

173
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,850
Yeah, that's right.

174
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,890
Okay. Let's go.

175
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,110
 - The results for the midterm exam come out today, right? 
 - Yes, Principal.

176
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,060
I heard that the grades have risen a lot.

177
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,480
Yes. Overall, the grades have increased a lot.

178
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,870
But of course, there will still be someone who comes in last.

179
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,260
I made sure to tell all the teachers

180
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,610
that if that student is in their class,

181
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,830
they should keep a close eye on them.

182
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,320
Let's pray together

183
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,000
that no problems come our way.

184
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,750
Yes, Principal.

185
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,580
There is a transfer student coming to Teacher Sa's class today, right?

186
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,680
Yes, Principal.

187
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,070
Chairman Na's wife specially asked us to open up a spot for her.

188
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,360
Apparently, she's close to the transfer student's mom.

189
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,680
What does her father do?

190
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,680
She doesn't have a father, and she lives with her mother. Apparently, she's a religious person.

191
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,020
A religious person?

192
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,800
Yes, Principal.

193
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,360

194
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,530
Il Ram.

195
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,230
What?

196
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,710
Teacher, the lowest ranking student in the whole school isn't from our class, right?

197
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,240
How would I know that? I don't know.

198
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,030
All the teachers know, right?

199
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,260
Please tell us.

200
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,960
 Please tell us, Teacher.

201
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,660
 You know it, right?

202
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,780
Silence. Silence.

203
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,460
I may not know who came in last place,

204
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,410
but I know who's first.

205
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm sure you all know who it is too.

206
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,300
Let's get some energy from Woo Soo, and

207
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,030
raise our grades a bit more. Do you understand?

208
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,530
 Yes, Teacher.

209
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,660
Do you understand, Kim Il Ram?

210
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,010
Ay! I look much better than him.

211
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,350
 What is he saying? Hahaha.

212
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,370
Hey! Silence. Silence.

213
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,380
You all got your report cards, right?

214
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,990
The exam tomorrow— What was that?

215
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,740
 Oh my gosh.

216
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,560
 Oh my gosh!

217
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,260
 What is all this?

218
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,190
What is it?

219
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,720
 What? What?

220
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,040
 Hey, hey, hey!

221
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,940
Someone jumped from the rooftop!

222
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,040
I think he's Jong Geun from Class Three.

223
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,430
Don't you hear me?

224
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,720
I knew it would be Jong Geun this time.

225
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,310
Are you serious?

226
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,150
 Is he dead?

227
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,580

♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

231
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,410
♫  Now cover up the harsh sun   ♫

232
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,800
♫  And protect the things that are more precious  ♫

♫  Oh dear our dreams  ♫

235
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,910
♫   I stretch out my arms as far as I can,  ♫

236
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,980
♫  I’ll hold onto as much as I can  ♫

 ~ Preview ~

241
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,730
 She is a shaman's daughter.

242
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,980
 I heard she has a lot of mysterious powers. She can even communicate with ghosts.

243
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,890
 So he broke open the locked door to the roof, and jumped without hesitation?

244
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,990
 What in the world is it?

245
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,130
 Are you saying that the lowest ranking students commit suicide?

246
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,850
 It's not suicide. But it's not murder, either.

247
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,510
 Here at Songyeong High School, if you don't want to die, you must study like your life depends on it.

248
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,600
 What happened to your face?

249
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
 I got into an accident on my way here.

250
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,980
 How long do you intend on denying your powers?

251
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,950
 Was this the reason you made me transfer schools?

252
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,940
 I don't believe in those things. It's a fraud.

253
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,790
 My eighteenth year was in danger.

254
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,250
