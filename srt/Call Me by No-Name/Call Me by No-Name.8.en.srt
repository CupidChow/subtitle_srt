1
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:10,180
With this,

2
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,000
now, we're friends.

3
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:20,859
I had known from the start

4
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,164
that this would happen.

5
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,852
At that time, I...

6
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,766
might have expected

7
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,359
love to begin.

8
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:48,180
"Call Me by No Name"

9
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,992
(The End: Proof of Megumi)

10
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,165
The ‘Se' from world,

11
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,289
the ‘Ji' from next generation,

12
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,433
And Megumi comes from

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,773
the word 'Ai' that means love.

14
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:00,540
That's a nice name.

15
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:03,939
It's filled with love.

16
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:11,118
I like it, Meguchi's name.

17
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:14,548
At first it was just a light feeling.

18
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:16,814
I just wanted to tear

19
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,501
this girl's love apart.

20
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,415
That was all.

21
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,348
Do you think they'll take us seriously

22
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,806
if we say it's between women?

23
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,126
It doesn't matter!

24
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,450
Even if it's between women,

25
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,984
if the other person doesn't agree,

26
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:31,856
it's a crime!

27
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,213
Wow,

28
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:36,479
Meguchi seems to know a lot.

29
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,135
Are you angry?

30
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,205
If you want to kick me out, go ahead.

31
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,518
I won't kick you out.

32
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:04,650
I'm playing Sekiro now.

33
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,729
I see.

34
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:31,213
I think you're a strange person.

35
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,455
What are you doing?

36
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:36,786
Figured if I stayed here,

37
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,046
you'd come and pick me up.

38
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:50,533
But...

39
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:53,567
Somehow, being next to

40
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,047
Meguchi felt comfortable.

41
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:11,315
- Just a bit, please.
- Please go back.

42
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:12,610
- I'm sorry.
- Please!

43
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,986
But...

44
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,845
The end came quickly.

45
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,543
(Happy birthday)
Is it delicious?

46
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:25,606
(Happy birthday)
Mm.

47
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:29,252
Congratulations!

48
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:30,947
Thank you!

49
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,111
At that moment...

50
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,393
Ah.

51
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,400
I realized I'm just like that woman.

52
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,752
To me,

53
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:38,947
Kotoha is Kotoha.

54
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,025
Nothing is strange at all.

55
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:46,033
I...

56
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,369
I love Kotoha.

57
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,815
Today, Meguchi's taking the lead, right?

58
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,307
That night,

59
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:58,252
you found me, Kotoha.

60
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,932
Let's get married.

61
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,728
Shall we stay together forever?

62
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:07,970
I never thought in my life I would

63
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,283
have the chance to be so happy.

64
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:42,892
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,024
I'm so sorry,

66
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:51,822
Meguchi.

67
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,017
I'm sorry...

68
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:17,978
Let's end this.

69
00:09:57,588 --> 00:10:01,337
(I found the name.
Meet me at the aquarium)

70
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:08,736
With this,

71
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,563
now, we're friends.

72
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:29,475
We've been competing for that

73
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:30,548
since the beginning.

74
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:35,371
At this point, are you still going

75
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:36,578
to say that and run away?

76
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:43,947
Kotoha!

77
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:46,822
I'll wait for you!

78
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,869
You've finished it?

79
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,861
- It's done.
- That was fast.

80
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:17,797
I have to do it this evening.

81
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,385
I'm not fast, Megumi-chan is slow.

82
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:21,642
- Am I slow?
- Of course.

83
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:36,247
If you have something to say,

84
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,267
just say it.

85
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,470
Huh?

86
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,376
What are you talking about?

87
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,447
You were watching Megumi.

88
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,611
That's none of your business.

89
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:56,455
You always dodge like that,

90
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,235
but deep down, you're just scared,
aren't you?

91
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,713
Scared of confronting her directly.

92
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,494
What are you saying?

93
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,627
Megumi has always been

94
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,847
serious about you.

95
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,016
If you're just going to keep

96
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,416
running away, then go ahead.

97
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:17,994
Hey,

98
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:20,992
can you stop already?

99
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:31,721
What, are you a stalker now?

100
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,963
It's not like that!

101
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:34,853
Don't follow me.

102
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,744
- Wanna walk together, at least partway?
- No.

103
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,869
- Then at least to the station.
- You're annoying!

104
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:46,549
I was asked to do this.

105
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:48,549
She said...

106
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,705
it might be dangerous.

107
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,478
Huh?

108
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,782
There might be some weird guy

109
00:13:58,802 --> 00:13:59,802
near campus.

110
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:01,448
She told me to walk you home

111
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,482
if you stayed late.

112
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,744
Who?

113
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,416
Some weird girl from the law department

114
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,752
who claims she's dating you.

115
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:20,744
I...

116
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,166
said some really awful things to her.

117
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,578
Like how if two women date,

118
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,265
they can't get married,

119
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:32,825
and that I could stay by

120
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,579
your side forever instead.

121
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,534
But you know what?

122
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:41,645
She actually bowed her head

123
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:42,678
to someone like me.

124
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:46,135
When I saw that...

125
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,273
I realized, maybe that's

126
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,847
what true love really is.

127
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,846
Kotoha.

128
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:42,416
Meguchi.

129
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,807
Why are you here?

130
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,202
I thought maybe you'd come

131
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:51,269
if I waited here.

132
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,627
Hm.

133
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:11,572
Hm!

134
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,471
Why

135
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,439
are you always like this, Meguchi?

136
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,127
Why

137
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,752
do you still like me?

138
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,096
There's no reason for liking.

139
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:15,843
I...

140
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,142
am scared,

141
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,251
Meguchi.

142
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:25,564
Of what?

143
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:31,596
One day,

144
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,432
I'll end up hurting you.

145
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,549
That won't happen.

146
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:38,939
Yes, it will!

147
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,227
Because that's

148
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:43,175
the only kind of love I know.

149
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,328
My happiness is mine to decide.

150
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,978
Fate, curses, none of that matters.

151
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,768
Even if I hurt Kotoha from now on,

152
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,125
or if the two of us have to

153
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,415
face something terrible,

154
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,025
I want to be happy with you!

155
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,666
Besides, Kotoha,

156
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,971
you like me.

157
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,682
But...

158
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,447
Women can't even get married.

159
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,658
There's nothing to

160
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:42,352
prove our relationship.

161
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,549
Then let's prove it.

162
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,217
We'll prove it by

163
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:48,220
staying together forever.

164
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:49,978
By loving each other a lot.

165
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,728
It's prove it together forever.

166
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,439
Just like you once proved yourself.

167
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,041
Kotoha.

168
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:12,392
Let's compete.

169
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,650
Compete?

170
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,239
Yes.

171
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:22,768
Compete.

172
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:32,174
It's simple.

173
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,635
If, while we're together,

174
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,554
we can make the world

175
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,094
recognize our love,

176
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,330
I win.

177
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:47,292
And...

178
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:50,127
if you lose?

179
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,400
Who knows?

180
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:15,736
But...

181
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,477
I'll keep challenging it,

182
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:21,671
until the day I die.

183
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:43,635
Meguchi,

184
00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:49,346
I like you!

185
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,369
I know.

186
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,205
I'm sorry...

187
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,314
Don't cry.

188
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,127
I love you.

189
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:20,884
Kotoha!

190
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:36,243
You know, it really

191
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,049
didn't come true in the end.

192
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:39,361
Hmm?

193
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:40,955
That thing you said

194
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,266
if you say your wish out loud,

195
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,480
it won't come true.

196
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,408
Our date that day

197
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,510
ended up a mess anyway.

198
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,885
Oh, that.

199
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,174
But my wish did come true.

200
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,681
Huh?

201
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,572
What did you wish for?

202
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:06,135
That I'd come back here with you.

203
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,619
Meguchi, what's wrong?

204
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:21,510
Sorry,

205
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,291
just now, my heart skipped a beat.

206
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:29,525
Geez, hurry up and come here.

207
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:49,463
Meguchi,

208
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,627
what did you wish for?

209
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:55,900
Not telling!

210
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,564
Huh?

211
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:01,713
But I think…

212
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,955
it was probably the same as yours.

213
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,799
Yeah, I think so too.

214
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,549
Here.
