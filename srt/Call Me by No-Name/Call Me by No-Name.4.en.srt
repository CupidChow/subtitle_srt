1
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:05,961
I...

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,516
I'm not good-natured!

3
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:14,906
Huh?

4
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:18,679
Even with you, Kotoha,

5
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,969
I wasn't trying to save you.

6
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:24,258
Back then,

7
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:27,366
I kept chanting in my heart,

8
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:28,502
over and over,

9
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,086
'This isn't about saving someone.'

10
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:39,680
I...

11
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,797
had already fallen in love with

12
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:44,008
Furuhashi Kotoha

13
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,469
from the very beginning.

14
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:29,070
"Call Me by No Name"

15
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,554
(Chapter 4: Evidence of doing good deeds)

16
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,632
Huh?

17
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:43,508
No way.

18
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:45,962
What to do?

19
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,734
This is bad.

20
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,828
Hurry up and help him.

21
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,370
Someone…

22
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,690
Please, help...

23
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,053
Excuse me.

24
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:57,638
You've been involved in

25
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,365
volunteer work before, haven't you?

26
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,795
Have you always had

27
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,414
a strong desire to help others?

28
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:03,507
That's not it.

29
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,624
What were you feeling
at the time of the accident?

30
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:06,663
My body just moved without any thought.

31
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,600
- Please tell us.
- I wasn't thinking about anything.

32
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,850
(She has always been committed to saving lives,
driven by a will stronger than fear)

33
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:15,343
(On May 23, at around 8 p.m.,)

34
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,784
(Ms. Yotsugi Megumi helped)

35
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,992
(a male driver around Eichi University)

36
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,819
(Hes quick response was one of the
factors that saved the man's life)

37
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,147
(Part of the public praised her as a
"virtuous person" or a "guardian angel)

38
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,570
So you're taking a leave of absence?

39
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,319
Mm.

40
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,702
Just until things settle down.

41
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,647
That's probably for the best.

42
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,936
You take on too much, Megumi.

43
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:17,053
Back then…

44
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,147
I couldn't help but think

45
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:22,435
it was all fake.

46
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,374
What was?

47
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,788
Everything.

48
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,085
I'll wait for you to come back.

49
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,733
Meguchi!

50
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,179
I didn't know you could

51
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:40,374
make a face like that.

52
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,116
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,498
Just grab my hand already!

54
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,600
You see,

55
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,514
I have something I want to say.

56
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,428
What?

57
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,585
- Does it have to be now?
- Yeah, now.

58
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:54,858
Back then...

59
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,132
I...

60
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,866
Back when I first met you, Kotoha,

61
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,522
I was hopeless, disillusioned

62
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:06,873
with people and myself.

63
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:10,327
I swore I'd never

64
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,225
save anyone again, even if it killed me.

65
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,421
I'm not a good person.

66
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,678
I'm...

67
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,803
Just a selfish, narrow-minded person.

68
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,366
I hated myself

69
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,553
and wanted to disappear.

70
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,389
But...

71
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,171
That night,

72
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,233
you found me.

73
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,014
You took my hand.

74
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,077
And after

75
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:59,921
meeting you, Kotoha,

76
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,686
I started to like myself just a little.

77
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:09,108
I stopped caring about

78
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,653
how others see me,

79
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:12,850
and it's all because of you.

80
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,202
What am I even saying?

81
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:26,990
Sorry

82
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,061
for ruining the date

83
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,233
with this weird nonsense.

84
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,311
You can laugh if you want.

85
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm not going to laugh.

86
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,741
I'm not going to laugh.

87
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,452
Because I...

88
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:04,757
like that about Meguchi.

89
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:11,514
I will never...

90
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,967
laugh at you.

91
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:37,639
Definitely a fever.

92
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:01,055
Meguchi, the porridge's ready.

93
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,584
Think you can eat?

94
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,641
I'll eat.

95
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,671
Here you go. Enjoy.

96
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,148
Thanks.

97
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,656
Bon appétit.

98
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,334
Ah,

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,046
Meguchi, ahhh.

100
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:47,151
Kotoha.

101
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:51,276
Did you get fevers as a kid?

102
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,034
Yeah, all the time back then.

103
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,283
My mom would worry herself sick

104
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,988
every time I had a fever,

105
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,463
she would take care of me day and night.

106
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,493
I see.

107
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,696
My mom was the worst.

108
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:18,016
She'd make way better

109
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,561
porridge than this.

110
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,774
Packed with eggs and salmon,

111
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,579
full of nutrients.

112
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,507
The worst?

113
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,157
Sounds like the best mom ever.

114
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:38,281
She was a terrible woman.

115
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:42,649
She gave me that kind of name...

116
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:47,888
Like being a witch who casted a curse.

117
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:52,415
A curse?

118
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,833
Meguchi, you need more water, right?

119
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:55,903
Ah...

120
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,817
Yeah. Thanks.

121
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,700
My name is a curse

122
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:23,958
that can never be lifted.

123
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:27,302
A fate I can never escape.

124
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,895
Is your name really that bad?

125
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,606
I think it's terrible,

126
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:41,989
but

127
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:44,630
maybe it depends on the context.

128
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:47,684
Well...

129
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:49,739
The characters look pretty, I guess.

130
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:00,168
Where's your mom now?

131
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,755
She's dead.

132
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,824
Bad witches are meant to burn,

133
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:18,849
aren't they?

134
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,418
Kotoha...

135
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,200
Come on, eat.

136
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,887
Your porridge's getting cold.

137
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:31,036
Here.

138
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,256
Weren't we supposed to work

139
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,709
on the report together?

140
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,262
Sorry!

141
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,591
There's something I need to look into.

142
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,812
Hey.

143
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:16,859
Hmm?

144
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:20,075
Words that look good in letters

145
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,067
but can have a bad meaning

146
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,755
depending on the context?

147
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,562
Can you think of any?

148
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,169
Huh?

149
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:32,239
Umm...

150
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,505
Maybe something like

151
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,872
"hanauri" (flower seller)?

152
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,685
Or, on a related note,

153
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,857
The words "sale" and "spring" combined

154
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:41,989
to form "prostitution"

155
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,036
should be similar.

156
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,638
I see.

157
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:50,724
So, kanji that are harmless on their own

158
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,341
but take on a bad meaning

159
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,645
when combined...

160
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:54,685
Umm...

161
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:01,709
Hmm.

162
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:05,255
Still working on that quiz from before?

163
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,427
(Combined words with bad meaning)

164
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,481
Think you'll get the answer?
(Combined words with bad meaning)

165
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,126
(Combined words with bad meaning)

166
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:11,451
Mm.

167
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,810
I feel like I'm getting closer.

168
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,351
But...

169
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:35,818
I'm sure even if I win,

170
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,606
I'm not sure the current me

171
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:39,793
would happy about it.

172
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:45,693
But...

173
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,606
I can't just stay

174
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:50,512
like this forever, either.

175
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:04,716
I have no idea what the right answer is.

176
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:09,068
Well,

177
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,576
one thing I can say is that

178
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,380
there's no such thing as

179
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,380
a right or wrong answer in love.

180
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,232
Giving advice like a love expert again.

181
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,057
That means everything depends

182
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:31,275
on your determination.

183
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,020
Megumi-chan.

184
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:39,396
This is your life.

185
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,451
That's deep.

186
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:52,544
Ah!

187
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:54,911
Hey!

188
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,685
Wait there.

189
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,794
What?

190
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:03,646
Let me ask you,

191
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,646
what kind of relationship did

192
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:06,913
you have with Furuhashi Kotoha?

193
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:07,810
Huh?

194
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,615
Nothing, really.

195
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,990
My turn just came up, that's all.

196
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:14,036
Your turn?

197
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:15,973
You know that Kotoha sleeps

198
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:17,678
with many people, right?

199
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,490
Well...

200
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,622
She doesn't just sleep

201
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,896
with anyone, though.

202
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,099
She's super particular about it.

203
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,099
What do you mean?

204
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,630
She never sleeps with the same person twice.

205
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,481
Once she's done, it's over.

206
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,170
Goodbye, see you never.

207
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,614
It's like she's on some

208
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,067
kind of quota or something.

209
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,490
Then...

210
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,489
So, the other day,

211
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,193
it was just your turn?

212
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,185
I...

213
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,607
I couldn't stand it.

214
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:57,271
I...

215
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,255
I liked Kotoha.

216
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,278
That's why, that night, before

217
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:03,677
I went to her place, I confessed.

218
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:04,740
- And...
- Koto...

219
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,606
when she rejected you, you got angry

220
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:07,963
and dumped her by the garbage pile.

221
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,027
- I told you, that was an argument...
- Enough.

222
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,646
Thanks. I'll take my leave.

223
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,919
Hey!

224
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:16,076
Why did you suddenly ask about that?

225
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,247
It's none of your business.

226
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:21,107
Don't tell me,

227
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,193
you're into Kotoha too?

228
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:32,794
I'm dating Kotoha.

229
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:37,277
Huh...

230
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,615
'Dating, ' huh...

231
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,560
What? Got a problem with that?

232
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:44,896
No.

233
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,302
Mm...

234
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,091
That's good.

235
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,091
I'm not prejudiced or anything.

236
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:01,755
But,

237
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:03,794
that kind of thing

238
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,091
can't last forever, right?

239
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,193
Huh?

240
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:11,185
Well...

241
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,810
there are limits to what women

242
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,223
can do together in the future.

243
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:16,318
When the time comes,

244
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,185
I could teach Kotoho

245
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,801
what 'real love' is.

246
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,841
Huh?

247
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,005
At the very least, I think

248
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,560
someone who left the girl

249
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,443
he claims to love by a garbage pile

250
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,818
has no idea what 'real love' is!

251
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,576
Meguchi!

252
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,537
Kotoha.

253
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:11,451
What are you doing here?

254
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:13,981
Where's your umbrella?

255
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:18,168
I saw you heading toward

256
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:19,793
the science building earlier…

257
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,224
So I came here.

258
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:43,279
Rain...

259
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:45,974
You don't like it either, do you?

260
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:48,654
Huh?

261
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:51,951
I don't like it.

262
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,076
And thunder is even worse.

263
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,234
Really?

264
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:02,601
That's surprising.

265
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:05,632
I mean it.

266
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,882
It's childish, right?

267
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:11,773
But I still find it scary.

268
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,710
That's why...

269
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:23,609
just having someone nearby

270
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:29,632
makes me feel a little safer.

271
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,007
Kotoha.

272
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:08,795
I...

273
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,936
Might have fallen in love with Kotoha...

274
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,155
For real.

275
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:28,155
I...

276
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,412
I know it's sudden, and I know

277
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:31,810
it might be overwhelming.

278
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,991
And there's still that whole contest thing.

279
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:36,381
But I just wanted to say it, properly.

280
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:37,383
Meguchi.

281
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:53,014
Kotoha...

282
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,709
You...

283
00:21:58,709 --> 00:21:59,764
Could you sleep with me?

284
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:05,225
Huh?

285
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,709
Do you want to hold me,

286
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,209
or be held by me,

287
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,248
at all?

288
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,225
You can't, can you?

289
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,811
It's not the same as kissing, right?

290
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:30,318
- That is...
- Hey, Meguchi.

291
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:03,647
If you don't figure out my name soon,

292
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:06,001
you'll start losing

293
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:07,142
your mind bit by bit.

294
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:45,662
(Next episode)

295
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,896
I'm prepared.

296
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:51,092
Thank you for liking me.

297
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:52,732
Why are you here?

298
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:54,701
You're going to hug me?

299
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,296
I don't hate being treated

300
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:57,469
like this by Kotoha.
