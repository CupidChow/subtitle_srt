1
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:58,750
To call that...

2
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,931
the beginning of love,

3
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,805
it was far too uncomfortable to be that.

4
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,610
I knew I shouldn't take that hand.

5
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:14,688
I had a bad feeling.

6
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:21,134
If I did,

7
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,938
there would be

8
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,852
no turning back.

9
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,649
"Call Me by No Name"

10
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:17,461
(Episode 1: Prove that we are lovers)

11
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,227
- Something on your mind?
- Whoa!

12
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,672
No, um, well...

13
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,102
It's nothing.

14
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,399
Can I borrow a hairdryer?

15
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,438
Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:39,946
Here.

17
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,079
Thanks.

18
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:51,954
Um, what's your name?

19
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,024
My name?

20
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:58,328
I mean, I can't let someone

21
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,695
stay at my place when

22
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,645
I don't even know their name.

23
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,086
Most people wouldn't let a stranger

24
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,789
into their home in the first place.

25
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:10,071
Well... That's true.

26
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:15,829
What's your name?

27
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:19,641
Yotsugi Megumi.

28
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:21,454
Oh,

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,368
how's it written in kanji?

30
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:27,790
The 'Se' from 'world,'

31
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,462
the 'ji' from 'next generation,'

32
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,797
and the 'Megumi' with

33
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:32,876
the kanji for 'love'.

34
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,790
That's a beautiful name.

35
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,032
It's a beloved name.

36
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:52,391
I like it, Meguchi's name.

37
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,234
Meguchi? You have no naming sense.

38
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,813
It's cute, isn't it?

39
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,391
So, what's your name?

40
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,212
Hmm?

41
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,798
I said what's your name?

42
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,485
Huh?

43
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:22,961
Ah.

44
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,727
I said, what's your name?

45
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,860
Scheherazade.

46
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,727
Scheherazade?

47
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:40,499
Do you not know

48
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:42,188
A Thousand and One Nights?

49
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,509
I do, but…

50
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,024
What about it?

51
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,126
That's my name.

52
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,938
No way that's true.

53
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:57,688
Can you prove it's not?

54
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:01,556
That is...

55
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:08,118
If you can't believe me, that's fine.

56
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,571
Call me whatever you like.

57
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,743
Can I dry my hair now?

58
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,758
Then...

59
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:25,602
I'll call you Chiyako

60
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,359
meaning a thousand nights.

61
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:30,641
Meguchi's naming sense

62
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,186
is just as terrible.

63
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:34,743
Noisy.

64
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:06,139
( Six Main Categories of Legal Principles)

65
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,055
(Examples of six main types of law)

66
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,681
Are you a college student, Meguchi?

67
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,391
So many law books.

68
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,750
Mmm.

69
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:18,946
I'm a second-year law student

70
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:20,554
at Eichi University.

71
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,829
Wow, you're smart.

72
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:34,477
Umm...

73
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:39,602
I don't have an extra futon for guests.

74
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,852
We can just sleep close to each other.

75
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,470
If that's okay with Chiyako.

76
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,189
Are you nervous, Meguchi?

77
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,189
I'm not!

78
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,485
Hmm?

79
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,673
Oh, you're awake?

80
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,836
Ahhh! What?

81
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,720
You're too loud.

82
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,149
You'll bother the neighbors.

83
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:52,461
Let me go!

84
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,923
It's fine. Just leave it to me.

85
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,329
Think of it as my thanks for

86
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:58,508
letting me stay the night.

87
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:00,422
What does that even mean?

88
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,173
You don't have to understand.

89
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,517
Meguchi just needs to feel good.

90
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,337
I will...

91
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,032
I'll call the police!

92
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,681
Do you think they'll take us seriously

93
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,213
if we say it's between women?

94
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,782
It doesn't matter!

95
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,094
Even if it's between women,

96
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,493
if the other person doesn't agree,

97
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,540
it's a crime!

98
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:23,993
Wow,

99
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,470
Meguchi seems to know a lot.

100
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:31,899
Huh?

101
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,556
Are you angry?

102
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,899
If you want to kick me out, go ahead.

103
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,446
I won't kick you out.

104
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:19,774
I'm playing Sekiro now.

105
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:23,353
Huh?

106
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,173
You can use the futon, Chiako.

107
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,923
So you're going to play games all night?

108
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:35,064
Yes.

109
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,853
I'm not kicking you out,

110
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:40,814
but I'm not doing that, either.

111
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,548
I see.

112
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:05,782
The light's too bright to sleep.

113
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,056
Ouch.

114
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:19,899
I'll mute the sound.

115
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:32,267
Mmm.

116
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:35,845
Goodnight.

117
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,478
Goodnight.

118
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,564
Now then, A Thousand and One Nights

119
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,571
refers to the collection of

120
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,907
stories told by Scheherazade.

121
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,133
According to the tale, a king would

122
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,446
- Of all topics...
- take a virgin maiden every night,

123
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,220
spend the evening with her,

124
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:52,501
and then have her executed by dawn.

125
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,540
To stop his atrocities,

126
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:59,602
Scheherazade herself married the king.

127
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,360
Each night,

128
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:04,188
- after fulfilling her conjugal duties,
- What is this class?

129
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:07,243
- World Classical Literature 101.
- she would regale him with tales

130
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,204
- Not what I meant.
- throughout the night.

131
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,871
When the king was captivated,

132
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,110
she would say, "I'll tell you

133
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,802
- You seem upset.
- the rest of the tale tomorrow."

134
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,655
Even though I helped someone

135
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:20,944
- to find a way to get easy credits.
- The same thing would be repeated.

136
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,141
- That is...
- It's called

137
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,093
“One Thousand and One Nights” because

138
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,203
it was repeated for

139
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,353
a thousand and one nights.

140
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:29,702
- This is a collection of folk tales
- You've been very helpful.

141
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,549
from Persia, India, and Greece,

142
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:33,898
and translated by Antoine Galland

143
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:36,069
a scholar of the Orient who supported

144
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,874
- Let's graduate together, Megumi-chan!
- Louis XIV in the 18th century.

145
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,686
Which was translated from

146
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,795
the Arabic version of

147
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,678
The Thousand and One Nights.

148
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,256
However,

149
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:47,986
only 282 episodes of this tale of

150
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,577
one thousand and one nights

151
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,631
have been confirmed to exist.

152
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,139
Are you going to the job hunting

153
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,153
guidance on Friday?

154
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,507
Already talking about job hunting?

155
00:12:57,554 --> 00:12:59,233
It's too early.

156
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:02,210
I think I'll pass this time.

157
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:05,311
I'm going to think about what

158
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:07,373
I'm going to do from now on.

159
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:11,587
I see.

160
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:22,804
Oh.

161
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,452
What's wrong, Megumi-chan?

162
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:30,280
Sorry, you two go ahead first.

163
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:37,835
Enough, stop pestering me like this.

164
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:40,093
Kotoha, I'm really sorry.

165
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,631
At that time, I couldn't

166
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,622
control my emotions.

167
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,795
I couldn't stand the fact that

168
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,412
Kotoha was going in and out

169
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:46,944
of various men's places.

170
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:49,483
What does that have to

171
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,019
do with Murata-kun?

172
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:53,319
Because I...

173
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,015
- My feelings for you...
- Wait!

174
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,405
Huh?

175
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,163
Sorry,

176
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,288
can I borrow this person?

177
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,459
Why are you suddenly interfering?

178
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:08,444
So I'm saying I have

179
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,412
a business with her.

180
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,381
I have something important to tell too.

181
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,468
Ouch!

182
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:17,569
By the way,

183
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:21,303
for shoving me the other night,

184
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,101
I haven't forgiven you.

185
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:30,163
Consider this payback.

186
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,108
Alright. Let's go.

187
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,601
Huh? Wait!

188
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:48,865
It wasn't fate.

189
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,678
It was something far more forceful

190
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,749
that was about to begin.

191
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,827
Wait!

192
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:00,952
Huh?

193
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,147
Still asking a question?

194
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,733
Explain it to me.

195
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,312
How come you're at the same university?

196
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:10,663
I can explain, but…

197
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:12,968
are we keeping our hands like this?

198
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:19,132
Tell me your real name.

199
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,749
Furuhashi Kotoha.

200
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,710
Furuhashi as in ‘old bridge,'

201
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,241
Kotonoha as in ‘koto' the instrument,

202
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,311
and ‘ha' for leaf.

203
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:38,218
What department?

204
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:41,069
Second-year,

205
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:42,234
Science and Engineering

206
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,327
at Eichi University.

207
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:46,351
Why didn't you tell me that night?

208
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,874
Well...

209
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:52,444
It's not like I introduce myself

210
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,149
to every one-night stand.

211
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:55,358
Right?

212
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,272
If you were going to leave,

213
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,084
you could've at least woken me up.

214
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,951
You were having so much fun

215
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,909
playing your game all night.

216
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,765
Even so, I was worried and lonely.

217
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,785
Huh?

218
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,176
You were lonely, Meguchi?

219
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:25,551
Anyway, why did you do that?

220
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,941
Why?

221
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,097
It was the only way I could

222
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,536
repay you for letting me stay over.

223
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,645
So you mean you did that every time

224
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,106
someone lets you stay over?

225
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,543
Pretty much.

226
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,159
Though I didn't expect you

227
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:45,300
to hate it that much.

228
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,348
Everyone else I've done it with,

229
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,613
guys and girls,

230
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:54,128
ended up liking it.

231
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,199
Liking it...

232
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,409
Anyway!

233
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,004
You should stop doing things like that!

234
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:15,481
Things like that?

235
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,590
Whether it's to repay or whatever,

236
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,816
but going into a stranger's house

237
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,818
and doing things like that!

238
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,707
You keep saying ‘things like that.'

239
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,731
I'm being serious.

240
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,082
Stop it.

241
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:41,027
Then Meguchi,

242
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,582
will you go out with me?

243
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:46,691
Huh?

244
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,043
Well, I don't see why

245
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,918
a complete stranger like you

246
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:54,223
gets to meddle in my private life.

247
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,255
No.

248
00:17:58,034 --> 00:17:59,223
Why does that mean

249
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:00,684
becoming your lover?

250
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,231
If we were lovers,

251
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,113
Even if you interfere in my affairs,

252
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,223
it can't be helped.

253
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:11,473
Can't we do that as friends?

254
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,152
I want to be your friend.

255
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,731
But I don't.

256
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:21,631
Worrying about me

257
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,389
but wants to be my friend?

258
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,254
It's not like I'm worried...

259
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:28,926
Then...

260
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,684
If you win a game,

261
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:33,879
I'll be your friend.

262
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:37,871
A match?

263
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:43,723
Yes.

264
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,176
A match.

265
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:55,776
(One Thousand and One Nights)

266
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,590
The rules are simple.

267
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,457
It's a name-guessing game.

268
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,707
While we're ‘dating,'

269
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,231
if you can guess my real name,

270
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:06,363
you win.

271
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:11,621
Your real name?

272
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:13,668
What about Furuhashi Kotoha?

273
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,035
That is...

274
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:21,426
Not my real name either.

275
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:24,746
You said earlier

276
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,863
that you want to know my real name.

277
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:28,816
Try guessing.

278
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,231
- It's a lie.
- It's not a lie.

279
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:44,926
It's the truth.

280
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:49,637
My destiny is tangled,

281
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,731
entwined like a curse.

282
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:01,293
Of course, if you're not up for it,

283
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,989
we can drop the game.

284
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,324
But in that case, you'll have to

285
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:06,988
stop meddling in my business.

286
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,340
I understand

287
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:21,840
I'll go out with Kotoha.

288
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:28,590
Then from now on,

289
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:32,035
Meguchi and I will be lovers?

290
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,191
I guess so.

291
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:43,137
I've never dated anyone before,

292
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:44,887
so I don't really know too.

293
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:46,839
Really?

294
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,081
Then I get to be

295
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:51,173
Megumi's first-ever girlfriend.

296
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,410
Well,

297
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:00,058
if you don't have anywhere

298
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,371
to go in the future,

299
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,816
you can come to my place again.

300
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,723
I'll let you stay over!

301
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:08,223
That's all.

302
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:12,863
Wait,

303
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,090
Meguchi.

304
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,215
What?

305
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:19,254
Give me a kiss.

306
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,098
Huh?

307
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,723
Kiss me.

308
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,698
Since we're dating,

309
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,105
I guess we can do it, right?

310
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,082
No.

311
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:31,254
We just started dating!

312
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,418
But you have to prove

313
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:35,387
that we're really dating.

314
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,832
Prove that we're really dating?

315
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,410
Because I'm

316
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,360
your first girlfriend, right?

317
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:46,574
If you treat me like a friend,

318
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,286
it would be really bad.

319
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,324
You really want me to do it?

320
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:57,441
Alright, hurry up.

321
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:30,191
How long are you going to kiss?

322
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,316
Well, I didn't know when to stop.

323
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:35,660
You should've told me how

324
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,121
many seconds or something!

325
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:39,231
Seconds?

326
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:41,543
That will ruin the mood.

327
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,379
Anyway,

328
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:46,699
this proves it!

329
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,746
Proof that we're dating.

330
00:22:58,879 --> 00:22:59,910
You've got something on your lips.

331
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,387
Uh,

332
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:12,113
just to make sure...

333
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:17,120
You're not actually in love

334
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,347
with me or anything, right?

335
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:29,426
You being like this,

336
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:31,550
I don't hate it.

337
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:35,809
What do you mean?

338
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,168
I'm counting on you, Meguchi.

339
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:45,637
(Next episode)

340
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:48,020
How can you suddenly ask me out?

341
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,513
Do you like me?

342
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,373
Why are you so aggressive?

343
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:53,129
Don't act cute.

344
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:54,359
Why do you think people

345
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,640
have to change their names?

346
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:57,188
Probably because they want others to

347
00:23:57,213 --> 00:23:59,039
know the reason for changing names.
