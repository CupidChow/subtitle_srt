1
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:04,563
That night…

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,766
Why did I take her hand?

3
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:16,820
If only

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,102
that night,

5
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:27,359
I hadn't taken her hand

6
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:30,727
then maybe I…

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,063
Umm…

8
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:02,789
are you free next Thursday?

9
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,273
I'm free.

10
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,383
Wanna go on a date?

11
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:27,859
Sure.

12
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,320
Whatever you want, Meguchi.

13
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,689
Hmm?

14
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,422
Too cute.

15
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:40,766
I'll try this one.

16
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,281
It looks weird.

17
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,578
This is a bit too much?

18
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,375
Is this it?

19
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:14,516
Just so you know,

20
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,562
if you can't date me

21
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,812
like a normal person,

22
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:19,516
I'll break up with you.

23
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,422
Huh?

24
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,210
"Call Me by No Name"

25
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,914
(Episode 3: Evidence of the deep sea)

26
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,218
Ah, Meguchi.

27
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,856
What's with that frown?

28
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:47,945
No,

29
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:49,625
it's nothing.

30
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,111
You're leading the date today, right?

31
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:57,338
I'll do my best.

32
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:59,705
Don't be so tense.

33
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:00,869
Come on, let's go.

34
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:04,424
Wait, before that, can I say something?

35
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:05,400
Hmm?

36
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:08,806
Your outfit today…

37
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,610
I mean,

38
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,595
Kotoha,

39
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,986
you look really cute.

40
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:19,010
I know.

41
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:21,939
You're looking different today too,

42
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:22,955
I like it.

43
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,939
Really?

44
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,963
- Mm.
- You look enthusiastic.

45
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:31,070
Is that a compliment?

46
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,076
(Enoshima Aquarium)

47
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,109
The aquarium, huh?

48
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,928
I thought it'd be a nice chance

49
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:41,787
to come since I don't usually get to.

50
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,104
Here, your ticket.

51
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:46,143
Thanks.

52
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,822
Well, it's a classic choice.

53
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:51,658
It's Meguchi's first date, after all.

54
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,166
First date...

55
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:58,432
Are you happy that I'm your first date?

56
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,354
Uh… Well…

57
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:03,494
I see. You're happy.

58
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,065
I didn't even say anything.

59
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:11,158
- Wow, amazing.
- Whoa.

60
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,370
So beautiful!

61
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,527
Amazing!

62
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:16,972
What place is that?

63
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:19,456
No idea.

64
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,824
Meguchi,

65
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:39,121
let's go over there.

66
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:42,262
Mm!

67
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:06,502
Amazing.

68
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:09,798
Beautiful, isn't it?

69
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,564
Mm.

70
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:17,857
Ah.

71
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,593
There's a little loner over there.

72
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,038
Which one?

73
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:26,827
That one.

74
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,202
The one that looks

75
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,280
like a pickled radish.

76
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:35,390
The comparison is not cute at all.

77
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,483
But it's easy to get, right?

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,983
I can't find its name.

79
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:52,554
Which one?

80
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,343
Mmm...

81
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,499
None of these seem to fit.

82
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,835
Maybe it's a no-name fish.

83
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,116
Unless it's a new species,

84
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,390
it must have a name.

85
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,968
No matter who it is...

86
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,045
No one can escape from

87
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,467
having a name, huh?

88
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,358
Earlier...

89
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,858
I just remembered,

90
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:00,898
I've been here before.

91
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,983
Really?

92
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:06,976
Mm.

93
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:10,366
I used to live in Tokyo

94
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,850
until middle school.

95
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,062
Did you move?

96
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,874
From the second year of middle school

97
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,514
until I graduated high school,

98
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,905
I was in Kansai.

99
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,373
The use of the Kansai-style "I"

100
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:32,490
came from that time.

101
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:35,788
I understand.

102
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:38,288
Though

103
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,562
your Kansai accent isn't very strong.

104
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:46,366
Well,

105
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,741
I barely went to school

106
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,109
in middle school,

107
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,748
and I was pretty isolated

108
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,045
in high school.

109
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:00,569
Honestly,

110
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,490
I never even refer to myself as

111
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,232
"I" in Kansai style there.

112
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,530
Sounds weird doesn't it?

113
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,819
I came back here

114
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,741
and changed my speech.

115
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:32,749
Kotoha!

116
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:37,273
What?

117
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,240
Suddenly you started to speak louder.

118
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:41,819
Ah...

119
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,444
Sorry.

120
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,812
Well...

121
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,733
Can we go back for a moment?

122
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,429
To the place earlier.

123
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,163
There it is.

124
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,257
You came back to look at this fish?

125
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,726
The name of this fish...

126
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,741
I'm naming it ‘Lemonfish.'

127
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:31,358
Huh?

128
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:33,976
Doesn't it fit?

129
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,092
Well, no, but what's with you

130
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,132
all of a sudden?

131
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,038
I thought we could give it a new name.

132
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,530
You said earlier that no one

133
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,234
escapes having a name.

134
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,124
But names can always change,

135
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,546
just like you changed yours.

136
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,093
For me,

137
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,437
Kotoha is Kotoha.

138
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:16,312
You refer to yourself as "I"

139
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:17,336
in the Kansai style.

140
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,538
There's nothing strange about it.

141
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:31,663
That point about Meguchi,

142
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:33,749
I can't compete with it.

143
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,233
Right?

144
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:41,687
But

145
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,866
your naming sense is as bad as ever.

146
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,358
Then what would you name it?

147
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,257
Mm...

148
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,335
Pickled Radish Fish.

149
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:08,608
Kotoha,

150
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,366
that's too pitiful.

151
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:30,053
Should I get you something as a gift?

152
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:31,460
Huh?

153
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,655
It's a date, after all.

154
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,171
Really?

155
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:39,913
Mm.

156
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,749
Pick whatever you like.

157
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:51,382
- Ah.
- Ah.

158
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,202
But not that.

159
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:55,429
It's over 10,000 yen.

160
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,398
So love has a ceiling.

161
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:39,068
Want that one?

162
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,905
Oh, no.

163
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:45,849
Just thinking about the last time

164
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:47,990
I came here, someone bought it for me.

165
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:51,389
But I left it behind when we moved.

166
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,834
I see.

167
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:58,974
But...

168
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:00,670
I don't think I'll get it.

169
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,655
No space for it at home.

170
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,428
Take it.

171
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,405
This kid

172
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,295
is probably happy to see Kotoha again.

173
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,559
It's been a while.

174
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,668
Wow, that looks so yummy.

175
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:33,684
Freshly grilled.

176
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,543
Looks so yummy!

177
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,605
That's nice, looks so yummy.

178
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,035
That's so big.

179
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,445
Bon appétit.

180
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:49,785
Looks delicious.

181
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,879
Thank you.

182
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,113
Thank you.

183
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,902
Yes, thank you very much.

184
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,512
How exciting.

185
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:05,855
(Whole shrimp senbei)
I'll take the blue one.

186
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,902
Yes.

187
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,519
Here you go.

188
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,340
- Thank you.
- It's so big.

189
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,543
Wow!

190
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,355
- It's so big.
- It's huge.

191
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:20,832
- It's so hot.
- Is it hot?

192
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,051
Thank you.

193
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:24,277
Awesome!

194
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:31,793
Look at that.

195
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,090
- There's another squid shop.
- Oh, right.

196
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,191
What should I get?

197
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:39,746
It's so pretty.

198
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:41,925
I think this color suits me.

199
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,832
- That's right.
- Should I buy it?

200
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,840
Yeah.

201
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:45,738
Let's go with this.

202
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:48,012
- Right?
- Mmm. This one is better.

203
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,308
Meguchi,

204
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,816
- what did you wish for?
- Hmm?

205
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,715
Promise you won't laugh?

206
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:29,770
I won't laugh.

207
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:37,331
I prayed that today's date

208
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,476
would go well.

209
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,340
Hey! You promised you wouldn't laugh!

210
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:47,269
But you looked so serious

211
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:48,574
when you prayed.

212
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,090
Then what did you wish for?

213
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:55,474
That's a secret.

214
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,240
Huh?

215
00:16:58,154 --> 00:16:59,435
Meguchi,

216
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:02,872
want me to tell you

217
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,091
something interesting?

218
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,146
If you say your wish out loud,

219
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,849
it won't come true.

220
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:16,428
Huh?

221
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,240
Mm!

222
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:26,506
So good.

223
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,045
What?

224
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:37,467
You're making it hard to eat.

225
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,756
Huh?

226
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,888
Oh, it's nothing. Sorry.

227
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,357
You're staring too much.

228
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:47,318
You should eat too.

229
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:49,506
Mm.

230
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:11,929
I'm just glad you seem to be having fun.

231
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,125
Well,

232
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,890
being with Meguchi makes anything fun.

233
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:25,882
So, what's next?

234
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:28,929
Mm...

235
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:30,757
You see...

236
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:32,984
There's a place where the sunset

237
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,156
looks beautiful.

238
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,718
I thought we could walk along

239
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,414
the beach until evening.

240
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:45,750
Don't tell me that...

241
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,875
You're a romantic?

242
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:50,398
Huh?

243
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,609
Do you not want to go?

244
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:55,937
No.

245
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:58,726
This point of yours,

246
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,101
I don't hate it.

247
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,711
Cold.

248
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,937
It's not weird.

249
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:18,875
It's November.

250
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,109
I didn't expect this.

251
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,578
Kotoha, are you okay?

252
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:26,820
I'm fine.

253
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,250
Next time, let's come in summer.

254
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,828
That's a long time from now.

255
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,867
Wait, Meguchi!

256
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:23,351
What's wrong?

257
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,078
Ah...

258
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,664
Did you drop that stuffed animal?

259
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,523
My mom bought it for me.

260
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:54,827
No, Meguchi, I think...

261
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:55,702
Then...

262
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:57,421
big sister will get it for you.

263
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,390
So just wait here, okay?

264
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:05,039
Wait, Meguchi!

265
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:07,047
Meguchi!

266
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:11,203
Hey, hold on!

267
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,406
Wait!

268
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:18,226
Meguchi.

269
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,375
It's sad, but we have to
let her let it go.

270
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,453
But...

271
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,851
It's still close enough to get.

272
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,194
A stuffed animal can be replaced.

273
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,523
That's not true.

274
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,246
If we abandon it now,

275
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,933
I'll regret it someday.

276
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,832
But still...

277
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:37,198
It's fine.

278
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,925
I'm good at swimming even though

279
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:40,972
I look like this.

280
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,160
Wait!

281
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,753
Wait! Meguchi!

282
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,727
Regardless, you're too good-natured!

283
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:19,777
I...

284
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:25,363
I'm not good-natured!

285
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:28,785
Huh?

286
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:32,675
Even with you, Kotoha,

287
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,746
I wasn't trying to save you.

288
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:37,753
Back then,

289
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:40,401
I wanted to stop

290
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,729
doing anything like this.

291
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:44,746
I...

292
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,535
What are you talking about?

293
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:51,636
I...

294
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:54,269
I...

295
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,410
Meguchi?

296
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,691
I'll be back.

297
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:30,846
(Next episode)

298
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,261
Helping people,

299
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:33,737
I used to think that even if I died,

300
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:35,065
I would never do it.

301
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,378
That girl doesn't sleep around.

302
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,043
One thing I can tell you is

303
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:42,620
love has no right or wrong.

304
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,550
My name is a curse

305
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,378
that can never be lifted.

306
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,660
It's my fate.

307
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,902
Even if I had won the competition,

308
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,050
the current me wouldn't be happy.

309
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:59,172
Have you ever thought of hugging me?
