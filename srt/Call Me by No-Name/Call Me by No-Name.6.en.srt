1
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:26,078
In that moment, she was so beautiful

2
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,430
it sent chills down my spine.

3
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,695
I don't even know

4
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,977
the name to call her by.

5
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,640
"Call me by no name"

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
(Episode 5: Proof of the Curse)

7
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,216
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,301
I just...

9
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,013
I asked you for a reason.

10
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:36,654
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,232
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.

12
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,334
Then

13
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,631
what right do you have to show up here?

14
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,435
You criminal.

15
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:47,779
Do you realize you're

16
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,483
not supposed to see me?

17
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:51,724
Umm...

18
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,091
I know it's not something that

19
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,630
can ever be forgiven. But...

20
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,357
I just...

21
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:58,677
I needed to apologize

22
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,817
to you and Asahi in person.

23
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,779
Don't speak.

24
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,756
I don't want to hear it.

25
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:09,177
It no longer has nothing to do with me!

26
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:10,465
No...

27
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,435
Stop it!

28
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,748
If you want to go back to prison,

29
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:16,794
then be my guest!

30
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,232
Just don't drag me into it!

31
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:19,271
I'm sorry!

32
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:20,685
If you want to die,

33
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:21,896
then die on your own!

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,170
Please forgive me...

35
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,435
Please forgive me!

36
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:25,881
Just die!

37
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,904
Kotoha!

38
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:28,412
Please stop!

39
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,059
I'm sorry!

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,287
Kotoha!

41
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,013
Wait, Kotoha.

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,474
Kotoha.

43
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,873
Kotoha!

44
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,404
That woman...

45
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:33,099
Meguchi.

46
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,420
Will you

47
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,513
come to my place?

48
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,568
Huh?

49
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:50,552
Just come.

50
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,724
Please.

51
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,872
Kotoha.

52
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,052
Meguchi.

53
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:22,263
Let's do it.

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,474
Huh?

55
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,420
Wait, Kotoha!

56
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,052
This isn't right!

57
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,084
Why not?

58
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:08,607
Let's talk about

59
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,857
what happened earlier,

60
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,365
please?

61
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:13,560
Meguchi,

62
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:15,841
please.

63
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,724
Kotoha.

64
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:29,818
Kotoha!

65
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,388
Stop it!

66
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,560
You said you love me, right?

67
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,912
If you love me, then you can do this.

68
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:50,615
Kotoha.

69
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,693
Are you okay?

70
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:20,326
Meguchi.

71
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,141
Megumi.

72
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,279
Do you know why I call you

73
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:35,943
‘Meguchi'?

74
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,037
I wanted to split it in half.

75
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:47,209
Split?

76
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:55,482
Your name in kanji, Ai, means ‘love.'

77
00:09:58,779 --> 00:09:59,888
If I called you Megu,

78
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,411
it would only be half, right?

79
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:09,615
I wanted to tear your love apart,

80
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,021
I've always thought about it.

81
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,170
Because...

82
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:24,912
Because a name filled with love

83
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,435
from the start, that's unfair.

84
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:32,933
So, calling you that was my

85
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,035
little act of defiance.

86
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,224
A name is a curse.

87
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,146
In the end,

88
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,677
I'm no different from that woman.

89
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,341
Today...

90
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,506
That woman

91
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,310
was that your mother?

92
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,341
Yes.

93
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:42,432
That woman is the witch

94
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,174
who cursed me for life.

95
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,211
To me,

96
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,906
Kotoha is Kotoha.

97
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,156
Meguchi.

98
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
As long as I'm here,

99
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,038
I don't want anything else

100
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,094
except that name.

101
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,547
You're right.

102
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm Furuhashi Kotoha.

103
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,054
My body hurts.

104
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:40,054
Are you okay?

105
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:43,929
At least we should have found

106
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:45,108
something to sleep on.

107
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:49,398
You're right.

108
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:56,718
Meguchi.

109
00:13:59,125 --> 00:13:59,968
I'm sorry.

110
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:03,172
Hmm?

111
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:04,750
What?

112
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:08,593
For earlier.

113
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,336
I forced you.

114
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,875
Even though you didn't want to,

115
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,929
but I still forced you.

116
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,898
That's not true.

117
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:25,101
I was actually into it.

118
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,234
You're staying over tonight, right?

119
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,093
That was the plan.

120
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:40,570
What a relief.

121
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:47,554
I...

122
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:49,812
Never told you this,

123
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,234
but I'm scared of the night.

124
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:53,906
Scared of the night?

125
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:58,405
I can't sleep unless

126
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,110
someone's next to me.

127
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:03,656
I see.

128
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,781
I'm also scared of rain and thunder.

129
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:10,851
And I'm scared of the night.

130
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:16,265
It's like I'm a little kid.

131
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,570
I really need to get over it.

132
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,562
No need to get over it.

133
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,734
I'll stay with you forever.

134
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,328
Kotoha,

135
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,281
let's get married.

136
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:50,117
Huh?

137
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,047
Ah.

138
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:01,484
Wait a moment.

139
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,367
Ta-da.

140
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:31,867
That's trash.

141
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,054
And besides,

142
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:38,445
two women can't get married.

143
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:03,507
Then...

144
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,046
Just stay together forever.

145
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:22,336
This kind of thing...

146
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,336
Doesn't mean anything.

147
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,687
Geez.

148
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,773
I know.

149
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:36,562
But don't say it so seriously like this.

150
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,937
I'm embarrassed.

151
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,109
That's why I said it.

152
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,726
You secretly smiled, didn't you?

153
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,752
I didn't.

154
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,280
- That was a smile.
- I didn't smile.

155
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,812
That was a mocking smile, wasn't it?

156
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:00,554
I suppose.

157
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:02,007
Geez!

158
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,187
Well, you know...

159
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,007
I never thought I'd have

160
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,233
a moment this happy in my life.

161
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,132
You're exaggerating.

162
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:19,687
I'm not.

163
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,515
It's all thanks to you, Meguchi.

164
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:35,648
Thank you.

165
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:42,203
Then...

166
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:45,045
Give that one back.

167
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,078
I'll get you a good looking one someday.

168
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:50,640
Nope.

169
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,617
You gave it to me, so it's mine now.

170
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:53,570
Huh?

171
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,968
Hey. Hey!

172
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:56,693
You called it trash a second ago.

173
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,179
Return it now!

174
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:21,007
(Are you awake yet?)
Today, continuing from

175
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,457
(Are you awake yet?)
the previous class,

176
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:25,004
(Where are you?)
we will listen to a story

177
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:26,769
(Where are you?)
from the Thousand and One Nights.

178
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,335
(Please contact me)
This time, it will be about

179
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,959
(Please contact me)
Sinbad's adventures.

180
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:31,056
Everyone,

181
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,443
Among the stories in

182
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:34,145
the Thousand and One Nights,

183
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,121
- Is something wrong?
- this a famous one.

184
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:37,912
I think everyone has heard it before.

185
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,207
It's nothing.

186
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:40,638
Is that so?

187
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:41,849
Mmm.

188
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,169
The summary of the story is as follows,

189
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:46,614
Sinbad, the owner of

190
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:48,311
a magnificent castle...

191
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:50,732
It's been quite a while

192
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:53,373
that we have get to eat outside.

193
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:55,630
Yeah, you're right. It's been a while.

194
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:56,989
- Mm.
- Let's go.

195
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:57,575
Sure.

196
00:20:57,576 --> 00:20:58,966
What do you want to eat?

197
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,387
I want western food right now.

198
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,365
Sorry,

199
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:03,802
I just remembered something.

200
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:05,317
You guys go ahead.

201
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,559
Skipping again?

202
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:09,810
Megumi.

203
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,279
You didn't come yesterday either.

204
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,279
Yesterday, I...

205
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:15,849
You realize your credits

206
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,044
are in trouble, right?

207
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,950
You have to make up

208
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:20,184
for the time you took off.

209
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,708
I know that.

210
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:24,294
- But...
- Megumi.

211
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,943
You've changed since you

212
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:28,982
started dating her.

213
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,787
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

214
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,771
Kotoha!

215
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:17,794
What's wrong?

216
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:20,044
You didn't contact me today at all.

217
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:23,013
Did I do something wrong?

218
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,576
I got bored.

219
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,630
Everything until now?

220
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,123
It was all just an act.

221
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,724
Do you think I'd believe that?

222
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,231
Stop lying.

223
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:55,591
Meguchi,

224
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,701
what do you even know about me?

225
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,482
You know nothing.

226
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,466
And yet, you say you'll

227
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:08,693
stay with me forever?

228
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,966
Do you really think I'd fall for it?

229
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,349
It's over.

230
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,451
From that day on,

231
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,865
Furuhashi Kotoha vanished.

232
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,810
(Next episode)

233
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,701
I'm afraid to guess your name.

234
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:48,888
That's why I've been avoiding it.

235
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:52,239
Please tell me everything about Kotoha.

236
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,239
I love you this much.

237
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,192
I know Kotoha's real name now.

238
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,281
If I get it wrong,

239
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,305
I won't bother Kotoha anymore.
