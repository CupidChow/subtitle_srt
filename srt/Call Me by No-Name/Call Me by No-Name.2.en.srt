"Couple proving"
Furuhashi Kotoha, right?

7
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,432
From the Faculty of Science
and Engineering.

8
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:15,589
Huh?

9
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,424
Sanae, you know Kotoha?

10
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,299
Of course I know her.

11
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,995
She's kind of famous.

12
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:23,947
I heard the seniors from my club

13
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,252
were fighting over her.

14
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,381
Famous? You mean like…

15
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,905
in a player kind of way?

16
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:35,647
Huh?

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,186
Megumi, you knew about that?

18
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,975
I thought you didn't know about it

19
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,936
and were just getting along with her.

20
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:45,334
You shouldn't get involved

21
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:46,624
with people like that.

22
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,538
Especially you, Megumi,

23
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,202
you're way too nice.

24
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,357
Alright, stop.

25
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,350
Hmm?

26
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,108
Aren't you going too far?

27
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,498
Judging someone just based on

28
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,114
rumors isn't right.

29
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,967
But there's also the ‘accident'...

30
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:19,420
Ah.

31
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:21,842
Hey there, Meguchi.

32
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,475
What are you doing?

33
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,662
Figured if I stayed here,

34
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,123
you'd come and pick me up.

35
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:48,256
So, how have the past three days been?

36
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:51,210
How have they been?

37
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,725
How have you been spending time?

38
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,194
What?

39
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:04,201
Were you lonely?

40
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,272
That's not what I meant!

41
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:09,858
I get it.

42
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,874
You're wondering if I stayed

43
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,545
at someone else's place, right?

44
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,373
I was at home.

45
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,592
Huh?

46
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:24,952
You have a house?

47
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:27,202
How else would I live?

48
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,686
Then why...

49
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,272
Meguchi,

50
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,647
are you hungry?

51
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,288
Umm...

52
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,087
Just so you know,

53
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,502
before I let you stay here,

54
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,225
don't do that kind of thing tonight.

55
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:58,491
That kind of thing?

56
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:03,335
Ah.

57
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,991
Sex?

58
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:08,374
You don't have to say it so bluntly!

59
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:13,210
Anyway,

60
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:15,545
no physical contact, okay?

61
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,475
Got it.

62
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:20,678
Sure.

63
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:23,342
Huh?

64
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,889
Huh? What?

65
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,116
You're okay with it?

66
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,327
I thought you would be dissatisfied.

67
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,795
Is it that unexpected?

68
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,553
Just so you know,

69
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:38,670
I only did it as a form of repayment.

70
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:39,834
It's not like I enjoy

71
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,139
that sort of thing.

72
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,561
But…

73
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,749
It's not only in your department,

74
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,217
people are saying you're

75
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:51,022
always hopping between clubs too.

76
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,631
Huh?

77
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:07,592
Meguchi, you've been looking into me?

78
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:11,639
Well, we're competing.

79
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:17,873
But

80
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:20,952
if you don't enjoy that kind of thing,

81
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,420
then why live like that?

82
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:30,694
At first, it was just proof.

83
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,256
Proof?

84
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,038
Huh? What?

85
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:41,061
Proof that you're popular?

86
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,038
No,

87
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,756
you don't have to go out of your way

88
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,498
to prove it, just look in the mirror.

89
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,428
Then...

90
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:51,170
But it's different now.

91
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:55,569
Different?

92
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,092
So it's not proof?

93
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:03,428
Mmm.

94
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:06,030
Now, it's fate.

95
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,366
What do you mean?

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,084
Fate that's been decided

97
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,514
since the moment I was born.

98
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,858
Now, it's all done.

99
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,826
Mm.

100
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,585
- Wow!
- Whoa!

101
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:51,952
What is it?

102
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,309
Or maybe you're the type of person

103
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,293
who doesn't like fried tofu in hot pots?

104
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,631
No,

105
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,577
I'm fine with it.

106
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,582
Just remembered

107
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,457
my big brother liked fried tofu.

108
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,124
You have a brother?

109
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:08,154
That's unexpected.

110
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,991
Yeah,

111
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:13,897
he's my complete opposite in every way.

112
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:16,655
Are you two close?

113
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,701
Not sure about now,

114
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,733
but we used to be.

115
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:36,811
Alright.

116
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:39,639
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

117
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,163
Alright.

118
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,022
Meguchi. Say ahh.

119
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:51,139
Huh?

120
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,131
Couples do stuff like this, right?

121
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:12,608
Is it good?

122
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:16,413
Okay, one more.

123
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,085
Alright, finish it all.

124
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,874
Here you go.

125
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:39,580
And this one.

126
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,186
And one more.

127
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:45,952
It's too much!

128
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,819
Hey, come here.

129
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:55,413
What is it?

130
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,177
Hey.

131
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:58,967
Huh? No, no, no.

132
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:00,092
Stop it.

133
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:03,584
My stomach feels like

134
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:04,646
it's going to burst.

135
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:08,249
You ate so much, Meguchi.

136
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,506
That's because you kept

137
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,211
feeding me your share.

138
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,116
Sorry, sorry.

139
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,303
Then...

140
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,889
Alright, I'll answer three questions.

141
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:25,663
Huh?

142
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,232
You've been staring at me all day

143
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:30,225
like there's something you want to ask.

144
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,928
If you have any questions, just ask.

145
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:38,819
Something to ask?

146
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,538
Ah...

147
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,866
Oh, right. What's your real name?

148
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:53,577
That point of Megumi is amazing.

149
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,647
No comment.

150
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:58,874
Huh?

151
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,569
What's your favorite color?

152
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:03,811
Mmm...

153
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:06,030
Never thought about it.

154
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:08,936
Blue, maybe?

155
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,530
Do you like me?

156
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,928
Probably not.

157
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:30,928
Huh?

158
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,358
Hey, Meguchi.

159
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,592
Why do you keep acting so bold?

160
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,647
Then why did you agree to date me?

161
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:47,569
That's your fourth question.

162
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,623
The first one doesn't count!

163
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:06,491
Kotoha, are you asleep?

164
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,225
Just so you know,

165
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,302
if you can't date me

166
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:16,491
like a normal person,

167
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,943
I'll break up with you.

168
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,311
Huh?

169
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,694
It's only natural.

170
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,615
Even normal couples break up

171
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:25,849
if they don't match.

172
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,319
Well, yeah.

173
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,850
What does ‘normal' even mean?

174
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:39,045
Well, that's up to you.

175
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:46,600
And if we break up, it's game over.

176
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:47,663
No way!

177
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,295
So, let's work hard together

178
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,865
so that doesn't happen, okay?

179
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,531
Hey, Meguchi.

180
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,249
Turn this way please.

181
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:20,234
No way.

182
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,616
My heart is...

183
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:30,765
Huh?

184
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,874
I want to fall asleep

185
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:34,796
looking at your cute face.

186
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,171
Good night,

187
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,695
Meguchi.

188
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,351
Good night.

189
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,721
Oh, you're up?

190
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:02,815
Morning.

191
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,485
Morning.

192
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,016
I'm heading out first.

193
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:09,641
See you later.

194
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,314
What does she even mean

195
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,462
by ‘dating normally'?

196
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:26,376
Ah, Megumi-chan, you have a lover now?

197
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,290
Not exactly lover...

198
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,610
Can they be called a lover?

199
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,180
Huh? You're confused already with that?

200
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,563
Let's say they are.

201
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:38,555
Mm.

202
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:39,742
What does ‘dating'

203
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,477
even entail?

204
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,524
Mm...

205
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,852
You don't need to ‘do' anything, really.

206
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,851
Just being together without a reason is

207
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,523
what dating is all about, isn't it?

208
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,657
Even if you said that...

209
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,555
That's how those who are

210
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,774
experts in love are.

211
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:05,493
No, I think that's a beginner level.

212
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,891
Maybe go somewhere together?

213
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,126
Like a date?

214
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,891
Yes.

215
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,125
If you don't want to feel pressured,

216
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,469
you could just watch a movie

217
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,782
at home or something.

218
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:17,812
Mm. Got it.

219
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,196
Bon appétit.

220
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:29,264
(Scheherazade Chiyako
Furuhashi Kotoha)

221
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:35,538
By the way,

222
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:37,155
why do you think people

223
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,358
change their names?

224
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,187
It's just a question,

225
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,249
but you're good at deduction, Tabane.

226
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,780
Mmm...

227
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,421
The only thing I can think of is

228
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,920
maybe their name was so unusual

229
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:53,136
it caused issues in daily life?

230
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:54,593
Oh.

231
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,460
Like a flashy, hard-to-live-with name?

232
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,374
Mm.

233
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,296
Or maybe...

234
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:04,555
It is a name that has an impact.

235
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,891
Has an impact?

236
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:12,578
You are already doing

237
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:13,742
volunteer work, aren't you?

238
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,179
Helping people has always

239
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,844
been a normal thing, right?

240
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,984
Maybe it's quicker to consider

241
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,039
the intentions of

242
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,306
the one questioned you.

243
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:23,469
Why did that person...

244
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,891
Ask you that, Megumi-chan.

245
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:35,813
Meaning...

246
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,857
Why did they have to try to

247
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,279
make me guess their old name?

248
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,626
I never thought about it like that.

249
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,407
What do you think, Tabane?

250
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:49,704
Hard to say,

251
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:54,227
but maybe they want you to know.

252
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,297
Want me to know?

253
00:16:59,005 --> 00:16:59,880
Mm.

254
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:02,633
The reason for the name change.

255
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,430
Hey...

256
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:20,766
If I didn't show up,

257
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,352
what would you have done?

258
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:26,774
Who knows?

259
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:28,719
But you're here.

260
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,126
Alright.

261
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:36,118
Let's go, Meguchi.

262
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:39,822
- Popcorn?
- Oh.

263
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:41,556
The sweet ones.

264
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,158
- Sweet ones?
- Mm.

265
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,111
Sweet ones, huh?

266
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:46,557
- Then the flavor of popcorn...
- Mm.

267
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,330
It must be caramel.

268
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,377
- Right.
- Oh.

269
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,962
Do you want to upset us?

270
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,135
So brave.

271
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,408
- Bring some beer.
- Bring some beer.

272
00:17:58,885 --> 00:17:59,768
Why?

273
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,150
You want beer too?

274
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:21,244
Hey,

275
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,791
do you want a basket?

276
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:34,330
Oh. Thanks.

277
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:39,354
Here.

278
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:40,791
Just leave it there.

279
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:41,869
Mm.

280
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,533
I'll check the drinks section.

281
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,377
Mm.

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,440
Sorry,

284
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:07,268
I forgot to buy something.

285
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,150
Are you okay, customer?

286
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,994
Ah.

287
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:24,596
Excuse me, we need to talk about this.

288
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,400
So, Meguchi.

289
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,291
Why'd you do that?

290
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:30,783
Huh?

291
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,096
You knew, didn't you?

292
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,455
That kid was shoplifting.

293
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,268
Well, yeah.

294
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,650
You could've just talked to him instead

295
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:43,784
of making him trip.

296
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,244
Or talk to the clerk.

297
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:49,892
It was just a coincidence.

298
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,002
Liar.

299
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,884
You made sure only the kid got caught

300
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:55,938
while the lookouts escaped, didn't you?

301
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:57,588
So he could tell the clerk

302
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:58,891
the truth later.

303
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,611
You figured that out, too?

304
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,494
If you're going to help someone,

305
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,916
why take such a roundabout approach?

306
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,370
This doesn't count as helping anyone.

307
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:18,315
I didn't do anything good.

308
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,127
Why can't you just admit it?

309
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,252
You're such a softie, Meguchi.

310
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,275
Meguchi.

311
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,486
What's wrong?

312
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:01,533
Nothing.

313
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,283
It's nothing.

314
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,416
Why'd you pick this movie?

315
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:31,127
Because I hate my mom, too.

316
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,674
I've been wondering.

317
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:51,713
Would you be happy if

318
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,346
I guessed your real name?

319
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:57,799
Maybe not.

320
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:03,588
Then why make me guess?

321
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,127
No comment.

322
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,377
Another question then.

323
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,861
Have you seen this movie before?

324
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:09,650
Umm...

325
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:14,166
Are you free on Thursday?

326
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,338
Yeah, I am.

327
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:31,893
Wanna go on a date?

328
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:37,361
Sure.

329
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,869
Whatever you want, Meguchi.

330
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:45,846
(Next episode)

331
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:48,001
I hope today's date goes smoothly.

332
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,181
Megumi looking different isn't bad.

333
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,282
I think I'll give you a new name.

334
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,618
Long time no see.

335
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:55,016
If I leave you here,

336
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,969
I'll regret it someday.

337
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,023
Wait a minute.

338
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,500
Wait, Meguchi.
