1
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:08,477
If I figure out her name,

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,086
this love will come to an end.

3
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,531
Kotoha.

4
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,429
"Call Me by No Name"

5
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,047
(Episode 5: Proof of Love)
Kotoha!

6
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:05,266
(Episode 5: Proof of Love)

7
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,468
You don't have to sound

8
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:10,173
like someone just died.

9
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:15,859
I've made up my mind.

10
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,188
Huh?

11
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,234
Come with me.

12
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:22,304
Wait, Meguchi, your eyes are

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,088
kinda scary right now.

14
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:26,292
(Welcome)

15
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,773
Will you be staying for two guests?

16
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,141
Yes, that's correct.

17
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:40,250
I'll book you under the girls' night plan.

18
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:41,383
Huh?

19
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,641
Please select your menu items.

20
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,906
This one.

21
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,672
Whoa! This is amazing!

22
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:26,330
Oh!

23
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,578
Whoa! It's a stone sauna!

24
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,257
This is insane!

25
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,046
There's even an open-air bath!

26
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:42,281
This is incredible! Right, Kotoha?

27
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:44,070
Ah.

28
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,406
Wanna take a bath together?

29
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:51,586
Huh?

30
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,218
Ah...

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,086
No, um...

32
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,078
Have you been to

33
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:01,398
a place like this before?

34
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,516
Yeah,

35
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,539
with two close friends.

36
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,353
I see.

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,181
Meguchi, I didn't know you were

38
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,326
the orgy type.

39
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:13,989
I am not!

40
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,246
We just ate honey toast

41
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,488
and played a board game.

42
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:17,817
A completely wholesome,

43
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:18,910
uncorrupted party!

44
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:22,599
But...

45
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:24,630
This time, you came here to

46
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:25,934
do more than that, right?

47
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,255
I...

48
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,005
Yeah, I guess so.

49
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,028
Haa...

50
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,935
I got it.

51
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:09,192
It's okay.

52
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,989
You don't have to force yourself.

53
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,185
Yesterday was my fault.

54
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,919
No.

55
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,802
I like you, Kotoha.

56
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,302
I'm here because I like you.

57
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,286
That's all.

58
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:54,848
Meguchi, are you going to be

59
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:55,981
the one to hold me?

60
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:16,739
Yes?

61
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,636
Ouch, that hurts!

62
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:20,753
Ah!

63
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,792
Yes, coming!

64
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,531
Excuse me, your honey toast is here.

65
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:31,001
Please enjoy.

66
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,292
Thank you.

67
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,440
Caught it in time.

68
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:12,488
- Place it there.
- Mm.

69
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,433
- Hey, Meguchi,
- Hmm?

70
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,722
do you think this flower is edible?

71
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,050
Mmm... No idea.

72
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:28,363
Ugh, bitter!

73
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:31,558
And kinda grassy.

74
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,409
Why would you eat the biggest one

75
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,885
when you don't even know?

76
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,550
Hmm?

77
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,831
But...

78
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,519
It's not completely inedible, I think.

79
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,550
But it's really bitter.

80
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,073
Ugh, that's really bitter!

81
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,339
This one's definitely not edible.

82
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:05,355
Next time we come here,

83
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,642
they're gonna laugh at us.

84
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,980
‘Those two were the idiots

85
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:09,316
who ate the decoration flowers.'

86
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,144
I...

87
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,675
I like you, Kotoha.

88
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:55,300
I...

89
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,722
I can't say the same

90
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:00,965
about you like that.

91
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,830
But still...

92
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,025
You don't hate it when I do this, right?

93
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:16,702
Well, no.

94
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,908
It's not like I hate it. I'm used to it.

95
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,517
It doesn't matter

96
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,877
if you're used to it or not.

97
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:32,619
I...

98
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,283
don't want to do anything

99
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,499
you don't like.

100
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,228
This isn't about proving love

101
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,400
or anything like that.

102
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:47,900
Right now,

103
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,665
I'm doing this just because

104
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:52,289
I want to touch you.

105
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,666
Meguchi.

106
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,119
Hmm?

107
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:12,943
Make a mark on me.

108
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:19,486
Done?

109
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:23,189
Mm.

110
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,607
It's the same.

111
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,521
Why...

112
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:11,310
are you crying?

113
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,662
I don't know.

114
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:21,467
I don't know,

115
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,035
my tears just fell on their own.

116
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,040
Ever since we met,

117
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,114
you've been nothing

118
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:38,803
but confusing, Meguchi.

119
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,045
Sorry.

120
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:53,326
But...

121
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,631
I don't hate it.

122
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:11,154
Being touched by you.

123
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:24,451
Kotoha, I like you.

124
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,334
Thank you

125
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,787
for liking me.

126
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,068
Ah!

127
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,389
Don't eat in bed.

128
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:06,459
It's not home, so it's fine.

129
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:15,825
Does your place happen to be

130
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:17,522
near the university?

131
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,920
Ah, no,

132
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,779
it's actually pretty far.

133
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,310
Can I come over sometime?

134
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,217
Nope.

135
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:29,693
Actually,

136
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,615
I've never let anyone in my house.

137
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,154
Really?

138
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,060
I'm the type to stay over

139
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:41,756
at other people's places.

140
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:47,514
So, Meguchi.

141
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,412
How was your first time?

142
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,795
Do people normally ask that?

143
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,146
I quite like it.

144
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,834
Seriously, what are you even doing?

145
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,185
Meguchi,

146
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,459
turn this way.

147
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,740
Hmm?

148
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:38,607
I can't sleep unless you're facing me.

149
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:42,404
That's definitely a lie.

150
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:44,748
It's true.

151
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,928
Come closer.

152
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,060
Isn't it too close?

153
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:12,162
When I do this, I'm not scared anymore.

154
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:28,958
- Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.

155
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:29,811
Shall I pay for it?

156
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,114
Thank you.

157
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:31,889
Sure.

158
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:33,881
Ah.

159
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,295
Kotoha!

160
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,131
Meguchi!

161
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,709
Wait up.

162
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:01,310
This is Furuhashi Kotoha.

163
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:06,225
But you already know that.

164
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:08,939
Umm...

165
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:13,998
She's my girlfriend!

166
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,045
Wait, Meguchi!

167
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:17,842
Huh?

168
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:19,443
Was I not supposed to say that?

169
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,764
No, I don't really mind.

170
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,685
I just wanted them to know.

171
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:29,545
Megumi.

172
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,318
I told you not to get involved with her.

173
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:35,381
Now, now.

174
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:37,770
Sanae-chan, you're just sad

175
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:39,802
Megumi-chan was taken away, huh?

176
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,748
That's not it! I'm worried about her!

177
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,443
Alright, alright,

178
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,771
let's go.

179
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:48,630
Let's go, come on.

180
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:52,178
See you later, Kotoha.

181
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,810
Mmm.

182
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,060
Let me ask you,

183
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:12,685
you're serious about

184
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,966
dating Megumi, right?

185
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:20,600
Do I need to answer that for you?

186
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:27,482
Megumi isn't like people like you.

187
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,349
She only just managed to start

188
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,795
coming to university again.

189
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,287
Please, don't mess with her.

190
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,475
You don't have to worry.

191
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,709
It's just a game anyway.

192
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,201
A game?

193
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:55,506
(Night of Diamonds, Volume 7)

194
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:11,842
Are you almost done with your report?

195
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,014
There's still a little bit left.

196
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,232
Ugh!

197
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,490
(Every night after she slept
with the king)

198
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,201
Hmm?

199
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:43,740
What are you laughing about?

200
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:47,178
I just remembered, when we first met,

201
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:50,357
you called yourself Scheherazade.

202
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:54,646
Oh, that.

203
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,959
You're pretty witty coming up with

204
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,552
One Thousand and One Nights

205
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,669
on the spot like that.

206
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:02,709
When I was little,

207
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:06,100
I actually wanted to be a novelist.

208
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:10,365
Huh, a novelist?

209
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:12,373
Surprising, right?

210
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,818
That's why I used ‘Scheherazade'

211
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:17,107
the name of a storyteller

212
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,740
who spins tales.

213
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:22,820
Oh.

214
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:24,889
But

215
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,748
now that I think about it,

216
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:27,951
it's not that surprising.

217
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,029
Maybe because of your name?

218
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:33,045
Kotoha

219
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:36,123
sounds a lot like Kotonoha [word].

220
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,975
Oh, good guess.

221
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:40,912
Well,

222
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:42,810
being a novelist was my dream

223
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,701
before I changed my name, though.

224
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,873
So, what's your dream now?

225
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:52,850
Hmm…

226
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,568
Maybe becoming a bride?

227
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:06,146
Umm...

228
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:09,873
Can I hug you?

229
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,365
Go ahead.

230
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,270
So cute.

231
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:26,169
Mm, you eat too.

232
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,130
Please make it for me.

233
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:28,975
Sure.

234
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,810
I want to buy other flavors of jam too.

235
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,169
Mm, nice.

236
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,334
What's happening over there?

237
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:38,694
Yeah.

238
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,342
Ah, wait.

239
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:54,957
You're making things difficult for me.

240
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,139
No, I can't let you through.

241
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,483
- Please.
- No, it's the rule.

242
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,123
Please go back. This way.

243
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,248
- Just a little bit is fine.
- No, ma'am.

244
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,623
Why are you here?

245
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:45,685
(Next episode)

246
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,881
No, wait, Kotoha!

247
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,639
Do you understand that you

248
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,013
shouldn't come and see me?

249
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,763
I want to tear Meguchi's love apart.

250
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:55,203
Do you think I'll understand

251
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,388
if you say it like that?

252
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:59,420
What do know about me, Meguchi?
