1
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:02,516
Meguchi,

2
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,539
what do you even know about me?

3
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:11,836
Kotoha.

4
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:15,922
It's over.

5
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,186
"Call Me by No Name"

6
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:31,873
(Episode 7: The proof of that woman)

7
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,057
Hey. Good morning.

8
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:01,991
What's going on?

9
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,389
You've been skipping for three days now.

10
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:07,248
Sorry.

11
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:12,702
That's not an answer.

12
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,404
Something happened with

13
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,109
Kotoha-chan, didn't it?

14
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,428
We broke up.

15
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,944
Hmm?

16
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,616
And?

17
00:02:36,194 --> 00:02:37,218
"And?"

18
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,522
Mm.

19
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,936
What of it?

20
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,233
I mean...

21
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,483
Kotoha and I are not...

22
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:51,725
Megumi-chan

23
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,312
is not the kind of person to fall apart

24
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,179
just because you got dumped.

25
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:06,155
When Kotoha brought it up, I realized

26
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:10,686
that I

27
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,426
never wanted to know about her.

28
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:18,452
I was afraid of guessing her name.

29
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,350
So I have been always avoiding it.

30
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:26,702
Someone like me...

31
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,233
doesn't even have the right to face her.

32
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:50,815
Because you don't have

33
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,241
the right to face her,

34
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:53,748
you're just gonna keep

35
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:54,954
skipping class forever?

36
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:58,850
That's...

37
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,999
Megumi-chan,

38
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:05,587
what do you want?

39
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,704
"What do you want?"

40
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,218
Are you really okay with never doing

41
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:16,851
anything about Kotoha at all?

42
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:31,758
This is your life, Megumi-chan.

43
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:49,975
Hey!

44
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,110
Ugh,

45
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:53,860
you again?

46
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,604
Tell me anything you know about Kotoha.

47
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,104
Anything at all.

48
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,602
I looked into it.

49
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,142
That day, after you said

50
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,354
all that stuff to me.

51
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,360
I wanted to know Kotoha properly, too.

52
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:19,873
So I talked to the guys

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,400
who slept with her.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,055
I honestly didn't want to do it.

55
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:27,961
But I couldn't think of any other way.

56
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:31,264
I thought maybe if I saw how

57
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:32,651
she acted with other people,

58
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,085
I could understand the real Kotoha,

59
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,399
even just a little.

60
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,196
Did you...

61
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,743
Find out anything?

62
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:48,524
That woman...

63
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,211
She acted like

64
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,878
everything was already decided.

65
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,464
She doesn't care about anything

66
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:55,489
that it's eerie.

67
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:58,755
As if it was an obligation.

68
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,454
Obligation?

69
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,126
That night...

70
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:09,079
I asked her why she was doing this.

71
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,133
And Kotoha said…

72
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,438
"It's my fate."

73
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,126
Huh?

74
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,352
Sorry,

75
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,805
I just had a feeling she'd say that.

76
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:29,602
Yeah.

77
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,555
She said "it's my fate."

78
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,696
I didn't get it at the time,

79
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:38,954
but now I do.

80
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,274
What's certain is that Kotoha

81
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,118
is probably not looking for love.

82
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,305
(A Thousand and One Nights)

83
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:34,938
Scheherazade.

84
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,243
Scheherazade?

85
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:38,672
You don't know

86
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,085
One Thousand and One Nights?

87
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,075
That's the name of the one who wrote

88
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,813
the stories and also the storyteller.

89
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,945
(Scheherazade Chiyako
Furuhashi Kotoha)

90
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:55,618
(Words that have a bad meaning
when combined)

91
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:57,712
Is your name really that bad?

92
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,180
Maybe it depends on the context.

93
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:03,266
But...

94
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,547
The characters do look beautiful.

95
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:18,125
(Scheherazade is probably
a word close to Kotoha)

96
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,547
Names are a curse.

97
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:47,622
From the moment we're born,

98
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,448
our fate is decided.

99
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:07,703
(Curse? Fate?)

100
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:23,407
Rain...

101
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:26,110
do you also dislike it?

102
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,516
I don't like it at all.

103
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,633
And thunderstorms are the worst.

104
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,602
When we're like this, it's not so scary.

105
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:44,641
I...

106
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,847
Never told you this,

107
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:48,265
but I'm scared of the night.

108
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,008
Hey, you.

109
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:18,422
You were there that time, weren't you?

110
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,165
- I...
- Wait a minute.

111
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:26,250
Please...

112
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,626
Don't say Kotoha's real name.

113
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,516
I absolutely don't want to hear it

114
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,741
from your mouth.

115
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,422
Are you her friend?

116
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:53,985
No.

117
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,516
I'm her lover.

118
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:16,454
My name is Yotsugi Megumi.

119
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,274
And you?

120
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:22,653
Hashidate Sora.

121
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,860
Hashidate...

122
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:35,188
Regardless...

123
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:38,040
I really wanted to see her.

124
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:42,055
But I haven't been able to at all.

125
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,863
It seems like she hasn't been

126
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,643
coming to the university for a while.

127
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,197
Have you been waiting here

128
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:54,342
all this time?

129
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:55,698
For Kotoha?

130
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,743
Because I...

131
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,155
have been holding back

132
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:02,568
from seeing her for so long.

133
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:05,648
Both that child and Asahi.

134
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,178
I've been holding back for so long.

135
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:10,782
Even though...

136
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,704
I love then so much.

137
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,391
It's cruel.

138
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:30,890
But I...

139
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,986
I'm sure Kotoha doesn't want to see you.

140
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,217
Not you.

141
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:46,430
So what?

142
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:49,679
Huh?

143
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,040
Because I...

144
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,391
want to see her.

145
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:19,344
(Hashidate Sora)

146
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,342
(Hashidate Sora, sentenced to one year in
prison for child abuse of her own child)

147
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,320
(Routinely subjected her 16-year-old
son to sexual abuse)

148
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:27,875
I'll report this to the police.

149
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,544
Do you think they'll take us seriously

150
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,069
if we say it's between women?

151
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,649
It doesn't matter!

152
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:33,869
Even if it's between women,

153
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,382
if the other person doesn't agree,

154
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,602
it's a crime!

155
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,195
Wow,

156
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,781
Meguchi seems to know a lot.

157
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,086
You criminal.

158
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:44,230
Do you realize you're

159
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:45,622
not supposed to see me?

160
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,632
Giving me a name like that...

161
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,570
She was a witch who put a curse on me.

162
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:51,612
Kotoha, don't you hate

163
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:53,205
being treated like this, right?

164
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:55,149
Not really.

165
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,538
I don't mind. I'm used to it.

166
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,081
When I was little,

167
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:08,621
I actually wanted to be a novelist.

168
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:11,500
That's why I used ‘Scheherazade'

169
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,788
(Every night, the king would spend
the evening with her)

170
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:14,570
If...

171
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,703
You can't escape the fate of your name.

172
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,906
Even if I change my name,

173
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,484
in the end,

174
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm no different from that woman.

175
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,172
You...

176
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:43,680
Can you sleep with me?

177
00:14:57,445 --> 00:15:01,210
(I found out your name)

178
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:06,382
(Let's meet at the aquarium)

179
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:07,894
(I found out your name
Let's meet at the aquarium)

180
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,047
You always arrive first.

181
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,922
I'm a woman who's always one step ahead.

182
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:59,264
Don't tell me you found out

183
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,831
the name of that fish from last time?

184
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:08,102
It's a damselfish.

185
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,336
I asked the staff.

186
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:16,180
What a plain name.

187
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:32,867
I also found out your real name.

188
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:46,047
I'll tell you this

189
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,469
you only get one chance.

190
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:52,399
I understand.

191
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,484
If I get it wrong,

192
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:01,012
I'll never involve myself

193
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,237
with you again.

194
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,109
I promise.

195
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:17,266
Yotogi.

196
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:26,624
(Scheherazade Chiyako)

197
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,953
(Furuhashi Kotoha Hashidate Yotogi)

198
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,477
Hashidate Yotogi.

199
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,266
That's your real name.

200
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:46,486
My brother and I

201
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:48,378
went through the same thing.

202
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,023
But...

203
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,958
But Japanese law only recognized

204
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,663
my brother as a victim.

205
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:02,547
Do you know why?

206
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,117
Because I'm a woman.

207
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,758
Because I'm the same gender as her.

208
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:26,234
That's the only reason.

209
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:31,008
I looked into it.

210
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,814
I also know that the law was

211
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,301
revised two years ago.

212
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,547
That's right.

213
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:58,797
Finally, they acknowledged it.

214
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,672
Did you change your name

215
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:14,078
to prove the abuse?

216
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,055
Yotogi.

217
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:28,094
If I could change this name,

218
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,915
that fact would be officially

219
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,729
recorded in court documents.

220
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,216
Along with the fact that

221
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:41,241
it reminds me of being abused.

222
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,180
It's a horrible name, isn't it?

223
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:55,508
It's too accurate.

224
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,430
It's a name that sounds...

225
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:09,492
As if I was born just for that woman.

226
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:13,820
That's not true.

227
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:14,945
But...

228
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,524
But even after changing my name,

229
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:25,242
‘Yotogi' remained inside me.

230
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:33,766
That woman's curse never left.

231
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,984
Meguchi,

232
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,758
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,797
People can't be reborn.

234
00:20:57,531 --> 00:20:58,758
Someone like me...

235
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:04,164
doesn't deserve to be loved.

236
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:21,297
I...

237
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,578
Ragardless of whether you're Kotoha

238
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,016
or Yotogi,

239
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:39,094
I love you all the same.

240
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:48,649
Megumi.

241
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:55,430
Say my real name.

242
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,805
My true name.

243
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:03,477
Please?

244
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:10,774
Yotogi.

245
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,203
I beg of you,

246
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,054
just one more time.

247
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:32,508
Yotogi.

248
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,156
Megumi.

249
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,339
You went to great lengths

250
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:56,813
to find Hashidate Yotogi.

251
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,266
Thank you.

252
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,930
With this,

253
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:28,594
now, we're friends.

254
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:33,766
I had known from the start.

255
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,781
The moment I spoke her true name,

256
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:42,406
this love would come to an end.

257
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:45,609
(Next episode)

258
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,134
At that time, I...

259
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:48,961
might have expected

260
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:51,297
love to begin.

261
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,313
You keep pestering!

262
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,346
Megumi has always been

263
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:54,296
serious about you.

264
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,297
I will choose my own happiness.

265
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:57,826
Someday, I will definitely

266
00:23:57,851 --> 00:23:59,451
make Meguchi suffer.
