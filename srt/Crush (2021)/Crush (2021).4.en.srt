3
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,561
I don't take carbonated drinks.

4
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,677
I was having a brain fade.

5
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,987
However, please be understanding.

6
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,934
If they believe it,

7
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,501
we shall move on.

8
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,854
It can be considered that...

9
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,869
you've contributed to a good relationship.

10
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,219
You'll be rewarded for that.

11
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,263
I don't need it.

12
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,105
Why did you cry?

13
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,242
I was acting.

14
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,280
I had to be sincere, right?

15
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,509
Be honest.

16
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,674
That guy and I knew each other
since we were young.

17
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,092
My dad and his dad are colleagues.

18
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:32,786
We live in the same building.

19
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:34,847
We grew up playing together.

20
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:36,702
Xu Qian...

21
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,615
transferred to our class when
we were in our sophomore year.

22
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,270
The moment I saw her,
I immediately felt awkward.

23
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,565
She's so pretty.

24
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,149
She's fair and slim.

25
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,474
However, she's distant and cold.

26
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,527
In the first month we shared a desk,
we barely talked.

27
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:54,161
However, since the music test...

28
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:02,659
Miss.

29
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,261
Sang Wu Yan is having a sore throat.
She can't talk.

30
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:08,186
I see.

31
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,334
Sang Wu Yan, you may take the test later.

32
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:18,695
Thank you.

33
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,839
After that, we became best friends.

34
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,950
We always spent time
together after school.

35
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,639
Xu Qian loved listening to the radio.

36
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,996
So, we always listened
to the radio together.

37
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:30,369
Because of that,
I fell in love with radio too.

38
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,492
Hello, everyone.

39
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,514
Thank you for listening to the show.

40
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,041
-Today...
-Hey.

41
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:37,840
My mom said that
your parents won't be home tonight.

42
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,273
She asked me to call you over for dinner.

43
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,710
Let's talk about the stories around us.

44
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,932
Whether you're sad or happy,

45
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,072
nothing's better than
turning off the lights,

46
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,208
putting on your headphones,

47
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,616
and immersing yourself in...

48
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:52,187
Let me introduce someone to you.

49
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:53,887
She's my best friend, Xu Qian.

50
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,637
Please take care of her.

51
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,891
Okay.

52
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,571
Hello, my name is Wei Hao.

53
00:04:58,651 --> 00:04:59,704
Hello.

54
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,652
(Inquiry on result of the Unified National
Examinations and University Admission)

55
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,909
(Sang Wu Yan
is admitted into Psychology Course)

56
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,839
There's no suspense at all.

57
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:19,648
Psychology in Southeast University.

58
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,094
My parents' dream has come true.

59
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,663
Software engineering?
Do you plan to go into the IT industry?

60
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,728
I know nothing about the course.

61
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:31,300
It doesn't matter.

62
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,101
As long as I get enrolled
into a university.

63
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,784
Broadcast journalism?

64
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:45,748
Aren't you interested in finance?

65
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,615
I changed my mind in the end.

66
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,378
Great.

67
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,860
You're a lady of spine.

68
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:56,047
Good.

69
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,949
Nothing much had changed
after we got into the university.

70
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,205
I should put it this way.

71
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,241
I thought nothing much had changed.

72
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,610
In the first year,
both of them started a band.

73
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,775
Wei Hao has been obsessed with music.

74
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,299
Xu Qian has a good voice.

75
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,893
It's natural that
she became the vocalist.

76
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:21,739
I couldn't do much for them.

77
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,986
However, I was the one
who came out with the band name.

78
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,082
In Japanese, it's known as Momo.

79
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:29,674
It sounds so adorable.

80
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,037
What do you think?

81
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:32,370
I think it's okay.

82
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,799
Here comes the first vote.

83
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,291
You have my vote too.

84
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:37,588
We got two votes now.

85
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:39,706
Count me in.

86
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,014
Here comes the fourth vote.

87
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,429
All right.

88
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,179
Attention, members of Momo.

89
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,727
Let's continue practice after lunch.

90
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:52,190
Sure!

91
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:56,557
Thank you.

92
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,198
Have you washed it?

93
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:59,510
Cheers!

94
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,206
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
I took them as my best friends.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,372
I told them everything.

97
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,670
The three of us always
spent time together.

98
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,307
In the end, I couldn't even
fit in between them anymore.

99
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,239
Worst of all, I became
the obstacle between them...

100
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,513
without even knowing.

101
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,382
How strange.

102
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,249
It's quite childish.

103
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,555
Yes, I'm quite childish.

104
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,123
I was thinking that

105
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,663
if I showed them I've moved on
with a new relationship,

106
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,884
they would...

107
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:02,557
Sang Wu Yan.

108
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:04,653
Are you a bodhisattva?

109
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,190
I am.

110
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,783
Not only I'm a bodhisattva,
I'm glowing with the divine light.

111
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:16,245
Do you want my blessing?

112
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,117
Wipe your mouth.

113
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:25,402
You're so dirty.

114
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:30,109
It's such a nice handkerchief
but you use it to wipe your mouth?

115
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,415
What a waste.

116
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,320
Incoming call from Yu Xiao Lu.

117
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:46,870
Hello.

118
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,883
Nian Qin.

119
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:48,981
Where are you?

120
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,199
I've reached the entrance
of the welfare home.

121
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,219
Continue walking.

122
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,858
Turn right when you
reach the first junction.

123
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:55,874
Then, turn left.

124
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:57,509
You'll see a KFC Restaurant.

125
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:58,923
Wait for me at the entrance.

126
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,325
Are you done?

127
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:09,878
Let's go.

128
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:11,490
Sure.

129
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:28,203
Nian Qin.

130
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,125
Daddy.

131
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,585
See you at school.

132
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,137
Why did she call you Daddy?

133
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:38,990
Let's go home.

134
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:52,278
It's strange.

135
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:55,435
Nian Qin perceives the world...

136
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:58,946
through smell and sound.

137
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,389
Hence, he dislikes
places that are full of strong smells...

138
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,258
and noises.

139
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,718
However, he came out of that place
with a girl.

140
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:10,133
When I saw that,
I thought I saw the wrong guy.

141
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,140
I asked him but he's being him.

142
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,527
He didn't say anything.

143
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,919
He asked you who is Yi Jin?

144
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,353
He's not Yi Jin for sure.

145
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,778
Based on my observation,
if he's not Yi Jin,

146
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,452
he will deny it right away.

147
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:46,190
You talked as if
you know him really well.

148
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,976
What's wrong, young lady?

149
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,436
Are you in love?

150
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:51,547
Not to that extent.

151
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:54,988
After all,
I'm a lady who have seen the world.

152
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,598
I need to continue observing.

153
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,471
Forget it.

154
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,822
You've announced that he's your boyfriend.

155
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,358
I...

156
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,188
That's because...

157
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,229
That's because...

158
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:10,770
It's just a white lie
in front of Xu Qian.

159
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,063
It's merely acting.

160
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,489
Both of them hid
their relationship from me.

161
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:16,022
That annoys me.

162
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:18,528
However, I don't want them...

163
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:21,231
to miss out on each other because of me.

164
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,073
They knew each other because of me.

165
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:25,642
Su Nian Qin was there anyway.

166
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:29,973
So, I made good use of his presence.

167
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,014
If you ask me,

168
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,172
your subconscious was messing with you.

169
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,971
If that's not it,
what are you trying to observe?

170
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:43,642
Listen.

171
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,627
The same lady picked him up again.

172
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,680
I observed closely today.

173
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,950
They're so close with each other.

174
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:56,538
I think that lady is quite pretty.

175
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,936
When she talked,
she sounded really gentle.

176
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,354
She's quite friendly too.

177
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:01,941
She has a nice voice.

178
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:05,816
If I were a guy,
I would fall in love with her.

179
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,701
So,

180
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,730
if he's really Yi Jin,

181
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,283
we have mastered
a valuable piece of news.

182
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,378
The magical relationship
of the mysterious genius songwriter.

183
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,171
Isn't that attractive?

184
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,591
My goodness.

185
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,890
What on earth are you thinking?

186
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,975
I think it's a good idea.

187
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:28,846
It's really a good idea.

188
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,069
You're crazy.

189
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:32,001
-It will work.
-No way.

190
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,705
-I'm serious.
-No way.

191
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,750
Mr Li.

192
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,799
It's Xiao Wei's birthday this month?

193
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,371
Yes.

194
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,726
The school will prepare presents
for birthday celebrants of the month.

195
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,566
She'll receive the present too.

196
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,059
I wonder how
she is going to celebrate her birthday.

197
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:17,510
Mr Su.

198
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,036
Do you want
to celebrate Xiao Wei's birthday too?

199
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:27,284
It's on 12th. Are you available?

200
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:29,060
I'll go there after work.

201
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,447
I'm going to attend a concert.

202
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,392
You can't make it then.

203
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,127
Forget it.

204
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,512
It's okay.

205
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,228
I'll send her your regards.

206
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:31,554
Wu Yan.

207
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:32,954
Join the class.

208
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,708
Go into the class now.
The bell will ring soon.

209
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:35,856
Sure.

210
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:38,818
I forgot my glass.

211
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:40,647
It's okay, Mr Li.

212
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,303
Please proceed with the class.
I'll get you the glass.

213
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,433
Thank you.

214
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:44,515
Don't mention it.

215
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,293
My goodness!

216
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:01,517
Are you okay?

217
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,566
Are you hurt?

218
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,093
Don't move. Let me take a look.

219
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:07,788
Hold on.

220
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:11,748
(Staff Room)

221
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:24,396
(Don't try this at home
as it's merely to cater to the plot)

222
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:25,384
What is it?

223
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,739
It's aloe vera.

224
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:33,482
I'm sorry. It's an accident.

225
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:35,221
Please don't get mad.

226
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,156
Is it?

227
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,485
Yes, I swear.

228
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,174
I'm doomed.

229
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,079
It's a fatal mistake. Goodness.

230
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,171
These hands are born to play piano.

231
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,384
I didn't know aloe vera smells like this.

232
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,825
What happened?

233
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:02,473
I accidentally scalded myself
when I was getting water.

234
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,026
That's so careless of you.

235
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,255
I'll get you a bigger
thermos flask tomorrow.

236
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,024
Fill it up with hot water
and bring it with you.

237
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,576
Don't get water on your own.

238
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,181
I'm good.

239
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,624
Are you sure?

240
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:16,826
It looks so painful.

241
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:22,232
Xiao Lu.

242
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,179
Can you get me a pot of aloe vera?

243
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:28,838
Why do you suddenly...

244
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,283
Mr Su, how is your hand?

245
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:44,451
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,869
You've apologised before.

247
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:54,128
Have a candy.

248
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,261
I don't take sweet food.

249
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,596
I'll bring you something
savoury next time.

250
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:05,904
Wu Yan.

251
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,328
Aren't you looking for Xiao Wei?

252
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:08,403
Xiao Wei is here.

253
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,072
Okay, thank you.

254
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,229
Mr Wang.

255
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:15,975
Was she looking for Xiao Wei?

256
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:17,276
Yes.

257
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:19,209
She bought quite a lot
of food for Xiao Wei.

258
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,449
(Staff Room)

259
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:30,858
Xiao Wei.

260
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,658
Ms Sang.

261
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,666
Xiao Wei, I brought...

262
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:39,534
What's wrong, Ms Sang?

263
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,513
Are you on duty today?

264
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:49,397
When they're playing in the classroom,

265
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:51,842
they left the broom on the table.

266
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:54,133
It's Mr Su's class later.

267
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,827
Mr Su likes it tidy.

268
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,553
So, I need to clean up the table
before he's here...

269
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,487
so that he won't mess up his clothes.

270
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,629
Xiao Wei, do you like Mr Su?

271
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:09,245
Yes, Mr Su is gentle.

272
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:12,549
Is he?

273
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:24,241
Why?

274
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:26,145
Why did you stop me?

275
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,297
What they want
isn't a pack of candies from you...

276
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,042
or a box of cookies from someone else.

277
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:40,202
But this is a thing within my ability
that I could do for them.

278
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,852
It's precisely because this is
the only thing you can do.

279
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:45,426
Hence, it's better to not do anything.

280
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:48,017
You're being too sensitive.

281
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,505
I just want her to know that
even if she doesn't have parents,

282
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:55,439
there are many people
who sincerely love and care about her.

283
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,343
Sang Wu Yan.

284
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,567
Please keep the sympathy to yourself.

285
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:03,816
They don't need your special attention.

286
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,359
What they need is something else.

287
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,999
-You know nothing.
-I know nothing?

288
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,248
Who are you to say that?

289
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,167
I grew up in a welfare home too.

290
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:31,939
They're dumped by their parents.

291
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,796
They're sent here at different ages.

292
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:37,054
Some have been here since they're born.

293
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,864
In general, they were born with defects.

294
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:40,421
Sang Wu Yan.

295
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,678
Please keep the sympathy to yourself.

296
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:45,917
They don't need your special attention.

297
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:47,336
What they need is something else.

298
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,562
You know nothing.

299
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:52,277
I know nothing?

300
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:54,436
Who are you to say that?

301
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,107
I grew up in a welfare home too.

302
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,457
Happy birthday, Nian Qin.

303
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:27,885
I bought you
your favourite fruity candies.

304
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,973
I'm really sorry.

305
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:31,864
If it weren't for the financial crisis
that we're facing,

306
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,191
your dad would have never
sent you here temporarily.

307
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,945
Please give us some time, okay?

308
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,044
Okay.

309
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,518
I'm sorry, Nian Qin.

310
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,460
I have something to attend.

311
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,142
I need to go.

312
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:55,894
I'll pay you a visit a few days later.

313
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:09,515
Be good, Nian Qin.

314
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,232
I'll be here again in two days.

315
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,320
Nian Qin, don't forget
to practice your piano.

316
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:24,788
The next time I come,

317
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:27,390
I want you to play the song
that I taught you.

318
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:41,406
Hello, Mr Li.

319
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:47,745
Why did you buy so many tangerines, Mr Li?

320
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:49,254
They're teaching tools.

321
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,282
Teaching tools?

322
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,083
Come with me to the class
and you will know.

323
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,413
Wu Yan.

324
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,787
I'm going to the class first.

325
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:58,934
Please bring the tangerines later.

326
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:00,660
Check them too.
Some might have been crushed.

327
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,928
Sure.

328
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,215
Tangerine.

329
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,039
There are so many tangerines.

330
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:09,861
Mr Su, have a tangerine.

331
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,102
Don't be mad.

332
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:13,632
I've to go to the classroom now.

333
00:26:13,712 --> 00:26:14,686
Have it.

334
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,872
Students.

335
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:41,502
Today, we're going to learn about
"The Little Orange Lantern" by Bing Xin.

336
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,353
The article is one of her masterpieces.

337
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,130
The "me" in the article...

338
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,750
ran into a young girl
whose mother was terminally ill.

339
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:53,329
When they bid goodbye with each other,
she gave him a little orange lantern.

340
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:55,357
Today,

341
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:58,700
I've prepared tangerines for you.

342
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,804
Let's make a lantern with the tangerine.

343
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,729
Okay?

344
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,859
Okay.

345
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:07,093
Be patient, everyone.

346
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:10,979
The light from the lantern might be dim
but it represents the desire for light.

347
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,134
Be assured that this question
will come out in the examination.

348
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,830
So, promise me.

349
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:18,447
Memorise the answer
before you start eating the tangerine.

350
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:19,782
Okay?

351
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:21,867
Okay.

352
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:42,480
Mr Wu.

353
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,390
Has Mr Su left?

354
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:46,445
He's just left.

355
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:48,246
He applied for leave
to attend to something.

356
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:49,874
Thank you.

357
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,375
It's me.

358
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:00,289
It's okay, the rain is not heavy.

359
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:03,309
I'm free anyway.

360
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:04,915
I've nothing to do.

361
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,369
Let me keep you company.

362
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,047
Here, it's your handkerchief.

363
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:47,900
You can dry yourself off.

364
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,687
I didn't want to return it.

365
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,492

The simplest way to tell them apart
is to take a look at the edge of the leaf.

407
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:00,453
Feel it.

408
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,389
It's smooth.

409
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,173
Ilex's leaf is serrated.

410
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:16,961
Can you feel it?

411
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,686
Aloe vera has serrated leaves too.

412
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:21,133
Yes.

413
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:23,332
You're very perceptive.

414
00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:33,259
Your car is here.

415
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,545
Nian Qin.

416
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:41,677
Thank you.

417
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:15,353
Why are you holding a leaf?

418
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:17,964
Nothing.

419
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,900
(The tombstone of Li Mei Ting)

420
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:27,802
He's here to pay his mom a visit.

421
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,474
Somehow he wanted
to come here out of a sudden.

422
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,264
What?

423
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:39,017
Okay, I got it.

424
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,860
I'll find the right time
to persuade him to go home.

425
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,546
As you know, he's against it.

426
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:48,589
I have to go.

427
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:56,099
So, in the end,

428
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,869
you didn't talk about
what happened yesterday?

429
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:02,333
Yes.

430
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:03,268
No, wait.

431
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:07,009
Why does he sound
so emotionally unstable?

432
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:09,461
He's just like our objects of study.

433
00:35:09,904 --> 00:35:12,277
You dislike psychology
because you hate...

434
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:14,753
dealing with complicated people, right?

435
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,501
Why are you so patient to him now?

436
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:23,856
I'm... I don't know.

437
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:27,977
Every time I look at his back,

438
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,622
I feel like hugging him for no reason.

439
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:34,192
It just felt like doing this.

440
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:35,722
Like this.

441
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:38,295
Young lady, congratulations.

442
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:39,961
You're doomed.

443
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:42,391
Why?

444
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:45,241
You've fallen in love.

445
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:48,219
That's not right.

446
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:03,476
According to the triangular theory
of love by Sternberg,

447
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:06,487
love is formed of intimacy,
passion and commitment.

448
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:09,283
I haven't started
dragging him into the bottomless pit.

449
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:11,984
I'm just...

450
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:14,535
falling in love with him at first sight.

451
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:21,711
Mr Su, you're early today.

452
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,513
I forgot to bring the text book home.

453
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:25,193
I'm here early to prepare for the class.

454
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,223
Who drew on the mandarin?

455
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:34,444
It's so funny.

456
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,880
The expression looks exactly like you.

457
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:39,681
I have to go.

458
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:44,032
Mr Su.

459
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,830
Have a mandarin.

460
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,082
Don't be mad.

461
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,296
I have to go to the classroom now.

462
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:50,892
You should eat it.

463
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:28,845
Xiao Lu.

464
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,512
Did you see a mandarin here?

465
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:33,936
I ate it.

466
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,539
Why did you take it without permission?

467
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,111
Isn't it just a mandarin?

468
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,519
There are plenty of mandarins
in the fridge.

469
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,269
Do you want it? I can get one for you.

470
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:45,412
No.

471
00:37:47,276 --> 00:37:48,823
Where is the mandarin skin?

472
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,349
Forget it.
