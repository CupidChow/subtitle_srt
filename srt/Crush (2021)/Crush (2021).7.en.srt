00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,869
As for Xiao Wei,

4
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,510
based on my judgment,

5
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,560
she has the tendency
to have avoidant personality disorder.

6
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,800
In that case,

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,560
when she loses her parents,
or people around her...

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
who are close to her,

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,079
she won't react aggressively.

10
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,390
However,

11
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,080
children who seem to be obedient
and sensible...

12
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,230
usually don't express their true feelings.

13
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,670
Therefore,

14
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,480
when they go to a new environment,
building mental resilience is important.

15
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,560
Are you rest assured now?

16
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,360
I didn't know
that you're quite serious in studying.

17
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,160
That's because I have a good brain.

18
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,570
Actually, I have been holding back
from saying something.

19
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,770
At the Ferris wheel...

20
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,490
You're still owing me a question,
aren't you?

21
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,240
You finally have something to ask.
Ask away.

22
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
What is that question?

23
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you like me?

24
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,850
Yes.

25
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,160
Why do you like me?

26
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Well...

27
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,049
You're...

28
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,049
I...

29
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,000
Su Nian Qin.

30
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm such a fool!

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,880
-Nian Qin, you...
-Go now.

32
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,910
We've been together
for almost four years now.

33
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,320
You've been witnessing
my development in psychology.

34
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,000
Look.

35
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,350
No doubt I lack hands-on experience,

36
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,320
but I have a good memory.

37
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,790
However, I don't remember any theories...

38
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,159
that can explain Su Nian Qin
and his unstable emotions.

39
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,760
Here, tell me why.

40
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
He doesn't know the answer.
It's your turn.

41
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,880
If you ask me,

42
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,600
you can't blame him.

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,950
You failed to answer his question.

44
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,280
"Love at first sight".

45
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,910
It's such a short answer,
but you couldn't even say it.

46
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,120
No.

47
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,160
I...

48
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,720
At that moment,

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,790
I knew that it's not just love
at first sight.

50
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,760
It's also because...

51
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Why am I not an art student?

52
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Why is my ability to express the language
so terrible?

53
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
(Third Class of Year Three)

54
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,189
That's all for today.

55
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,220
Stand up.

56
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,470
Thank you, Mr Su!

57
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,630
Thank you, everyone.

58
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,540
It's my honour to have been your teacher.

59
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,350
Thank you.

60
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,310
(Third Class of Year Three
for students with visual impairment)

61
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,350
I was right.

62
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,380
You didn't bid them goodbye.

63
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,740
Thank you.

64
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,310
We are the ones who should thank you.

65
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,070
Perhaps we'll need your help again.

66
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,430
Sure.

67
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,660
Mr Su.

68
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,939
Mr Su.

69
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,870
Mr Su.

70
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,980
Will I see you again?

71
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,940
Sure.

72
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,660
I'll pay you a visit when I'm free.

73
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,870
This is a goodbye present.

74
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,590
I only have this.

75
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,590
This is...

76
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,260
I got the candy from Ms Sang.

77
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,540
She told me not to tell you.

78
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,590
Otherwise, you'll scold her again.

79
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,940
She lied.

80
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,630
What else did she tell you?

81
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,750
She also told me...

82
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,500
that you lied
about not fancying sweet food.

83
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,820
Every child loves sweet food.

84
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,380
Mr Su, I'm going to miss you.

85
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,630
Don't miss me.

86
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,750
Study well.

87
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,070
Wait for me to come back, okay?

88
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,790
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

89
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,380
It's all here.
We finally gathered enough materials.

90
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,030
Finally.

91
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,590
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

92
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,470
You look so pale.

93
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,940
I'm okay.

94
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,220
I stayed up two nights in a row
to work on my thesis.

95
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,910
You just have to tell me.

96
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,260
You didn't have to come here.

97
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm quite puzzled.

98
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,190
I can tell that working
at the news department...

99
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,750
is taking a toll on you.

100
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,420
I guess you don't really enjoy it either.

101
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,750
What do you still work on here?

102
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,820
I want to finish what I start.

103
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,870
I can't leave the job
just because I'm dejected.

104
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,790
I think disliking the job is one thing,

105
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,830
disliking working is another thing.

106
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,950
Look at me.

107
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,830
I don't like psychology,
but I still stick to it.

108
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,070
I think it's impressive...

109
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,790
to devote myself to something I hate.

110
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,100
All right.

111
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,580
Let's pack up and leave.

112
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,740
It's getting late.

113
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,270
It's so funny.

114
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,460
One time, I ran into someone in the lift.

115
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,060
The same thing happened.

116
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,150
I think there's a power outage.

117
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,070
Hello.

118
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,700
We're trapped in the lift.

119
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,110
I think we're at level six.

120
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,670
Okay.

121
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,070
Okay.

122
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,620
The management is getting it fixed.
They told us to be patient.

123
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,780
Fortunately, I'm trapped here with you.

124
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,190
If I were with Cheng Yin now,

125
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,700
I would be freaked out.

126
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,870
She has claustrophobia.

127
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,990
I've never seen her use a lift.

128
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,780
Goodness.

129
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,380
You have a one-track mind,
just like Wei Hao.

130
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,380
Do I really have to make everything clear
so that you can be normal?

131
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,110
I thought things would go back to normal
after we spent two days together.

132
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,830
Fine, I admit it.

133
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,780
Things were brought to a deadlock
due to my fault.

134
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,950
However, as a human being,

135
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,710
it's normal to be block-headed.

136
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,510
Wei Hao was my childhood friend.

137
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,070
He's been following me around
ever since we were young.

138
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,900
He fell in love with you all of a sudden.

139
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,830
I need some time to get used to it.

140
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,580
And worse,
both of you didn't tell me the truth.

141
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,740
You especially.

142
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,190
I'm so mad at you.

143
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,190
I got so much madder at you than him.

144
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,780
I don't mind losing
that useless childhood friend.

145
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,950
However, you're my best friend.

146
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,940
How could you do that to me?

147
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,540
Wu Yan, Wei Hao and I...

148
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,830
Enough.

149
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,790
We've resolved the misunderstanding.

150
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,340
He told me you left the band.

151
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,710
You also had a row with him.

152
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,350
If it's because of me,
it's not necessary at all.

153
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,590
What happened after
was not because of you.

154
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,020
My mum is back.

155
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,230
She came to see me.

156
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,110
She...

157
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,430
I bet she was dumped
by her boyfriend again.

158
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,710
Don't worry.

159
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,230
I won't tell anyone about it.

160
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,300
Anyway,

161
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,580
I have so much to worry about.

162
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,180
I don't have that time for her.

163
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,820
How about Wei Hao? What do you plan to do?

164
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,110
I'm going to do nothing.

165
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,060
Just let it be.

166
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,230
We'll listen to the song next time.

167
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,630
Good morning, Mr Qiu. Hello, Mr Wu.

168
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,550
Morning.

169
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,100
Mr Li.

170
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,020
Wu Yan.

171
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,340
Have you done dealing
with your school affair?

172
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,470
I've submitted the draft for my thesis.

173
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,300
Mr Li, what happened to Mr Su's desk?

174
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,070
Ms Zheng is back.

175
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,790
It's natural that Mr Su has to leave.

176
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,870
When did that happen?

177
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,980
It happened over the past two days
when you were on leave.

178
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,150
You've missed your chance.

179
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,180
You didn't get to bid him goodbye
before he left.

180
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,870
Sorry.

181
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,100
The number you've dialled is unavailable.

182
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,910
Please try again later.

183
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,430
Ms Sang.

184
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,910
Is Mr Su not coming?

185
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:05,270
Xiao Wei, maybe Mr Su is not good
at saying goodbyes.

186
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,150
That's why he decided not to come.

187
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,190
Please understand his feelings, okay?

188
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,190
I'm here for you.

189
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,540
I'll pay you a visit
with Mr Su in the future, okay?

190
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,510
Sure.

191
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,390
He promised to pay me a visit too.

192
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,940
Don't forget it.

193
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,950
Sure.

194
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,150
Here, let's make a pinky promise.

195
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,820
Let's go.

196
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,630
Please take care of her.

197
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,550
Thank you.

198
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,510
Thank you, Ms Sang.

199
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,430
Don't mention it.

200
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,140
Xiao Wei.

201
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,350
Nian Qin, what's wrong?

202
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,910
Why didn't you answer the phone call?
My sister said that she called you.

203
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,230
That's why I switched off the phone.

204
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,740
Nian Qin, you should go home.

205
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,950
Sure.

206
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,540
Do whatever you want.

207
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,420
I've made arrangements, for meals
and laundry services.

208
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,420
During this period,

209
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,260
there's no need for you
to leave the house.

210
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,260
I'm leaving. Take care.

211
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,870
Where are you going?

212
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,790
I'm going on a break.

213
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,350
Have a good one.

214
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,540
To be honest,

215
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,900
it's very wise for you
to ignore that lady.

216
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,550
Don't ruin the girl
with your odd temperament.

217
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,950
If you ask me,

218
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,020
I would suggest for you to seek help
from your former boss...

219
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,190
to look for him.

220
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,620
Don't you forget that he's Yi Jin.

221
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,070
I've asked him.

222
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,620
I didn't get any feedback.

223
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,280
(Mum)

224
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
What's wrong?

225
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,550
What's wrong?

226
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,790
How dare you ask me that question?

227
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,460
It's been so many days
since you last answered my phone call.

228
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,510
You only sent me
a few brief text messages on WeChat.

229
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,590
Are you busy?

230
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,150
I don't get it.

231
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,390
Why are you so occupied?

232
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,590
Mr Zhao told me that you haven't
even submitted your thesis.

233
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,420
Goodness, Zhao is calling me out again.

234
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
You have the cheeks to blame him.

235
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,340
Listen.

236
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,060
You'd better come home right away
when the semester break starts.

237
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,630
We'll get someone to guide you
on the postgraduate entrance examination.

238
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,180
If you're unable to register this year,
you'll sit for the examination next year.

239
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,990
I can't let you fool around.

240
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,630
Did I hear that correctly?

241
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,390
Sit for the examination next year?

242
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,980
Didn't I say that I want to work?

243
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,940
I've started working at the radio station.

244
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,460
Furthermore,
I plan to continue working there.

245
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,980
Don't tell me about the radio station.

246
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,830
No one listens to radio stations nowadays.

247
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,950
Not even your dad listens to the radio.

248
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:19,870
Working at a radio station...

249
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,299
is not as good as being a professor
in a university.

250
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,100
Not only are the benefits better,

251
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,310
you'll be respected too.

252
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,700
Everyone wants the position so badly.

253
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,670
I'm the exception.

254
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,340
You're talking about success in life
based on a conventional belief.

255
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,580
I don't feel like talking with you.

256
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,270
I'll have to work during
the semester break before I can go home.

257
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,500
We'll talk about it when I'm home.

258
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,480
(Mum)

259
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,020
Hello?

260
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,300
You don't have to worry about money.

261
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,550
Just take care of her.

262
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,260
Got it. I'll go home early.

263
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,310
If there's nothing else, I have to go.

264
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,910
Thank you.

265
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,100
I just passed by and saw you by chance.

266
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,100
Are you here for an interview?

267
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,430
I've missed out
on the peak recruiting season.

268
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,460
It's difficult to secure a good job.

269
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,670
Aren't you working
at the radio station with Wu Yan?

270
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,950
Don't you want to work there?

271
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,030
Radio station...

272
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,910
It's not up to me.

273
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,340
I need to have a spare plan.

274
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,580
By the way, don't tell Wu Yan
that I came for an interview.

275
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,910
Students.

276
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,100
As we know,

277
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,670
the Chinese Braille
is made of consonants and basic finals.

278
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,100
Each syllable is written
with up to three Braille cells.

279
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,640
A phrase
is formed by two to three syllables.

280

♫I want to see♫

281
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,280

and get me a pack of candy?

333
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,910
♫But you're still beyond the reach♫

334
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,360
That lady gave it to you, didn't she?

335
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,510
♫I just can feel♫

336
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,200
In that case,
why don't you go and see her?

337
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,980
♫Your heartbeat and breath♫

338
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,200
Didn't you say that...

339
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,010
♫Your worries and happiness♫

340
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,150
it's a wise decision?

341
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,550
♫Do you know that I want to see?♫

342
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,680
Nian Qin.

343
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,600
♫All the possibilities♫

344
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,580
♫Make me believe♫

345
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,290
♫You're the only one♫

346
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,320
♫Yes, I believe♫

347
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,150
So,

348
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,340
she naively brandished the four thorns...

349
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,430
and said,

350
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,190
"Stop dilly-dallying."

351
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,620
"You're so annoying."

352
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,150
"Since you've decided
to leave this place,"

353
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,670
"you should leave now."

354
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,860
She didn't want the Little Prince
to see her crying.

355
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,550
She is such a proud flower.

356
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,260
Why did she do that?

357
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,260
That's very odd.

358
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,580
Yes.

359
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,790
She can't be weirder.

360
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,960
(The Little Prince)

361
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,980
He's not answering my calls again.
Fine.

362
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,510
I'm not going to entertain you anymore.

363
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,390
When I become sober,

364
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,670
I will be my old strong self again.
Am I right?

365
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,340
My dear, can we go home after a drink?

366
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,190
I need to catch a train tomorrow.

367
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,550
What did you see?

368
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,980
Xu Qian is at the entrance.

369
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,180
Didn't you see her?

370
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,580
Your eyesight is terrible.

371
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,670
What are you doing?

372
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm inviting people to come over.

373
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,200
(Me: Wei Hao, come over now!)

374
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,640
(Me: At the bar street)

375
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,620
What drinks would you like?

376
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,180
Give me the strongest drink.

377
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,670
Okay, orange juice it is. How about you?

378
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,790
What do you want?

379
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,510
It's been a while since we drank together.

380
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,790
I'll get you anything that is available.

381
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,310
I started the one-sided love.

382
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,980
I started it alone.

383
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,430
I made up the story alone.

384
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,790
I experienced happiness and sorrow alone.

385
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,950
Now, I'm going to end it alone.

386
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,580
You won't even sing me a song.

387
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,860
It's a long story.

388
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,910
Pretty lady, please do her a favour.
Please sing for her.

389
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,980
Just one song.

390

It's okay if you turn me down.

410
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,500
I mean it.

411
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,580
It's really okay.

412
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,100
After all,

413
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,830
you always say no to everything.

414
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,220
However, I can't find you anywhere.

415
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,670
I can't find you anywhere.

416
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,030
It's as if you've completely vanished...

417
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,740
from the world.

418
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,340
Sometimes, I wonder...

419
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,950
if that period...

420
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,740
is merely my own imagination.

421
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,190
You're a nutcase.

422
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,030
You turned me into a nutcase too.

423
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,340
Just pretend that he's dead.

424
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,830
You're finally awake.

425
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,700
I need to leave for the train now.

426
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,070
Clean up the place before you leave.

427
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,340
Where is Wu Yan?

428
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,430
She went out early in the morning.

429
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,980
Fan girls are always the craziest.

430
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,260
Did anyone else come to visit you?

431
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,910
This one time, Aunt's mum came here.

432
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,150
She brought lots of snacks.

433
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,510
You're such a foodie.

434
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,550
It seems that everyone loves you.

435
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,860
Ms Sang.

436
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,340
Why didn't you come together with Mr Su?

437
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,790
He paid me a visit yesterday.

438
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,550
He also bought me
the same kind of candy you gave me.

439
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,820
Hold on.

440
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,100
Did you just say Mr Su paid you a visit?

441
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,100
Did he say anything?

442
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,390
He asked about how I've been.

443
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,980
He also asked about my studies.

444
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,340
He also reminded me
not to tell you that he came to see me.

445
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,620
Then, why did you tell me?

446
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,870
Just pretend that I didn't say anything.

447
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,860
Xiao Wei!

448
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,380
You're becoming more and more like him.

449
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,220
Today, a listener wrote in
to complain that she's sick...

450
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,940
of arguing with her group members
during group work.

451
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
It makes her tired.

452
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,100
In the beginning,
she thought that she's not articulate.

453
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,380
Soon, she realised the toughest part...

454
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,710
was not speaking out her mind.

455
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,940
But no matter how hard she tried,

456
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,230
the other party
just wouldn't listen to her.

457
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,770
I guess many people can relate to that.

458
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,050
That's why I love conducting broadcasts.

459
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,960
I have a selfish thought,

460
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,020
and that is whatever I said
in the broadcast,

461
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,140
I bet there is at least one listener
who listens attentively to me.

462
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,700
Does such a listener exist?

463
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,690
All right.

464
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,040
I dedicate the following therapeutic song
to all of you.

465
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,190
I look forward
to receiving more letters from you.

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,820
Open your eyes and look around.

494
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,149
We put in so much effort
to produce a news story.

495
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:50,300
But we get less listeners
than followers of a public WeChat account.

496
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,630
We're going to graduate soon.

497
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,270
It's time to face reality.

498
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,380
Wu Yan, you need to be realistic.

499
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,950
Because of you,
I fell in love with broadcasting.

500
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,740
When you said
that you wanted to be an anchorwoman...

501
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,300
to anchor a news program,

502
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,780
I thought that you were really cool.

503
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,780
To be honest, I'm really envious of you.

504
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,340
As you know,

505
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,500
my parents have mapped out a plan for me
when I was a kid.

506
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,190
I thought it was fine.

507
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,870
That's because I didn't have
any ambitions back then.

508
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,950
However, now,

509
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,580
I want to be an anchorwoman,
and it's no longer because of you.

510
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,910
It's for myself.

511
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,750
Why do I have a feeling
that I was betrayed by my own comrade?

512
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,340
Anyway, thank you.

513
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,100
I found my ambition because of you.

514
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,630
Wu Yan...

515
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,750
Enough, stop talking.

516
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,830
I received a letter today.

517
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,110
Someone threatened me to read her letter.

518
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,150
This lady claims that she needs
to answer an important question.

519
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,430
The first line of the letter is,

520
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,240
"Let me tell you why I like you."

521
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,100
She's so impulsive, isn't she?

522
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,570
No doubt
there's nothing special about you.

523
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,430
-Besides being good-looking...
-Besides being good-looking and talented,

524
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,020
you're completely different
from my dream guy.

525
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,820
However, whenever I think of you,

526
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,750
I can't help imagining...

527
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,540
what I look for in a guy.

528
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,430
You're always gentle to children,

529
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,470
but you're very fierce to me.

530
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,380
You never fail to perceive the feelings
that no one else could perceive.

531
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,430
You deliberately ignored my feelings,

532
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,540
but you're actually very gentle
and sensitive.

533
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,950
However, when you're in pain,

534
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,580
you just silently put up with it.

535
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,380
I think because of that,

536
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,500
you think
that I would have the same tolerance...

537
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,100
when you left me.

538
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,390
Just because
I couldn't answer the question,

539
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,470
you just disappeared suddenly.

540
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,270
You're just a jerk!

541
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,910
I still can't answer the question,

542
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,020
but I want you to scold me
when you hear this.

543
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,560
Searching contacts.

544
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,920
All contacts.

545
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Sang Wu Yan.

546
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,230
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

547
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,470
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

548
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,150
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

549
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,910
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

550
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,940
Hello.

551
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
Say something.

552
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,190
Sang Wu Yan, say something!

553
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,340
How do you know it's me?

554
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,910
Where do you live?

555
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,060
You don't have to come.

556
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,820
I just want to talk.

557
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,400
Give me your address. Now.

558
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,470
(Su Nian Qin)

559
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,470
Sang Wu Yan!

560
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,540
Open the door, Sang Wu Yan!

561
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,950
Sang Wu Yan! Wake up!

562
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,510
Wake up! Sang Wu Yan!

563
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,190
Sang Wu Yan!

564
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,920
Open the door, Sang Wu Yan!

565
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,150
Sang Wu Yan!

566
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,710
I'm coming.

567
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,620
Sang Wu Yan!
