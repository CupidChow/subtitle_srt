Xiao Wei.

5
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,329
What's wrong?

6
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,850
In the coming performance,

7
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,830
I'm going to perform on the stage too.

8
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,440
I'll sing a song.

9
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,690
Please help me with the practice.

10
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,110
Me?

11
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,190
Why didn't you approach Mr Su?

12
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,720
He's a pro in singing.

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
I don't want to trouble him.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,740
I'm too shy to approach him.

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,210
I see.

16
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,800
Actually, don't worry about troubling him.

17
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,850
If you approach him,
he'll help you for sure.

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,329
It's recess. Time to play.

19
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,300
Those boys are so annoying.

20
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,920
But you like Mr Su, right?

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Of course.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,740
Mr Su is different from them.

23
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,180
Even a 10-year-old girl
can tell men and boys apart.

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,590
Xiao Wei, do you want Mr Su
to help you with the practice?

25
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,750
Yes.

26
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,670
However, Mr Su has left.

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,310
Tomorrow's the weekend.

28
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,390
It's simple.

29
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,900
I'll give him a call.

30
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,470
I don't know what I should say.

31
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,160
What you just told me is good enough.
Don't be nervous.

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,050
Just tell Mr Su what you just told me.

33
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,640
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

34
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Hello.

35
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,440
Xiao Wei. Xiao Wei.

36
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,690
Mr Su.

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,640
I'll be performing in the performance
mentioned by Mr Li.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll sing a song.

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,540
Please help me with the practice.

40
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,690
Sure,
I'll go to the welfare home tomorrow.

43

It's me.

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
All right.

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,560
Let's start now.

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,840
Mr Su, should we arrange the formation?

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,400
I can help.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,560
It's okay.

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,360
Let's start from singing practice.

50
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,320
Xiao Wei, start singing.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,220
I'm so envious of those who can sing well.

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,270
Stop.

57
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,370
Stop.

58
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,560
How about this?

59
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,740
Sing one by one.

60
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,810

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,900
You need to sing in tune.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
Please practice more, okay?

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,570

You didn't bring an umbrella.

83

Let's wait together.

84
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,370
It's okay, I'm good.

from the convenience store.

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,850
I'll leave after we get the umbrella.

Sorry to trouble you.

89
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,620
It's not troubling at all.

90
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,470
My umbrella is smaller.

91
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,740
You have to stand closer.
Don't get yourself wet.

92

93
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,040
It's time to turn left.

94
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,520

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440

For some odd reason,
it's been raining non-stop this year.

99
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,570
I got you a black umbrella.

100
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,220
Okay.

101
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
It's done.

102
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,330
That will be 35 yuan.

103
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,260
Hello, this is the change.

104
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,470
Do you need a towel, or napkins?

105
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,200
It's okay. I'm good.

106
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,150
You must be too busy
to take care of your friend.

107
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,820
Look at you, you're drenched.

108

No.

109

Where can I get towels?

113
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,180
It's just beside the umbrella.

114
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,530
Thank you.

115
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,650
Go get the towel.

171
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,100
She injured her eyes in the accident.

172
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,630
Afterwards,
she was sent to the welfare home.

173
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,950
Though she's lost her parents,

174
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,790
the warmth from the society...

175
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,980
has made her happy again.

176
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,150
Xiao Wei is currently in Year Three.

177
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,830
She's received lots of attention
and love from her teachers.

178
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,990
Look.

179
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,690
Her class teachers are over there.

180
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,950
Well...

181
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,240
Why are they aiming their cameras at us?

182
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,750
Just ignore them.

183
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,160
How do I ignore them?

184
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,980
Just look to the front.

185
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,300
Keep your eyes straight.

186
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,810
Think about the time you torture me.

187
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,440
When did I torture you?

188
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,520
(A warm welcome to Caring Enterprise)

189
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,270
Xiao Wei, you must be exhausted.

190
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,400
You did a great job.

191
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
You performed sign language
and singing at once.

192
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,000
Did you know?

193
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,960
Mr Su was clapping for you all the time.

194
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,370
Thank you.

195
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,190
Where is Mr Su?

196
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,610
Has he left?

197
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,780
Xiao Wei, we need to go now.

198
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,570
Wu Yan, you may leave now.

199
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,760
It's been a long day. Go some rest.

200
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,220
Sure.

201
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,040
Xiao Wei, see you tomorrow.

202
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,860
See you tomorrow, Ms Sang.

203
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,750
Get some rest.

204
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,480
It's Yi Jin's song.

205
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,440
However, I really have the urge
to hug the person in front of me.

206
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,830
However, when he left quietly,

207
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,980
he made me think
that he has an odd temperament.

208
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,450
He doesn't usually express his thoughts,

209
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,240
but he's always the gentle guy,
Su Nian Qin.

210
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,460
It's me.

211
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,290
I know.

212
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,540
You're right.

213
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,120
I'm too naive.

214
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,980
I...

215
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,240
I can't take on the responsibility for
the consequences that Xiao Wei may face.

216
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,220
Just like today.

217
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,190
I thought it would be a cheerful event.

218
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,800
However, it turned out this way.

219
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,590
Yet, I had no idea...

220
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,020
what to do about it.

221
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,360
When I was young,

222
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,640
I had to perform like this too.

223
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,120
Those people sincerely think
that they're doing charity.

224
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,080
Of course,

225
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,120
I don't deny that.

226
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,800
But they have no idea
what the kids really need.

227
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,850
It's not that they have no idea.

228
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,150
It's more like they didn't bother
to find out.

229
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,560
In front of the kids,
they repeatedly mention defects,

230
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,030
abandonment and orphans.

231
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,000
They keep reminding the kids...

232
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,934
and keep making them think
that they're inferior to others.

233
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,680
However,

234
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,320
the disabled are merely those
with physical defects.

235
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,030
They're different from other people.

236
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,199
We don't want to be sympathised.

237
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,660
We ask for equality.

238
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,590
Then...

239
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,390
Then, you...

240
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,669
It's okay. It's over now.

241
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,560
Are you back yet?

242
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,460
You said you'd let me clean up
the interview draft tonight.

243
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,880
I'll give to you when I'm back.

244
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,500
Huh? Where are you right now?

245
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm still at the museum.

246
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,260
It's too remote. I can't get a ride.

247
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,260
Send me your location.
I'll get a ride for you.

248
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,000
(Xu Qian: Contemporary Music Museum)

249
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,700
Hurry. Xu Qian is stuck in a remote place.

250
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,620
Go get her.

251
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,040
(Wei Hao: OK)

252
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,400

Thank you.

254
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,500
Thank you.

255
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,620
It's okay.

256
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,960
It's Wu Yan.

257
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,740
Of course it's her. Isn't it obvious?

258
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,680
Well...

259
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,240
I won't force you
to come back to the band anymore.

260
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,310
But can we still be friends?

261
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,590
Don't feel pressured. I'm not...

262
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,640
Sure, let's be friends again.

264
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,640
Hello, what's wrong?

265
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,590
Stay still. I'll come now.

266
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,780
Stop following me.
I can go back to the hostel on my own.

267
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,930
Qian Qian.

268
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,460
Why are you here?

269
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,510
I couldn't find you.

270
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,130
I had no choice but to come here.

271
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,980
Why did you come home so late?

272
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,070
I'm too busy.

273
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,530
What's wrong?

274
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,930
Aren't you in Guangzhou?

275
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,850
Were you dumped by that man?

276
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,160
Don't be mean.

277
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,520
We separated on good terms.

00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,220
You...

280
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,790
Do you have money?

281
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,440
(Transferred to Mum)

282
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,200
Five hundred yuan is all I have.

283
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,680
You should at least go home
and pay grandma a visit.

284
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,830
Thank you, love.

285
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,740
Nian Qin, you told me
to investigate that family,

286
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,830
and I did.

287
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,930
It's just an ordinary family.

288
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,760
The husband is a doctor,

289
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
while the wife is working
as an administrator in a company.

290
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,700
Nothing special.

291
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,380
However, due to the wife's health issue,

292
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,880
they don't have any children.

293
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,880
Did they commit any crime...

294
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,050
or something bad before?

295
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,460
What do you mean?

296
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,160
They're about to adopt Xiao Wei.

297
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,660
Nian Qin, you're taking it too seriously.

298
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,040
You really care about that young girl.

299
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,670
Are you...?

300
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,590
Enough.

301
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,590
Thank you for the help, Xiao Lu.

302
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,290
I should be the one who attends to it.

303
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,180
However, with your company,

304
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,720
I think she'll be more at ease.

305
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,740
Don't worry, Madam Zhang.

306
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,490
We'll keep her company.

307
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,950
When everything is over,
we'll send her back.

308
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,850
Okay, thanks for the help.

309
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,120
Have a safe journey.

311
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,000
We have to go now.

312
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,380
Let's go.

313
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,650
Xiao Wei, were you cold on your way here?

314
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,530
How do you like warm milk?

315
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,010
She's afraid of strangers.

316
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,580
Let's order some food.

317
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,680
Sure.

318
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,420
Excuse me.

319
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,460
Xiao Wei.

320
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,840
Is there anything you want?

321
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,350
How do you like strawberry juice?

322
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,940
Or...

323
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,180
do you want some bread?

324
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,100
How about cake?

325
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,750
Do you want to listen to the radio?

326
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,230
Can you please switch to FM82.4 for me?

327
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,040
I think they're playing
"Xiao Man's After Work Music."

328
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,540
What's wrong?

329
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,820
I'm surprised
that you listen to the radio too.

330
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,960
Moreover, it's a mainstream channel.

331
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,530
Or what?

332
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,200
Is it better to listen to your show?

333
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,960
How do you...?

334
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,700
Do you remember my voice?

335
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,890
That's the only time
I hosted a radio show.

336
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,230
I didn't know that my voice is so special.

00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,490
♫A faint and tipsy scent
Of aroma of coffee♫

339
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,710
Why do you enjoy listening to the radio?

340
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,590
I don't have to watch it.

341
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,670
♫Suddenly you're by my side again♫

342
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,240
♫Smiling as bright as the stars♫

♫Turning to the next page
Of the storybook♫

344
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,981
Do you know
why I love listening to the radio?

345
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,540
It's because I hate the sunset.

346
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,990
I hate seeing the sun go down bit by bit.

347
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,330
Then, one day is gone.

348
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,080
What's worse orse,
I haven't completed my tasks.

349
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,190
I choose to close my eyes,
put on headphones and listen to the radio.

350
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,121
♫You smiled without replying♫

351
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:33,020
When I opened my eyes again,
the sky has turned dark.

352
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
♫Telling me not to be silly♫

353
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,410
It's yet another endless night, for me
to waste my time.

354
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,160
♫Oh, clear skies outside the window♫

355
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,130
♫Oh, yeah♫

356
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,081
What a fool.

357
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:48,371
♫I want to hug you from the back
And never let go of you♫

358
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,520
Did you just smile?

359
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,090
♫Why do beautiful things
Always make people sad?♫

360
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,040
No, I didn't.

361
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,180
♫I'm afraid of you leaving♫

362
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,610
I swear I saw your smile.

363
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,790
My eyesight is perfect.

364
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,930
♫Ha, yeah♫

365
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,140
♫I thought I would see tomorrow's sun♫

366
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,280
♫Oh♫

367
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,460
♫The warm sunlight idly crawls
Into the window♫

368
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,960
So do you want to ride on the Ferris wheel
with me and Xiao Wei in two days?

369
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,970
♫A faint and tipsy scent
Of the aroma of coffee♫

370
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,920
No.

371
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,840
I bet you'll come.

372
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,770
♫Suddenly, you're by my side again♫

373
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,560
-You...
-Be careful.

374
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,900
We're very close to each other now.

375
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,380
♫Turning to the next page
Of the storybook♫

376
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,760
♫You said the wind will dry the tears
Shed by the clouds♫

377
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,680
♫I asked you
How to console the sighing wind then♫

378
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,180
♫You smiled without replying♫

♫Oh, yeah♫

382
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,820
♫Perhaps the wind will blow dry
The cloud's tear when she cries♫

383
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,540
I'm back.

384
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,470
You're back.

385
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,370
It seems that you've thought it through...

386
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,300
and decided
to get a master's degree with me.

387
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,240
How is that possible?

388
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,060
Didn't I tell you before?
I'm not getting a master's degree.

389
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,350
What are you doing then?

390
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm using science to attract a guy.

391
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,470
I aspire to be
a technical heart stealing thief.

392
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,750
What are you doing?
You're smiling like an idiot.

393
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,300
Su Nian Qin said, "No."

394
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,470
What does that mean?

395
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,330
You've studied psychology
for so many years now...

396
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,990
and you use the knowledge on this?

397
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,900
Yes, I've studied psychology
for so many years now.

398
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,180
After a careful analysis,

399
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,850
I obtained the mighty victory
as my bravery overcame my self-knowledge.

400
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,560
He has a personality disorder,
but I have the knowledge.

401
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,870
You're really something.

402
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,960
However, I have a question.

403
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,780
Why are you referring...

404
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,630
to abnormal psychology?

405
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,280
Well...

406
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,320
What's on your mind?

407
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,730
Nothing.

408
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,330
Are you not joining them tomorrow?

409
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,390
Aren't you fond of the young girl?

410
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,070
I'm not.

411
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,680
You told me to investigate
the background of the adoptive family.

412
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,830
I guess you like her.

413
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,180
That's why you're concerned about her.

414
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,920
Did I understand it wrongly?

415
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,000
No, I'm not going.

416
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,750
That place is surely crowded.

417
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,870
Moreover, it's not fun.

418
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,160
You've never ridden on a Ferris wheel.
How do you know that it's not fun?

419
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,460
Just join them.

420
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,780
You've never gone on a date.

421
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,110
It's quite rare.

422
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,840
I said I don't want to go.

423
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,770
Fine.

424
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,940
(Ticket booth)

425
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
Xiao Wei.

426
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,060
When we're in the park,

427
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,490
you have to hold on to me all the time.

428
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,370
If we get separated,

429
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,700
just stand still and shout my name, okay?

430
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,700
Got it.

431
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,680
Good girl.

432
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,780
You're always careless.

433
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,590
You might not be able
to take care of her. That's why...

434
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,280
Sure. I'm always careless.

435
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,090
Do you want to go inside?

436
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,010
If you go inside, I can be your guide.

437
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,680
The park is crowded.

438
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,490
Let's go.

439
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,920
Let's go!

440
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,560
Let's get the pink one.

441
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,220
Show me.

442
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,390
You look super adorable.

443
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,940
Su Nian Qin, lower your head.

444
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,870
What did you call me?

445
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,560
What is this?

446
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,990
It's just Mickey's ears.

447
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,630
What is a Mickey?

448
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,750
Su Nian Qin, you really have no childhood.

449
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,130
You...

450
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,160
Xiao Wei, look.

451
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,300
Do you think Mr Su
looks extra handsome now?

452
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,440
What's so handsome about me?
Xiao Wei, aren't you...?

453
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,610
Let's take a ride on the Ferris wheel.
We will have to queue up for a long time.

454
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,010
Let's go.

455
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,110
This is so foolish.

456
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,350
The rain falls on the eaves
and the swallows return.

457
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,730
Ms Sang, what are you saying?

458
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,650
Me?

459
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,680
I'm reciting...

460
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,470
the lyrics written by my idol.

461
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,390
Idol?

462
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,080
Who is your idol?

463
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,920
My idol is...

464
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,840
He's a talented songwriter.

465
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,260

480

Isn't it...

481
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,230
usually initiated by men?

482
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,630
What's wrong, Ms Sang?

483
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,490
Nothing.

484
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,110
I think it's gone too high.

485
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,960
How did you know?

486
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,580
Ms Sang.

487
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,110
Did I ever say that I'm blind?

488
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,800
I'm not completely blind.

489
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,110
I can detect movements within three feet.

490
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,840
Now I know that...

491
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,710
you're a fan who goes overboard
when you see your idol.

492
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,250
I'm not.

493
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,730
I don't see you as Yi Jin.

494
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,200
To you...

495
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,400
Don't talk too much
in front of the young kid.

496
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:43,190
Did anything good happen?

497
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,319
Nothing.

498
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,560
Did you have fun with the girl?

499
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,190
What could be so fun about it?

500
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,360
How come you made a mistake?

501
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,190
Did I?

502
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,980
You made a mistake.
Didn't you notice that?

503
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,990
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

504
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,290
Music is meant to express one's feelings.

505
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,470
There is no right or wrong.

506
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,470
It's fine as long as one gets
to express his feelings, isn't it?

507
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,770
Hello, it's me.

508
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,180
Listen.

509
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,470
I think we need to get Nian Qin a doctor.

510
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,460
Go to hell!

511
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,840
Why are you so irritated?

512
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,470
You look as if you have
the early warning signs of mania.

513
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,940
Do you need a check up at the hospital?

514
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,500
Why should I go to the hospital?

515
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,330
He's the one who needs treatment.

516
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,810
I'm so angry! He did it on purpose.

517
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,810
Otherwise, why did he voice it out
only when I got so close to him?

518
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,810
It's to make you think
that you've succeeded...

519
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,260
and to see you embarrass yourself.

520
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,810
He's so cunning!

521
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,460
Cunning!

522
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,190
How cunning.

523
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,770
That's not right.

524
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,710
In that case...

525
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,050
Thank you. I can do it.

526
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,950
Is he really blind?

527
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,640
Excuse me, are you Yi Jin?

528
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,940
-You...
-Be careful.

529
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,980
We're so close to each other.

530
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,670
So, he could see all this while.

531
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
You've been embarrassing yourself
all this time.

532
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,400
It doesn't matter now.

533
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,330
Why did you say that?

534
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,660
What is so embarrassing
about flirting with him?

535
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,120
I have the courage to own up to it.

536
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,530
The main point is...

537
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,290
What happened?

538
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,370
As you didn't lose your first kiss...

539
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,470
-So...
-Says who?

540
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,470
When did that happen?

541
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,990
Why didn't I know?

542
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,360
She's odd.

543
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,980
Mr Su.

544
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,600
It's like this.

545
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,760
Next week,
Ms Zheng will be back to school.

546
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,320
For some reason,

547
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
she decided
to end her maternity leave early.

548
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,710
Therefore...

549
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,150
Therefore, thank you for your hard work.

550
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,190
Okay, I got it.

551
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,670
Thank you so much...

552
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,290
for replacing her.

553
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,910
All the students really like you.

554
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,470
Don't mention it.

555
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,950
Mr Li.

556
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,760
Ms Sang...

557
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,090
Is she here yet?

558
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,940
Wu Yan?

559
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,940
She's on leave today.

560
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,761
She said something happened
at the radio station.

561
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,981
What's wrong? Are you looking for her?

562
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,880
Nothing.

563
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,840
I'll get going then.

564
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,720
I'm curious.
(Engineering Office)

565
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,180
Both of you are in charge of the news.

566
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,600
Sang Wu Yan.

567
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,780
Why weren't you involved in it?

568
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,400
Xu Qian interviewed pedestrians.

569
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,380
-Did you know that?
-I...

570
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,730
It's not something serious.

571
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,360
I think it's fine without that paragraph.

572
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,050
Even though you put in a lot of effort
preparing for it,

573
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,660
the audience will forget
as soon as it's over.

574
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,870
-Can you hear yourself?
-How could you say that?

575
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,790
I...

576
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,060
Conduct the interview again.

577
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,050
Before Friday,
make sure you get the material ready.

578
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,950
This is the last chance.

579
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,640
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

580
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,180
Let's go.
We'll conduct the interview again.

581
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,940
Don't you have something to do at 4 P.M.?
It's almost time.

582
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,230
That's right.

583
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,810
Go ahead.

584
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,390
I'll visit the site today.

585
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,660
We'll go there together
when the plan is ready.

586
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,800
In that case, I'll get going for real.

587
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,150
If you need my help,
don't hesitate to call me.

588
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,520
All of a sudden,

589
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,810
I have a feeling
that you're back to the old you.

590
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,470
You're crazy.

591
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,420
I'm leaving.

592
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,320
That's not right. Why am I panicking?

593
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,810
He's the one who fooled me.

594
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,400
Su, you're here.

595
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,150
Where is Ms Sang?

596
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,560
She's behind me.

597
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,570
Hello, Madam Zhang.

598
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,490
Hello.

599
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,950
Do you have eyes on your back?
