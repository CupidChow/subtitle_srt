[Episode 10]

4
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
Anyway, if I don't say,

5
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
he would never ask anything.

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,030
He acts like he doesn't care.

7
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,440
Does he even know

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,420
what school I am in?

9
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,829
You should've asked him this directly.

10
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,920
I say,

11
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,000
you'd better think about

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,540
how you are going to
explain to your family first.

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,720
Your mum called me again yesterday,

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
saying that you have to go back.

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,200
She called you again.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Why did she keep bothering you?

17
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,950
I'm sorry, honey.

18
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,470
It's fine.

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,190
But I really think that

20
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,340
you should talk to your parents.

21
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,560
They just want the
best for you, after all.

22
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,230
But they don't have the
rights to decide on my future.

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,550
What am I going to to do,

24
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,030
who I am going to date,

25
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,650
whether I would continue to learn,

26
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,870
isn't that something that I
should decide for myself?

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,520
[Mum]

28
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,080
Well, I think

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,590
you should just give in to her.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,590
Otherwise I'm going crazy.

31
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,390
Mum, listen,

32
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,079
I'll definitely stay here.

33
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,880
I've been staying here for four years.

34
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,750
I like this place.

35
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,310
I'm not going back in the future either.

36
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,950
Why won't you listen to me?

37
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,829
As your parents, we are
not going to ruin your life.

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,920
We are doing this for your own good.

39
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,560
There are a lot of people who really want

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,870
to enroll in your dad's
school, and they couldn't get in.

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,910
You've studied away
from home for just four years,

42
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,079
and now you don't want
to come back anymore.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,030
I shouldn't have let you apply for

44
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,470
the university away from
home in the first place.

45
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,110
I'm still not going back.

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Wu Yan,

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,390
are you hiding something from me?

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Mum,

49
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,470
I...

50
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,320
I have a boyfriend now.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,470
Boyfriend?

52
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,240
When did you meet? How old is he?

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,160
Where does he live?

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,950
Is he from the same school?

55
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,399
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,959
Introduce him to me.

57
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,550
Mum, he...

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
I met him at the special education school

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,750
where I'm doing my internship.

60
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,840
He works there as a Braille teacher.

61
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,200
He...

62
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,200
He has a little problem with his eyesight,

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,550
but he is not totally blind.

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,990
What about his family?

65
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,360
What do his parents do?

66
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,270
He was raised in an orphanage.

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,830
But...

68
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,710
Stop.

69
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,710
I'll fly there tomorrow.

70
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm dead.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,150
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,110
I heard it was fixed.

73
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,360
I happened to leave work early,
so I dropped by to take a look.

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
Time flies.

75
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,470
I remember you were the one
who cleaned up the studio

76
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,430
with me in the middle
of the night back then.

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,960
Hello, Mrs. Sang.

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,520
Wu Yan's mum.

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,470
Her current address?

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,360
If I hadn't asked Wei Hao,

81
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,480
did you still think

82
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
you could muddle through this time?

83
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,950
Mum, that's enough.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Just get in the car.

85
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,710
Xiao Lu, why aren't you getting in?

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,310
Nothing, I just saw a friend.

87
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,060
What's wrong?

88
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,150
Look at that smile on your face.

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,200
Nian Qin is dating someone.

90
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,080
Good for him.

91
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,840
Sang Wu Yan.

92
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,710
Have you eaten?

93
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,640
Haven't.

94
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,310
Wu Yan, is everything okay?

95
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,670
You sound nervous.

96
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,350
I have to go, I'm hanging up now.

97
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,550
Talk later, bye bye.

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,970
Nian Qin,

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,310
I might bring someone to see you later.

100
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,240
Which one is your room?

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,080
This one.

102
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,909
This one?

103
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,590
Mum?

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,310
Mum, what are you doing?

105
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,680
You're coming home with me tomorrow.

106
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,260
Mum.

107
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,710
You only want to stay here

108
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,400
because of that guy, isn't it?

109
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,870
I'm not letting you stay
here for another minute.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,430
Your father will apply for
leave for you at the school.

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,750
You're leaving with me tomorrow.

112
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,789
Wait, Mum, at least meet him for once

113
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,299
before you jump into conclusion.

114
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,280
I'll show you his photo.

115
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
That's enough.

116
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,640
We don't approve of
your relationship at all.

117
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
So there is no need for me to meet him.

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
Mother.

119
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,550
Before you young people do something that

120
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,280
you will regret in the future,

121
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,870
I'd better break you guys up now.

122
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,670
We have already done it.

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,110
But I don't regret it.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
You...

125
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,990
Stop being mad.

126
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,600
Mum, I've fallen in love with him.

127
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,200
And that's the most painful thing for me

128
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,960
if we are separated
in the future, isn't it?

129
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,640
Mum, I don't get it.

130
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,250
Why do you have to oppose us?

131
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,550
Is it just because of his eyesight?

132
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,960
Just because?

133
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,160
Do you think it's just that simple?

134
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,990
Yan Yan,

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,230
you are acting like

136
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,990
an insensible child now.

137
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,470
You haven't experienced
the daily grind of marriage.

138
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,710
You have no idea of

139
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,840
the struggles and sufferings in it.

140
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,040
You're not thinking straight because
your feelings have gotten to your head.

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,870
You think you're doing fine, don't you?

142
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
-You think you can do anything, don't you?
-I...

143
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,970
-No...
-Stop, stop.

144
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,600
I don't deny the love you believe in,

145
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,230
but the reality of life

146
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,080
is not how you expect it to be.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
You grew up being pampered.

148
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,520
You are the apple of your dad's eyes,

149
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,400
he pampered you so much that

150
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,230
he treated you like a princess.

151
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,030
What can you experience?

152
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,160
But I can learn.

153
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,470
I can learn to cook.

154
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,550
I can learn to make money. I can
learn to take care of myself and him.

155
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,350
Besides,

156
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,080
he doesn't need me to
take care of him at all, okay?

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,910
I didn't raise you up,

158
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,790
so that you could spend

159
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,150
most of your life

160
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,040
taking care of people like that.

161
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
Not to mention that he's an orphan.

162
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,430
He's not.

163
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,790
He really is not, he has family.

164
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,760
Mum, I think you really should meet him.

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
He is an outstanding man.

166
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,350
And he loves me very, very much.

167
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,870
Yan Yan, I told you before

168
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,040
love shouldn't be
about the spur of the moment.

169
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,280
Love comes with sense of
security and responsibility.

170
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,680
What good family could a person

171
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,840
with mysterious background have?

172
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,050
He won't even tell you.

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,790
And you call that love?

174
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,550
It's not that he wouldn't tell me.

175
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,520
It's because I didn't ask him.

176
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,200
I can call him and ask him now.

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,520
If that's all you're worried about,

178
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,550
I will call him now.

179
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,840
I don't need it.

180
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,400
Wu Yan, I don't care
about what family he has.

181
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,870
If his family is rich,

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,910
then I can tell you that

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,720
our family doesn't need to marry
our daughter above our station.

184
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,640
If he is poor,

185
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,000
then I can tell you that

186
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,280
that would make me dislike him even more.

187
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
Fine.

188
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,910
You're just going to disapprove
of us no matter what.

189
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,280
But Mum, you need to understand that

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,230
the one who wants to be with him is me,

191
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,430
not you guys.

192
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,950
Wu Yan,

193
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,480
how could you talk to me like that?

194
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,910
Nian Qin, what's wrong with you?

195
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,400
I thought it was Wu Yan.

196
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,370
What's going on?

197
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,480
You seem nervous.

198
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,720
Wu Yan said she's going
to bring someone here.

199
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,910
If I'm not mistaken, it should be her mum.

200
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,040
You should prepare for it indeed.

201
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,840
How did you know?

202
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,400
I was in the airport.

203
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,430
I saw her when I was picking up a friend.

204
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,480
Oh right, I'd better go
buy some ingredients.

205
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
It's almost time for dinner.

206
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,000
When they come later,

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
we can eat together.

208
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,520
Nian Qin,

209
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,910
it's 9 p.m..

210
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,550
Why don't you...

211
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,880
I'll call you later.

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,680
Gotta go.

213
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,640
The food's cold.

214
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,990
Let me reheat it.

215
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,600
No matter what,

216
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,960
let's eat first.

217
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,840
Mum,

218
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,080
I've grown up.

219
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,200
Can you let me choose my own path?

220
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,650
I know there will be setbacks.

221
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,560
But

222
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,720
I'll be strong too.

223
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,960
Even if I'm beaten down,

224
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,640
I still have a mother and a father

225
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,670
who love me very much, don't I?

226
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
Right?

227
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,230
I'm going back to Tongcheng County.

228
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,400
Wu Yan,

229
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,040
you're on your own now.

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,550
You can have it your way.

231
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,640
I understand now.

232
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,200
No matter what I say,
you're not going to listen.

233
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,200
But mark my words,

234
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,990
you walk the path
you're chosen for yourself.

235
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,840
There are no do-overs in life.

236
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,750
If you encounters problems in future,

237
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,480
you can't blame others but yourself.

238
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,160
I want to take a nap.

239
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,829
Nian Qin, listen to me.

240
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,790
-I mean it...
-It's none of my business.

241
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Nian Qin, don't be so
harsh to your father.

242
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,080
Father?

243
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,040
I never thought

244
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,960
he fulfilled his fatherly duty.

245
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,110
I have to leave.

246
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,510
Xiao Lu, I'll walk you out.

247
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,430
Xiao Lu,

248
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,030
what's going on with you guys?

249
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,360
Nothing.

250
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,920
By the way, Wu Yan,

251
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,110
didn't you say you were going
to bring someone to meet him?

252
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,270
Why didn't you come?

253
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,200
Something came up yesterday.

254
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,630
We couldn't make it.

255
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,120
Actually, yesterday
was Nian Qin's birthday.

256
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,670
It's fine.

257
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,880
He never celebrates his birthday anyway.

258
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,840
He couldn't.

259
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Keep him company, Wu Yan.

260
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,280
I'm going now.

261
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,310
Call me if you need anything.

262
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,640
Okay.

263
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,760
Bye, Xiao Lu.

264
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,600
Birthday...

265
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,720
Thank you, Doctor.

266
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,400
You're welcome.

267
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,200
Madam Wang, please walk him out.

268
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,840
Okay.

269
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
-Please.
-Okay.

270
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,600
As soon as you landed yesterday,

271
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,840
you went straight to see that brat.

272
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,840
After all, it was a special day.

273
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,600
I have to see if he's doing well.

274
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,840
Is it necessary?

275
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,790
It was him who chose to leave back then.

276
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,840
Why bother to see him?

277
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,400
If you hadn't been too proud

278
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,840
and wouldn't give in to a kid,

279
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,960
would things turn out like this today?

280
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,840
He didn't come back, did he?

281
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,960
Let's just pretend nothing happened.

282
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,550
Goodbye.

283
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,910
Hello, please come in.

284
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,430
Is it crowded?

285
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,600
A little bit.

286
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,710
If there were so many people on a weekday,

287
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,080
we would just go.

288
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,470
Then why don't we go now?

289
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,000
No, we have to wait today.

290
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,550
Because I'm craving for it.

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Okay.

292
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,510
Thank you for coming.

293
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,150
Please come in.

294
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
Okay, thank you.

295
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Let's go.

296
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,270
Sit here.

297
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,840
Thank you.

298
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:02,400
[Please make us a bowl
of longevity noodles.]

299
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,760
Waitress.

300
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,670
Thank you.

301
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,000
Thank you.

302
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,670
You haven't told me

303
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,310
who you were going to
bring to see me yesterday?

304
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,670
Cheng Yin.

305
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,560
Among my best friends,

306
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,760
you've met Xu Qian and Wei Hao, right?

307
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,390
So I wanted you to meet her too.

308
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,910
So why all the secrecy?

309
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,270
No.

310
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,550
Because I want to move in with you.

311
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,150
So I thought I should let my current
roommate get to know you too.

312
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,510
Why do you suddenly
want to move in with me?

313
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,390
Well, I found my meal ticket.

314
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
So why not move in earlier
so that I can have free meals

315
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,480
and save money?

316
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,640
Hi.

317
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,520
-Thank you.
-Here's your noodles.

318
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,840
Please enjoy.

319
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm allergic to beef, I can't eat it.

320
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,610
Eat it for me.

321
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,910
Let me smell it.

322
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,790
Eat up.

323
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,280
Is it good?

324
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,670
Husband.

325
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,670
You're home.

326
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,790
Let me tell you,

327
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,030
you daughter defied us completely now.

328
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,270
Do you know what she told me?

329
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
She actually fell in love with that guy.

330
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,910
And this is her most
painful thing in future.

331
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,800
Listen to her.

332
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,310
Listen to the mawkish things she said.

333
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,710
Ever since she was little,

334
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,970
I strictly forbid her

335
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,790
to read those romance novels.

336
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,390
But I didn't expect that

337
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,490
I had raised a lovesick fool.

338
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
I know that

339
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,310
at her age,

340
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,640
she is going to yell and beg me

341
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,550
to give her freedom and love.

342
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,000
But I did not expect that

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,720
she would go that far.

344
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,960
She actually fell in
love with a blind orphan.

345
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,310
I mean, why did she...

346
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,080
Jing De!

347
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,840
Jing De!

348
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
What's wrong with you, Jing De?

349
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Jia Ying.

350
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,310
Jia Ying, how are you doing?

351
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,200
How is he? What did the doctor say?

352
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,480
The doctor said he had brain hemorrhage.

353
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,030
He just got out of surgery

354
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,760
and has been admitted to ICU.

355
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,600
He will be put under
observation for 24 hours

356
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,910
to see how he recovers.

357
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,240
How did he...

358
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,880
Jia Ying, don't panic.

359
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,320
He'll be fine.

360
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,970
He'll be fine.

361
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,120
Thank you for coming.

362
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,240
This is nothing.

363
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
What about Wu Yan? Have you told her?

364
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,960
Nian Qin.

365
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,840
Did I wake you?

366
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,600
No.

367
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,910
Were you having nightmare again?

368
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,590
Nian Qin, when did you

369
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,030
start learning to play the piano?

370
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,030
When I was about to celebrate
my six years old birthday.

371
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,200
Was it easy to learn?

372
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,630
No.

373
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,310
Then why did you choose

374
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,840
to learn piano in the first place?

375
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,840
My mum wanted me to.

376
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,390
She believed that if a
disabled child like me

377
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,510
could be proficient in
a musical instrument,

378
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,630
at least I would have
valuable skill in life,

379
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,840
I could make a living from it.

380
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
Your mother...

381
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,720
She passed away.

382
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,720
On my birthday,

383
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,270
my mum taught me this song.

384
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,720
She said

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,350
this song was written for

386
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,670
a woman who was in confinement.

387
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,390
People could only
tell if she was still alive

388
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,960
by the sound of the piano at night.

389
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,080
When the piano was no longer heard,

390
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,480
that meant she was gone.

391
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,500
I guess

392
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,480
perhaps she liked this song that much

393
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,880
because she too,

394
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,480
was confined in a cage

395
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,080
like that woman.

396
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,480
Having a child with disability

397
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
was the beginning of her ordeal.

398
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,800
Nian Qin,

399
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,510
teach me how to play piano.

400
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,430
So that I can keep you company.

401
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,590
Do you really need to
bring so much stuff there?

402
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,310
It's not like you're marrying him.

403
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,310
Don't worry, honey.

404
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,880
I will come back to see you

405
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,280
at least once a week, okay?

406
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm really worried that when I'm not here,

407
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,390
a homebody like you

408
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,270
will tear down the house.

409
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,880
That's not what I meant.

410
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,670
You should worry about yourself.

411
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,360
Don't turn his mansion into a pigsty.

412
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,910
This time is different, okay?

413
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm going there

414
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,790
to take care of him.

415
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,670
I'm done packing.

416
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,790
Come, give me a hug.

417
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,310
Okay, bye.

418
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
Look at you,

419
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,880
why didn't you walk me out?

420
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,480
You can do like the
characters do in the movies,

421
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,120
telling me to come back often
to visit you or something like that.

422
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,310
Would you like to order a takeout with
me so that I can get a discount then?

423
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,910
Nian Qin, are you sure
you want to do this?

424
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,160
You haven't...

425
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,120
Say no more.

426
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,390
I'm aware of the chaos
she is capable of making.

427
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,910
Oh gosh.

428
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,630
Are you alright?

429
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,830
Are you hurt?

430
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,670
No, I'm fine.

431
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,200
Let me.

432
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,430
Don't, don't.

433
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,080
You might burn yourself, hold on.

434
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
Have you forgotten?

435
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,430
I made you some fried eggs last time.

436
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,120
Oh right.

437
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,120
This is so embarrassing.

438
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,360
I told you that I'm
here to take care of you.

439
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,670
I ended up making a mess.

440
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,310
Keep in mind that

441
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,710
I didn't date you just because

442
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,030
I'm looking for someone
to take care of me.

443
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:21,960
[The scenario is for story purposes.
Please don't try this at home.]

444
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,840
Let me take care of you in future.

445
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,600
Let's go grab something to eat.

446
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,910
Come on.

447
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,760
Let's go.

448
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,910
Sorry, sorry.

449
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,430
Sorry.

450
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,200
He's so handsome.

451
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,370
Such a small face.

452
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,590
-Such a pity.
-Yeah.

453
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,570
-Wonder what happened.
-Wu Yan.

454
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,200
Hurry up and let me kiss you.

455
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,140
I'm going to put a label on you,

456
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,990
you're Sang Wu Yan's personal belongings.

457
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,970
What was with those people just now?

458
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,910
Nothing.

459
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,720
[Right,]

460
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,170
[you've never seen your own face.]

461
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,910
Let's go.

462
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,800
Aren't you going to teach
me how to play the piano?

463
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,880
Let's start now.

464
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,360
You can't even sing in tune

465
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,880
or read music,

466
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,030
and you want to learn
how to play the piano?

467
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
As long as you have perseverance,

468
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,160
I'm sure I can learn it.

469
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,530
It's you who want to learn the piano,
why do I need perseverance?

470
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,500
Because I certainly
won't have persistence,

471
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,310
so I'll need to count
on a tyrant like you.

472
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,060
You're calling me a tyrant,

473
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,220
despite you need my help.

474
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,560
Let's go.

475
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,320
My hair.

476
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,040
What time is it?

477
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,480
Is Xiao Man's After Work Music
going on air soon?

478
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,670
What's the matter?

479
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,239
I think my watch stopped.

480
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,000
Let me see.

481
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,070
It's 6:30p.m..

482
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,530
We missed it.

483
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,110
We'll listen next time.

484
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,040
Su Nian Qin,

485
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,280
how do you feel when you hear the song

486
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,200
♫ Rain falls on the eaves ♫

487
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
you composed being aired?

488
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,240
♫ The swallows return to the house ♫

489
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,720
I feel nothing.

490
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,120
What a ruthless guy.

491
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
♫ By the Zhuque Bridge ♫

492
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,000
You're so cold to yourself.

493
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,920
♫ The boat has gone far away ♫

494
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,830
What'd you expect?

495
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,390
What feelings do you think I should have?

496
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,000
♫ Years of parting ♫

497
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,080
The fulfillment of your song

498
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,920
♫ When will we see each other again ♫

499
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,920
♫ I wonder under the umbrella ♫

500
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,520
being heard by one more person.

501
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,710
For me,

502
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,560
♫ In the Wuyi Lane ♫

503
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,190
after writing the song I want to write

504
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,640
♫ The dusk is light ♫

505
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,760
and sent it out,

506
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,560
what I want to say has already
been expressed in the song.

507
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,120
♫ Tea smoke floating
in the small pavilion ♫

508
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,040
Whether they can hear or understand it,

509
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,140
♫ Strumming the strings ♫

510
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,910
that's not my concern.

511
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,000
♫ Looking back ♫

512
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,390
Stop lying to yourself.

513
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,680
♫ The butterfly dances ♫

514
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,190
If that's the case,

515
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,280
why did give your
song to others to sing it?

516
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,120
♫ Dreams emerge ♫

517
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,600
You could've just written it like diary

518
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,720
♫ Old images ♫

519
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,240
and kept it to yourself.

520
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,680
♫ I wake up at a loss of words ♫

521
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,040
You let others sing it

522
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,800
because you want someone
else to hear it, isn't it?

523
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,080
♫ Morning breeze and the lingering moon  ♫

524
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,800
It's just to make ends meet.

525
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,000
♫ Flower petals fall ♫

526
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,910
Xiao Lu is the one who sold it.

527
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,280
In this case,

528
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,280
♫ Drawing the face of someone ♫

529
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,120
you'd better compose more songs.

530
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,480
♫ Linger on my fingertips ♫

531
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,800
Because I can eat a lot.

532
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,720
♫ Hearing the cuckoo on the stream ♫

533
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,000
♫ The story is poignant ♫

534
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,080
♫ Summer cicadas and winter snow ♫

535
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,770
♫ Engraved in the past ♫

536
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,520
♫ Countless fates ♫

537
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,080
♫ Letters have turned yellow ♫

538
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,320
Copy that.

539
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,760
♫ Another year goes by ♫

540
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,040
♫ The willow leaves wait for the wind ♫

541
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
Why are you being so serious?

542
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,520
What?

543
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,430
Xi.

544
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,040
You want to buy a watch as a gift?

545
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,000
It's not that easy to
find that watch of his.

546
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
Have you asked Xiao Lu about it?

547
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't want to let them know.

548
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,720
Xi, can you...

549
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,040
I'll keep it to myself.

550
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,910
Thank you, Xi.

551
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,430
Mr. Su,

552
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm here to learn the piano with you.

553
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,520
And this is my tuition fee.

554
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,760
Su Nian Qin, from this second on,

555
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,520
your time begins anew.

556
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,320
You have to be good-tempered,

557
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,520
try your best to live well,

558
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,040
and be nice to yourself.

559
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,520
Because this is the only way

560
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,520
you can love me everlastingly.

561
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,920
So corny.

562
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,480
The word like everlastingly,

563
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,000
no one uses it in lyrics anymore.

564
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,670
I don't care, that's how I want it.

565
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,480
[Are you still at work?]

566
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,000
[We're still in the studio.]

567
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,320
[Yes.]

568
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,480
Aren't you guys going off work?

569
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,520
If you want to leave, you can leave first.

570
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,000
Our leaders are still here.

571
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,720
If they are still here,

572
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,630
subordinates like us
wouldn't dare to leave.

573
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,520
That's like showing them
we're not working hard.

574
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
What are you doing here?

575
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,670
I thought I've texted you that

576
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,150
our practice ended?

577
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,040
My battery died.

578
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,800
Sorry.

579
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,320
I've wasted everyone's time.

580
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,240
It's fine.

581
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,720
You must be really busy today.

582
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,280
I don't know

583
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,150
what I'm doing all day today.

584
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,470
It's like I have entered

585
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,240
into a totally different world.

586
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,320
But it's also like

587
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,630
that world is the real world.

588
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,040
I'm sorry.

589
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,040
I've messed them up.

590
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,760
It's fine, but it'd be nice

591
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,120
if you could remember to

592
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,040
put them back in their places.

593
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,200
I got it.

594
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,710
I just thought that this photo frame

595
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,250
would look better on this side,

596
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,520
that's why I put it here.

597
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,280
I've been meaning to ask you,

598
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,760
who are the people in this photo?

599
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,150
Are they your relatives?

600
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,760
What do you mean?

601
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,520
What people?

602
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,830
I'm talking about the
photo frame you're holding.

603
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,000
How do the people in the photo look like?

604
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,760
It's just an old photo.

605
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,520
There are four people.

606
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,040
It looks like a family photo.

607
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,960
This girl here looks like Xiao Lu.

608
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,320
Standing next to her
is a girl with long hair,

609
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,630
they were holding hands.

610
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,280
Is the background a glass wall?

611
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Yes.

612
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,350
Did I say something wrong?

613
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,510
No.

614
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,760
It's nothing. Thank you.

615
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,000
Did you guys have a fight?

616
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
The photo frame.

617
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,430
Miss me?

618
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,630
Stop signaling to each other.

619
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,070
What is this?

620
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,950
This...

621
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,320
A decorative painting?

622
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,800
You actually told me
it's a decorative painting?

623
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,870
Nian Qin, please listen to me.

624
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,320
How long has it been here?

625
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,630
Tell me.

626
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,280
You actually told me that

627
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,280
it's just a simple decorative painting.

628
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,910
What do you mean by this?

629
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,520
Are you trying to tell people
that I have a lovely family?

630
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,630
You are well aware of

631
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,830
the things I hate

632
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,070
and certain people I hate.

633
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,840
And you just blatantly put it

634
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,320
right under my nose.

635
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,280
You think because I'm blind,

636
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,390
I can easily be fooled?
