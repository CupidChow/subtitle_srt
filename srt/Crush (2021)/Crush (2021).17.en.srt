3
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:13,634
Here.

4
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:14,999
Thank you.

5
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:17,937
It's only been a few months.

6
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:20,048
Why do I feel that you've grown taller?

7
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,295
It's been more than just a few months.

8
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,309
The last time we met each other
was more than six months ago.

9
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:28,589
Mr Su, you almost forgot about me,
haven't you?

10
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,655
I was a little occupied at work.

11
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:34,810
What about Ms Sang?

12
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,100
You told me she's busy with work.

13
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,997
She's never visited me since then.

14
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,756
Is she never free?

15
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,192
Ms Sang is also very busy.

16
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,267
Please don't blame her.

17
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:52,395
I miss Ms Sang so much.

18
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,031
I really miss her too.

19
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:11,844
Mr Su, when you told me the story,

20
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:14,724
you said that
Ms Sang recorded the story for you.

21
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:16,740
Will you let me listen to it?

22
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,925
No.

23
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,754
It's only for me.

24
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:22,982
How petty.

25
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,305
Excuse me.

26
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,759
Sorry to interrupt.

27
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,904
I just received a phone call
from Director Xia from Finance.

28
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:36,549
It's about the acquisition of Toro.

29
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,026
The result of their internal assessment
is out.

30
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:41,593
They would like to have a meeting
with you and the legal department.

31
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,097
What do you think?

32
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:44,976
Send Xiao Wei home.

33
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,272
Notify them that the meeting
will be held in an hour.

34
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,507
Okay.

35
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,586
I'll see you again...

36
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,792
It's okay.

37
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:07,180
(World Trade Business Centre)

38
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,242
Okay.

39
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:12,294
I'll report it to our boss.

40
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:13,427
Okay.

41
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:16,997
By the way, Xu Qian,

42
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:20,253
regarding Toro's case,
did our boss tell you anything?

43
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,104
Does he plan to name you
as the leader of the project?

44
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,422
Me?

45
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,128
Forget it. It's nothing.

46
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,445
I have to go.

47
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:34,214
Don't lower yourself to his standard.

48
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:37,550
We've been working for such a long time.
You should know him well by now.

49
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,260
What's wrong with him?

50
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,893
Why did he say something strange?

51
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:47,938
What's wrong, Ms Fei Fei?

52
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:49,279
Even you...

53
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:52,873
Haven't you heard about it?

54
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,494
About what?

55
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:58,773
Why are you so slow?

56
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:04,798
The affair between you and our boss
has been getting around.

57
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,501
Some people claimed that they saw him
sending you home after office hours.

58
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,444
Let me remind you.

59
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:13,918
Our company is against office romance.

60
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,559
In general,

61
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,808
it's usually the female staff
who resigned in the end.

62
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:20,593
You should be ready.

63
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,215
Ms Fei Fei, believe it or not,

64
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,705
I've never been together with our boss.

65
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,900
(Dried Peaches)

66
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,300
(Dried Peaches)

67
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,348
Can't you bring me to your office?

68
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,688
I'll just sit at the side.
I promise I won't say a word.

69
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,548
There are many
confidential documents in the office.

70
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,756
If something happens,
you can never clear your name.

71
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,312
All right.

72
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,887
Take it.

73
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,916
I bought you a makeup remover,
as you requested.

74
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,290
I don't know if I have got it right.

75
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,745
Peaches were not available
in the supermarket.

76
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:31,205
Hence, I got you dried peaches.

77
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:33,206
Don't eat too much. It's heaty.

78
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,570
All right, got it.

79
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,862
Give it to me.

80
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,898
I just have to work overtime.

81
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,215
Go back now.

82
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,596
I'll go home now.

83
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,236
Send me a text message when you're
almost done. I'll pick you up.

84
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,131
Why did you come back out of the blue?

85
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:53,458
Did something happen?

86
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:55,976
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,262
Don't say that. It's quite scary.

88
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,231
Just tell me if anything.

89
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:02,540
What happened?

90
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,259
I resigned.

91
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,740
I've decided to move back.

92
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,097
I was wrong.

93
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:14,106
I didn't figure out what I wanted.

94
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:15,421
I blamed everything on you.

95
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:16,767
Hold on.

96
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:19,189
I'm confused.

97
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,901
Let me ask you a simple question.

98
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,265
Do you still want me?

99
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,305
Won't you blame me?

100
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,146
Are you silly?

101
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:52,290
No matter what happens, I won't blame you.

102
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,830
Hold on.

103
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,232
If you come back,

104
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,461
you won't be able
to make big money anymore.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,181
What's wrong?

106
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:07,454
Do you want me to go out
and make big money?

107
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:08,801
No, I don't mean that.

108
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:11,079
Let me sustain your life from now on.

109
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:17,003
Besides paying my grandma,
I've saved up a lot.

110
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,960
If I come home,

111
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,229
I would become jobless.

112
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,840
If you don't want me anymore,
I'll lose both you and money at once.

113
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,910
Of course I want you.

114
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,461
What are you doing?

115
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,018
Why are you loitering around
late at night?

116
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,616
What is going on?

117
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:43,950
Isn't this Xu Qian?

118
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:47,882
Come, let's go home.

119
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,496
I haven't even gotten to hold her hand!
Sang Wu Yan, you...

120
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:00,668
You mean you're going to propose to her?

121
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:04,484
You two have only just made up
and you're already proposing to her?

122
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,035
Isn't it a tad reckless?

123
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:07,920
It's called strike while the iron is hot.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,165
While she's confused, I have to act fast.

125
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,685
Otherwise, she might run away again.

126
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,499
That's right.

127
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,738
Grandma, I'm here to see you.

128
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:23,064
Look, I got a lot of goodies for you.

129
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:27,550
Have an orange first.

130
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:32,437
Grandma.

131
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,117
Let me tell you a secret.

132
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:38,127
Do you know that Wei Hao
plans to propose to Xu Qian?

133
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,635
It's not confirmed at the moment
but it'll eventually become true.

134
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,597
Why are you standing here?

135
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:00,425
Are you going to propose to me?

136
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,490
I haven't come out with the plan.

137
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,758
You're a typical science student.
Don't bother.

138
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,849
Since my grandma is here,

139
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,446
just admit that you want to marry me.

140
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:23,711
Yes.

141
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,638
Okay, I'll marry you.

142
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,256
See?

143
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:51,988
I told you I could make it happen.

144
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:57,810
Dear, take a rest.

145
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,969
Let me do it.

146
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,638
How disgusting.
No couple on earth is innocent.

147
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,238
Here.

148
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,861
Eat more.

149
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,474
Mum, you've gone too far.

150
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,346
Mind your own business.

151
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:31,467
Xu Qian, eat more.

152
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:33,802
Look at you, your chin is so sharp.

153
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:37,202
She never puts on weight in the face.
Her chin has always been that sharp.

154
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:41,027
Xu Qian, how do you like the dishes?

155
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,639
All the dishes that you ordered
are delicious.

156
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,973
You'll have to address us
as mum and dad soon, right?

157
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:52,010
Mr and Mrs Wei,

158
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,880
I think there is something
I need to explain to you.

159
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,477
Although it's a little soon
for Wei Hao and I to get married,

160
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,746
and it appears to be a hasty decision,

161
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,559
I've thought it through.

162
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:11,475
I know full well that
marriage binds two families.

163
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:12,762
Therefore,

164
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:16,013
I think I need to be honest
about my family background.

165
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:19,237
Wei Hao has told us about it.

166
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,560
We understand the whole situation.

167
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,398
You must've endured a lot
since your childhood,

168
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,026
haven't you?

169
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,396
After listening to Wei Hao,

170
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,453
I admire you more.

171
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,815
If I were you,

172
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:37,218
I wouldn't achieve
what you have achieved for sure.

173
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,066
It's okay.

174
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:46,208
Thank you, Mrs Wei.

175
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:48,648
There's no need for thanks.
Family takes care of each other.

176
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,815
I think your husband is almost ready.
I'll go get him.

177
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:02,943
Sure.

178
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,454
What did I say?

179
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,816
I knew that
you could handle Mr and Mrs Wei well.

180
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,831
It's because they're really nice to me.

181
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:20,005
Were you looking for this?

182
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,905
You left it behind
when you were getting changed.

183
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,565
Hence, I kept it for you.

184
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,030
I can't believe that
I'm looking at Sang Wu Yan...

185
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,937
who used to leave things behind.

186
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:34,561
Why do you look so beautiful
in a wedding gown?

187
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,375
You're so beautiful.

188
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,020
Wu Yan, I always think that
you're so much luckier than me.

189
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,614
You know about my family.

190
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:47,087
Since I was young,
I always had to work so hard.

191
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,096
I always had to curry favour
with people around me.

192
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:51,766
To be honest, I envy you.

193
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,311
Why did you say that?

194
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,892
Wei Hao makes me understand that
I must not think that way.

195
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:04,268
Everyone
has their own life and happy moments.

196
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:07,180
I shouldn't compare my weaknesses
with others all the time.

197
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,327
I just have to grasp my own.

198
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:13,623
Now, I got it.

199
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,289
I'm very happy now.

200
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:18,265
All the best to you too.

201
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,205
I bet the groom is getting impatient now.

202
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:38,696
No one is a lone island.

203
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:41,632
There is always a song
that will get into your heart.

204
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:44,515
Welcome to "The Lone Island Playlist".

205
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:47,184
An audience said that he's been
requesting this song to be played...

206
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:50,385
Tongcheng Music Broadcast
but it's never been selected.

207
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:53,422
All right, his request is granted.

208
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:59,211
Let's listen to the last song written by
the mysterious songwriter, Yi Jin.

209
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,704
♪Every time I thought I would cry♪

210
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:11,173
♪When the light fades away♪

211
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:15,015
♪I look for the familiar voice around me♪

212
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:16,776
♪Slowly penetrating the tides
and raindrops♪

213
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:19,072
-Excuse me, I was trapped in the traffic.
-It's okay.

214
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,249
This is the first song.

215
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,288
Thanks.

216
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,517
♪Even though I try to carry on♪

217
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:27,023
♪And I leave my past behind♪

218
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:30,664
♪I feel like I can hear your breathing♪

219
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,490
♪And the night turns translucent♪

220
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,039
♪Be it the city or forest♪

221
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,628
(Crush)

222
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,380
♪A gloomy tranquillity♪

223
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,641
♪Lost in the midst♪

224
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,523
♪I close my eyes♪

225
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:51,253
♪But I see your silhouette♪

226
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,150
♪Forever shine for me♪

227
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,270
♪Unafraid even when faced
with the unknown future♪

228
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,060
♪Because you're
the only thing I think about♪

229
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,930
♪I only think about you♪

230
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,980
♪Forever shine for me♪

231
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,910
♪Never doubting even when I continue on♪

232
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,099
Boss.

233
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,941
The latest romantic
and thriller movies are here.

234
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,260
They're here.

235
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:27,096
Thanks.

236
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,980
Is there anything else?

237
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,154
Boss.

238
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:41,394
Yi Jin's "Crush" was played.

239
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:42,597
I heard it.

240
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,675
Boss, may I know why?

241
00:18:47,188 --> 00:18:49,493
Why do you always want me
to request the song?

242
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,957
Isn't the song nice?

243
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,957
Of course it's nice.

244
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,413
I actually think that
girls will be fond of the song.

245
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:49,464
I knew that you would be here
visiting your grandma.

246
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:52,727
I went home and no one was in.
I guess you're here.

247
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:53,948
Keep quiet.

248
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,294
Let's talk outside.

249
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,311
What do you want?

250
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:05,874
Why do you speak that way?

251
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:07,991
I mean it.

252
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:10,528
What do you want this time?

253
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,629
Why did you come back
if nothing had happened?

254
00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:16,070
I came back because of your wedding.

255
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,551
My daughter is getting married.
Of course I have to be there.

256
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,951
Who informed you about it?

257
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:22,913
Did I invite you?

258
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,828
To be honest,

259
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,093
I really admire you.

260
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,475
How did you do this?

261
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,443
You can pretend nothing has happened.

262
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:36,233
If I don't do that, how do I face you?

263
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:37,989
Yes.

264
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,927
I know I've hurt you...

265
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:43,179
but I also know that
I can never make up to it.

266
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,218
It's been so many years.

267
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:48,112
If you really hate me to the core,

268
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,995
you'd better do what you said.

269
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,651
Never live my life.

270
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,539
That's exactly what I'm doing.

271
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:57,582
Don't you worry.

272
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:00,488
Qian Qian...

273
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:05,431
I only hope that
I could witness my daughter's wedding.

274
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,093
After the wedding,
I'll leave immediately.

275
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:12,259
Again?

276
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,221
Whatever.

277
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,378
Mum.

278
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,839
The wedding lasted for the whole day.

279
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,376
Are you exhausted?

280
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,168
Xu Qian purposely
passed the flower to you.

281
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:02,807
You get the meaning, right?

282
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,418
Remember Xiao Xiao
who came to our place last time?

283
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:09,901
What do you think of him?

284
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,528
I think he's quite okay.

285
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:17,660
He's nice and polite.

286
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,479
His height is okay too.

287
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,937
Who is that?

288
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,111
Your dad's former student.

289
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,649
How could you forget him?

290
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,208
He always called you "little girl".

291
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,574
Forget it.

292
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:43,858
At your university,

293
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:47,676
is there any guy who gets along with you?

294
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:51,582
Yes.

295
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,535
He's helping me
in conducting research for my thesis.

296
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:55,894
How is he?

297
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,757
Don't you even think about it.

298
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,122
He's already married.

299
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,825
Look at you.

300
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,685
We're talking about something serious.

301
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:06,927
Got it.

302
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,260
(Interview with RD Group CEO,
Su Nian Qin)

303
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:36,199
What's wrong?

304
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:41,082
Nothing.
I'm going on a blind date tomorrow.

305
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:43,036
Your mum sure acts fast.

306
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:44,181
Of course.

307
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,672
Look at you.

308
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:51,226
It's just to meet a person.

309
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,488
Have you confirmed the details?

310
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:54,950
Yes.

311
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,431
That person is really funny.

312
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,796
I thought I could contact him by phone.

313
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,862
However,

314
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,106
he insisted on wearing a brown jacket...

315
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:08,755
so that I could recognise him.

316
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,264
The moment I heard that,
I decided to do the same.

317
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:14,446
Why don't you hold a copy of
"Best Friends" in your right hand...

318
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:15,718
and a rose in your left hand?

319
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:18,330
And have a secret pass code too,
such as "I won't tell you anything"?

320
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,901
What nonsense is that?

321
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:21,051
Go away.

322
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,219
I'll have to meet him tomorrow.

323
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:24,803
What a drag.

324
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,337
So Ms Sang, you're Professor Li's
graduate student.

325
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,257
How was the blind date?

326
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:42,870
It was okay.

327
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,422
What does "okay" mean?

328
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:45,985
It means it's not okay.

329
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:47,751
Why?

330
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,865
I'm still studying, my dear mum.

331
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:55,489
If I date him,
it'd become a teacher-student affair.

332
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:58,200
There's no way I'd do that.

333
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:07,631
Ms Sang, when will you graduate?

334
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:09,034
Next year.

335
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:11,998
I'm interested in applying as a
postgraduate at your university.

336
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,280
I would like to know,

337
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,300
how did you study for
the postgraduate entrance examination?

338
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:19,258
Just study and do worksheets.

339
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:23,063
I also got a senior
who had passed the examination...

340
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:24,463
to help me with the revision.

341
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:27,021
Do you mind helping me with the revision?

342
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:30,301
Last year, I failed English
and a core course.

343
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,068
I would like to try it again.

344
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:39,095
Was he even there for a blind date?

345
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:40,661
He's there with an intention.

346
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:42,562
He's there to look for a tuition teacher.

347
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:43,931
I see.

348
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:46,644
Yan Yan, be patient.

349
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:49,043
I have a new guy to introduce to you.

350
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,875
Take a break, my dear mum.

351
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:55,057
Do you know I'm becoming famous
in the academic world...

352
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,335
in our hometown?

353
00:25:56,415 --> 00:26:00,798
Do you plan to introduce me
to all the single male teachers?

354
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,063
Have faith in me one last time.

355
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:08,768
The guy I'm about to introduce to you
is such a rare gem.

356
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:10,694
Not only is he nice, but handsome too.

357
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,363
And tall.

358
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,379
And he has an impressive career.

359
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,751
Mum.

360
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:17,617
What subject does he teach?

361
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:20,075
Is he teaching in high school
or elementary school?

362
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:22,423
He's a lawyer!

Just switch the lights on

I think we should switch on the lights.

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,658
You'll need to make a trip
to Toro's office tomorrow morning...

500
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,579
for a meeting
with their senior administrators.

501
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:11,034
Also, the branch office manager...

502
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:13,822
hopes that you can
pay the employees a visit.

503
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,941
Ms Yu called.

504
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:19,528
She hopes that you could return her call
when you're free.

505
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,600
Boss.

506
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,936
Are you done?

507
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:32,643
That's all.

508
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,428
What else do you need?

509
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,546
Bring me...

510
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:40,152
the agreement that we're
going to discuss with Toro tomorrow.

511
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,036
As for the trip to the branch office,

512
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:45,523
make arrangements for it.

513
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,011
All right, got it.

514
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:49,916
What is the phone number?

515
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:51,187
It's 101.

516
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,863
Do you need anything?

517
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:55,370
I need a bottle of liquor.

518
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,297
Ms Yu said that your eyes...

519
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:30,036
If reading is taking a toll on your eyes,
just let someone read it for you.

520
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:32,362
If you need to note it down,
then just jot it down.

521
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:44,948
Please send me a bottle of whiskey.

522
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:18,211
Chinese privet and Ilex
are not the same thing.

523
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:22,556
What is this?

524
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:23,848
It's aloe vera.

525
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,203
Here.

526
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,861
These are eyebrows. They're messy.

527
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:36,840
That's because I don't take care of them.

528
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,011
These are eyes.

529
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:40,981
These are eyelashes.

530
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,520
Eyelashes are thick.

531
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,423
My eyes always get teary
but I have good eyesight.

532
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:52,789
Su Nian Qin,

533
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,669
I don't want to see you again
for the rest of my life.

534
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:29,658
Wu Yan.

535
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,028
Wu Yan.

536
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,535
Wu Yan?

537
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:32,358
(Tongcheng University
Autism Research Centre)

538
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:38,497
Madam, based on our analysis,
Xiao Jie has autism,

539
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:40,614
but there are no problems
with his intellect.

540
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:43,069
He might even have some hidden talents.

541
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:46,062
The autism that you mentioned...

542
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,192
Is it a serious illness?

543
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:52,706
We're from the countryside.

544
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,814
I don't think we can afford the treatment.

545
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,040
Don't worry.

546
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,827
We'll figure it out.

547
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:06,200
Please take a look at the agreement.

548
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,005
What does it mean?

549
00:41:09,085 --> 00:41:12,112
It means with the consent
of the guardian,

550
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:16,175
we'll give him basic support
and treatment.

551
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:19,468
So if I sign the agreement,

552
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,841
you will give him treatment?

553
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:23,074
Is that right?

554
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,943
To put it simply, yes.

555
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:28,205
However, if you have any concerns...

556
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,536
Patients with severe autism
require lots of support,

557
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:48,675
whether in terms
of language or socialising skills.

558
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:51,043
I think you have conducted
preliminary examination.

559
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:53,255
You may take a look at the details.

560
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:56,891
Wu Yan, I need to remind you.

561
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:00,544
Treating him will be a tough battle.

562
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,487
You need to be mentally prepared.

563
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:07,004
We mustn't take in a patient
on impulse and give up later on.

564
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:09,338
Some people do it just
for their thesis writing purposes.

565
00:42:09,418 --> 00:42:11,192
In the end, they will be left unattended.

566
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:12,532
We can't do that.

567
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:14,301
I got it.

568
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:15,814
Don't worry.

569
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,561
(Toro)

570
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:24,635
Dismiss.

571
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,073
Nian Qin.

572
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,490
This is Ms Peng, the former owner of Toro.

573
00:42:47,158 --> 00:42:49,417
Ms Peng, how may I help you?

574
00:42:49,497 --> 00:42:51,619
Just call me Dan Qi.
You don't have to be so polite.

575
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,398
We were busy attending
the meeting just now.

576
00:42:54,478 --> 00:42:56,310
I forgot to exchange name cards with you.

577
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:08,404
I'm sorry.

578
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:11,522
I gave the last name card
to someone else yesterday.

579
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:13,903
It's okay.

580
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:16,850
Nian Qin, I heard that this is
the first time you're in Tongcheng.

581
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,020
Do you want me to show you around?

582
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:25,294
Thank you for the offer, Ms Peng.
However, I have a tight schedule today.

583
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:26,599
I'm sorry.

584
00:43:28,313 --> 00:43:31,271
Let me be the host tonight.
I'll buy you a welcome dinner.

585
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:33,245
You should have time for dinner, right?

586
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:37,788
Thank you for the invitation, Ms Peng.

587
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,575
I want to get changed.

588
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,352
Her perfume has tainted my suit.

589
00:43:45,432 --> 00:43:46,562
Okay.

590
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:51,557
Thank you.

591
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,303
What are you looking for?

592
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,568
Where is the MP3 player
that I always have with me?

593
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,296
Did you leave it in the hotel?

594
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:14,672
Go back to the hotel now.

595
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:17,200
What about the dinner with Ms Peng?

596
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,352
I'll skip it.
