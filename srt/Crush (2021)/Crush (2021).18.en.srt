3
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,294
I'm really sorry, Ms Peng.

4
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,857
Okay.

5
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,239
I will tell him.

6
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,108
Goodbye.

7
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,713
Mr Su's MP3 player is very precious.

8
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,918
If we don't find it,
it will be the end of us.

9
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:34,383
I found it.

10
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,020
(RD Group finances
local technology company, Toro)

11
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,965
Didn't I tell you he's not here for me?

12
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:06,389
He has some big business deals here.

13
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,576
If you ask me,
it doesn't matter why he is here.

14
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,086
As long as you get to meet, that is fate.

15
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,456
It was reported in the news that
Mr Su Senior transferred...

16
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:17,186
all his shares to him.

17
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,332
And with this news, what does it say?

18
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:23,610
It says Young Master Su
is now a genuine business elite.

19
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,891
Don't you want the old flame
to light up again?

20
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:29,483
There's no old flame to begin with.
How can it light up again?

21
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,125
Besides, didn't you say
he's a business elite now?

22
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:35,148
He should find someone
that matches his status,

23
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,828
like those marriages that comes
with business benefits.

24
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:39,740
Why would he want to socialise
with ordinary citizens like us?

25
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,574
There you go again.

26
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,486
Can you not immediately
categorise people by social status?

27
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,800
To be honest,
we are just vulnerable human beings.

28
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,295
He may have more worries than you at best.

29
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,960
Look.

30
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:58,182
Three years have passed.

31
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:59,189
In these three years,

32
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,925
I have never participated
in a single part of his life.

33
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,538
Who am I to think that he...

34
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,688
Can you clarify with him
before talking about these?

35
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:09,672
You can ask him
when he is inviting you to his wedding.

36
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,212
If he said it's still too soon,

37
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,665
it means all your thoughts now
are non-existent.

38
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,096
He will certainly say,

39
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,661
"Don't worry, Ms Sang."

40
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:24,661
"You will definitely get
the wedding invitation."

41
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:40,588
The new boss is here for an inspection.

42
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:43,281
I heard he is now at the R&D Department
on the fourth floor.

43
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,944
He's going to be here any minute then.

44
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,410
I really want to
get a good look at this new boss...

45
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,395
to see if he is as legendary
as he is rumoured to be.

46
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,128
You'd better control yourself.

47
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,671
Don't get too excited
and fall in front of him.

48
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,368
He's here.

49
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:13,928
This is our information department.

50
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,576
We have 45 regular staff here.

51
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,102
You better stop it.

52
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:43,795
The place for our meet-up
is where Wei Hao is working at.

53
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,038
I can even pick him up after work.

54
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:50,101
What's wrong? Are you afraid
of bumping into Su Nian Qin?

55
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,825
How did you know?

56
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,124
I was involved in Toro's case
before I resigned.

57
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:59,184
Besides, Wei Hao is working at Toro.
How can I not follow their news?

58
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:01,604
Moreover, I do watch news.

59
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,838
Have you two met?

60
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,220
Don't just talk about me.

61
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,481
When are you getting back to work?

62
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,364
It's been a while since you got married.

63
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,151
Don't divert the topic.

64
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:17,847
Oh, right.

65
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,660
I have booked for a refractive surgery.

66
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,623
You have to accompany me on surgery day.

67
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,530
Why do you suddenly
want a refractive surgery?

68
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,246
I have always wanted to do it.

69
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:27,920
But I had been busy with work...

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,957
and afraid that the recuperating
period will affect my work.

71
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:32,626
Since I am free now, I want to do it.

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,185
I really don't get it.

73
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:38,422
Don't contact lenses do the job?
Why do you need surgery?

74
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,683
You're not putting yourself in my shoes.

75
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,754
All those years of television
and video gaming...

76
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,145
didn't damage your eyesight.

77
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:46,486
Of course you don't know my pain.

78
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,607
Contact lens is inconvenient
and uncomfortable.

79
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:53,756
Nothing is better than
using your own eyesight.

80
00:06:58,699 --> 00:06:59,822
Wei Hao will go.

81
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:01,931
And you must accompany me too.

82
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:49,837
Pull over.

83
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,932
Since you like movies so much,

84
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,228
do you know that the basic
fundamental that movies rely on...

85
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:12,880
is persistence of vision?

86
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:15,855
Lights that reach the eyes...

87
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:19,546
will remain in the retina for some time
before disappearing.

88
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,083
The duration is very short.

89
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,183
It's ephemeral.

90
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,421
But,

91
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:32,617
I probably have
an innate ability to prolong it.

92
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,655
In these three years,
it feels like I didn't see anything...

93
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,890
except everything about you.

94
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,518
They still appear before my eyes.

95
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,947

Ms Sang.

125
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:04,696
We met previously
at the lobby of Holiday Hotel.

126
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,129
I'm Wu Yu.

127
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:10,048
-Hi, Mr Wu.
-Where are you going?

128
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,918
I just got off work.
I can give you a ride.

129
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,493
No, thanks.

130
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:16,889
Please don't turn me down.

131
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,941
It's hard to find a ride at this hour.

132
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,562
Don't let the kid wait out here.

133
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:21,708
Please.

134
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:25,641
Thank you then.

135
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,822
Let's get in.

136
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:30,994
Thanks.

137
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,269
Where are you going?

138
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:44,135
The KFC Restaurant on Ning Kou Road.

139
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:47,586
That restaurant is usually crowded
at this hour.

140
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,115
If you don't mind going to another branch,
I know one which is less crowded.

141
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:55,701
Okay, thanks.

142
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,670
Thanks.

143
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,802
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-It's fine.

144
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,184
I have never eaten this.

145
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,085
This is just a place I pass by every day.

146
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:17,708
My hometown is quite remote.

147
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:19,031
We don't have fast food.

148
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:21,757
When I came here to study,
I was struggling financially.

149
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:24,529
A hamburger that cost 10 yuan
was a luxury.

150
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,851
Do you mind me asking, Mr Wu?

151
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,868
What do you do?

152
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:36,032
I'm a lawyer.

153
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,909
Then this is no longer a luxury to you.

154
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,447
He is...

155
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,712
He has autism.

156
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,508
I have heard of it.

157
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:52,420
His condition
seems better than most autistic kids.

158
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,334
It becomes worse if treatment
is not sought earlier.

159
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,421
He is born with it.

160
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,958
Generally, there is no cure.

161
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,503
Is this condition hereditary?

162
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,275
It is not proven medically.

163
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,875
The biggest probability is maybe
getting infected with some disease...

164
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,434
during the fetal period.

165
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,303
Poor kid.

166
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,178
He had no choice but to accept it.

167
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,738
Can he hear us talking?

168
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,235
He can hear some of it.

169
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,992
But autism
helps him automatically block out...

170
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:25,931
all the external messages
that he doesn't like.

171
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:31,278
I'm sorry, Mr Wu.

172
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,034
He is not used to physical contact
with strangers.

173
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,281
He will have a meltdown.

174
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:36,634
I'm really sorry.

175
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:37,604
Here you go.

176
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:38,836
Thanks.

177
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,641
I was a stranger to him initially.

178
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,033
He needs time to accept someone.

179
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:48,787
It might take a really long time.

180
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,628
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine after you get used to it.

181
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,360
That is a Polley watch.

182
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,060
You like collecting watches too?

183
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,040
My previous client
loves collecting these watches too.

184
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,491
The first time I saw it,
I found it quite unique.

185
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,450
What did you say this is?

186
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,539
Polley.

187
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,275
You can't buy the authentic watch here.

188
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,227
I heard its entirely crafted by hand.

189
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:16,521
Buyers have to pre-order it.

190
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,133
Made to order?

191
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,685
I'm not exactly sure.

192
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,389
Anyhow, it's really expensive.

193
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,245
Like jewellery,
its value can appreciate too.

194
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:31,900
I bought this on Taobao.
It cost me a few hundred yuan.

195
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,218
I bought it because I like the design.

196
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:38,512
Maybe it really looks authentic.

197
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,739
Mr Su.

198
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:52,396
Wait for Qin.

199
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,679
-He went up to retrieve my document.
-Okay, Mr Su.

200
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,266
Mr Su.

201
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,801
I'm Wei Hao.
I'm not sure if you remember me.

202
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,686
I do.

203
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,867
I work at Toro.
I saw you in our company a few days ago.

204
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:14,120
I didn't say hi because
there were too many people.

205
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,143
In the past few years,
life didn't go well for Wu Yan.

206
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,669
Did you know that?

207
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,407
I know.

208
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,232
I know it all.

209
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,373
Ms Wu Yan, you are here.

210
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,724
Something came up at home.
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

211
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:42,868
No worries. When I was late,
didn't you help take over too?

212
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,523
I'm returning the favour.

213
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,871
Is this the script?

214
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,015
Go ahead.

215
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,163
Sun.

216
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,545
Do you know of any good radio show?

217
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,889
Let's listen to it.

218
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:25,843
Lately, there is a
nice talk show at this hour.

219
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,986
After the internship ends,
he returned the book to me...

220
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:40,290
with a card inside that says,

221
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:44,723
"I have actually fallen for you
a long time ago."

222
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,580
When reading the letter
from this listener,

223
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,311
I can't help feeling a sense of regret.

224
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:59,731
Hence,
never feel like you don't deserve love.

225
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,302
Just say it out loud.

226
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,740
To quote my personal motto,

227
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:08,780
"I may be ugly,
but what if the other party is blind?"

228
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,544
Go to a nearby KFC Restaurant.

229
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:17,684
I'm hungry.

230
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,953
Yes, Mr Su.

231
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,143
Look at the way you eat.

232
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,455
What an expensive item!

233
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:44,714
One day when we
can't afford to pay for food,

234
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:46,954
I'll sell it to the pawn shop.

235
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,775
How did I end up living with
a sleazy woman like you?

236
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:52,838
What can I do about it?

237
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:55,979
You kept following me around
like you can't live without me.

238
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,773
Do you think...

239
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,970
I should return this to him?

240
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,851
It feels awkward for me
to keep such a luxurious item.

241
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,222
Then just go.

242
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,917
You now have a reason to see him.

243
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,968
I didn't say I want to see him.

244
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,326
I just...

245
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,197
Wu Yan. Do you still love him?

246
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:24,393
I don't know.

247
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,543
Why do you keep his card
if you don't know?

248
00:20:26,623 --> 00:20:29,940
-I saw you put it into your pocket.
-I didn't.

249
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,266
-You did. It's in that pocket.
-I didn't.

250
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,855
Take it out. Quick.

251
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:36,217
Why don't you reconsider it?

252
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,517
Any surgery has its risk.

253
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:40,579
What if there are after-effects?

254
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:41,951
Don't worry.

255
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:44,024
This surgery is like extracting a tooth.

256
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,798
Technology is very advanced nowadays.

257
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:46,864
But extraction...

258
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:48,880
People die from tooth extractions too.

259
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,879
You really have nothing
good to say, don't you?

260
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:56,046
Wu Yan. Let's make a bet.

261
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,809
If I survive the surgery,
you go talk to Su Nian Qin.

262
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:04,006
How about that?

263
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,151
You...

264
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,682
I will definitely lose.

265
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:10,677
Didn't you say this is a minor surgery?

266
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:13,041
Even if you wanted to lose,
the doctor won't let you.

267
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,443
Nobody knows for sure.

268
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,150
Didn't you say
people die from tooth extraction too?

269
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,555
I really mean it.

270
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:21,233
You two should talk it out.

271
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,060
Talk about what?

272
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,243
Anything.

273
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,889
Talk about your feelings at that time,
or talk about the present.

274
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,052
If you really want to
put everything behind...

275
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:36,996
and cut ties completely,
you really have to talk it out.

276
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:40,530
Give that relationship a proper closure.

277
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,328
It helps you to let go too.

278
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:50,244
The nurse has called our number.

279
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:53,884
Go.

280
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,374
Go, quick.

281
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,330
I'll take the bet. Now go.

282
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,595
I'll take the bet.

283
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,821
What bet were you talking about?

284
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,465
Nothing.

285
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,086
She wanted me to talk to Su Nian Qin.

286
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,850
My wife and me are really at our wit's end
when it comes to your bumpy relationship.

287
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,115
What?

288
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:43,023
I met that brat at my company
the other day.

289
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,343
I told him.

290
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:47,863
"You became a CEO overnight,
but do you know how difficult..."

291
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:49,251
"Wu Yan's life is the past few years?"

292
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,341
You...

293
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,113
Why did you tell him that?

294
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:55,247
I...

295
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:58,850
I thought he should know.

296
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,667
-Wu Yan. I know you have your pride.
-But this is not about pride.

297
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,540
That was totally uncalled for.

298
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:07,675
Who doesn't have a hard life?

299
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:10,059
Everyone just pushes on no matter what.

300
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,091
Moreover, we are not
in a relationship anymore.

301
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,795
Why did you tell him that?

302
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,008
Are you trying to make him feel guilty
or feel sorry for me?

303
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:18,017
I don't need that and I don't want that.

304
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:23,152
I'm sorry. I didn't think that...

305
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:24,296
It's okay.

306
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,355
I know you are trying to help me.

307
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:05,826
Thanks.

308
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,700
Wu Yan.

309
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:13,094
I... I'm here.

310
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:14,293
What's wrong?

311
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,754
Don't forget what you promised me.

312
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,584
What are you doing?

313
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,753
I want to feel what it is like
to be blind.

314
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,013
Don't help me.

315
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,638
You are really smart.

316
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,415
You even got yourself a white cane.

317
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:57,083
That famous saying is really true.

318
00:25:57,163 --> 00:26:00,370
Being blind for an hour is not difficult,
being blind for your whole life is.

319
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,735
I never heard of that saying.

320
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,015
Honestly.

321
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:07,315
You didn't close it after taking things.

322
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:08,699
Don't blame me.

323
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,579
What is it now?

324
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:25,977
I just feel that
I had all these bad habits.

325
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:28,176
I definitely caused him a lot of troubles.

326
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:31,208
Thinking of your Young Master Su again?

327
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:34,491
Mumbling to yourself here
won't help anything.

328
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:37,348
I asked you to get back together but you
said there's no old flame to begin with.

329
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:38,517
Now look at you.

330
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,213
You are obviously stuck
and not moving on.

331
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:43,200
It's not like I don't want to move on.

332
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,046
I went for blind dates, didn't I?

333
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:48,840
I met new people
and I'm sure I want to get married.

334
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,004
But I kept recalling...

335
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,393
that first time we met,

336
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,157
the lights and the smell of the lake.

337
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:09,407
My singing was off tune.

338
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,913
He gave me that look.

339
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:14,501
I remember everything so clearly.

340
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,756
I asked myself over and over again. Why?

341
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,049
I'm a forgetful person who...

342
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:26,040
lost her things all the time.
But why do I remember all that?

343
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,704
I came to realise later that...

344
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,370
there are a lot of things
which can't be expressed or forget.

345
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,734
If I can't forget, I'll just let it be.

346
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:38,665
I'll just live with the memories.

347
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,142
It's no big deal.

348
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:46,744
I understand how you feel.

349
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,155
But I really want to know.

350
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,409
Do you think in the past three years,
Su Nian Qin...

351
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:53,165
was doing better than you?

352
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,425
I just feel that sometimes you can't
always stand from your point of view...

353
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:57,727
when you consider things.

354
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:00,647
You are only choreographing
your own story.

355
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,853
When you lost your dad,

356
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:06,061
Su Nian Qin's dad was
on the verge of death too.

357
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:07,584
His life was hanging by a thread.

358
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:10,543
He may look arrogant.

359
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:16,222
But didn't we analyse that
he actually lacks a sense of security?

360
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:19,770
At that time,
you left after lashing it out on him.

361
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,218
How do you think he felt?

362
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,229
Eight, nine, nine.

363
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,319
Hello?

364
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:09,710
Hi, I'm Sang Wu Yan.

365
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,931
I'm looking for Su Nian Qin.

366
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,147
Ms Sang, Mr Su is in a meeting.

367
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:17,286
May I know the reason you called?

368
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:21,180
I want to meet him today.

369
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,571
Is it possible?

370
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,327
No problem.

371
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,437
But when you are here,
I think you might need to wait.

372
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,249
That's fine with me.

373
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,638
Okay.

374
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:38,346
I will text you the hotel address
and room number.

375
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,088
Okay, thanks.

376
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:14,754
-You must be Ms Sang.
-Yes.

377
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,032
Come in.

378
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:17,281
Thanks.

379
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,412
Market share for the new product
can't fully rely on advertising.

380
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:31,315
You are aware of the company's
yearly expenditure on advertising,

381
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,632
don't you?

382
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:34,060
Ms Sang.

383
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,727
Please wait. I will inform Mr Su.

384
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:39,214
No, no.
Let them continue. I'm not in a hurry.

385
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:40,883
We can't afford to repeat history...

386
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:43,892
and spend too much time
on communication channel.

387
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,158
Please take a seat at the study room.

388
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,452
I'll get you some tea.

389
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:54,191
Okay, thanks.

390
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,206
Thanks.

391
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,452
Alright. That's all for today.

392
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,502
Thank you for your hard work.

393
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:14,265
Why don't Mr Su treat us to lunch?

394
00:32:14,688 --> 00:32:15,742
Thank you, Mr Su.

395
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:17,005
-Thank you in advance, Mr Su.
-Thank you in advance, Mr Su.

396
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:19,115
Alright. Pick any restaurant.

397
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:21,985
Report to me immediately
if something comes up.

398
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,040
-Get me my jacket.
-Okay.

399
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:27,556
Mr Su.

400
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:30,332
There's a Ms Sang waiting for you.

401
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:32,378
What did you say?

402
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,826
I haven't heard from her.
She is probably still waiting.

403
00:32:57,736 --> 00:32:59,174
She fell asleep.

404
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,073
You take the team to the restaurant.

405
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:04,814
Give me a call when everything is ready.

406
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:06,017
Okay.

407
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,201
Wu Yan.

408
00:33:52,482 --> 00:33:53,739

434
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,194
Hello. Where are you now?

435
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,190
That proposal was really good.

436
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,621
-Right.
-We can wrap it up soon.

437
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:19,894
Try this.

438
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,489
Mr Su.

439
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,296
Did Ms Sang leave?

440
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:27,864
She's still sleeping.

441
00:38:27,944 --> 00:38:29,317
I didn't wake her up.

442
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,722
Get her something to eat later.

443
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:37,898
Ask the kitchen for something light.

444
00:38:38,824 --> 00:38:40,030
Okay.

445
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,993
What is it, Mr Su?

446
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:07,205
Where is my watch?

447
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:08,431
Weren't you wearing it?

448
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:09,746
No.

449
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,426
I left it beside the basin.

450
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:12,830
I'll look for it.

451
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,631
Mr Su, I found it.

452
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,545
Are you here to return the watch
and cut all ties with me?

453
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,599
This watch...

454
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:09,457
What happened?

455
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,707
I don't know.

456
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,346
I took the wrong one.

457
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:26,171
Why has the watch I gave him
become so worn-out?

458
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:29,531
You not only didn't get to talk,
you even took back a worn-out watch.

459
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:32,457
The most valuable treasure of our home
is gone because of you.

460
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,762
Hello?

461
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,694
It's just a watch.

462
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,359
Do you have to be so happy?

463
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,299
Hello?

464
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,657
I'm Su Nian Qin.

465
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,590
Hi.

466
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,200
My secretary told me
you were here to look for me.

467
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,554
Yes.

468
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:02,848
What is it about?

469
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,290
I...

470
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,060
What is it?

471
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:12,877
When are you inviting me to your wedding?

472
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:17,514
You can't wait for me to get married?

473
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:18,661
No, no.

474
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:20,706
How could I wish that
you marry someone else?

475
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,997
Have you eaten?

476
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:36,101
Yes.

477
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:37,780
No, wait. I haven't.

478
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,491
Have you or have you not?

479
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:43,757
I have but I don't feel full.

480
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:47,605
He probably thinks you have gone mad...

481
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,153
after not seeing you for so many years.

482
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:51,625
Why don't you know if
you have eaten or not?

483
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,310
Do you want to eat out tonight?

484
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,592
I have not eaten anything.

485
00:41:58,672 --> 00:41:59,767
Sure.

486
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:11,656
This is really spicy.

487
00:42:12,118 --> 00:42:14,992
I picked this restaurant
so I can watch you eat this.

488
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:16,066
You...

489
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:17,484
I'm only doing this for you.

490
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:19,776
Nobody would be crazy enough
to have hotpot for supper.

491
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:32,202
Don't you feel this place is noisy?

492
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:33,948
I'm used to it, thanks to your trainings.

493
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:56,742
Why did you grow your hair?
Doesn't it trouble you?

494
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,636
I... I was in a hurry
so I forgot my hairband.

495
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,136
You were in a hurry?

496
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,528
Aren't you eating?

497
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:23,206
You didn't train me to eat spicy food.

498
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,108
Thanks.

499
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,207
Well...

500
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:59,397
I... I understand.

501
00:43:59,477 --> 00:44:02,142
After breaking up,
it might be hard to just be friends.

502
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,305
But,

503
00:44:03,628 --> 00:44:06,220
I hope our relationship
will not be so awkward.

504
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,386
When we broke up,
I was probably too impulsive.

505
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:13,899
I said a lot of things that hurt you.

506
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,661
So, if you still feel offended,

507
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,924
I apologise.

508
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:20,702
I accept.

509
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,112
I accept your apology.
