(Emergency)

4
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:14,945
Were you looking for me?

5
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:16,723
No.

6
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,075
However, I was waiting for you.

7
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,324
I've fallen sick.

8
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,544
You fell sick because
you were caught in rain?

9
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,160
You won't get anywhere.

10
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,999
Sang Wu Yan,
you weren't like this in the past.

11
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,903
Even when I injured my finger, you were...

12
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:37,081
That's right. I learned it from you.

13
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,817
Now, my heart is as cold as metal.

14
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,454
So, where is the metal?

15
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:43,835
Su Nian Qin!

16
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,652
I heard from an ophthalmologist
not long ago that...

17
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,712
eye surgery may affect the brain.

18
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,505
I think something is wrong with you.

19
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:58,634
I...

20
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,853
Enough of you. You're alike and kicking.

21
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:03,261
Will you please stop adding burden
to the hospital?

22
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,663
Do what you need.

23
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:06,652
Stop following me.

24
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:14,657
Mr Su.

25
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,029
Are all women so cruel?

26
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,760
Mr Su, let's go back.

27
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,457
No way.

28
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:28,990
I have to send her back.

29
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,443
Tell Sun to bring the car here.

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm not like you.

31
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,385
Falling in love with someone...

32
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,188
isn't that easy for me.

33
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,631
Let alone forgetting someone.

34
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,093
I was serious.

35
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,339
There is no expiration date
when it comes to you.

36
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,063
Hello.

37
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,561
Have you entered your house?

38
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,635
Why didn't you switch on the lights?

39
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,141
How do you know?

40
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,328
Why are you here?

41
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:42,009
Why can't I be here?

42
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:46,449
Are you free tomorrow?

43
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,504
Su Nian Qin. What are you doing?

44
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:51,535
I'm courting you.

45
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:55,387
Wu Yan.

46
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:59,155
Will you date me?

47
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,056
I mean,

48
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,603
let's start all over again.

49
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,676
I'll make the question simple.

50
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,520
Will you go on a movie date
with me tomorrow?

51
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,314
Now, I am able to watch movies with you.

52
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,480
I have something to do tomorrow.

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,791
Maybe next time.

54
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,326
What do you need to work on?

55
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,157
I can fetch you.

56
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:32,376
It's okay.

57
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:36,949
Tomorrow...

58
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:40,261
is my dad's death anniversary.

59
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,174
Go home, it's getting late.

60
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,009
Goodnight.

61
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,540
(Tomb of beloved father, Sang Jing De,
mother Cheng Jia Ying)

62
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,320
My broadcast...

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,679
I'm sure you listen to it on time, right?

64
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,864
Lately, I've received
more and more letters.

65
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:51,749
I think I'm kind of popular
in our hometown.

66
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,659
I'm going to graduate soon.

67
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,496
My thesis is going quite well.

68
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:02,966
All thanks to
the smart brain that I got from you.

69
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:04,815
By the way, Dad,

70
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:08,926
lately, I've been guiding a child
with severe autism.

71
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:13,061
Sometimes, I really felt helpless.

72
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,467
However,

73
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,197
all of a sudden, I got why
you made me study psychology.

74
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:21,797
It's so that
I can live an optimistic life.

75
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:24,002
Now, when I think back,

76
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,594
it does feel that
everything can be overcome.

77
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,750
Hello.

78
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,089
Hello, Wu Yan.

79
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,049
Where are you?

80
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,662
It sounds like an open area.

81
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,289
I'm at the cemetery.

82
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,777
The wind is strong.

83
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:55,175
Today is my dad's death anniversary.

84
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:56,981
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,599
Sorry to have interrupted you.

86
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,800
It's okay.

87
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,079
Why did you call?

88
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:03,537
Nothing much.

89
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,418
Let me pick you and your mum up.

90
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
It's okay. I've called a taxi.

91
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,486
All right.

92
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:20,123
I was serious last time.

93
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:21,733
Thank you, Mr Wu.

94
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,280
Who called you?

95
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,614
It was Wu Yu.

96
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:39,386
What did he say?

97
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,263
How are things going on
between you and him?

98
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,424
My biggest wish
is to see you find a life partner...

99
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:50,279
the soonest possible.

100
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,317
After your dad's demise,

101
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,588
I've thought it through.

102
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:59,675
As long as he cherishes you
and he's able to sustain the family,

103
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,422
everything else doesn't matter.

104
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,345
Mum, you're a career woman.

105
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:09,759
Why do you keep mentioning
about sustaining a family?

106
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,773
Look. I can make money on my own.

107
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:14,448
Isn't it great for me to live like this?

108
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,136
Look for someone
who is a good fit for you.

109
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:18,399
Isn't it great to be with each other?

110
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,815
Furthermore, Wu is not bad of a guy.

111
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,223
Look, he's handsome
and he has a good job.

112
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,119
No doubt his family background
is not great,

113
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,475
but those who come from such
families usually cherish things better.

114
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:33,233
He's good tempered and nice to people.

115
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:36,506
Be it from the psychological perspective
or the sociological perspectives,

116
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:39,250
your judgment is untenable.

117
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,200
Moreover, didn't you just say that
all these aren't important?

118
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,788
Why did you
start listing out the requirements?

119
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,649
Of course I won't let you marry
someone who would mistreat you.

120
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,220
You're short-tempered.

121
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,835
You should know that.

122
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,119
Of course I hope that you can marry
someone with good temperament.

123
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:02,567
As the elders in the family
are not around,

124
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:03,878
if two hot-tempered persons are together,

125
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,158
they might drive each other up the wall.

126
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:09,662
Where are you?

127
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,325
Look to the right.

128
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,034
Look.

129
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:25,905
I'm talking about something serious
but you're not taking it to heart.

130
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,685
Listen.

131
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,008
Your future husband
has to be healthy, okay?

132
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,253
I'm not looking for a slave.

133
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:38,048
Otherwise, if he dies early,

134
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,815
you'll be all alone.

135
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,847
All right, Mum.

136
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,584
Let's go shopping.

137
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,200
Let's go eat and shop.

138
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,351
I need some new clothes.

139
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,271
No.

140
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,196
The streets are crowded.

141
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,385
-You can go alone.
-Come with me.

142
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:03,130
I'm not going no matter what.

143
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,228
Let's go.

144
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,010
Miss 007.

145
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:43,840
Wait for me at school.

146
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,192
How could 007 let his Bond girl
wander around alone?

147
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,668
Why are you leaving in a rush, Miss 007?

148
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,461
My name is Sang Wu Yan.
I've no idea who you're referring to.

149
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,573
Okay.

150
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:03,855
Where is your fiance?

151
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,488
He is not my fiance.

152
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:06,879
Wow.

153
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,312
Are you throwing hints?

154
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:12,516
When a lady
claims that she doesn't have a fiance,

155
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:15,417
she's actually throwing hints
to the man standing before her.

156
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,755
Why do you...

157
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:23,380
That's because I'm really interested in
Su Nian Qin's crush.

158
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,051
I would like to know why he chose you,

159
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,697
but when it comes to
my sister who is as pretty as a fairy,

160
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,326
he doesn't even bother to throw a glance.

161
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,149
Firstly, I refused to be studied.

162
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:37,303
Furthermore, your behaviour
has caused harassment to me.

163
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,349
Secondly,

164
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:41,290
nowadays, not everyone looks at
the opposite gender...

165
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,451
with the aesthetic sense of animals.

166
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,221
For example, you're quite good looking.

167
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,927
However, I'm very annoyed to see you
flaunting your tail like a peacock.

168
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:51,819
Wow.

169
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,660
I suddenly have a feeling...

170
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,364
the possibility that you are his fiance
is slightly higher.

171
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,635
Why?

172
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,306
Now I get it.

173
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:03,313
Are you the same kind of person
as Su Nian Qin?

174
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,281
Are you also someone
who keep your own counsel...

175
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,762
and come from money?

176
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:10,290
There is another possibility.

177
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,136
He loves you so much,
he's losing his mind.

178
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,474
I think he likes me.

179
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:18,091
But I think it's a far cry from love.

180
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:21,287
Speaking about losing his mind,
isn't he crazy all this while?

181
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,673
That's interesting.

182
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,167
Now, I'm more interested in you.

183
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:26,046
Let's go. Let me buy you a meal.

184
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,436
Don't drag me.

185
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,504
No.

186
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:33,127
How can you just leave?
What about that pretty lady?

187
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,502
That's my secretary.

188
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:35,763
I told her to go back.

189
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:37,093
Secretary?

190
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,237
As long as someone is pretty,

191
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,094
you tend to claim that
she's your secretary.

192
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:42,728
Wu Yan.

193
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:44,823
You can't have double standards.

194
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,393
Just because I hired a pretty lady
as my secretary,

195
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:47,626
I'm a playboy?

196
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:48,715
How about Su Nian Qin?

197
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,393
Including my sister,
he's surrounded by so many pretty ladies.

198
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:54,175
You didn't comment about that.

199
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:57,126
Will you stop mentioning Su Nian Qin?

200
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,741
Why do you care about him so much?

201
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:01,825
Wu Yan.

202
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,918
Are you even jealous of a guy?

203
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:06,090
Let's go.

204
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,842
I said, stop dragging me!

205
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:09,965
Watch out!

206
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,443
I've only met you twice but I get myself
in danger every time.

207
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:26,245
Judging from the situation,

208
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,906
I bet Su Nian Qin
is tortured by you to the max.

209
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:30,458
Don't move.

210
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,350
You need to get treatment at the hospital.

211
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,700
I can do it. Thank you.

212
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,860
(Toro)

213
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,397
Our collaboration with Toro
is proceeding smoothly.

214
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,938
Thank you, everyone
from the branch office for the help.

215
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:58,385
Mr Su.

216
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,684
The headquarters Sales Department
wishes to speak to you.

217
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:00,979
Tell them I'm in a meeting.

218
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:04,544
My job at the branch office
is coming to an end.

219
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:06,284
-As such...
-Mr Su.

220
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,235
Ms Peng of Toro is on the phone.

221
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,132
Tell her I'm having a meeting.

222
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,216
I'm going back to the headquarters
on Friday.

223
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,460
Some arrangements...

224
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,513
Mr Su, Mr Peng of Toro...

225
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,970
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

226
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,188
Mr Peng said it's something important.

227
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:31,993
One Ms Sang
was involved in a road accident.

228
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:33,833
So, you must go there.

229
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,564
What?

230
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,302
Keep the wound dry.

231
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,517
Don't forget to come again for dressing.

232
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:50,668
Thank you.

233
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:57,084
The battery is flat.

234
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:05,011
You can't leave yet.

235
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,309
My phone is dead. I need to charge it.

236
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:10,794
Your phone is dead?
The timing is just right.

237
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,405
Help me with an experiment.

238
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,944
I just saved your life.

239
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,997
It's not out of line
to do me a favour, right?

240
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:22,999
What experiment is that?

241
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:26,457
It's to examine
how fast Su Nian Qin could be...

242
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:28,043
when it comes to his true love.

243
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,439
I called him using your phone just now...

244
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,844
and informed him that
you were involved in a road accident.

245
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,156
You!

246
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,763
How could you make such joke?

247
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:38,862
You look like you're in pain.
I'm just doing you a favour.

248
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,730
It's for the sake of my sister too.

249
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,734
I hope she can give up early.

250
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,842
I'm not in pain.

251
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,150
Stop finding excuses for your mischief.

252
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,957
You looked as if you're going to
burst in tears when you smiled bitterly.

253
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,303
Do you know that?

254
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,379
Ten minutes.

255
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,955
From his company to the hospital,
it would take about ten minutes.

256
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:00,204
Ten minutes later,

257
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,497
you'll know
if Su Nian Qin really cares about you.

258
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:10,350
I don't need it.

259
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,881
I don't need to get the answer like this.

260
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,620
Call him and tell him I'm fine.

261
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,687
If something happens to him
when he's rushing to the hospital,

262
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:19,982
you'll be doomed.

263
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,090
Don't go!

264
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:03,888
Are you coming?

265
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:26,741
Where is Wu Yan?

266
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,996
What happened to Wu Yan?

267
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,995
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:34,462
Wu Yan is fine but she's left.

269
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:35,673
What?

270
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,482
Well...

271
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:40,581
I tricked you.

272
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,864
I ran into Wu Yan on the street.

273
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:45,874
Suddenly, a bicycle came
and knocked into us.

274
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,867
She scrapped her forehead.
It's just an abrasion wound.

275
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:52,154
I suddenly had the idea
to make good use of the chance...

276
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:55,163
to see if you're indeed a couple.

277
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,372
Good to know that she's fine.

278
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,700
It seems that the experiment is a success.

279
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,065
If Wu Yan were here...

280
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,704
Stop calling her name.

281
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,433
Also,

282
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:16,781
stay away from her.

283
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:39,670
Mr Su.

284
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:43,271
We've been waiting for an hour.
Should we look somewhere else?

285
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,167
Sorry, the number
you've dialled is not available.

286
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:59,253
Look for her along the bus route.

287
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,384
Sure.

288
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Sorry, the number
you've dialled is not available.

289
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,515
It's Ms Sang.

290
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:36,423
Pull over.

291
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,931
(Do not imitate dangerous behaviour)

292
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,333
Watch out!

293
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:54,260
Wu Yan.

294
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,866

00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:25,368
If I succumb to him,

323
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:27,648

I was never a hesitant person.

I guess I'm at the age
where I'm afraid of losing.

00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,533
Su Nian Qin told me that...

330
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:54,259
I used to fall in love
with people very easily...

331
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,348
and I drown myself in love.

332

Was I really that kind of person?

333
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:01,954
After listening to him, I realised that...

334
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,883
I've changed so much without me knowing.

335
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,928
However, if I've changed so much,
then why...

336
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,510
I thought it's because I was young
and it was the first time I fell in love,

337
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,986
that's why I fell in love
with a lunatic like him.

338
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,360
I thought as time passed...

339
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,872
and as I've grown up,
I won't make the same mistake.

340
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:28,369
However...

341
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,224
It's so annoying.

342
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,902
I still like him.

343
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,510
I can't believe that I still like him.

344
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:52,954
Qin.

345
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,387
You may leave now.

346
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,374
She's your real boss, isn't it?

347
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,265
You may go home now.

348
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:05,530
Thanks for the hard work.

349
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,150
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

350
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:17,391
You still haven't won her heart.

351
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:20,544
I think you're aging for nothing.

352
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,013
You must have plenty of time.

353
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,854
That's why you're here
to be sarcastic to me.

354
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,583
I'm just bored of waiting.
That's why I'm here to offer help.

355
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,783
Nian Qin, don't just pester the girl
without any plan.

356
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:36,433
Think about it before...

357
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:37,857
She doesn't love anymore.

358
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,193
Furthermore, what happened to her dad...

359
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,692
I was too impulsive.

360
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,461
I couldn't control my recklessness
the moment I saw her.

361
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:54,866
However...

362
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:56,003
Nian Qin.

363
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:58,806
Have you ever asked her opinion?

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,341
It's been three years.

365
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:06,436
You should at least talk to her
and ask her about it.

366
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,297
I don't dare to ask.

367
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,362
There is no need to ask.

368
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,750
Regardless of the answer,

369
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,350
I'll still love her.

370
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:40,546
(Library)

371
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,872
Here.

372
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,601
Haven't I taught you before?

373
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,208
When you play piano,

374
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:19,248
pretend that
you're holding an egg in your hand.

375
00:26:23,603 --> 00:26:25,077
Let's not do this.

376
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:26,992
How long would it take
for an ordinary person...

377
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,435
to master a song?

378
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,083
It's different for everyone.

379
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,435
Some people would take three years...

380
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:35,909
while some people
would only need a few days.

381
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,245
Xiao Jie.
Let me teach you how to play piano, okay?

382
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:55,235
Here. Look.

383
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,374
Ms Xiao Lu, you got married?

384
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,544
I got married to
a nerdy university lecturer.

385
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,391
Congratulations.

386
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:38,932
Let's not talk about me.

387
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:41,725
I was observing you from the outside.

388
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,768
Don't you think
he is really like Nian Qin?

389
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,919
Be it the behaviour or the expression,

390
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,190
even the appearance is similar too.

391
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:55,290
Xiao Jie has autism.

392
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,294
Nian Qin had it too when he was young.

393
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,775
I think he's still suffering
from the side effects until now.

394
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:04,173
Have you met Nian Qin?

395
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:08,940
You're still in love with him, right?

396
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:11,962
Yes.

397
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,938
Then why won't you get back together?

398
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:16,724
I'm no longer a young girl.

399
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,516
I've changed so much.

400
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,946
I won't be impulsive anymore.

401
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:23,937
Perhaps we're not meant for each other.

402
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:30,195
Well, he's indeed
getting more and more impulsive.

403
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:32,384
Wu Yan.

404
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,394
Do you know on the first night
when Nian Qin reached Tongcheng,

405
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:35,558
he got drunk?

406
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,448
It's no longer news.

407
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,055
Ever since you left,

408
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:42,828
he became an alcoholic
for a period of time.

409
00:28:42,908 --> 00:28:44,301
No one could stop him.

410
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:48,411
At night, he went to bed
while listening to the MP3 player.

411
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:50,847
The next day, he would behave normally
when he woke up.

412
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:52,612
Wu Yan.

413
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,308
How many blind dates
have you attended in the past?

414
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,874
I guess it's twice.

415
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:01,090
No.

416
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,466
Including the time Nian Qin showed up,

417
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:05,209
you attended three blind dates.

418
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:21,095
Didn't you feel anything?

419
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,587
Don't you feel that...

420
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:28,372
no doubt you've been struggling
in the past three years,

421
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,144
but everything went your way?

422
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,171
For example,

423
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:38,174
your dad's office in the university
was preserved for no reason?

424
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,752
Why did the radio station
agree almost immediately...

425
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:42,513
when you requested
to work the night shift?

426
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:47,899
Wu Yan has been
attending blind dates lately.

427
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:50,786
I guess she plans
to settle down and get married.

428
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:29,733
Hello, boss.

429
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:30,841
What's the matter?

430
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:33,315
Make some arrangements.

431
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,370
I'm going to Tongcheng
to liaise with Toro.

432
00:30:37,956 --> 00:30:39,106
Sure.

433
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,244
Xiao Lu.

434
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,680
Please get the watch repaired.

435
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,996
Make sure it remains the same.

436
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:01,067
Okay.

437
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,380
(Su Nian Qin, Sang Wu Yan)

438
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:30,682
Upon knowing that
you were attending blind dates,

439
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,097
he couldn't take it anymore.

440
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:34,166
Otherwise, he might continue hiding.

441
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:36,399
Actually,

442
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:39,578
he knows everything about you.

443
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,536
However, he didn't have the guts
to appear in front of you.

444
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,161
It's because of your dad.

445
00:31:44,865 --> 00:31:46,855
He still feels very sorry for that.

446
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,233
Therefore, he thinks that he only deserves
to protect you from far.

447
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:53,227
He thinks that he shouldn't go near you.

448
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,548
As you know,

449
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:59,746
Nian Qin has extreme low self-esteem.

450
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:03,758
He is too afraid to face the fact that
you no longer love him.

451
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,552
That's why he decided to run away.

452
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:07,883
However, he can't forget you.

453
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,250
For the past three years,

454
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:13,814
he threw himself
into managing the company.

455
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,805
He wants to get everything in order
to prove to you and your mum...

456
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,411
that he is a good fit for you.

457
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:25,510
It's twisted, isn't it?

458
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:30,143
However, it shows that
he loves you very much.

459
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:32,426
His love is deeper
than what you could imagine.

460
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:35,809
Of course.

461
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:39,684
You may summarise these crazy behaviours
into one word,

462
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:40,973
lunatic.

463
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,921
He's a sheer lunatic.

464
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:48,157
You're an expert on this.

465
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:50,823
He's mental.

466
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:17,696
Spill the beans. What's wrong?

467
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:20,937
You asked me out but you just let me
watch you drink in silence.

468
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:22,359
It's not appropriate.

469
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,493
He's so annoying.

470
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,407
He used to be so hard to please
in the past.

471
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:35,767
But it turns out he's
the most annoying creature on earth.

472
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:38,575
Why couldn't he be a jerk until the end?

473
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:43,040
Why must he
pretend to be a faithful lover now?

474
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,409
Now, I don't know what should I do.

475
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,868
What did he do?

476
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,824
Tell me why.

477
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:53,794
Why does he behave
like a complete different person?

478
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:56,415
Moreover,
he takes everything upon himself.

479
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,337
It's even harder to handle him now.

480
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,007
I really don't get it.

481
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:01,188
I really...

482
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:04,575
Look, the structure of men and women
are indeed...

483
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:05,761
quite different. Am I right?

484
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:06,877
No, listen.

485
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,577
I told you to talk to him.

486
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:10,254
Did you talk to each other?

487
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,968
No matter how much he's changed,
your views are the most important.

488
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:15,789
Do you want to start all over again?

489
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,964
I don't know.

490
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:22,249
Look at you. You're merely in a dilemma.

491
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,947
Where has the old Sang Wu Yan gone?

492
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,366
If you have anything to say,

493
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:29,258
just let him know.

494
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:31,354
Why are you mad at yourself?

495
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:35,389
You're right.

496
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:38,349
I'll call him now.

497
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,704
Hey. You only hear what you want to hear.

498
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:01,591
Hello.

499
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,294
What's wrong, Wu Yan?

500
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,886
Su Nian Qin, you're such a jerk!

501
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:18,613
Why didn't you lie and say
that you love me?

502
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:22,013
Why did you keep quiet back then?

503
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:24,756
Why?

504
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,352
Since we've separated for so long,
why did you come back to me?

505
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:30,550
Why did you make my heart flutter again?
Su Nian Qin, you're inhumane!

506
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:34,047
Why did you drink so much?

507
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:35,908
Is anyone by your side?

508
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,054
No.

509
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:42,932
I mean, Xu Qian is here.

510
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,485
Where are you?

511
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:47,111
Why should I tell you?

512
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:49,687
Pass your phone to Xu Qian.

513
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:52,377
Why should I let her talk to you?

514
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:54,134
Why should I listen to you?

515
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:55,444
Sang Wu Yan.

516
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,584
Pass the phone to Xu Qian.

517
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:00,728
Now.

518
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,034
Hello.

519
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,233
Ms Xu.

520
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:17,882
Please send me your current address.

521
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:21,657
Besides that, please take care
of Wu Yan until I reach there.

522
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:24,314
Okay, got it.

523
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,933
(Wu Yan: Address of hot pot restaurant)

524
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:30,165
Something is not right.

525
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,484
Why do I feel as if I'm his subordinate?

526
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:41,420
Here.

527
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,498
How much did you guys drink?

528
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:05,574
I guess it's about two bottles of beer.

529
00:37:05,654 --> 00:37:08,012
Do you drive? I can send you back.

530
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,509
It's okay. My husband will be here soon.

531
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:13,271
We'll wait for your husband
before we leave.

532
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,547
It's late.
It's not safe to leave you alone.

533
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,132
He's here.

534
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:22,482
I'm leaving.

535
00:37:22,562 --> 00:37:23,790
Ms Xu.

536
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,110
Thank you for taking care of Wu Yan.

537
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,840
I should be held responsible
for this episode.

538
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,367
No, not only for today.

539
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:36,437
I know that
you've been taking good care of her.

540
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:38,076
Thank you.

541
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:55,247
You just deliberately
let him take her away?

542
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:56,815
If Mrs Sang knew about it, she would...

543
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:58,536
If you don't tell her,
how would she know?

544
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:01,246
Let's talk about it when we're home.

545
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:42,778
No.

546
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:46,764
Give it to me.

547
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,458
No.

548
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:01,316
Don't move.

549
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,740
Wu Yan.

550
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:11,604
Rest early.

551
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:13,332
Let's continue tomorrow, okay?

552
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,611
Wu Yan.

553
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:23,717
Give it to me.

554
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:24,995
No.

555
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:27,159
If you spill the beer,

556
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,373
you'll feel discomfort
due to the stickiness.

557
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:32,537
If you break the bottle,
what should I do if you cut yourself?

558
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,660
I won't break it.

559
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:36,395
All right.

560
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:37,768
Just hug it.

561
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:39,947
Sure.

562
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:41,263
Give me a hug.

563
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:44,004
Who are you?

564
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,305
Who do you think I am?

565
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,840
How do I know who you are?

566
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,038
But I'm pretty sure that
you're trying to seduce me.

567
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,032
That's right.

568
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,877
I'm Su Nian Qin.

569
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:04,492
How is that possible?

570
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:08,054
There's no way you're Su Nian Qin.

571
00:40:08,134 --> 00:40:10,461
He wouldn't talk to me like this.

572
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,350
He always shouts at me.

573
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,896
He would say,

574
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,213
"Sang Wu Yan, shut up."

575
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:19,251
"Sang Wu Yan, go away."

576
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:21,531
"Sang Wu Yan, don't make noise."

577
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,192
I didn't make noise. I'm not noisy.

578
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,340
Wu Yan,

579
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:35,118
from now on,
I won't throw tantrums at you, okay?

580
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,773
Really?

581
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:38,933
Yes.

582
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,034
Give me a hug.

583
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:14,107
Why did you place my shoes
on the coffee table?

584
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:17,383
In the past, no matter
where I placed your shoes,

585
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:20,166
you would kick them to the middle
and I'd end up tripping.

586
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,516
It's safest
to place your shoes on the table.

587
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:26,017
Am I so bad?

588
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:30,095
There is more.

589
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:31,526
Once,

590
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:35,583
you forgot to put the kettle
with hot water back to its original spot.

591
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:38,463
You placed it at the edge of the stove.
I burnt myself because of that.

592
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:42,365
Is it? I don't remember it anymore.

593
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,493
Just forget it if you don't remember.

594
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:55,227
It looks longer from here.

595
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,814
Why are your lashes so thick?

596
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,744
Can you pluck a few lashes of yours
and put it on my eyes?

597
00:42:06,987 --> 00:42:08,439
You can have all of them.

598
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:11,054
You're smiling.

599
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:12,342
You...

600
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:14,522
Stop smiling.

601
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:16,779
It's really dangerous.

602
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,758
From now on,
you're only allowed to smile at me.

603
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:22,279
Don't smile when you're out there alone.

604
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:25,199
Those girls are really dangerous.

605
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:28,629
Su Nian Qin.

606
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,839
You only belong to me, okay?

607
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:36,202
I have always
belonged to you and only you.

608
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:38,402
You're lying.

609
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:40,849
I've never lied to you.

610
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,978
Ever since you appeared in my life,
I have always belonged to you.

611
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:51,148
Hold on.

612
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:54,090
Say that you're mine.

613
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,265
You're mine.

614
00:42:57,915 --> 00:42:59,020
That's right.

615
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:01,063
No, that's not right.

616
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:02,681
You said it the other way round.

617
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,651
It seems that you're quite sober.

618
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,509
I won't be shy then.

619
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:11,746
You haven't said it.

620
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,772
I'm yours.

621
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,924
Su Nian Qin belongs to Sang Wu Yan.

622
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,523
Now and forever.

623
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,433
Wu Yan.
