Slow down.

Slow down, slow down.

5
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,310
Slow down. Slow down, slow down.

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,003
I...

7
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,054
I...

8
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,452
I'm just wondering...

9
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:31,000
if you need me to hold you?

10
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:34,861
No.

11
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,611
Ms Sang, aren't you coming?

12
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:49,088
Yes.

13
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:54,329
Mr Su, just call me Sang.

14
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,318
I'm not a teacher yet.

15
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,646
The school director's office
is on the right.

16
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:12,858
Thank you.

17
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:14,915
Mr Su.

18
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,703
See you later.

19
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,203
Mr Su.

20
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:33,260
Mrs Zheng posted on
her social media yesterday.

21
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,071
She's already in the labor room.

22
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,156
I bet she's going to give birth today.

23
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,543
-So soon?
-It's not.

24
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,889
You've taken over her classes
for more than a month.

25
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,255
Mr Li.

26
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:44,859
Mr Wang.

27
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,309
Let me introduce to you.

28
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,544
This is Mr Li.

29
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,689
This is Sang Wu Yan.

30
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,260
Our new teacher intern.

31
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:53,905
You'll be assisting Mr Li in the future.

32
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,511
Help out on the class affairs.

33
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:56,700
Hello, Mr Li.

34
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,443
Please guide me in the future.

35
00:03:58,523 --> 00:03:59,491
Of course I will.

36
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,956
I look forward the most
to new interns every year.

37
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,539
It makes my work easier.

38
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,097
Well.

39
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,933
In our school,
interns and substitute teachers...

40
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:11,417
share the same office.

41
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,182
Your desk is beside Mr Su.

42
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:16,113
Sure.

43
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,875
Mr Su.

44
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:19,555
She's Sang Wu Yan.

45
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,735
I've arranged her to sit beside you.

46
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,503
This is Su Nian Qin.
You can call him Mr Su.

47
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,073
Hello, Mr Su.

48
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:27,514
Hello.

49
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,443
Mr Su is a Braille teacher.

50
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,837
Since you're sitting beside him,
do look after each other.

51
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:34,444
Mr Su.

52
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,093
I'll be here every Thursday and Friday.

53
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,598
Please provide me guidance.

54
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,737
Please don't say that.

55
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm busy. I'll get going.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,444
Okay.

57
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,704
Wu Yan.

58
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,203
Do you want to move out with me?

59
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:30,507
I've found a house.

60
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:31,716
I always come back late.

61
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:33,950
The dormitory curfew is annoying.

62
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,275
I'd better move out.

63
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,413
Do you want to come with me?

64
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:37,446
Okay.

65
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,468
Tell Lu Lu about it then.

66
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:41,146
You know what?

67
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,972
Do you remember
that blind guy I told you before?

68
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:46,848
I met him
at the special education school today.

69
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,500
That prince charming at first sight?

70
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,287
He works as a Braille teacher there.

71
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,449
I even got to know his name today.

72
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,043
It's Su Nian Qin.

73
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:56,869
Nian Qin?

74
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,333
I've researched about it.

75
00:06:58,413 --> 00:06:59,579
Let me show you.

76
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,646
Qin means Blanket?

77
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,931
He must be from a poor family
that can't afford blankets.

78
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:08,158
What if his name was given before birth?

79
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:12,480
Then his parents must be poor
before they got married.

80
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,645
Chinese parents...

81
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,251
tend to put their hopes
in their children's name.

82
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,843
You're really something.

83
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,229
Su Nian Qin.

84
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,305
Nian Qin.

85
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,025
Nian Qin.

86
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,112
Nian Qin.

87
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,215
Su Nian Qin.

88
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,008
Wu Yan.

89
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:39,166
Wipe your mouth. You're drooling.

90
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,950
You know what?

91
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,630
He remembered my voice.

92
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:49,415
He knew it right away
that we met before in the radio station.

93
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:54,567
Do you think
it's because my voice is recognisable?

94
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:00,547
But after meeting him for two days,
I think he has a bad temper.

95
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,863
He seems cold.

96
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,147
He always has that unfriendly vibe.

97
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,206
But he is gentle to the students.

98
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,330
Do you think
he misunderstood me as a stalker?

99
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,080
We always meet unexpectedly.

100
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,036
How should I explain our fate to him?

101
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,886
Tell him that
it's an ill-fated relationship.

102
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,173
He can't run from it.

103
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,347
You're annoying.

104
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,853
Ill-fated relationship?

105
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,897
That's also a kind of fate.

106
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,727
Director.

107
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,741
I need you to sign this document.

108
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,999
Something urgent came up.
Take a seat first.

109
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,092
I'll be back soon.

110
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,416
The scenery in Jiangnan
is as beautiful as before.

111
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,671
Sunrise appears redder than fire.

112
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:16,671
When spring comes, the green lake-water
turns azure blue.

113
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,786
Who could have forgotten Jiangnan?

114
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,295
This music genre...

115
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,380
(Music Office)

116
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:11,360
Who's that?

117
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,257
It's me.

118
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,348
You are...

119
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:16,450
Wu Yan.

120
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,025
Sang Wu Yan.

121
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:20,851
What is the matter?

122
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,467
Nothing.

123
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:25,731
I heard the piano
from the opposite office.

124
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,477
It sounded beautiful.
So I came to take a look.

125
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,167
I've finished playing.

126
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:35,704
You may go.

127
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,511
Please shut the door.

128
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:09,525
Why is he so arrogant?

129
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:23,717
Yin Yin, are you done packing up
in the dorm?

130
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,639
I might go home late today.

131
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,630
Okay.

132
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:31,892
Bye.

133
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,984
(Music Broadcast)

134
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,959
Chins up.

135
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,677
Wu Yan.

136
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:53,664
From today onwards,
you'll join the News Department.

137
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,187
Find Mr Jiang on the eighth floor.

138
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,216
He'll guide you.

139
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:58,651
Take a seat.

140
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,369
I apologise for not asking
before transferring you.

141
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:07,988
But you'll learn a lot
in the News Department.

142
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,467
You must trust me on this.

143
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:12,232
But why so sudden, Miss Xi?

144
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,118
At first I thought you should learn more
about the music market...

145
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,838
and get more in touch
with record companies.

146
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,042
But Mr Jiang needs helpers urgently.

147
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,437
If you sharpen your skills
and expand your network...

148
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,840
in the News Department,
you'll grow faster.

149
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:29,738
I got it.

150
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,034
Thank you, Miss Xi.

151
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:33,704
But the pace in News Department
is much faster than us...

152
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,206
and more precise too.

153
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,264
It'll be a good opportunity
to re-organise...

154
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,110
the brain of yours
that is only full of Yi Jin.

155
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,021
I... That's not true.

156
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,763
My brain functions well.

157
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,560
Wu Yan, do your best.

158
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,249
You're my apprentice.

159
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,531
The office is usually empty.

160
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:00,860
They will only come back
when the deadlines are near.

161
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,337
Your job is to receive emails everyday.

162
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,039
Notices are extremely important
to reporters.

163
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,743
Everyday, you have to gather
and sort out notices, messages...

164
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:12,137
and hot topics of the day
for the reporters.

165
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,158
The proposal meeting every morning...

166
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:16,762
will decide the schedules
for each reporter.

167
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:19,648
Everyday?

168
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,842
Yes, everyday.

169
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,678
There's another trainee here.

170
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,451
You can discuss and take turns doing it.

171
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,340
Okay.

172
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,930
Xiao Xu is here.

173
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:32,723
Xiao Xu.

174
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,231
This is our newcomer, Sang Wu Yan.

175
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:36,431
Get to know each other.

176
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,658
Tell her about the writing format.

177
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:40,840
I have to attend a meeting now.
I'm leaving now.

178
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,589
I didn't know you're the newcomer.

179
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,405
That's your seat.

180
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,597
Can you send me the format
for statistics report?

181
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:07,723
Tonight is my roommate's birthday.
I need to finish up earlier...

182
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,743
and get off work on time. Thank you.

183
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,075
Okay, I'll send you an email.

184
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,710
(Radio Station)

185
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,510
You're so successful in this field
but I heard you have side jobs.

186
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,647
Or could it be that songwriting
is your side job?

187
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,698
Yes.

188
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,385
Mr Yi Jin.

189
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:48,131
Is there any meaning
behind your stage name?

190
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:51,400
Does Yi Jin symbolise a night and a day?

191
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,117
Or is it to commemorate
someone or something?

192
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,221
It's easier to write.

193
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,848
Many songs you wrote
touched the hearts of many female fans.

194
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,562
For example, "Fall"
and "Dream Under The Night Sky".

195
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:08,483
Were they your personal stories?

196
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,007
No.

197
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,946
They are...

198
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,736
Why did my battery die now?

199
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,129
You know know? That place is great.

200
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,306
-We should go and see next time.
-Yes.

201
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,645
Do you still want this?

202
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,884
No, it'll be too much.

203
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,090
Wu Yan.

204
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,818
-Over here.
-There's she is. Wu Yan.

205
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:38,805
Are you ready to place order?

206
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:40,907
I heard the signature dish is good.

207
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:42,820
-What dish is that?
-Let's try it later.

208
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,706
-What was it again?
-I'll check the menu again.

209
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:45,836
Okay.

210
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,295
Why didn't you answer my call?

211
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,395
My phone is out of battery.

212
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,859
I've already texted you immediately.

213
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:53,994
Don't blame me if you didn't see it.

214
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,365
We're from the same hometown. That's all.

215
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:02,990
Waiter, please take our order.

216
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:07,868
Any add-ons?

217
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,070
Add on beef. Wu Yan likes it.

218
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,675
We'll have this.

219
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:13,880
This as well.

220
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,533
Okay. Please hold on.

Wu Yan.

248
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,179
-I'm going out for some fresh air.
-Why are you avoiding me?

249
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,160
I'm not.

250
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,543
You didn't answer my calls
and even moved out.

251
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:54,120
When you saw me at school,
you took another route.

252
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,262
Don't deny it.

253
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:58,117
If you can transfer to another university,
I bet you would.

254
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,187
I didn't move out because of you.

255
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:04,437
I didn't answer your calls
because I'm unpredictable.

256
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:05,962
I took another route because...

257
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:12,012
Because you're Wei Hao,
the star bass player in our campus band.

258
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,784
I fear that the path is too narrow
and I might be get in your way.

259
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,906
I've told you. I'm not with Xu Qian.

260
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,462
We were drunk.

261
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,883
It was just an accident.

262
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,812
We're grown ups now.

263
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:24,591
Can you stop being so stubborn?

264
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,752
Yes.

265
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,437
We're graduating soon.

266
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:31,496
We're no longer kids
who play house anymore.

267
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,821
That's why we shouldn't
always stick together.

268
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,110
Let's live our own lives.

269
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:38,310
Xu Qian is the one who likes beef, not me.

270
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,688
I'm allergic to beef.

271
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,897
Just like what you said,
we're no longer kids.

272
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:44,926
You said it was an accident.

273
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:47,149
Isn't that irresponsible to say?

274
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,411
After you said he was irresponsible,
how did he respond?

275
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,274
He said nothing.

276
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:56,652
I left right after.

277
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,786
You're brutal. Not bad.

278
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,031
But you know what?

279
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,504
You have to think further down the path.

280
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:05,033
You seem like you want
to end your friendship.

281
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:06,156
What's then?

282
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:08,759
You can't just
cut ties with them forever, can you?

283
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,577
After all, you're from the same hometown.

284
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:12,984
Speaking of it.

285
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:15,707
I was transferred to the News Department.

286
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:17,458
I didn't get to tell you that yet.

287
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,257
Now, the person sitting behind me
is Xu Qian.

288
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:25,396
Didn't you tell your superior
to get you transferred back?

289
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,483
You didn't want to join
that department too, right?

290
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,860
I agree with your thoughts.

291
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:34,933
But come to think of it,
I'll be a coward if I do that.

292
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:36,481
You don't want to be a coward?

293
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:38,991
Then what's your plan
for dealing with Xu Qian?

294
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,552
Are you going to act like a stranger?

295
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:43,767
-What's the time now?
-Ten o'clock I guess.

296
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:44,829
Oh, no.

297
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,493
I forgot the family weekly update.

298
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:51,888
Our daughter called.

299
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:54,628
Father, I'm craving glutinous rice balls.

300
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,838
Is your pocket money enough?

301
00:20:56,918 --> 00:21:00,189
Should I give you more pocket money
to buy yourself some glutinous rice balls?

302
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,910
Her monthly pocket money...

303
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,280
is a few times more than
our neighbour's daughter, Xiao Qiong.

304
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,961
You still worry that she has no money
to buy glutinous rice balls?

305
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,847
I'm just craving father's
sesame glutinous rice ball.

306
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,547
Okay, okay.

307
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,101
I'll make them for you tomorrow.

308
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,633
Coincidentally,

309
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:19,051
your Uncle Yu is going to
Xiamen for a meeting.

310
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:20,900
I'll get him to pass the fillings to you.

311
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:24,210
You'll have to make them yourself.

312
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:27,221
No, I want the rice balls you make.

313
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,029
I miss you and miss home.

314
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:31,800
How about this?

315
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:33,955
Come home next week.

316
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,163
What about my classes?

317
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:39,060
Forget about your classes.

318
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,101
Apply leave.

319
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:43,596
Nonsense.

320
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,187
Wu Yan.

321
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,300
Stop fooling around with your father.

322
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:50,805
He has spoiled you.

323
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,446
You're a teacher...

324
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,000
yet you don't discipline your child.

325
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,267
Listen here.

326
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,809
You'll have to register for postgraduate
entrance examination next month.

327
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,542
You need to focus on revision.

328
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:03,420
Stop going to the radio station
for no good reason.

329
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,825
You're wasting your time.

330
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,835
Do you hear me?

331
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,292
Yes.

332
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:10,494
Also,

333
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:14,541
Wei Hao called us two days ago...

334
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,103
and asked where you move to.

335
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:18,682
He seemed worried. It breaks my heart.

336
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:21,831
If you don't want to be with him,
make it clear.

337
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:25,873
If not, how is your father going to
face Uncle Wei in the future?

338
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:30,791
How is it related to facing Uncle Wei?
I can't believe you said that.

339
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,995
It's impossible between me and Wei Hao.

340
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,062
Class is over!

341
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:41,754
Let's go and play in the field!

342
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:42,906
Come on. Let's play tag.

343
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,316
You start.

344
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:46,969
Hurry up. Follow us.

345
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,299
Okay. Slow down.

346
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,040
Come on. Hurry up.

347
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:56,791
Thank you. I'll pick it up myself.

348
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,864
Is he really blind?

349
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:41,752
Mr Su, it's me.

350
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:45,697
Mr Su.

351
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,290
I just want to tell you that
I parked my bicycle...

352
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,361
at the left side of the gate.

353
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,132
Be careful. Don't walk into it.

354
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:09,342
Don't you have classes?
You're leaving already?

355
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:10,794
No.

356
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,887
Mr Yi Jin.
Are they your personal stories?

357
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:15,983
No.

358
00:24:22,248 --> 00:24:23,338
Okay.

359
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,621
I'll get going then. Goodbye.

360
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,534
Wu Yan.

361
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:53,313
I'm looking for you.

362
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,428
I have a sudden meeting to attend
at the City Hall.

363
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:57,476
Can you take over Class Three for me?

364
00:24:57,939 --> 00:25:01,001
You can do some singing activities
or let them talk about themselves.

365
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,843
Sure.

366
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:06,357
But they've already done self-introduction
when I first came.

367
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:08,111
Let me think up something.

368
00:25:08,191 --> 00:25:09,397
Okay. Thank you.

369
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:11,184
Give me a call if anything comes up.

370
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:12,647
Sure. No problem.

371
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:13,786
Have a safe trip.

372
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:18,224
What should I plan for them?

373
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,617
Mr Su, why did you come back?

374
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:37,695
I left my music score behind.

375
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,336
How is everything?
Are you comfortable in our school?

376
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:41,838
Yes.

377
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,929
Everything is good here.

378
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,539
That's great.

379
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:49,288
To be honest, at times like this,

380
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:51,300
teachers who are willing to teach
at special education schools...

381
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,138
are getting lesser.

382
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:55,851
It's difficult to find talents like you.

383
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,718
If you intend to
become a full-time teacher,

384
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,620
I can help you.

385
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,488
You know my situation too.

386
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:04,800
Don't bother about it.

387
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:07,917
To be honest, I really want you to stay.

388
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:10,547
Moreover, we are in need of manpower.

389
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,212
Don't we already have interns?

390
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:17,478
They're just students
who majored in related fields.

391
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:18,748
It's their university's requirement...

392
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,839
to do their internships
at different organisations.

393
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,880
They can only graduate
if they score marks for it.

394
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,901
Usually, they won't come back anymore
after a few months.

395
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,340
So their universities
appointed them to come?

396
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,789
That's not completely it.

397
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:33,460
It's also up to the students' willingness.

398
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,843
Take Ms Sang for example.

399
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:36,520
She's studying psychology.

400
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,252
Her academic results are good too.

401
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,561
If she puts us as her first choice
for internship,

402
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,182
she'll definitely get it.

403
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:47,277
It's rare to find someone
who puts special education schools...

404
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,561
as their first choice.

405
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:56,384
(Lu Lu)

406
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,051
Hello?

407
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:01,652
I'm doing my internship
at a special education school.

408
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:02,694
I can't make it.

409
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:05,508
I'll have to meet the requirements
of my credit hours.

410
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:07,176
If not, I won't be given marks.

411
00:27:07,256 --> 00:27:08,424
It's annoying.

412
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:10,939
You go ahead. Have fun.

413
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,228
Goodbye.

414
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:18,359
Mr Su, why did you come back?

415
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,200
What's the matter?

416
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:35,542
Mr Su,
I actually have a favour to ask from you.

417
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:37,702
Mr Li went out for a meeting.

418
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,819
I plan to teach singing
during my lesson later.

419
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:43,766
Can you help me to play the piano?

420
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,499
They can learn singing in music classes.

421
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:47,659
I know.

422
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,889
But you see, a teacher
intern like me can't teach them...

423
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:54,427
using Braille.

424
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,217
So I need your help.

425
00:27:58,448 --> 00:27:59,670
Mr Su.

426
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,005
Mr Su.

427
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,416
Excuse me, Mr Su?

428
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:14,501
He's so rude.

429
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:43,351
Ms Sang.

430
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,922
Hello, kids.

431
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,877
Today, let's learn how to sing.

432
00:28:57,957 --> 00:29:01,426
The student who can sing the best
will be rewarded later.

433
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,499
So, you must try your best to learn. Okay?

434
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,268
Okay.

435
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:08,319
What should we sing?

436
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:10,836
Let's sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars.

437
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,839
I'll sing once to Mr Su
so that he can prepare.

438
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,780
After that, you'll sing along with me
line by line.

439
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,931
Okay?

440
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:18,714
Okay.

441
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,508
I'll start singing now, Mr Su.

Wei. What's wrong with you recently?

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,058
You got the beats wrong again.

523
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,473
Sorry. Let's try again.

524
00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:48,106
We've repeated this many times.

525
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,370
Xu Qian? Hello.

526
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:56,840
I'm sorry.

527
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,710
I came here today to tell you that
I'm quiting the band.

528
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:02,862
Why?

529
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:03,986
You must be joking.

530
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,684
Why did you do this all of a sudden?

531
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,626
Let's talk outside.

532
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:18,263
What's going on?

533
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:19,561
What else could it be?

534
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,989
Relationship problems probably.

535
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,630
It's not that complicated.

536
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:31,462
I'm busy doing internship. I have no time.

537
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,963
I'm sorry for kissing you last time.

538
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:35,282
It's nothing to be sorry for.

539
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:36,925
We were just drunk at that time.

What's the story?

547
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,400
Do you have girlfriend in university?

548
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,224
I've heard about it.

549
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,540
No.

550
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:17,014
Look for that uncle of yours.

551
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,575
I will.

Here you go.

558
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:29,554
I came here for a meeting this time.

559
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,455
This is from your father.

560
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:33,939
They're glutinous rice balls.

561
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,773
He really made them?

562
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:39,388
I was just joking with him.
It's too much.

563
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:41,005
I don't think I can finish them.

564
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,531
Your father loves you.

565
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:45,750
Thank you uncle.

566
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,587
It's good that
you both are in the same campus.

567
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,662
You can look after each other.

568
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:51,972
Go home.

569
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:53,589
Take care of yourselves in campus.

-Goodbye.
-Goodbye Uncle Yu.

571
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:56,130
Goodbye.

572
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,909
-Is it heavy? Let me carry it.
-No, thank you.

573
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,604
Are you going back to the
new rented place? I'll send you there.

574
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:08,863
-You don't have to.
-Wu Yan.

575
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:11,495
I think I have
made myself very clear last time.

576
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,626
It's unnecessary for the three of us
to complicate this relationship.

577
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,495
Moreover,
I don't want to be dragged into this.

578
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,906
You two can do whatever you want.

579
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,489
Wu Yan.

580
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,501
You two are indeed best friends.

581

Xu Qian said the same thing.

582
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:29,572
She quit the band
and even drew a line with me.

583

In this incident, I'm really a scum.

I'm sorry.

I know you don't wish to hear this.

587
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,373
It's getting late. You should get going.

588
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,656
No. What are you two doing?

You requested this song again?

596
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:29,956
No. I didn't make song requests today.

597
00:37:31,744 --> 00:37:33,134
It's unbelievable.

598

songs that I like,

I'll definitely find out
about their relationship.

They might be couples who broke up
but still have feelings for each other.

That means I helped match-make them.
