Zheng Ye In the near future,
I plan to assemble all of my works...

4
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:06,462
into the first album
and publish it online.

5
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,069
I hope everyone will like it.

6
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,888
(Fans meeting of Zheng Ye,
the Independent Musician)

7
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:14,842
Well...

8
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,285
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,094
I have a question.

10
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:22,188
Since you're a singer-songwriter,
why did you decide to work with...

11
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:25,059
the most mysterious
genius songwriter, Yi Jin?

12
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,949
I've been a lyricist
and composer all this while.

13
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:34,654
However, I don't mind
working with talented musicians.

14
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:37,295
We appreciate each other's talent.

15
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,666
We decided to collaborate
since the timing is right.

16
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,784
If Mr Yi Jin invites me
to write a song for him,

17
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,299
I would gladly accept it.

18
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,874
Okay, thank you.

19
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,496
Those who want to take photos,
please come to the stage.

20
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,817
Thank you, everyone.

21
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,853
Don't worry.

22
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,551
Even if you didn't call me,
I won't let go of them easily...

23
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,469
when it comes to matters like this.

24
00:02:58,837 --> 00:02:59,929
Okay.

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,638
Sang Wu Yan.

26
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:10,831
Sir.

27
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,542
Before you came back,

28
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,886
Zheng Ye's manager gave me a call.

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,834
Why did you ask him that question?

30
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:20,715
No one asked him questions at that time.

31
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,037
The atmosphere was a little awkward.

32
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,984
I was merely trying to create a topic.

33
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:26,192
The situation
would be better off without the question.

34
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,891
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

35
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,491
I guess Zheng Ye's
interview was recorded, right?

36
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,056
Summarise it.

37
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:35,516
Write something nice about him
at the end of the article.

38
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,618
-Get the draft ready as soon as possible.
-Sure.

39
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,201
It's meant to be training for you.

40
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,796
It's not necessary to publish the news.

41
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,124
But things went out of control
and you've offended him.

42
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:46,570
Go now.

43
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,065
You only have an hour.

44
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,338
What are you waiting for?

45
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:50,899
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

46
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,977
The netizens are accusing our station
of being mean to Zheng Ye.

47
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,561
(A reporter questioned the collaboration
between Zheng Ye and Yi Jin)

48
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,768
My goodness.

49
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:03,925
I'm doomed.

50
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,832
I've made a huge mistake, haven't I?

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,955
As a reporter, you need to be responsive.
You need to be highly flexible too.

52
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,032
If you really think that
you're not a good fit,

53
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,513
will you consider joining us again?

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,578
If you want to come back,
I can do you a favour.

55
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:23,515
Well...

56
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,778
I think I should continue
staying in the news department.

57
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,846
I can't run away
just because I messed up once.

58
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:34,558
No doubt I don't quite like
how they handle things,

59
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,577
but they're really fast.

60
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:39,474
It's a good chance
to change my dilly dally personality.

61
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:40,809
It's a good thing.

62
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:43,440
Not bad.

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,441
Your awareness
has increased after some training.

64
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:54,959
A reporter questioned the collaboration
between Zheng Ye and Yi Jin.

65
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,200
Zheng Ye answered the question wittily
and ingeniously resolved the awkwardness.

66
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,928
I'm sorry. I have a question.

67
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:04,349
Since you're a singer-songwriter,

68
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,360
why did you decide to work with...

69
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,240
the most mysterious
genius songwriter, Yi Jin?

70
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,825
She looks familiar.

71
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,475
Isn't she the lady I met
at the KFC Restaurant?

72
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:20,911
Did she ask the question
because she knew that you're Yi Jin?

73
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:22,631
She doesn't know.

74
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:23,930
How do you know?

75
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,975
You're still laughing.

76
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,719
Yi Jin must be furious.

77
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,220
Seriously?

78
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,777
I bet he doesn't have time to check on...

79
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,480
unimportant titbits like this.

80
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:54,084
I'm doomed.

81
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,385
If he noticed the news,

82
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,280
he might be hating me already.

83
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:22,567
I left the pen on the board.

84
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,455
I don't mean to disturb you.

85
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:26,866
I worry that you can't find it.
That's why...

86
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,960
It's okay.

87
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,416
Thank you.

88
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,375
Is there anything else?

89
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,525
Nothing.

90
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:43,591
I'm just curious about
what you're writing.

91
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,624
It's a musical notation used
by blind people.

92
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,732
There will be a public event
at the Piano Museum over the weekend.

93
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,780
It's meant to popularise
the knowledge about piano...

94
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,940
among the blind
who are interested in learning music.

95
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:01,679
Is it not available in the market?

96
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,414
It's rare. It's hard to get.

97
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,189
Many blind children have to
memorise the music note one by one...

98
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,989
in order to learn music.

99
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,803
Did you do that in the past?

100
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:12,328
What else?

101
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,388
You're amazing.

102
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,337
I didn't know that one
could master piano like this.

103
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,795
You're indeed a genius.

104
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,699
Mozart once said,

105
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,624
"I practice 12 hours a day,"

106
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,825
"and now they call me..."

107
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:32,562
"a genius!"

108
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,788
What song is this?

109
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:43,824
"The Girl With The Flaxen Hair".

110
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,030
Did you write the song?

111
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,471
-Didn't I tell you...
-All right, got it.

112
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,611
If it's not you, who wrote it?

113
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:00,471
Debussy.

114
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,498
Debussy?

115
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,252
Is he your favourite composer?

116
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,546
I like...

117
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:11,679
Chopin.

118
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,380
Which song do you like the most?

119
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:17,511
I...

120
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:20,050
"Nocturne".

121
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,239
Why?

122
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:22,893
It's nice.

123
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,056
What's wrong?

124
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,701
Nothing.

125
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:29,804
Everyone is the same.

126
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:31,947
Most of the people fall in love
with the same mainstream song...

127
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,263
or a composer.

128
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,968
In fact, they've
never tried to understand it.

129
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:41,093
Liking the composer or the song
has become a tag.

130
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:44,030
They're just trying
to show that they're artistic.

131
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:48,349
No doubt I know nothing about it...

132
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:52,868
but I think what matters is that the
music is pleasant to the ears, right?

133
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,724
Forget it.

134
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,430
I'll get going.

playing classical music.

153

I would like to invite someone
who has never learned piano...

154
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:11,885
to experience it.

155

Please raise your hand
if you want to volunteer.

156
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:19,384
Okay, let's welcome the lady
who is standing at the side.

157
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:21,225
-Here.
-Please come to the stage.

158
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,585
Now, memorise the sequence of the note.

159
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,838
Try to follow my lead.

160
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,196
You may use one hand.

161
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,869
We'll do it together.

162
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,903
This is the Twelve Variations
on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman".

164
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,155
We hope that the blind
have the chance to learn music.

165
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:16,361
Coincidentally, someone volunteers
to produce the Braille music notation.

166
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,141
It's just a small favour from me.

167
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,815
You don't look like one, Mr Su.

168
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:29,295
I didn't know that you
do good things without leaving a name.

169
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:33,788
Or do you always live incognito?

170
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,403
Mr Su.

171
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:43,288
I admit that I'm not a know-it-all.

172
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:44,941
However,

173
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:47,572
you accuse that
when we claim we like something,

174
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,634
it's just our attempt
to put a label on ourselves.

175
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:52,062
I kind of think
it's a subjective speculation.

176
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,994
You can't conclude that
I'm talking nonsense just because...

177
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:57,518
I can't justify why I like something.

178
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:59,645
I like Yi Jin too.

179
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,722
Is this considered
an act of labelling myself?

180
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:04,264
Enlighten me. What kind of tag Yi Jin is?

181
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:07,380
Which of his songs do you like the most?

182
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,657
"Occupied".

183
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,301
Why?

184
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,390
We're back to square one again.

185
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,179
I just like it. There is no...

186
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,327
Watch out!

187
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,090
Watch out for the piano.

188
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,991
Every piano in the museum is precious.

189
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,549
I'm not done.

190
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,397
If I must explain,

191
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,826
I like "Occupied" because
I think it's really nice.

192
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:43,772
Furthermore, I think that the song is so
beautiful in terms of melody and lyrics.

193
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:45,891
I really like it.

I listened to Yi Jin's songs again.

215
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,923
I still think that he's Yi Jin.

216
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:21,491
Whose phone number is that?

217
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:22,961
It's his number.

218
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:27,269
Not bad, you're still good at it.

219
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:30,153
He's so cold and distant
but you got his number anyway.

220
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:32,916
No.

221
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:35,992
I copied his number
from Mr Li's contact list.

222
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,932
The situation is different then.

223
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,071
Since you've got his number.

224
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:44,507
Why don't you give him a call?

225
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,200
Give him a call?

226
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:48,502
What should I say?

227
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:50,422
Ask for hush money.

228
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:54,619
If the gossip were sold to the media,
how much would it cost?

229
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,324
However, you should
contact him for hush money.

230
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:01,798
We make money
while he can continue being mysterious.

231
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:03,780
Do you know what this is called?

232
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:05,691
Fishing in troubled water?

233
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,269
It's called a win-win situation.

234
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,388
Firstly, we must lay out a plan.

235
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,581
It's too awkward
to give him a call out of random.

236
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:36,461
Moreover, the one who makes the first
move is always at a disadvantage.

237
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:37,783
However, it doesn't really matter.

238
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,749
It's impossible for him
to make the first move.

239
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,089
In that case,

240
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,453
I must get him when he's least prepared.

241
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:44,804
I'm going to overwhelm him...

242
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:46,808
with my professional
psychological skills.

243
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,290
All right, I'm going to do it.

244
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:10,708
Hello.

245
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,390
Hello, I'm Sang Wu Yan.

246
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:16,565
Anything?

247
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:20,757
You're Yi Jin.

248
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:44,831
If there is nothing else, I have to go.

249
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,490
You're really Yi Jin.

250
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:51,166
Hold on.

251
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,376
Well...

252
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,865
The incident happened
due to my lack of understanding.

253
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,119
As such,

254
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:01,852
sorry for the offence.

255
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,089
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:04,679
Also,

257
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,375
I have always wanted to thank you.

258
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,004
When I listened to
Yi Jin's song in the past,

259
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:21,235
I had been wondering
what kind of person...

260
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:24,726
could write a song about tough love.

261
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,455
It's as if he's used up all the energy...

262
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:31,165
to remember
every fleeting detail in life.

263
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,710
When I was in freshman year,

264
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:36,685
a close friend who I met in
elementary school passed away.

265
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,461
"Occupied" is the song
that kept me going through that period.

266
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,499
It taught me how to bid goodbye.

267
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:49,708
At that time, everyone told me
I overreacted.

268
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,709
Even my dad told me not to be childish.

269
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:56,288
It's as if
I was the only person who realised...

270
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,171
a very nice person had left the world.

271
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,340
Only when I was listening to his song,
I was allowed to cry.

272
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:08,079
If I were given a chance to meet him,

273
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:12,210
I would make sure
he knows that I'm living well.

274
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,697
Then, I would smile and thank him.

275
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:30,635
All right. I'll keep the secret for you.

276

00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,652
Then, we'll do research respectively.

330
00:22:57,732 --> 00:22:58,917
Okay, thank you.

331
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:15,315
Are you sure you don't want to watch
Berliner Philharmonike's performance?

332
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,199
You told me to get the ticket
a long time ago.

333
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,033
Let's go.

334
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:48,260
Do you have an appointment?

335
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,450
You've checked on your watch a few times.

336
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:55,942
Nothing.

337
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:00,510
You may leave now.
It's almost done. I can do the rest.

338
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:02,891
Really?

339
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:05,889
Don't you trust me?

340
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,992
Of course I trust you.
You excel in everything.

341
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,117
I'll complete my part and send it to you.

342
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:12,340
Hold on.

343
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,137
All right, I've sent it to you.

344
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,056
Sorry to trouble you. I have to go.

345
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,110
Thanks.

346
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:29,538
(Binhai Welfare Home, Xiamen)

347
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:32,161
Don't worry.

348
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,154
Why are you in a rush?

349
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,616
It's a birthday celebration after all.

350
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:36,829
Here.

351
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:42,902
Xiao Wei.

352
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:44,900
Let's wait for a moment.

353
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,756
When Ms Sang is here, we'll cut the cake.

354
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:47,855
Okay?

355
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,809
Xiao Wei.

356
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:56,188
Xiao Wei, are you getting impatient
from the wait?

357
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:58,167
I'm sorry for being late.

358
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,037
Ms Sang.

359
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:05,689
I didn't know that
you're looking forward to seeing me.

360
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:06,911
Mr Su.

361
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:10,564
Mr Su has been here since 4:00.

362
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:12,221
He brought a cake too.

363
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,244
Then, we can try two cakes
with different flavours.

364
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,571
Xiao Wei, are you happy?

365
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:19,745
Yes.

366
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:23,203
Madam Zhang.

367
00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:25,382
Xiao Yu is not feeling well.

368
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,912
Please check on him.

369
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:28,280
Sure.

370
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,814
Ms Sang, Mr Su.

371
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:31,724
You may cut the cake with Xiao Wei.

372
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:32,890
Don't worry.

373
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:34,666
-Take care.
-Let's go.

374
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,462
Let me do it.

375
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:45,401
Like I said, let me do it.

376
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:47,082
Xiao Wei and you just have to sit still.

377
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:00,065
You got us a strawberry cake too.

378
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:02,620
It's said that
all girls like strawberry flavour, right?

379
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:07,392
How do you know
all girls like strawberry flavour?

380
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,275
I bet you always buy cake for girls.

381
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,546
Blow out the candles first.

382
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:16,476
Xiao Wei.

383
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,086
Let's blow out the candles
and make a wish.

384
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,824
I almost forgot.

385
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:46,678
We should sing you the birthday song
before you make a wish.

386
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,398
Mr Su, let's sing a song for Xiao Wei.

387
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,254
Fine, I'll sing alone.

388
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,987
Get set, go.

389
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:02,606

394
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,385
Xiao Wei, happy birthday to you!

395
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,811
Hurry up, make a wish.

396
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:27,380
My birthday wish
is to ride on the Ferris wheel.

397
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,452
Something is not right.

398
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,500
Why did you
say your birthday wish out loud?

399
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,985
You shouldn't have done that.
Otherwise, it won't come true.

400
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,341
It's to let you know
what my birthday wish is.

401
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,623
You're really something, little girl.

402
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,523
All right.

403
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:50,995
Let me cut the cake.

404
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:54,057
Ms Sang, we surely can't finish the cakes.

405
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:56,729
Can we share them with the other kids?

406
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,961
Of course.

407
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,193
I'll distribute the cakes.

408
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:05,330
The largest chunk
is for our birthday girl.

409
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,912
Here, have it.

410
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:18,732
What are you doing?

411
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,522
Don't you dislike sweet food?

412
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,094
Here.

413
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:33,656
I'll distribute the cakes now.

414
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:36,295
Wait for me, Xiao Wei.

415
00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:44,848
Mr Su, you don't like sweet food?

416
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,485
I don't like it.

417
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,559

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,953
Your singing is out of tune.

421
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,996
You couldn't even
play the classic childhood song.

422
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:30,662
I don't have a childhood.

423
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:35,673
Well,

424
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,238
music is meant to express one's feelings.

425
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,534
There is no right and wrong.

426
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,546
As long as one can express their feelings.

427
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:48,344
I'm obsessed with Yi Jin's songs
precisely because I can always catch...

428
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:51,417
sincerity and real feelings
from his songs.

429
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:03,193
Hold on.

430
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:04,919
Well...

431
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,039
Can I ask you a question?

432
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,515
In return, you can ask me a question too.

433
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:15,890
The lady who always picks you up...

434
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:18,094
Is she your girlfriend?

435
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:21,119
Xiao Lu?

436
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,308
So, Xiao Lu is her name.

437
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:27,188
No.

438
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,561
What is her name?

439
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,972
She isn't my girlfriend.

440
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,883
Do you have any questions for me?

441
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,760
I'll save it for next time.

442
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:05,509
Hello.

443
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,446
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

444
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,119
He doesn't have...

445
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:26,111
Do you have to be so happy?

446
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:28,148
She may not be his girlfriend
at the moment...

447
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:29,766
but what if she becomes one in the future?

448
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,042
Don't talk nonsense!

449
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:32,621
Furthermore,

450
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,921
that's not why I'm so happy.

451
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,217
What is it, then?

452
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:40,747
I asked him if he had anything to ask me.

453
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:42,510
He should have said...

454
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:46,114
"No" but he replied,

455
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:47,919
"I'll save it for next time".

456
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:50,692
He's getting better at this.

457
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:54,364
What's wrong with you?

458
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:57,443
Am I right?

459
00:31:57,523 --> 00:31:59,364
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

460
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,508
You'd better get up
and fill in your internship form.

461
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,789
We need to go back to school
and get it signed tomorrow.

462
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,777
You owe me a question, woman.

463
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:07,191
You owe me one.

464
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:08,860
You owe me one.

465
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:14,467
Even if you don't want to talk to me,
you should think for the band.

466
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:16,905
No matter how bad it is, you should at
least perform on the convocation day.

467
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:19,181
Find someone else. I can't do it.

468
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:21,113
I have a part-time job and an internship.
I don't have the time.

469
00:32:21,193 --> 00:32:23,273
-You should...
-I have to go.

470
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:49,999
Why on earth did I think that
I like a dumb guy like you?

471
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,393
Fine.

472
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:55,201
Let me tell you the main point.

473
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:56,662
I'll only say it for once.

474
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,121
You'd better
listen to it with all your brain cells.

475
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:03,443
Firstly, we grew up together.

476
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,992
Of course I'd think that
we're meant to be with each other.

477
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:09,188
However, now I realise,
I have never fallen in love with you.

478
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:11,549
I'm merely too used
to being together with you.

479
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,943
Secondly,
I'm sure that you had feelings for me.

480
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,672
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have been so nice to me.

481
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:18,200
Don't even argue with me.

482
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,422
In analysing human behaviour,
I'm so much more professional than you.

483
00:33:21,814 --> 00:33:22,975
Thirdly,

484
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:25,884
I don't know
when you fell in love with Xu Qian...

485
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,520
but I'm sure you're
in love with her now, not me.

486
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,095
The same theory applies.

487
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:34,498
Lastly, what confuses me the most is...

488
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:38,143
how come I didn't notice that
you've fallen in love with each other?

489
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:40,181
I'm usually quite observant.

490
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,487
Unless both of you
deliberately hid it from me.

491
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,012
That makes me really angry.

492
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:45,976
Both of you are the worst kind of friends.

493
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:47,997
Actually,

494
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:52,257
she's been distancing herself from me.

495
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,085
No wonder.

496
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,984
What are you doing?

497
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:01,583
If she backs off, you should move forward.

498
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:06,919
I think
my feelings for Xu Qian were wrong.

499
00:34:07,561 --> 00:34:08,783
After all,

500
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:11,748
I had feelings for you before.

501
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,403
I think I haven't thought it through.

502
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,543
Let me ask you a question.

503
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,036
Think about it.

504
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:22,338
Who is more important to you?
Me or Xu Qian?

505
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,214
Both of you are equally important.

506
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:31,757
That's the wrong answer!

507
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,761
Of course she is more important.

508
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,331
I have become the past tense.

509
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:37,564
She's your present and future.

510
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,112
My friend, will you
stop being indecisive?

511
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,888
Wu Yan, why did you suddenly cool down?

512
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:47,844
That's because I've figured out
how silly both of you are.

513
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:49,496
I've thought it through.

514
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:53,027
I was under the impression that
I was mad because you betrayed me.

515
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:54,858
However, soon I realised that
I was mad because...

516
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:56,850
both of you didn't see me as a friend.

517
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,498
You've become a couple
but you decided to hide it from me.

518
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:01,870
Now, have you cooled down?

519
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,337
Yes, so you'd better hurry up.

520
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,422
Go and get her back.

521
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:10,461
Will you be persistent?

522
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,060
Enjoy the food.

523
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:24,794
Welcome. How many of you?

524
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:28,187
I'm sorry. Is Xu Qian on duty today?

525
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,451
Xu Qian?

526
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:31,002
She's resigned.

527
00:35:32,638 --> 00:35:33,972
Okay, thank you.

528
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,198
Sure, no problem.

529
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:44,512
If you ask me,

530
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:46,964
we should stop dawdling
and find a new vocalist.

531
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,011
I think that's a good idea.

532
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:53,727
I don't deny that it's a little difficult
to find someone like Xu Qian...

533
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:55,217
who is pretty and has a good voice.

534
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:57,569
However, it's better than
having no vocalist.

535
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,674
Hello, where are you?

536
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,936
I'm not looking for her.
I'm looking for you.

537
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:10,172
Let's go for lunch.

538
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,559
Welfare home?

539
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,366
Sure, send me the location. I'll go now.

540
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,650
A family intends to adopt her.

541
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,185
It's a good thing.

542
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:26,376
However, I'm not sure about Xiao Wei.

543
00:36:27,178 --> 00:36:30,868
During this period, I can tell
that she trusts you guys a lot.

544
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,526
Though it's not confirmed,

545
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:38,084
I still would like to discuss it with you
at the first instance.

546
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:41,423
Thank you for believing in us.

547
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:44,080
We'll get going.

548
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,353
If there are any updates,
please contact us again.

549
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:48,798
Sure, no problem.

550
00:36:48,878 --> 00:36:50,747
You don't have to send us off.

551
00:36:50,827 --> 00:36:52,287
Have a safe journey.

552
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,071
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

553
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,127
Mr Su.

554
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:08,861
What do you think?

555
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,288
I think it's not a good idea.

556
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:20,898
(Wei Hao)

557
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:23,135
Hello?

558
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,227
I'm almost done.

559
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:28,149
I'm talking with a friend.

560
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:30,896
I see.

561
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:32,272
You don't have to come.

562
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:33,842
We can meet up at the restaurant.

563
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:37,489
It doesn't matter.
We can talk at the restaurant.

564
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:42,124
You should respect my decision
since you invited me.

565
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:44,149
Just send me the location. I have to go.

566
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,872
Where were we?

567
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:56,198
Do you want me to tag along?

568
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,179
Are you serious?

569
00:38:02,052 --> 00:38:03,480
Aren't you...

570
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,014
Aren't you going to meet
the old friend you told me before?

571
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:08,264
It's him.

572
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,606
I'm asking why are you
volunteering yourself to come along?

573
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:20,522
You still remember
what I told you before.

574
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:23,058
Do I look like I have bad memory?

575
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,173
Yes.

576
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:31,759
You look like
you don't bother to remember things.

577
00:38:32,698 --> 00:38:33,773
Let's go.

578
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,922
Let's go.

579
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:43,714
Are you going to repeat
the same procedure every time?

580
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:45,515
So, are you going
to argue with me as usual?

581
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:54,359
How do you know
that call was from my old friend?

582
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,354
I could tell.

583
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,018
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

584
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:02,188
Actually, we have
resolved the misunderstanding.

585
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:11,641
We need to eat, right?

586
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,309
After this meal,
all of us will become friends.

587
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:15,637
Let's go.

588
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,079
Let's go.

589
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,475
Let's go.

590
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:25,356
Have you ordered?

591
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,528
Forget it.

592
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,331
I bet he hates
having someone by his side.

593
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:51,082
Here is the lemon juice.

594
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:52,422
Thank you.

595
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,089
It's so cold.

596
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:59,817
Stop eating. Aren't you allergic to it?

597
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,719
Please bring a glass
of warm lemon juice for the lady.

598
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:03,800
Thank you.

599
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,072
It's pork. Can't you see it?
Are you blind?

600
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:12,889
So, both of you see each other every day
but you have not made peace with her.

601
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:15,811
The friendship
between girls is complicated.

602
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,127
You know nothing.

603
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,522
Fine, I don't want to know.

604
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:22,545
I just want to know
what's wrong with her.

605
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,669
She's resigned from the restaurant.

606
00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:26,048
What does she want?

607
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,221
It's not about her.

608
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,614
It's about you. Have you ever tried
to understand her life?

609
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:34,847
Unlike you,
she's eager to do well in everything.

610
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:36,996
All you care about is
managing a band for fun.

611
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:39,901
Yes, you have a fair share of fun
but look at her.

612
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,238
Ever since
she enrolled into the university,

613
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:42,787
has she ever taken a break?

614
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,688
Let's just talk about this incident.

615
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:45,737
Our supervisor assigned to both of us...

616
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:48,194
an assignment to report
about an exhibition at the museum.

617
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,097
Do you know how far it is?

618
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:51,810
The journey takes more than three hours.

619
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:55,931
Internship alone has taken a toll on her.
She also has to make money.

620
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:58,532
Isn’t it normal that she
doesn't have the time to entertain you?

621
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:05,880
Mr Su.

622
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,543
Do you like lemon juice too?

623
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:24,044
Mr Su.

624
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:31,042
Mr Su.

625
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,465
Have some lemon juice.

626
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,955
I have something to tell you.

627
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,655
Madam Zhang called me just now.

628
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:39,222
She said that the couple
have decided to adopt Xiao Wei.

629
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,145
They have initiated
the adoption procedure.

630
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:44,679
Isn't it exciting news?

631
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:47,851
What is so exciting about it?

632
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,866
Do you know the couple?

633
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,146
Have you considered Xiao Wei's feelings?

634
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,586
What if they send her back later?

635
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:59,759
Do you know how much damage
it would cause to Xiao Wei?

636
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:01,457
But...

637
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:06,059
But she deserves a chance
to embrace a different future.

638
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:09,654
Is staying in the welfare home forever
the best option she has?

639
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:10,896
If she refuses to give it a try...

640
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:13,040
just because
she's worried about the outcome,

641
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,806
that makes her a coward.

642
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:20,316
Fine.

643
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:22,946
If my prediction comes true,

644
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:24,915
will you take on the responsibility?

645
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:26,114
I...

646
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:28,307
I...

647
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:41,143
You're too naive.

648
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:42,259
I...

649
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,330
He's never happy with anything.
