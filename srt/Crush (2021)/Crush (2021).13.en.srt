00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,703
What's wrong with you all now?

4
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,922
Stop dragging your feet.

5
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,563
Just put the matter of record deal aside.

6
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:19,122
The program line up of graduation party
has been announced.

7
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:20,713
You have to perform no matter what.

8
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,535
Why don't we go by the majority?

9
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,609
If you want Xu Qian back,
raise your hand.

10
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,329
I'm the one who named your band.

11
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,720
I have the right to vote.

12
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:50,091
There's no way
we could we get a replacement now.

13
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:51,968
Spare your vote, both of you.

14
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:58,544
What's wrong?

15
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,374
Are we not getting her back?

16
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,509
Hurry up!

17
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,540
(China World Business Centre)

18
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,223
(Me: When are you coming down?)

19
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,745
She'll be here soon. (Xu Qian: Soon)

20
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,325
Look over there.

21
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:27,233
What are they doing?

22
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,769
It seems like they're trying to block
someone judging from their posture.

23
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,086
It has been a long time since I last saw
young rebels.

24
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,190
Yes.

25
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,136
I never thought someone
from this building...

26
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,052
would associate with people like them.

27
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,225
Tell me about it.

28
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,717
You really think only elite
white-collar workers here?

29
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:45,574
You have no idea what they do after work.

30
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:46,907
No one can say for sure.

31
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:50,336
That's enough.

32
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,732
They are my friends.

33
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:57,325
I've no idea whether they'll be someone
like you in future,

34
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,634
judging others with stereotypes.

35
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:01,041
But at least for now,

36
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,118
they won't talk about
others behind their back.

37
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:04,636
They have no imaginary rivals.

38
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:07,534
They're frank and straightforward
and compete with honour and dignity.

39
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:11,448
They will never befriend people like you.

40
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,361
What brings you here?

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,541
Xiao Lu came earlier.

42
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,901
She said collaboration is still possible.

43
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,510
We also tried to find a new lead vocalist,
but...

44
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:35,505
Anyway, it's about...

45
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:36,697
Get to the point.

46
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,052
Say it.

47
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,452
Could you join me for the performance
of the graduation party?

48
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,573
Okay.

49
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:05,296
Just forget it.

50
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,844
The graduation ceremony
is the day after tomorrow.

51
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,036
There's too much hassle.

52
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,171
Okay then.

53
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:15,492
Go to bed earlier.

54
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:16,839
See you at the graduation.

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,840
At last,

56
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,641
the Little Prince...

57
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:53,128
still returned to his favourite plant
of the rose.

58
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,362
(Little Prince)

59
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,896
What's wrong, Mr Su?

60
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:07,070
Nothing.

61
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,231
I'm a little envious.

62
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:12,980
Recently, I often feel this way.

63
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,142
Envious?

64
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,519
There's nothing to be envious about.

65
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,613
In future, you and Miss Sang
will surely be much happier...

66
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,118
than this love story.

67
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,819
Future?

68
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:33,941
It's weird, right?

69
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,892
When Xiao Wei mentioned about the future,

70
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:40,286
I have no idea why
I started to think about my future.

71
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,423
Just get married then.

72
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,080
Since you can't live without her.

73
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:48,682
I always feel that people like me
will remain this way as long as I live.

74
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,055
I thought marriage is something that
very far away from me.

75
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,184
But now,

76
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,476
I'm looking forward to it.

77
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:07,021

227
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,497
First of all,
you have to be really shameless.

228
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,297
Then be a perfect nuisance,
until you reach the goal.

-Bye.

Go.

255

Such a pleasant smell.

256
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,653
It's your own fragrance.

257
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,882
No.

258
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:50,495
It's the scent of privet.

259
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,686
How can there be privet here?

260
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:55,788
It's right here.

261
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,147
Where's my flower?

262
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:05,629
Oh, no. Did I leave it behind at the bar?

263
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,112
Thank God it's here.

264
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,656
This was the only one.

265
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,338
Fortunately it's not lost.

266
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,153
Why are you so stingy?

267
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,982
Why did you only give me one?

268
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,411
Can't you learn from those
leading men in the movies?

269
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:23,939
They gave a big bouquet.

270
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,677
How come I only got one?

271
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,700
Because you are
the only rose on this planet.

272
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,100
(Treatment Room 3)

273
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,971
Okay.

274
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,051
How is it, doctor?

275
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,177
To be specific,

276
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:31,535
we have to wait
for the medical test result.

277
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,066
Since you dragged on for so long
before seeking help,

278
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:36,316
you may have missed the
best timing for treatment.

279
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,089
From my initial assessment,

280
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:40,410
I'm afraid corneal
transplant is necessary.

281
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:45,763
I suggest you to register yourself
for a suitable donor.

282
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:49,941
Thank you, doctor.

283
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,477
My God.

284
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:06,005
There are so many things.

285
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:08,201
Why is no one here to help?
What about Wu Feng?

286
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,939
They've just graduated, They are busy.

287
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:11,396
I'd better not bother them.

288
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,769
I'll take a look.

289
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,755
Oh, my God.

290
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,544
It's quite spacious here.

291
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:30,814
I bet the price is not cheap.

292
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:32,293
It's still okay because it's
located on top floor.

293
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:33,607
Moreover, it's an old house.

294
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,735
So the price is still reasonable.

295
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,895
In the future,
there will be a place for our band.

296
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,316
By the way, did Xiao Lu get back to you?

297
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,133
Our collaboration was put on halt.

298
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,171
Mr Li called and told me personally.

299
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,923
If it didn't work out, just forget it.

300
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:03,524
There's nothing to be sad about.

301
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:05,328
Let's look for another opportunity.

302
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,611
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:12,089
I was thinking that
if the collaboration worked out,

304
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,694
at least we'd have some income.

305
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,611
Then you don't have to be so tired.

306
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:17,760
I didn't expect that...

307
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,149
I've told you to have some
foresight on this matter.

308
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:23,326
Since it has happened,
that is the cost of silence.

309
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,043
Staying hopeful
is the most important capital.

310
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,660
Why don't you guys perform on my program?

311
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,182
Your program?

312
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:37,960
In fact, it is not yet officially mine,
but it will be soon.

313
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,478
If you're willing to come over.

314
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:46,372
Our boss is planning a new segment
specializing in promoting indie musicians.

315
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:49,991
Her requirement is guests who appear
on the program have to be young and fresh.

316
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:53,565
So, she is basically looking for novices
with sufficient experience.

317
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,161
Isn't that your band?

318
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:58,402
It seems possible.

319
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,616
What? It certainly is!

320
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:03,385
Pack up quick.
After that, we'll discuss about it.

321
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:04,402
Okay.

322
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,488
What a tiring day.

323
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,194
If you are tired, just stop reading.
It's not good for your eyes.

324
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,170
I'm not reading a book.

325
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,437
It's a comic.

326
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:37,787
It's relaxing.

327
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,181
What comic?

328
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:40,426
A suspense.

329
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:47,832
I'll tell you the story, okay?

330
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:58,321
"In a village
built in a hexagram pattern,"

331
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,163
"there are mummies hidden inside
each and every cellars."

332
00:23:03,704 --> 00:23:06,005
"All mummies..."

333
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:09,408
"are bizarrely deformed."

334
00:23:18,223 --> 00:23:22,914
Are there cellars in this house?"

335
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:24,387
I don't know.

336
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:27,090
What do you know then?

337
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:28,974
I only know...

338
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:32,707
there's only two of us in the house,

339
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,760
and there seems to be noise
coming from next door.

340
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:47,103
Do you know...

341
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:50,105
there's a shadowy figure flashing
outside the window?

342
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,922
Is it doing it on purpose
so you'll notice it?

343
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,364
Did you turn off the light?

344
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,540
I didn't move at all.

345
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,756
Furthermore,
lights are without remote control.

346
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:09,971
What?

347
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,233
I...

348
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:14,301
I think my eardrums will ring.

349
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:16,389
Why not you shout after I go out?

350
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:18,025
What? No, no, no.

351
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:19,088
Don't go.

352
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,822
You can't leave me here alone.

353
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,449
It's a power outage.

354
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,086
How do you know?

355
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:30,385
There's no sound from the fridge.

356
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:32,127
The air conditioner is not working.

357
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:35,296
Every normal person can tell.

358
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:37,376
Are you suggesting I'm abnormal?

359
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:38,884
You're just timid.

360
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:41,729
I'm just trying to switch the topic,
to divert your attention.

361
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:47,238
In psychology, this is known as
transference.

362
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,565
You're really not qualified to be
a professional psychologist.

363
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:55,188
We won't mention the method
before the treatment, okay?

364
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,424
What time is it now?

365
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,900
9:11 PM.

366
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,059
You treasure this watch a lot.

367
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:12,248
What about my gift?

368
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:13,360
How was it?

369
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,465
Not bad.

370
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,192
You have great patience.

371
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:19,889
Finally you noticed my strength.

372
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:22,816
You still have many strengths.

373
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:26,794
For example?

374
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:28,138
For instance,

375
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:31,151
this is an exceptional spot for kissing.

376
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:32,513
What are you doing?

377
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:34,524

Hey.

396
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,652
Tell Nian Qin about it.

397
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,666
No matter what,

398
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,730
this concerns him.

399
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,140
At least, tell him courteously.

400
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,567
Okay.

401
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:56,951
Nian Qin.

402
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,618
Xiao Lu, you are here.

403
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,200
I'm just here to deliver a message.

404
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,013
Liver transplant is a must for your dad.

405
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:06,945
But he still can't find
a matching donor so far.

406
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,587
You have to be ready.

407
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,773
He has signed the consent form
for corneal donation.

408
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,905
You should understand by now
that it's for you.

409
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:15,446
It's okay if you don't want to go back,
but please don't reject it.

410
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:16,633
What are you saying?

411
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,122
What has he done?

412
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:22,765
You told him about my medical check-up?

413
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:24,975
I didn't say anything.
This is his own decision.

414
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:27,729
You decide for yourself. I'm off.

415
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,256
Actually there are many bands
who are active in the underground scene.

416
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:49,035
These people
are not from the professional background.

417
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:51,568
They have experience in other fields.

418
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:53,128
I'm thinking that these people...

419
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,100
would have more appealing stories
behind their music.

420
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,147
Their music not only has
a very unique, personal style,

421
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:00,777
what's more important is that...

422
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:03,107
they have something
to tell behind their music.

423
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,274
Please have a look.

424
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:07,217
Actually, my point is...

425
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:10,039
their concept of music
is very interesting.

426
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,841
The show I want to do
is to invite this band...

427
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:14,882
I'm familiar with.

428
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:19,008
I believe if I further explore,
there will be great stories from it.

429
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,190
Okay.

430
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,836
In fact, I've came across this band
at Xiao Lu's place.

431
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,163
It's quite interesting.

432
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:31,432
Give it a try.

433
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:34,004
Submit the program proposal
as soon as possible.

434
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:36,310
Sure!

435
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,479
Thank you, Xi.

436
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,117
Nian Qin,
why didn't you turn on the lights?

437
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:05,093
Wu Yan.

438
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,742
My...

439
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,546
My dad is sick.

440
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,905
You know it, right?

441
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,055
What's wrong?

442
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,952
He seems to be in a critical condition.

443
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,773
Xiao Lu informed me earlier today...

444
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:30,783
he has signed the consent form
for corneal donation.

445
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:35,005
I really don't know why he would sign it.

446
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:36,883
So,

447
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:40,180
your eyes are not incurable?

448
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,230
Although I've missed
the best timing for treatment,

449
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,306
but there is a hope to be healed.

450
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:49,234
Missed it?

451
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:51,563
Why did you...

452
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:53,589
Why didn't he bring me for treatment
in the first place,

453
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,797
but disowned me instead?

454
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,253
When I was born, my family was very poor.

455
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:06,348
They couldn't afford my treatment.

456
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,578
But after my dad disowned me,

457
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:11,795
he gradually became richer.

458
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,834
Then why didn't you...

459
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,877
get your treatment
after you returned home?

460
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,017
Because I have a grudge.

461
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:35,620
I still hold onto the deep grudge.

462
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,700
I must use my disability as an excuse,

463
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,110
to remind him of what he has done.

464
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,371
He decided to help me get better later

465
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:49,201
for the sake of his dignity and prestige.

466
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,560
Or perhaps it was atonement for my mother.

467
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,030
How can I fulfill his wishes?

468
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:09,670
But what I don't get now
is his intention.

469
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:13,811
Even if he does this,

470
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:16,467
I won't let it go.

471
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:20,350
It has been so many years.

472
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:25,537
There's no way I can let it go.

473
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:42,955
It's okay.

474
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,203
If you can't let it go, just let it be.

475
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:48,983
You don't have to let everything go.

476
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,879
Just forgive.

477
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,232
Why hold a grudge against yourself?

478
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,178
Your mum won't blame you for this.

479
00:31:57,698 --> 00:32:00,771
Surely, she would hope that
you could see the beauty of this world.

480
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:03,841
So there is nothing to be afraid of.

481
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,464
If you want to go back,

482
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,190
I'll go with you and visit him.

483
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,094
There's someone I wish to marry.

484
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,599
She wants to meet you.

485
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,936
I'll bring her home tomorrow.

486
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,457
Okay.

487
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:54,599
That's all for now.

488
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,988
Nian Qin said...

489
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,392
he is bringing his girlfriend home
tomorrow.

490
00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:25,164
Get prepared.

491
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,880
Nothing much.

492
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,013
I promised
to accompany him home tomorrow.

493
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:39,618
To meet parents means to speed things up.

494
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:41,077
That's fast.

495
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:42,647
Wu Yan.

496
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:44,627
What a coincidence, Uncle Yu.

497
00:33:44,954 --> 00:33:46,168
I am here to meet someone.

498
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,956
Wu Yan.

499
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:50,112
How's your dad? Is he getting better?

500
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:52,347
My dad? What happened to him?

501
00:33:52,427 --> 00:33:54,112
I heard he had a cerebral haemorrhage
and was admitted to the hospital.

502
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:55,177
Didn't you know?

503
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:58,204
What?

504
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,932
Why is she not picking up the call?

505
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:12,734
Fang Fang,
can you apply a day off for me?

506
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:14,582
I have to rush off.

507
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:17,774
-Where are you going?
-I have to go back to my hometown.

508
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:20,591
-But I thought you're going...
-My dad is more important.

509
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:22,654
-Thank you. I need to go now.
-Okay.

510
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:35,999
Did you forget your keys again?

511
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,709
Nian Qin.

512
00:34:42,104 --> 00:34:43,134
It's me.

513
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,116
Long time no see.

514
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:48,459
Xiao Lu is not here.

515
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,012
I'm not looking for her.

516
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,605
Won't you invite me in?

517
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:22,837
Hello.

518
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:23,982
Wu Yan.

519
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,195
We got the photo.

520
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:27,678
Well done.

521
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:28,910
Where's my dad?

522
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,872
He is on a business trip.
He has not returned yet.

523
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:34,024
Can you stop fooling me? How is Dad now?

524
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:40,791
Wu Yan.

525
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:42,941
How did you find out?

526
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,703
Why didn't you tell me?

527
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,970
You're busy too.

528
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,920
Dad wants it that way.

529
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:53,241
He did not want this matter
to mess up your graduation.

530
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,226
Anyway,

531
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,616
he survived the most critical period.

532
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:01,620
I wasn't able to inform you at the time.

533
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,818
Mum.

534
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:06,087
Are you punishing me
because I'm being capricious?

535
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:09,098
You let me be and
don't even care to keep me in the loop?

536
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,623
We don't want to be your burden.

537
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,379
You've grown up.

538
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:18,597
You'll lead your own life sooner or later.

539
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,790
Mum.

540
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,006
That's all for now.

541
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:24,807
I will go home right away. I'm hanging up.

542
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,941
I heard you are bringing your girlfriend
home tomorrow.

543
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,404
When your dad heard,
he managed to sit and eat on his own.

544
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:52,083
You've no idea how happy he is.

545
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,415
You are still so stubborn.

546
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,300
No.

547
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:06,833
I'm not stubborn about certain things.

548
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,291
Nian Qin.

549
00:37:20,148 --> 00:37:21,796
If Mrs Su is still around,

550
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:24,652
she will definitely be pleased.

551
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:26,692
You are now Mrs Su.

552
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:28,819
I'm also happy for you.

553
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,317
Really, I am.

554
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,957
Of course you are happy.

555
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,076
Because you have nothing to worry about.

556
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,179
You don't have to deal with
a complicated family.

557
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:48,164
I know you've been trying very hard,
pretending to be part of the family.

558
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:52,559
But you can stop being a hypocrite
in front of me.

559
00:37:54,894 --> 00:37:57,279
Out of my respect for her,
I'll bring her along.

560
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,638
After such a long time,

561
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:09,331
you finally expressed your thoughts.

562
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:12,373
It seems that you really love that girl.

563
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:15,014
That's none of your business.

564
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,812
What I want to say is,

565
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,766
you should go for your eye surgery.

566
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:25,363
At least you must consider this
for the sake of her happiness.

567
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:26,445
Isn't it so?

568
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,688
Have a harmonious dinner tomorrow.

569
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,698
Don't become a laughing stock to others.

570
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,890
I've got to go.

571
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,704
Let's go.

572
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:27,933
That's enough, Yu Wei Lan!

573
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:29,098
It's me.

574
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,840
I just met someone at the door.

575
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,996
Who is she?

576
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:49,499
She is no one.

577
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,418
What are you doing?

578
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:22,270
Nian Qin. Please apologize to your family
on my behalf.

579
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,103
I can't make it tomorrow.

580
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:25,395
Where are you going?

581
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:26,930
I'm going home.

582
00:40:27,442 --> 00:40:28,738
My dad...

583
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:30,992
I know.

584
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,141
I'm just a blind man
who will become your burden.

585
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:34,843
They look down on me.

586
00:40:34,923 --> 00:40:36,973
They think I'm good for nothing
and will hurt you eventually.

587
00:40:37,053 --> 00:40:38,720
That's why you were told to go back.

588
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:42,460
Su Nian Qin, stop being unreasonable.

589
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,793
Unless you stay.

590
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,029
I must go back.

591
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:48,305
You have have to stay.

592
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:49,751
I can't fulfill your request.

Why does he only treat me badly?

I guess when he is with
someone he's close to,

00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:58,796
he will lose his temper,
