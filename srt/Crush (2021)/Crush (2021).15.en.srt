170
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,139
I'll get going then.

171
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:43,190
Wu Yan.

172
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,542
Let's go back together.

173
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,466
We'll take the earliest plane.

174
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:51,598
Thanks.

175
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:39,105
Mum.

176
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,814
I'm sorry.

177
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,304
Wait for me to come home.

178
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:48,398
From now on,

179
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:50,917
let me take care of you.

180
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:13,700
Wu Yan, are you really okay?

181
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm fine.

182
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,399
Ms Xi.

183
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,581
Wu Yan is not in her best form.

184
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:24,919
Why don't we...

185
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,674
Three, two, one.

186
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:35,288
Go.

187
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:37,637
Good evening, everyone.

188
00:22:37,717 --> 00:22:40,103
Welcome to "I Want to Hear You Sing".

189
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:41,675
I'm the host, Wu Yan.

190
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,392
Today is the pilot episode of this show.

191
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:49,137
We've invited a new school band, Momo.

192
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:51,651
Please welcome them.

193
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:54,747
Hello, everyone. We are Momo.

194
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:57,663
I'm the captain cum bass, Wei Hao.

195
00:22:58,134 --> 00:22:59,484
How is the review?

196
00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:01,667
As expected, it's not well received.

197
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,618
Everyone is confused.

198
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:07,461
Just wait and see.

199
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:29,632
(Our station's new program hosted
by Wu Yan, "I Want to Hear You Sing.")

200
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,729
Nian Qin, listen to it.

201
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,299
(Donghu Music Broadcast FM27.1)

202
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:44,300
Okay.

203
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,116
Thank you Momo for coming to the show.

204
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:50,547
We hope that you'll become the coolest
band in the eyes of corporate slaves.

205
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:51,959
Thank you.

206
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:53,866
Ms Xi.

207
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:56,367
There are more than 5,000 comments now.

208
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:01,839
Judging by the number of listeners,
the interaction rate is really high!

209
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:06,497
Look, everyone is saying
the discussion topic is realistic...

210
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:07,900
and very relatable.

211
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,776
Before playing the last song,

212
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,459
I have something personal to share.

213
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:16,885
Ms Xi...

214
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:24,218
My dad
is the first listener of this show.

215
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,575
He really liked the show.

216
00:24:27,522 --> 00:24:31,411
It's interesting.

217
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,547
When it's out,

218
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:39,946
I'll listen to the broadcast every day.

219
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:45,893
Perhaps it's because he never expected...

220
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:51,459
his daughter,
who inherited his tone-deafness,

221
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,552
to dream of becoming a music show host,

222
00:24:56,672 --> 00:24:59,379
and that she would actually succeed.

223
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,275
But before this episode came out,

224
00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:06,617
he had left us.

225
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:09,775
However, I believe that
he could hear the show.

226
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,379
He could hear my first show
as a broadcaster.

227
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,749
I've been tone-deaf since I was young.

228
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:19,330
I sing out of tune all the time.

229
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,027
I was teased by my friends
because of that.

230
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,935
But my dad was not worried about it.

231
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,754
He got me music scores...

232
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,824
and taught me bit by bit patiently.

233
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,637
He also brought me to karaoke.

234
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,791
He told me,

235
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,747
no one is perfect.

236
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:43,353
What's more important
is to embrace your true self...

237
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:46,446
and face the world bravely.

238
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,829
My dad...

239
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:55,683
I really think that
even if he's not my dad,

240
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:01,110
he's still a warm, and powerful person.

241
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:04,619
He's a very kind person.

242
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:12,537
My fondest childhood memory
is singing in the KTV with him.

243
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,922
The next song...

244
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:21,051
I'm thankful to the producer
for letting me choose this song.

245
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:23,814
It's me and my dad's go-to karaoke song.

246
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,186
It's "Stars Under the Sun" by Jin Hai Xin.

Move.

the demographics of the listeners.

268
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,909
Is that true?

Goodness.

271
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,185
Can we talk?

272
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,537
Come in.

273
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:11,503
The show has received good feedback.
We may continue the show.

274
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,031
You'll be the host.

275

dealing with your family affair.

Then, we may proceed
with the signing of the contract.

Or...

278

Thank you for taking care of me.

284
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,211
May I know the reason?

285
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,210
If it's because of your relationship,
I hope you can consider it again.

286
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,272
I'm not flaunting my seniority.

287
00:28:54,352 --> 00:28:56,501
However, I don't want you to be
so deep in your relationship...

288
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,657
that you neglect other things in life.

289
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,087
When you reach my age,
you'll realise it's not necessary.

290
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:05,250
I've indeed neglected
something really important in life.

291
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:10,323
Ms Xi, I understand
what you're trying to say.

292
00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:12,477
But I've made up my mind.

293
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:15,005
I think it's time to grow up.

294
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:17,178
I need to fulfill my responsibility.

295
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:19,194
Hence, I made this decision.

296
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:22,478
Okay.

297
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:24,002
I respect your decision.

298
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,377
Give me a hug.

299
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,301
Both of us are ladies.

300
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:40,882
It's not easy to survive outside.

301
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:43,552
If you need help,
you can always come to me.

302
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,476
Thank you, Ms Xi.

303
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:57,237
Here. I propose a toast.

304
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,796
Thank you for taking care of me.

305
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,645
Just skip the meaningless toast.

306

00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:17,204

310

Here.

311
00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:28,396
Just contact me anytime
if you need time, okay?

312
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,125
Sure.

313
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,841
Always go to Xu for anything.

314
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:46,462
Wu Yan.

315
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:49,308
You're really silly.

316

317
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,377
For him,

318
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:57,273
you missed the last chance
to see your dad.

319
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:01,674
Let's go.

320
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:02,906
Let's go and meet him.

321
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,633
I'll get a few friends of mine along.

322
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,762
Stop talking nonsense.
Don't make me scold you,

Wu Yan.

325
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:20,138
Are you drunk?

326
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:22,693
She's not drunk.

327
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:25,489
She's just truly hurt.

328
00:31:37,073 --> 00:31:39,148
Be safe on your way back.

329
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:42,061
-Wu Yan, please don't...
-All right.

330
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:45,334
Take care of Wei Hao. We're leaving.

331
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,253
Bye.

332
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,101
What is going on?

333
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:08,709
What is this?

334
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,343
What's wrong?

335
00:32:10,423 --> 00:32:11,879
It's not here just now.

336
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,084
That's right.

337
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,042
Not everyone uses the lift.

338
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,877
My goodness.

339
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:24,796
Hold on.

340
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:29,541
Forget it.

341
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:31,128
Let's take the lift.

342
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,510
You can't take the lift.

343
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,687
Hold on.

344
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:36,867
You're here.

345
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,235
What else can be done?
Do you plan to go somewhere else?

346
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:55,893
We're almost there.

347
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:58,068
Okay, it's okay. Relax.

348
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,257
We're almost there.

349
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,329
We're almost there.

350
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,561
All right, it's okay.

351
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,808
We're almost there.

352
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:07,033
We're almost there.

353
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:08,216
What's wrong?

354
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:09,935
Cheng Yin.

355
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,503
Wait for me.

356
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,670
What is going on?

357
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,694
Hold on.

358
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:20,250
It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.

359
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,054
Look, there's light.

360
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:23,445
My goodness. What's going on?

361
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:24,843
Is there anyone?

362
00:34:24,923 --> 00:34:26,662
Wait for me. Don't panic. Don't panic.

363
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:28,868
Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath. Don't panic.

364
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:30,457
Sit down.

365
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,495
Take a deep breath.

366
00:34:32,575 --> 00:34:34,272
Don't be scared.

367
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,234
Is there anyone outside?

368
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:37,474
I'm here.

369
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:39,047
The management will be here soon.

370
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:40,585
Don't be scared.

371
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:04,310
Hello.

372
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:07,005
What?

373
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:16,797
Which hospital?

374
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:31,257
Wu Yan.

375
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,554
You're awake.

376
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,376
How do you feel?

377
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:45,144
What happened to me?

378
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:48,288
Why am I in the hospital?

379
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:51,391
Do you feel any discomfort?

380
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:53,174
I'll get a doctor.

381
00:35:58,129 --> 00:35:59,305
Where is Cheng Yin?

382
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,270
Wei Hao is taking care of her.

383
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,507
Don't worry. Take care of yourself.

384
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,009
I'll get a doctor.

385
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,309
Stop it.

386
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:33,111
You've been playing the same song
for three hours.

387
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,460
What are you doing?

388
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:40,224
Wu Yan doesn't know that...

389
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,846
her favourite song "Moonlight",

390
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,049
is actually "Pierrot lunaire" by Debussy.

391
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,296
It's about...

392
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:55,206
a moonstruck clown
who was teased due to his depression.

393
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:57,690
Stop showing off your trivial knowledge.

394
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,714
If you're really upset,
you should look for her.

395
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:00,958
I'll send you there.

396
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,532
Once, Wu Yan told me...

397
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,588
that when a close childhood friend of hers
passed away,

398
00:37:09,756 --> 00:37:11,022
she felt...

399
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:16,222
as if she was the only person
who understood what she had lost.

400
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,300
When I heard it,

401
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,270
I felt immediately that
she had described my feelings perfectly.

402
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,201
When my mum passed away,

403
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,416
I felt the same way.

404
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:38,978
She said...

405
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:45,630
she felt comforted
after listening to my songs.

406
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:48,287
However,

407
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,257
she lost someone again.

408
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:55,266
Because of me,

409
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:02,194
she didn't manage
to see her dad for the one last time.

410
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:04,072
Stop talking, Nian Qin.

411
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,793
Xiao Lu.

412
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:15,944
Didn't you say that it's almost my turn?

413
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,662
Please make arrangements
for the eye surgery.

414
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,685
Is it painful?

415
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:48,837
Of course.

416
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,968
I injured myself
but you didn't offer to stay longer.

417
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,210
My mum is waiting for me at home.

418
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,054
You only have a few belongings.

419
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:00,595
That's so not you.

420
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:02,335
That's right.

421
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:04,435
I'm no longer the old me.

422
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:06,450
You? You always forget things.

423
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,531
You will come back
to pick up your things for sure.

424
00:39:08,988 --> 00:39:11,477
I'll just forget about those things
that I leave behind.

425
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:13,764
Are you not coming back again?

426
00:39:15,872 --> 00:39:17,236
No, I'll not come back again.

427
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:20,432
Wu Yan.

428
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,346
Will you regret it?

429
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,088
Leaving Xiamen just like that.

430
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:27,114
No.

431
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:29,642
You're the only person I'm going to miss.

432
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:31,239
Aren't you going...

433
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,396
to continue your master's degree
at my dad's university?

434
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:35,326
Then, there's nothing for me to miss.

435
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,945
I'm not fooled.

436
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:39,441
You know what I'm trying to say.

437
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,471
Perhaps, I will regret this...

438
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:53,420
but it doesn't matter anymore.

439
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:58,630
I told Xu Qian to at least give it a try.

440
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:02,915
Now, when I think back,
that's indeed inconsiderate.

441
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:05,311
My mum didn't lie to me.

442
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:09,342
Some failures are fatal.

443
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:15,186
Now I understand
how it feels to be helpless.

444
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:17,847
I'm tired.

445
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,406
I can't move anymore.

446
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:21,547
I'll say the usual line.

447
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,055
Just pretend that he's dead.

448
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:31,681
No.

449
00:40:32,482 --> 00:40:34,146
I wish I was dead.

450
00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:38,884
I don't want to have any feelings anymore.
