3
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,618
Good morning, guys.

4
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:14,747
Morning.

5
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:18,649
Wu Yan, what is this?

6
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,317
My dad asked someone...

7
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:22,755
to bring me these glutinous rice balls
from our hometown.

8
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:24,327
I'm sharing these with all of you.

9
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:26,218
We can't keep them for too long.

10
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,497
It's better if you cook
and finish them tonight.

11
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:29,520
Thank you.

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,323
We're lucky.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,701
My dad made these himself.
It's full of the flavour of happiness.

14
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,659
You'll feel even happier
after eating these.

15
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,339
-Please distribute these for me.
-Thanks.

16
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:44,903
Mr Su, this box is for you.

17
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,217
I'll put it here then.

18
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,496
I don't want it.

19
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,811
It was my fault
for thinking like that previously.

20
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,091
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,767
You don't have to apologise.

22
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,084
You didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,408
Why is it so hard to cheer him up?

24
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:29,845
Teacher, sorry.

25
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,170
I'm late.

26
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:46,849
Xiao Ling?

27
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,399
Teacher?

28
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,386
Where is Xiao Wei?

29
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,196
Mr Li, I can't find Xiao Wei.

30
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,497
I'm afraid she has been left behind.

31
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,788
Wu Yan, go check the classroom now.

32
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,148
I told them before.

33
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,735
If they can't find
their classmates or teachers,

34
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,773
just go back to the classroom.

35
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,280
Okay, I'll go find her.

36
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,440
(Grade 3 Class 3
Department of Visual Impairment)

37
00:04:58,782 --> 00:04:59,837
Xiao Wei?

38
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,496
Mr Su, Mr Su.

39
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,411
Mr Su, I thought you're all gone.

40
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:12,392
I thought you don't want me anymore.

41
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,933
I'm right here.

42
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:15,853
Have you forgotten?

43
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,808
We're doing health examination now.

44
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:23,673
Now you remember, don't you?

45
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,056
Good job, Xiao Wei.

46
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:30,525
You came to the classroom when you
couldn't find your teacher and classmates.

47
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,871
You listen to what the teacher said.
Great job.

48
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:34,937
Good girl.

49
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,546
Don't cry.

50
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:47,145
It's me.

51
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:49,546
I'll take Xiao Wei
to the health examination.

52
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,895
I know you won't listen
to my explanation,

53
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:10,822
but trust me,

54
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:13,105
I'll take good care of Xiao Wei.

55
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,561
You should at least give yourself a chance
to trust people.

56
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,058
Xiao Wei,

57
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,711
let Ms Sang take you
to the health examination, okay?

58
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,832
Okay.

59
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,504
Then we'll leave now.

60
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:50,544
Let's go, Xiao Wei.

61
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:05,242
(Su Nian Qin)

62
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,430
Oh, his attitude.

63
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,592
What a waste of that beautiful face.

64
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,951
Wu Yan, you're still here.

65
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,519
I'm just about to leave.

66
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,754
Mr Li,

67
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:17,513
I noticed that Mr Su
seems to favour Xiao Wei.

68
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,252
Xiao Wei's surname is also Su.

69
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,855
Are they relatives?

70
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:21,895
No.

71
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,793
How long has Mr Su been working here?

72
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,098
Over a month.

73
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,426
As a matter of fact,
he's not exactly our teacher.

74
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,545
The teacher who taught Braille,
Ms Zheng is delivering a baby.

75
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,863
She's on maternity leave.

76
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,941
There was another retired teacher,
Miss Xu.

77
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,142
The school wanted to hire her again.

78
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,477
However, she needs to take care
of her grandchildren out of town.

79
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,539
This is why we were in need of a teacher.

80
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:52,081
Principal Pei
happens to know Mr Su very well,

81
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:53,717
so he hired him as a substitute.

82
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:56,800
I guess he'll be here
for over half a year.

83
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:00,908
What was his previous job?

84
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:03,704
Did he teach somewhere else?

85
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,293
I've no idea.

86
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:07,444
He never joins our conversation.

87
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:13,265
Glutinous rice balls?

88
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,521
Where did you get these?

89
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:16,796
From a colleague.

90
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,646
This is the first time you received
a gift from a colleague.

91
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,990
I didn't expect your colleague to like you
with this attitude of yours.

92
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,017
Go home.

93
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:41,519
They're really good.

94
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,719
These are the best glutinous rice balls
I've ever had.

95
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,846
Are they really that good?

96
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:48,752
Try it and you'll know.

97
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,275
My dad made these himself.

98
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:54,767
It's full of the flavour of happiness.

99
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:56,667
You'll feel even happier
after eating these.

100
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,831
They're good, right?

101
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:17,938
They substituted sugar with osmanthus.

102
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,585
It's quite special.

103
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,392
Ask your colleague where she got this.

104
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:23,562
Her father made these.

105
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:24,702
I knew it.

106
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:27,863
People say that food always tastes better
if it's made with love.

107
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,544
Food made by a father is just different.

108
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,272
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:43,131
It's fine.

110
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:44,667
I don't mind.

111
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,937
Nian Qin,
there will be traffic jams on a rainy day.

112
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:09,519
You'll be late for school.

113
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,410
You only have one lesson today.

114
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,930
Why don't you make a call
and make adjustment with the school?

115
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,378
No.

116
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,770
The kids still go to school
on a rainy day.

117
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:22,858
Alright.

118
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,253
I'll pick you up after work.

119
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:45,876
Be careful.

120
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,980
Don't worry. The rain has just stopped.

121
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:20,006
Mr Su, you're here.

122
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,926
That was a heavy rain, wasn't it?

123
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,589
Come in.

124
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,612
Mr Su, I'll put it
in the umbrella stand for you.

125
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,926
I'll give you three seconds.

126
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:44,115
Three.

127
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:49,546
Two.

128
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:00,330
Appreciate it.

129
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:04,278
No problem.

130
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:07,903
Appreciate it?

131
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:11,157
He looks well-mannered
but he actually has a thin skin.

132
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,828
Mr Su, I'm sorry.

133
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:22,038
In your coming Braille lesson,
I need to use some of your time.

134
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:23,753
The school has just issued a notice.

135
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,606
We need to brief the students
about the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.

136
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm taking a day off tomorrow,
so I have to inform them in advance.

137
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,330
Do you have any issues with that?

138
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:34,917
No problem.

139
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,386
Okay, thanks a lot.

140
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,255
Wu Yan, there's nothing much to do today.

141
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,472
If you're busy, you can leave first.

142
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,561
Alright.

143
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:45,727
Take care.

144
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:10,376
Beside Zhuque Bridge,
rank grasses overgrow.

145
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,901
Over Wuyi Alley, the sun is setting slow.

146
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,701
Swallows that gathered
on Wang and Xie's eaves in bygone days,

147
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,151
Are now dipping among
the humble home's doorways.

148
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:20,139
Rank grasses overgrow.

149
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,099
The sun is setting slow.

150
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,314
It's low.

151
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:28,880
What?

152
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,044
Over Wuyi Alley, the sun is setting low.

153
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,193
No. It's obviously setting slow.

154
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:39,068
Slow.

155
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,982
I know.

156
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:42,978
But in this poem, it is setting low.

157
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,226
It's low.

158
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,970
Is that so?

159
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,912
When I was a second year student,
I even went to Wuyi Alley.

160
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:57,387
If the tourist hadn't mentioned it,
I wouldn't even know.

161
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:01,423
Wang Xian Zhi and Wang Xi Zhi
are one of the Wang and Xie...

162
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,931
in Wuyi Alley.

163
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:06,372
I heard that Wang Xian Zhi
was quite a romantic guy.

164
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:10,875
He was the allusion
of a ferry or something.

165
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,796
It's Taoye Ferry.

166
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:18,509
It's 12:00.

167
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:19,950

Besides, I noticed
that a woman has been picking him up.

00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:40,221
She asked Xiao Wei
to play stones with her.

335
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:43,068
Yes. The three of them
always hang out together.

336
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,693
It's been a while since I last met you.

337
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,563
How are you doing?

338
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:49,509
I'm good.

339
00:24:57,432 --> 00:24:58,912
-Wait here. I need to go.
-Okay.

340
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:00,097
Let's go.

341
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,768
Su,

342
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:28,828
I got so caught up with work
that I forgot to ask about you.

343
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,071
It's fine.

344
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:32,933
Just do your work. Don't mind me.

345
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:37,853
I've finished my work.

346
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,796
You must be boring sitting here alone.

347
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:43,086
Since we haven't met for a while,
we should catch up.

348
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:48,494
Su, are you seeing anyone recently?

349
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:50,034
You should let me meet her.

350
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:16,930
-You...
-Do you really want to know?

351
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:18,811
Ms Sang.

352
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,737
Sang, what's the matter?

353
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,326
Nothing, nothing.

354
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:48,679
By the way, have the children
been living here their whole lives?

355
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,735
No.

356
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:51,401
Some of them were lost.

357
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:54,717
The police couldn't find their parents,
so they were sent here.

358
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:58,419
Some of them were abandoned
by their parents.

359
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,066
Some were sent here
when they were a toddler.

360
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:03,393
Some were sent here after they were born.

361
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:06,050
Is that because they were sick?

362
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,065
They usually have birth defects.

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,413
How can there be such parents
in the world?

364
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:14,979
There are also parents...

365
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,165
who gave birth to children
with birth defects,

366
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,446
but they still take care of them
for their entire lives.

367
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:40,427
Mr Su,

368
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:42,695
I didn't expect you
to visit Xiao Wei here.

369
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:44,879
You seem to really adore her.

370
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,511
Where are you going? I can send you there.

371
00:27:50,484 --> 00:27:51,585
You don't have to.

372
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,104
Are you done?

373
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,936
I'm outside the welfare home.

374
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,687
Okay.

375
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,135
Mr Su,

376
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:38,424
I've been wanting to ask you something.

377
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,238
Are you Yi Jin?

378
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:13,789
You should at least say something.

379
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,706
If you don't want to admit it,
you could've faked it.

380
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,058
Why are you acting like this?

381
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,447
You're acting like you'd catch a plague
if you talk to me.

382
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:21,383
Go wherever you want.

383
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,032
I'm not getting in your way sitting here.

384
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,404
But please don't stand in front of me,

385
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:28,467
and stop bothering me, will you?

386
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:34,396
Mr Su, what do you think
you're talking about?

387
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:36,706
Just now, you were walking in front of me.
I was behind you.

388
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,778
Now, you're sitting, I'm standing here.

389
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:40,522
You sat on this bench first,

390
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:41,871
but you didn't construct this road,
did you?

391
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:45,253
I can stand wherever I want.
You... I can do whatever I want.

392
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:55,314
Listen.

393
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:59,921
When Yi Jin did the interview,
I met you in the lift.

394
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,076
Yi Jin's new song is based on
Wang Xian Zhi's allusion.

395
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:05,221
And we happened to discuss this before.

396
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:06,947
It's certainly not a coincidence.

397
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,347
Who is Yi Jin?

398
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,296
Forget it. That's fine.

399
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:28,992
Why don't you let me take you home?

400
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,435
You can't just
keep sitting here, can you?

401
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:43,022
It's getting dark now.

402
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,399
You need to eat.

403
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,160
Are you waiting for someone
to pick you up?

404
00:30:49,838 --> 00:30:52,379
Waiting alone is quite boring, isn't it?

405
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:53,744
I can talk to you.

406
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,082
Do you think that you're quite cool?

407
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,262
Okay. You're really cool.

408
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:10,878
Really cool.

409
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:24,081
How did you know that I work here?

410
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:26,066
Zhao Ying saw you and told me that.

411
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:27,472
I've asked them out for dinner.

412
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,767
You should at least have dinner with us
and make things clear.

413
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,028
I've nothing to say.
I shouldn't quit in such short notice,

414
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:33,539
but I really don't have time for the band.

415
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:36,533
Be honest with me.
Have you encountered any problem?

416
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,088
No.

417
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,718
What kind of problem would I have?

418
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:43,055
Stop following me.

419
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:47,543
This is my last warning.

420
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:14,177
Aren't you cold?

421
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:19,441
We've been sitting here for some time.

422
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,998
It's quite chilly.

423
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:25,421
You should go home first.

424
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:28,720
Aren't you hungry?

425
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:45,226
Wu Yan.

426
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,103
You...

427
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:55,753
He... He's my boyfriend.

428
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,392
We're on a date.

429
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,736
Mr Su, the almighty Mr Su,

430
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,337
please have some mercy
and finish this play with me.

431
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,613
Thanks.

432
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:10,036
Finish this play with me.

433
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,044
Ms Sang,

434
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:26,598
please behave yourself.

435
00:33:45,268 --> 00:33:48,065
He's hungry. He couldn't think straight.

436
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,173
Su Nian Qin.

437
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,853
Su Nian Qin!

438
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:57,786
Su Nian Qin, stop!

439
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:01,526
I told you to stop. Didn't you hear me?

440
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:04,109
I told you to...

441
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,059
♪I'm willing to imagine♪

442
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,099
♪All the possibilities♪

443
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,340
♪Make me believe♪

444
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,699
♪You're the only one♪

445
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,140
♪I'm willing to believe♪

446
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,734
Please let go.

447
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:22,765
I won't.

448
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,455
♪No matter how long the journey is♪

449
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:26,019
I can let go.

450
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,686
But you have to go there
and explain to her.

451
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,474
-Was I not telling her the truth?
-You...

452
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,482
How could you do this?

453
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,735
Do what?

454
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:45,088
How... How could you do this?

455
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,134
Listen.

456
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:50,331
I fell out with my family
and moved to Xiamen with you.

457
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:52,265
You said you'd be nice to me.

458
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:54,301
You also said you'd be a good father.

459
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:57,443
How could you leave me
and go on a date with that woman?

460
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,999
I haven't eaten anything yet.

461
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:03,584
Our child and I are starving.

462
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:07,298
How could you be so cruel
and fool around with other woman?

463
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:09,010
His wife is pregnant,

464
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,836
but he's cheating on her.

465
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:12,547
Exactly. Why would anyone do this?

466
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,998
When we were young, you only like me.

467
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,980
Why would you be with another woman now?

468
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:21,385
I could've let it slide
if it were someone else.

469
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:23,531
But she's my best friend.

470
00:35:23,611 --> 00:35:26,318
How can both of you deceive me?

471
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,567
A good-looking man will never be loyal.

472
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,109
He's a beast.

473
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:33,449
He's worse than a beast.

474
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,911
What the heck is this?

475
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,549
Sang Wu Yan.

476
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,572
Get up first.

477
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:41,861
No.

478
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:48,656
You can do whatever you want.

479
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,843
Get up first.

480
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:54,143
I'm hungry. I want KFC.

481
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:58,191
Put this on.

482
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:01,109
I'm not cold.

483
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:03,836
You still have to wear it.

484
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,264
Do you want me to keep crying?

485
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:10,843
Put it on.

486
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,647
You keep holding this blazer.
I thought it'd be hideous.

487
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,993
But it actually looks good on you.

488
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:32,940
Let's go.
