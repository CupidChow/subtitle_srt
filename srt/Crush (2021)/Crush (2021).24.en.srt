00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,400
He hopes to express that
you're his number one priority.

4
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,836
Maybe he also hopes that
you can use the same way...

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,156
to express
that he's your number one priority too.

6
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
This is his ritual.

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,718
Can I interpret this
as he loves me too much?

8
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:15,920
Of course.

9
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,836
So that means unless we divorce,

10
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,954
I have to put up with him
like this for the rest of our lives.

11
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,000
No, no. He'll get better.

12
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:30,920
In some ways,
men are a little childish.

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,116
When he gets really mature,
when he feels secure about your marriage,

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,800
these acts will be gone naturally.

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,316
Childish?

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,240
He's not childish,
he's more like a grandpa.

17
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,995
Other than asking me to open the door,
he would get talkative intermittently.

18
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,760
Fortunately, I found a good way.

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,076
I used the mole
on the tip of his nose as a button.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Whenever he talks too much,
I push the button.

21
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Just zip up his mouth.

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,320
He's too clingy.

23
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
Isn't this mine?

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,553
Listen first.

25
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,280
Is Mr. Yi Jin going to make
a comeback in the music industry?

26
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,753
No.

27
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm keeping my promise of retirement.

28
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,240
I don't like going back and forth over it.

29
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,040
That's really cool.

30
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,240
But didn't you say you want
to let the whole world hear your song?

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,880
I used to want that.

32
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,960
I used to think that
besides writing songs,

33
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
there was no other way
to let my voice be heard.

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,760
But now, it doesn't matter anymore.

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,880
I wrote this song
simply because I wanted to.

36
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,513
For you.

37
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,160
For myself.

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,800
And for those around us.

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
Since it's for me,

40
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,680
I can decide to share
it with others, right?

41
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,960
What do you want to do?

42
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,600
It's time for our last song for the day.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,120
This song today is very special.

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
Because I'll only air it once.

45
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,920
It must be fate
that you get to listen to it.

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,440
This song is from a musician
who has disappeared for a long time,

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,033
who is also my favourite musician,
Yi Jin.

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,600
I've thought for a long time
how I should introduce this song.

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,320
But in the end,

50
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,560
I realized that all the words
that have to be said is in the song.

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,160
Some words can only
be expressed through a song.

52
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm sure you can feel it
when you hear it.

What is going on?

91
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Xiao Jie misses me.
So he's staying with us for a few days.

92
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Xiao Jie, come.

93
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Xiao Jie.

94
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,933
Here.

95
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,273
Let's eat.

96
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:50,913
Okay, dig in.

97
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,436
Nian Qin, today's meal is made
according to Xiao Jie's preference.

98
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,913
You're an adult. Make do with it.
Eat up.

99
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,633
Xiao Jie,

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,000
let's take another bite.

101
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
Have some vegetables.

102
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
It's good for you.

103
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,360
What's the matter?
Why aren't you eating?

104
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,313
I have no appetite.

105
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
It's pretty tasty.

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,640
I want another meatball.

107
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,793
Okay.

108
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
Here, finish this one.

109
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,240
Xiao Jie, help yourself.

110
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,553
Good boy.

111
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,640
You're really not eating?

112
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,200
I am fed up.

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,960
You are almost 30 years old.
Why are you making a fuss over a kid?

114
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
The kid is watching. Behave yourself.

115
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,116
Nian Qin, are you hungry?

116
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,956
Would you like me
to make you some noodles?

117
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,960
I don't want noodles.

118
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you want to eat then?

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,680
Meatballs.

120
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,880
Meatballs?

121
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,880
Mix the meatballs in the rice.

122
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
Then say,
"Nian Qin, open your mouth."

123
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,236
Nian Qin, I'm going out
to buy some breakfast.

124
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Watch Xiao Jie.

125
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
Xiao Jie, are you bleeding?

126
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
No.

127
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,960
Did you fracture your bone?

128
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,560
Can you move your arms and legs?

129
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,120
That'll do. Stop crying.

130
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Get up on your own.

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
If you can, stop crying.

132
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,120
You're a man.

133
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
Men don't cry.

134
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,000
But I'm just a child.

135
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
A child?

136
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,116
If you can talk and walk,
you are not a child anymore.

137
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,560
Remember, you're a man.

138
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,320
A man's duty is to protect the weak.

139
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,600
I will protect Wu Yan then.

140
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,840
Not her.

141
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
She's mine to protect.

142
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,400
Get your own girl.

143
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,720
What happened?

144
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,440
How did you hurt your leg?

145
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,720
Su Nian Qin, did you watch the kid?

146
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm fine.
I can still move my arms and legs.

147
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Nian Qin, Xiao Jie,
come and eat your breakfast.

148
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Brother, the stars are so far away.

149
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,120
How can people get there?

150
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
You'll know when you grow up.

151
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,480
In that case, I want to grow up soon.

152
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't grow up.

153
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,640
Growing up is a trap.

154
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,880
Xiao Lu,

155
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,116
I noticed that Nian Qin
is quite good at spending time with kids.

156
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,116
Every time he finished
spending time with Jie,

157
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,080
I noticed Xiao Jie
would change a little bit.

158
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,480
Change? How?

159
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,360
He's not becoming
as insensitive as he is, is he?

160
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,160
Xiao Jie?

161
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
Xiao Jie?

162
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,873
What are you doing?

163
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,880
Xiao Jie. My goodness. Get up.

164
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,036
Do you have any idea how precious
these fish are to Nian Qin?

165
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,636
You mustn't do this again,
do you understand?

166
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,240
Don't do this again.

167
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,160
Alright, alright.

168
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,240
Don't cry, don't cry.

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,040
Stop crying, stop crying.

170
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,560
I just saw the fishes
stick their heads up...

171
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,036
as if they needed some air
and wanted to come out,

172
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,560
so I thought I should help them.

173
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,320
Alright, alright.

174
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Don't cry.

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,116
Sister, I love you so much.

176
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,720
How could you hit me?

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Xiao Jie,

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,116
when Nian Qin comes home later,
will you apologize to him?

179
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,916
Otherwise, if he gets angry,

180
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,996
I don't think anyone in this house
can ease his anger.

181
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,040
And when that happens,
what if he hits me too?

182
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,233
Good boy.

183
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
Don't do such silly things again.

184
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Didn't I tell you you're a man
and you shouldn't cry?

185
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,840
I'll be good. I won't cry anymore.

186
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
Xiao Jie,

187
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,113
good boy.

188
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,320
Stop crying.

189
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,113
Go now.

190
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,840
Thank you, brother.

191
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,960
You brat.

192
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,400
Did you hit him?

193
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
I was angry.

194
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,360
I only slapped him on his bum twice.

195
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,160
Don't hit the child
when you're angry next time.

196
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,960
Just try to reason with him.

197
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,240
If you really want to hit him,
wait until after you've calmed down.

198
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,947
So that you won't get carried away
by your emotions and hit too hard.

199
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,673
He's asleep.

200
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,840
Nian Qin, I find that you are better
with children than I am.

201
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,113
And...

202
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,000
you are quite fond
of Xiao Jie, aren't you?

203
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Nian Qin, tell me, is it better
for us to have a daughter or a son?

204
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,313
I'm fine with both.

205
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
Do you prefer a daughter or a son?

206
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:33,556
Daughter.

207
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,473
Why?

208
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
What's so good about a son?

209
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,480
He will be just like Xiao Jie.

210
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,800
When he grows up, he will
compete with me for his mother.

211
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,000
And a daughter won't compete with you?

212
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
If we have a daughter,

213
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,920
I want to give her
all the best things in the world.

214
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,120
She will be so outrageously pampered,
no one will dare to want her.

215
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,160
That's good then.

216
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
She won't marry anyone.

217
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,353
She'll stay with me.

218
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,167
I'll take care of her for her whole life.

219
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
Childish.

220
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,596
Are you sure I can come back
tomorrow night?

221
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,513
Yes.

222
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Okay, we'll use this plan.

223
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,540
Thank you all for your hard work.

224
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,420
(Meeting Room)

225
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,080
Boss, the next meeting is starting soon.

226
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,740
(Outpatient Building)

227
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,433
Congratulations.

228
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,526
It's five weeks old.

229
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,040
The fetus is healthy.

230
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,120
Five weeks?

231
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,720
This little white dot is a fetus.

232
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,356
Thank you.

233
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,273
Don't mention it.

234
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,313
Nian Qin.

235
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,680
Boss is in a meeting.

236
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,600
Is there anything I can do for you?

237
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,880
No, no.

238
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,920
I'll call back later.

239
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,033
Okay.

240
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,740
(Nian Qin)

241
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:40,079
What's the matter?

242
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,793
What's the matter?

243
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,280
The doctor said...

244
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm...

245
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,680
pregnant.

246
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,393
Hello?

247
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
Really?

248
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,120
It's five weeks old now.

249
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm coming back now.

250
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,520
Don't you have work to attend to tomorrow?

251
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,580
I'm going to the airport now.
I'm coming home.

252
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
Where are you?

253
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,120
I'm going to drive home.

254
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,233
Don't. Stay where you are.

255
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,760
I'll ask someone to pick you up.

256
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,520
Where is my wife and my child?

257
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,579
Your child is still just
a little bean sprout now.

258
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,520
Even if he's just a little bean sprout,

259
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
he's still an extraordinary
little bean sprout.

260
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,520
We're really having a baby.

261
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,520
However, due to unfamiliarity
with the local launching process,

262
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,000
there was some miscommunication,

263
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,520
which led to a cost overrun.

264
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,600
Based on our calculations,
the budget was exceeded...

265
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,640
by about one million yuan.

266
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,360
Boss?

267
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,153
It's fine.

268
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,120
It is within an acceptable range.

269
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,400
You all have worked hard.

270
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,760
Tell the advertising department
I'll buy them dinner this week.

271
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,440
I have a meeting. I have to go.

272
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,520
Did he just smile?

273
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,800
Yes, Boss just smiled.

274
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,720
Inform them to write
a self-reflection report.

275
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,240
I'm home.

276
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,520
How was your day?

277
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,960
What did you do today?

278
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,080
I went shopping with Xiao Lu.

279
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
You should go shopping less.

280
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,927
There are so many people out there.

281
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,207
Someone might bump into you easily.

282
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,400
Xiao Lu is also a clumsy person.

283
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,801
Two clumsy people getting together,
it's just horrible to even think about it.

284
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,196
You can just tell me if there
is anything you want to buy next time.

285
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,040
If you don't need anything, you mustn't...

286
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,836
Nian Qin, I'm starving.

287
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm craving for tomato egg noodle.

288
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I want to eat it now.

289
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,880
Sure. Coming right up.

290
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,780
(Xiao Lu)

291
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Xiao Lu.

292
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,440
What's wrong?

293
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,560
When Nian Qin came home today,
he didn't go through that ritual.

294
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,880
That means he's starting
to feel secure in your marriage.

295
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,396
That's so soon and so sudden.

296
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,760
How did it suddenly disappear?

297
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
It's probably because of your child.

298
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,560
Our child?

299
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,756
Since you're pregnant,

300
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,916
it made him feel like
he's not just a husband,

301
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,160
but also a father now.

302
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,636
The sense of dual responsibility,

303
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,280
has strengthened
his sense of security and identity.

304
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,440
He no longer needs
external validation.

305
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,920
Drive.

306
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,500
(Outpatient Building)

307
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,280
What's wrong?

308
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Why did you go back to talk to Dr. Zhao?

309
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm just a little worried.

310
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,320
What if my child
is born blind like me?

311
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,440
Did the doctor say anything?

312
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,240
He said he isn't sure if it is hereditary.

313
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:44,666
So far, everything looks normal.

314
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,640
But when I was born,
everything looked normal too.

315
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,756
It wasn't until a few days later
that they found out that...

316
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,920
there were issues with my eyes.

317
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,000
Look, your father and mother are fine,

318
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,116
so it's not hereditary.

319
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,479
So our child will be fine too.

320
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,193
What if he's not?

321
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
There is no "what if."

322
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,400
What if there is?

323
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,080
Even if there is, I'm not afraid.

324
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,156
Our baby has a good father
who'll look after him for his whole life,

325
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,840
who will never let him suffer.

326
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,134
So there is nothing to be afraid of
even if there is a "what if."

327
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,840
According to a staff member
who has left Music Broadcast,

328
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,916
the true identity
of the composer Yi Jin,

329
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,276
who suddenly disappeared from the
entertainment industry four years ago

330
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,516
is the sole heir of the Su family, and the
current CEO of RD Group, Su Nian Qin.

331
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,656
According to a staff member,

332
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,056
RD Group CEO, Su Nian Qin's background
revealed who has left Music Broadcast,

333
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,556
(Mysterious composer
Yi Jin's real identity)

334
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,756
the true identity
of the composer Yi Jin,

335
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,476
who suddenly disappeared from the
entertainment industry four years ago,

336
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,881
is the sole heir of the Su family,

337
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:06,291
and the current CEO of RD Group,
Su Nian Qin.

338
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,200
The current CEO of RD Group,
Su Nian Qin.

339
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:27,865
Tell the public relations department.

340
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't care how they are going
to handle the public opinion.

341
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,880
I will not show my face
or make any statements.

342
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,396
I reserve the right
to pursue legal responsibility,

343
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,880
against personal privacy violation.

344
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,156
That's all.

345
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,160
Okay, got it.

346
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,636
The number you have dialled
is currently engaged.

347
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,040
Please wait...

348
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,640
Hello, Wu Yan.

349
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,520
Why was your phone busy just now?

350
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,680
Nian Qin,

351
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,960
are you alright?

352
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,396
I'm fine. What about you?

353
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,360
Are you okay?

354
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,440
I'm okay.

355
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,036
The baby is fine too.

356
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,040
He just rolled in my belly.

357
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,240
Are you alone?

358
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,516
Madam Zhang is here too.

359
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,160
She just came back
from grocery shopping.

360
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,640
Stay at home and don't open the door.

361
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,880
Draw the curtains.

362
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,680
Unplug the landline phone line.

363
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,840
I'll come back to pick you up tonight.

364
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,200
Nian Qin, are you really fine?

365
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,200
Don't worry.

366
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,040
I'll put an end to this soon.

367
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
I'm not worried about people's opinion.

368
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,920
I'm worried about you.

369
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,710
I'm worried that you are feeling sad.

370
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,800
Don't worry.

371
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,080
How can I be sad when I have you?

372
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,600
Those things in the past
shouldn't have made you sad.

373
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,236
The more unpleasant your past was,

374
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,600
the more it proves that
you deserve to be happy in the future.

375
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,760
Wu Yan, I'm sorry.

376
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,360
There are many things I should've...

377
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,196
It's the first time I've heard you...

378
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,840
apologize to me
in a sober and serious manner.

379
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
Nian Qin,

380
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,320
I'll make you happy.

381
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,400
I will make up for all the happiness
you missed in the past.

382
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,553
Wu Yan.

383
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm fine.
I just drew the curtain.

384
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,156
Ask Madam Zhang
to lock all the doors and windows.

385
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,640
She's cooking now.

386
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,040
I don't want to bother her
over a trivial matter like this.

387
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,560
I can manage it.

388
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,480
Think of it as exercise.

389
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,920
Be careful.

390
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,000
Maybe you should put the phone down first.

391
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,280
It's okay. I'm strong.

392
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,553
Wu Yan.

393
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,040
I'm fine. I was just trying to scare you.

394
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,034
Boss, the director
of the public relations department...

395
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,920
Wu Yan, I have to go.

396
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Take care of yourself.

397
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,520
Wait for me to come home.

398
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,513
I will.

399
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,276
-I need to go home now.
-Okay.

400
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,996
But there are many reporters
in front of your house now.

401
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,960
Wu Yan's inside the house.

402
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,800
She needs me.

403
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:40,204
How about this?

404
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,713
Nian Qin.

405
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,920
Wu Yan, let me hug you.

406
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,720
Where is your ring?

407
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,516
I washed my face before I went out.
So I took it off.

408
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,280
Then, I forgot to put it back on.

409
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,080
Don't simply take it off
after you've put it on.

410
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
You're forgetful.

411
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,160
If you lose it,
I could buy you another one,

412
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,240
but you might think it's inauspicious.

413
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,760
Where are we going?

414
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,320
Let's find a hotel.

415
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,800
Why don't we go back to our old apartment?

416
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,360
I don't like hotels.

417
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,679
Go to the apartment in Lujiang.

418
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,080
Qin said you're tired.

419
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,360
Why don't you take a nap?

420
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,360
I can't sleep.

421
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,199
How about I sing you a lullaby?

422
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm afraid I'll have nightmares
for three days.

423
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,913
How can you still be so mean?
I hate you.

424
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,273
Wu Yan,

425
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,440
what the media said is true.

426
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,880
My mother did pass away in a car accident.

427
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,876
I only found out later that
she actually died in front of me.

428
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,320
Stop, Nian Qin.

429
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,560
I'm not going to press you for an answer.

430
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,280
You can tell me what happened in the past
when you're ready, okay?

431
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,960
Are you really okay?

432
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,633
I am.

433
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,400
Ever since I have Sang Wu Yan,
I'm no longer sad.

434
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,400
Careful.

435
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,880
You say this word
dozens of times every day.

436
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,800
I'll protect our home.

437
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,120
Don't worry.

438
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,680
I'm just worried
that you're feeling upset.

439
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,800
Your man is not as fragile as you think.

440
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,433
Wu Yan.

441
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,600
My stomach hurts.

442
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,120
Wu Yan, Wu Yan.

443
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,960
I'm sorry.

444
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,320
Nian Qin.

445
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,120
What if we lose the baby?

446
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,160
Then so be it.
We don't want him anymore.

447
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,320
How could you say that?

448
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,600
You love him so much.
How could you say you don't want him?

449
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,196
So if I die,
will you not want me as well?

450
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,113
Don't you dare.

451
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
Stop talking about dying.

452
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,000
What if I really die?

453
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
If you dare to pass away
and leave me behind,

454
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,560
I'll find someone new immediately.

455
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,680
I'll forget you in just a few days.

456
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,960
You're lying.

457
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,680
You wouldn't do this to me.

458
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,033
Goodbye.

459
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,560
Wu Yan.

460
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,833
Wu Yan.

461
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,280
Where is our baby?

462
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,713
How is he?

463
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,553
He's fine.

Su Nian Qin, when I picked the leaf
back then,

484
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:30,116
why didn't you say anything?

485
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,760
Don't you still keep it with you?

486
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,353
Let's go.

487
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,880
Su Nian Qin.

488
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,753
Look.

489
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
Be honest with me.

490
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You fell for me hard
at that time, didn't you?

491
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:56,280
It took me a long time
to allow myself to fall in love with you.

492
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,400
Allow?
