(On air)

4
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,915
Welcome to a new day
in Golden Hits Studio.

5
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,728
Today is Thursday.

6
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,643
Today is a little cloudy.

7
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:16,433
You’re like the most delicate flower,
floating outside the blue window.

8
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:19,289
It’s like you might fall
into my heart anytime.

9
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:21,963
You switched the channel?

10
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,208
No. Why?

11
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,547
Nothing.

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,030
The first song for today...

13
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,285
is a classic song that
matches the sky today.

14
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,280
It's best to wind down your car window,

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,481
feel the wind in your face
as you listen to this song.

16
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,551
Fall by Xu Guan Chun,

17
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,124
composed and written by Yi Jin,

18
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:42,261
a very mysterious songwriter and lyricist.

19
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,106
This doesn't sound like Miss Xi.

20
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:47,736
♪If wishes and future hadn't
come into contact♪

21
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:50,440
♪Perhaps♪

22
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,928
Although Xu Guan Chun
has released a new song,

23
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,207
everyone still prefers
the song you wrote.

24
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,409
Switch it off. It's too noisy.

25
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,280
When Lin Yang's Dream Under
The Night Sky is available online,

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,328
I wonder if Xu Guan Chun's new song
will still be in the charts.

27
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:06,304
Lin Yang was surprised that...

28
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,471
you're willing to write a song
for a rookie like him.

29
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:10,945
Netizens are curious of who Yi Jin is.

30
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,336
It's a super topic now.

31
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:15,459
Miss Xi has always wanted
to invite you for an interview.

32
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,006
Do you want to consider it?

33
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:18,181
No.

34
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:19,322
I understand.

35
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,803
You don't want Yi Jin's identity exposed.

36
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:24,311
But Miss Xi knows us well.

37
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:27,440
We'll maintain confidentiality
and make sure nobody knows.

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,829
Many listeners are now asking why
we change the channel host.

39
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,547
What should we do?

40
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:41,244
Can we just straightaway tell listeners
I'm the substitute host?

41
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:42,880
Fang Fang. Keep calling her.

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,088
Alright.

43
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,233
Wu Yan. Can you keep to the script?

44
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,154
Just start the second segment later.

45
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,715
-Listen to my instruction.
-Alright.

46
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,558
Sorry, I'm late.

47
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,390
Miss Xi. Why can't your phone be reached?

48
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,429
I dropped my phone because I was in hurry.

49
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,428
Wu Yan. The song will end soon.

50
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,211
Think of something to wind it up smoothly.

51
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,420
Alright.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,669
Welcome back to Golden Hits Studio,
brought to you live on 27.1 FM.

53
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,520
Many listeners asked why
the host sounded different today.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,560
Actually, this is a little game
our programme team has planned...

55
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,711
for our listeners during the opening...

56
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,910
to test the auditory skills
of our listeners.

57
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,149
Alright then. Next up is...

58
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,466
Hello, everyone. I'm Nie Xi.

59
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:27,855
The ability to differentiate a voice
will allow one to enjoy music better.

60
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:31,841
It seems that our listeners
have very sharp ears.

61
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,256
There's always someone in your heart.

62
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,748
There's always something in your mind
that you can't shake it off.

63
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,572
Hello? It's been a while
since I hear from you.

64
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,695
I have time today.

65
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,796
See you later.

66
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:51,601
I knew it.

67
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,932
The manager of Xu Guan Chun called.

68
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,103
They heard your Dream Under The Night Sky.

69
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:57,693
Now they want to meet up.

70
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:02,389
I think they'll ask us
why we didn't give them the song.

71
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,092
What should we say?

72
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:08,675
The truth.

73
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:10,799
His voice doesn't suit the song.

74
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:14,046
I'm afraid they won't accept it so easily.

75
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:15,916
I'll send you home first.

76
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,607
Drop me at the nearby park.

77
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,470
I want to sit there for a while.

78
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,454
Pick me up after you're done.

79
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,906
Miss Xi. Are you okay?

80
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,088
I'm fine.

81
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:33,569
Everyone in the team just needs
to write a reflective report.

82
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,444
How did it feel to be at the anchor desk
for the first time?

83
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:42,686
It's hard to tell
because I was too anxious just now.

84
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:44,690
Let me ask you then.

85
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,690
If I couldn't make it today,
what will you do?

86
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:50,476
Do you plan to keep reading the script...

87
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:53,916
and make today a non-interactive show
without taking calls from listeners?

88
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,868
I...

89
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,876
You're very brave today
but don't be carried away.

90
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:02,915
This is not campus broadcast.

91
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,646
You're still not prepared for
the position of a radio host.

92
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:07,586
You should know it yourself.

93
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,639
I understand.

94
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll continue to work hard, Miss Xi.

95
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,456
Alright then. You can clock off now.

96
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,707
Quickly go back for class.

97
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,269
I'll get going then, Miss Xi.

98
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,005
Someone is here for you.

99
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,791
No, I have no idea. I don't know him.

100
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:26,587
I'll leave now, Miss Xi. Goodbye.

101
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,774
Why didn't you pick up my call?

102
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,395
I don't want to.

103
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:35,202
How did you know where to find me?

104
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:36,519
Cheng Yin told me about it.

105
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,681
Wu Yan. Xu Qian and I are not...

106
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,545
Whatever it is with the two of you
is none of my business.

107
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,576
Wu Yan...

Now, let's conclude humanism,
the most important theory of therapy.

122
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,996
Firstly, humans have a tendency
of self-actualization.

123
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:28,103
Rogers thinks that humans
are born with a basic motive.

124
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,654
I saw a guy in the park today.

Absolutely divine.

126

I didn't dare to take a photo.

00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,157
When the broadcast station was recruiting,

130
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:47,207
you even had the guts to get
the first-year campus prince to sign up.

131
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,267
There's nothing you dare not do.

Finish the assignment.

I'll see you all next week.

135

I'm your host, Xu Qian.

137
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:04,577
Today, the first song I'm going to play
is a newly-released song.

I have to check it out.

156
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,005
You really have an occupational disease.
Why don't you just text Xu Qian directly?

157
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:57,156
I won't.

158
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,529
I've drawn the line with them.

159
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,071
(Dream Under The Night Sky, Yi Jin)

160
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,310
It's Yi Jin.

161
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,049
I knew it.

162
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:10,128
He didn't post it in his page again
to give fans a preview.

163
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,760
(Billboard Chart)

164
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,052
It's in second place in the charts now.

165
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,099
It's going to make this Lin Yang famous.

166
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,391
Your Yi Jin again.

167
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:25,077
What kind of person is Yi Jin?

168
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:27,986
With a song, he made Xu Guan Chun
famous overnight.

169
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,156
But no one knows who he is.

170
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:34,017
This time, he worked with a newcomer.

171
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,431
That's just too mysterious.

172
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:39,029
Do you think he's a writer?

173
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,815
Or a language teacher?

174
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,441
Or, he's a pervert.

175
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,111
You're the pervert.

176
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:46,638
Don't insult my idol.

177
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:48,537
I'm praising him.

178
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:50,624
He's a low-profile to a perverted degree.

179
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,805
Have you come across anyone
who says that to praise others?

180
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,224
Do you want a beating? Do you?

181
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:55,905
-Alright. Stop hitting me.
-Stop running.

182
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,671
Come here.

183
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,032
Milk is on the first level.

184
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:05,434
Fruits on the second level.

185
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,191
Drinking water is by the side.

186
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:09,249
Thank you.

187
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:11,602
If you really want to thank me,

188
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,540
then write another song for Xu Guan Chun
as a compensation.

189
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:17,633
You gave your Dream Under The Night Sky
to newcomer Lin Yang.

190
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,448
Xu Guan Chun's side is not happy about it.

191
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,986
Whether he's happy or not,
it has nothing to do with me.

192
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,390
Dream Under The Night Sky...

193
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,729
is now catching up on
Xu Guan Chun's new song.

194
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:30,394
They're having a tough time on publicity.

195
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:32,169
They think we're attacking them.

196
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:35,504
I tried to explain to them
that his voice doesn't suit the song.

197
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,220
But they just can't understand.

198
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,910
They think we're giving an excuse.

199
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,103
This is a problem that
the company needs to resolve.

200
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,501
Nian Qin. Aren't you being unreasonable?

201
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,746
You're lucky I know your temper.

202
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,629
Anyone else is going to be mad at you.

203
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,490
I still have work. I'm leaving now.

204
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,943
Wu Yan.
Let's have dinner together tonight.

205
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,237
I'll invite Wei Hao.

206
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:01,150
I have something to attend to.
You two go ahead.

207
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,097
Wu Yan. I want to talk to you.

208
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,800
You don't have to.

209
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,517
I treated you as my closest friend.

210
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,014
Way better than I treated Wei Hao.

211
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:15,835
But since you never wanted to talk to me
before you two want to be together,

212
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,098
there's nothing to talk about
now or in the future.

213
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,346
Wu Yan. We're not...

214
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,536
So, did Wei Hao ever like you?

215
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:30,382
Why do you ask me that too?

216
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,669
I'll change the question.

217
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,355
Did he ever say he likes you?

218
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,549
We grew up together.

219
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,100
We've been together for ages.
We're like an old couple.

220
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,099
Have you ever seen an old couple
say they love each other everyday?

221
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,409
So, Wei Hao has never actually
uttered explicitly that he likes you.

222
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,755
It's not compulsory to utter it.

223
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,376
Look.

224
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:04,233
In the past, he'd always buy me breakfast
or go shopping with me.

225
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:07,244
When the hostel gate is shut,
he'd come pick me up on his bike.

226
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:08,714
Aren't these expressions of
liking someone?

227
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:10,850
Then, have you ever said you like him?

228
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,230
You may think that confession
is a meaningless ritual.

229
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,039
But a clear relationship is based on that.

230
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,136
If both of you don't say it,

231
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:25,356
you'll be guessing it until it dies out.

232
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:27,373
I...

233
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:31,688
If you need words to convince
even after being with each other...

234
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,269
for so long,

235
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:35,164
isn't it a waste of
all those times together?

236
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,037
Now it's really all a waste.

237
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:45,645
In that case, I can let go everything
and marry Yi Jin.

238
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:49,239
I'm so happy.

239
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,990
Just cry if you want to.

240
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,243
Why should I cry
if my new life has just begun?

241
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,925
Group message from the radio station.

242
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,622
I'm now walking towards
the path of realising my dream.

243
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,755
I have to focus. No time for romance now.

244
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,342
A pretty girl claims she's the
composer and lyricist Yi Jin.

245
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:22,616
She revealed her relationship
with music star Xu Guan Chun.

246
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:24,888
Oh heavens.

247
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:25,927
This...

248
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,365
Yi Jin is a girl?

249
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,967
Why did the fake news suddenly surface?

250
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:33,472
I'm sorry
you had to work overtime on this.

251
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,637
Thank you.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,412
The record company will release
an official notice later tonight...

253
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,052
to clarify that she faked the identity.

254
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:44,941
But Xu Guan Chun is too popular
these days.

255
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,961
I'm afraid we can't stop this fake news
from snowballing.

256
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,891
Everyone will only be interested
in the gossips.

257
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,507
The fake Yi Jin will make a mark.

258
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,001
I'm really curious.

259
00:17:56,081 --> 00:17:57,944
A girl is claiming that she is Yi Jin.

260
00:17:58,024 --> 00:17:59,669
Aren't you anxious at all?

261
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:09,882
Close your eyes.

262
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,157
This is my world.

263
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:19,700
It doesn't have a hint of chaos.

264
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,970
I only write songs I want to write.

265
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,386
It's not important...

266
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,392
who Yi Jin is.

267
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,081
Is it really not important?

268
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,719
At that time,

269
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,511
did you also close your eyes like this
and tell yourself that it's not important?

270
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,083
It's too late.

271
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,855
Why did I call myself Yi Jin?

272
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:04,937
Yixiyijin, a night and a day.
It represents my ambiguous...

273
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,021
but heartwarming love stories.

274
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:08,173
Yiguyijin, the old and the new...

275
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,580
It represents the impact
and interaction of thinking...

276
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,905
between my upbringing
in Chinese traditional studies...

277
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,942
and my higher education abroad.

278
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,036
This two ideas are merged
by the word Yi Jin.

279
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:22,589
That's gross.

280
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:23,853
It's definitely fake.

281
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,165
Why are you so worked up?

282
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,136
How did you reflective report go?

283
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,270
You told me before...

284
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,059
that you want to invite Yi Jin
for an interview...

285
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,085
but it never happen.

286
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:44,568
Why did she suddenly want to come?

287
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,308
She is fake.

288
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:47,872
Fake? How can it be?

289
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,578
She's really a fake. I can warrant that.
The real Yi Jin...

290
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,892
I'll get the real Yi Jin
to come to our show.

291
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,159
Alright. I'll wait for it.

292
00:19:57,757 --> 00:19:58,876
If you can't do it,

293
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:02,298
I'll have to take it that
you're just making excuses.

294
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:07,383
The reason I didn't go public
with my real identity...

295
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:08,786
is not about staying low-key.

296
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,862
It's because I love my life.

297
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:14,213
Life as a public figure
is too much a burden.

298
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:15,323
But,

299
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:19,442
I did write my first song, "Fall"
as a token of our love.

300
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,460
It's from the male perspective.

301
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,570
He told me his feeling
when he first saw me.

302
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,556
That first time we met on the beach.

303
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:30,359
I was touched
so I wrote this song for him.

304
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,060
But he's now denying everything.

305
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,358
He even denied that I'm Yi Jin.

306
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,205
Miss Xi said her director has ordered...

307
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,308
to invite the fake Yi Jin
for an interview.

308
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,095
She's in an awkward situation now.

309
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,810
I know you don't care.

310
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,814
But Nian Qin,
can you at least visit the station once?

311
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,583
At least let them know Yi Jin is a fake
and cannot be interviewed.

312
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:55,590
Nie Xi is my best friend.

313
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,165
Can you do this for me?

314
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,729
(Tomorrow's music guest
is a mysterious big shot)

315
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,675
What are you so focused on?

316
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:11,626
I'm checking if there's any celebrity
coming to our station.

317
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:15,816
Usually when a celebrity is coming,
they're announce it in Weibo.

318
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,896
But it's so weird this time.

319
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,942
I asked Miss Fang Fang and others
about the guest in this coming show...

320
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,464
but they have no idea too.

321
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,732
We don't have a class tomorrow.

322
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:26,986
You can go have a look.

323
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:32,334
How's your Yi Jin doing?

324
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,081
I don't know who to trust.

325
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:40,235
If the record company says she's a fake,
then where is the real Yi Jin?

326
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:43,377
That's why I believe the girl.

327
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:45,325
Who would want
to create rumours like that?

328
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:51,700
Notice.

329
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,090
Tomorrow morning at 8:00,

330
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,678
please gather at the lecture hall
of the main building.

331
00:21:56,758 --> 00:22:00,093
Counselors will announce arrangements
on internship matters.

332
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:03,402
It's about internship again.

333
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,730
Please sign the attendance for me then.

334
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:13,004
You've really put your whole heart
into that radio station career.

335
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:15,969
I love you.

336
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,130
Crippled at such a young age.

337
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,813
Yu Xiao Lu is calling.

338
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,640
I'll go up on my own.

339
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,870
You don't need to come down.

340
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:05,007
Inner first column on the left.

341
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,730
Second row from top.

342
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:09,741
I got it.

343
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:19,962
It's him.

344
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:31,150
He's blind?

345
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:46,540
His eyes are pretty.

346
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:55,216
Do you need help?

347
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:58,846
No, thanks.

348
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:04,816
Inner first column on the left.

349
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:06,391
Second row from top.

350
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,512
I feel like a thief.

351
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:46,583
Come back quick,

352
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:48,397
Mr Zhao said if you don’t
come back before the session ends,

353
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:49,878
you’ll flunk the subject, hurry up.

354
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,697
Seventh floor.

355
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,408
I really don't want to go.

356
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:23,847
Hello? Miss Fang Fang.

357
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:25,581
I need to go back to campus.

358
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:33,352
Tenth floor.

359
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,374
Mr Su.

360
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:37,562
Nian Qin.

361
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,341
I'll follow Xiao Lu.

362
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:43,385
Alright. This way please.

363
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:54,028
Work interview, postgraduate interview
and civil servant interview...

364
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:56,257
are the three major categories.

365
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,406
Some students...

366
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,726
have contacted the organisation
for internship.

367
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:05,179
As for the rest,

368
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,504
the university has arranged
two organisations for internship.

369
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:11,900
One group will be going
to the high security prison.

370
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,973
The other
will go to a special education school.

371
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:18,215
I heard you're going
to the high security prison.

372
00:26:18,295 --> 00:26:20,901
To proactively apply to go
to a high security prison.

373
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:23,015
-What is high security?
-Cheng Yin.

374
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:26,041
The inmates are all felons who
are convicted for over 50 years.

375
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,333
You mean murderers?

376
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:31,326
Not just that.
Drug dealers, smugglers or kidnappers too.

377
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,290
Do you want to join me?

378
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,336
No, thanks.

379
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,897
You pampered girl. I'll let you in
on the horror stories later.

380
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:38,535
Sang Wu Yan.

381
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,676
Where do you plan to go?

382
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,010
Special education school.

383
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:49,604
For the rest of you, give your names
to the class monitor.

384
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,111
Sang Wu Yan. Come with me.

385
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:54,517
I...

386
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,179
Alright.

387
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:58,428
Good morning, everyone.
This is Golden Hits Studio...

388
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:00,516
on 27.1 FM.

389
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:02,254
Yesterday,
we have given a preview that...

390
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:04,971
a mysterious guest will
come on the show today.

391
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:10,151
In our studio now is
famous songwriter and lyricist Yi Jin.

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,823
Hello, everyone. I'm Yi Jin.

393
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,551
Yi Jin. I have a question for you.

394
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:19,100
Two days ago, someone claimed
to be you on the internet.

395
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,934
There was a huge uproar about this.

396
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,719
Why didn't you come forward to clarify it?

397
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,116
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

398
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:31,333
I don't care how they think.

399
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:35,660
Why did you decide to
embark on songwriting?

400
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:39,514
Did you dream to be a songwriter
when you're young?

401
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,405
I just like music.

402
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,838
I never thought about it at that time.

403
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:49,253
Facing such a large number of music fans,

404
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,935
why did you intentionally choose
to avoid the public?

405
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,106
To keep my life private.

406
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,468
Is this the only reason?

407
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,344
This is the only reason.

408
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:04,046
In that case, I'm really curious about...

409
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:08,452
why you choose
to accept this interview invitation?

410
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,949
I feel I have wronged my song.

411
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,489
For the song to be heard in the way,

412
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:23,305
it's a failure on my part.

413
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,503
What were you thinking?

414
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,891
Are you planning to go for
postgraduate studies?

415
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:31,184
No, I don't want to.

416
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,948
I also don't plan to
become a psychotherapist.

417
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:37,853
I prefer working in a radio station.
I'm very sure of this.

418
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:41,554
But if you go for postgraduate studies,
you don't have to make it your career.

419
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:44,780
You can choose the academic path
like your father.

420
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,859
Can you make this quick?

421
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:50,040
Hopefully I still get to hear
a little part of it.

422
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,647
Even if you go for postgraduate studies,

423
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:54,454
you can still
work part-time at the radio station.

424
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,631
Mr and Mrs Sang...

425
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,280
really hope you can go back
to pursue your postgraduate studies.

426
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,695
I know you have your ideals.

427
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:04,222
I totally understand and support you.

428
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:07,691
But you should at least
think of your parent's hopes.

429
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,311
Mr Zhao. I have decided
to become a professional radio host...

430
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:16,177
and I plan to achieve success in this.

431
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,011
I've made up my mind.

432
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:22,580
Wu Yan. Are you really going
to bet on your future?

433
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,553
I want to bet on a path that is mine.

434
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:33,093
If you don't have any other matters,
I'll go back now.

435
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,785
I'm not done.

436
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,045
The internship is very important.

437
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,964
It'll directly affect your graduation.

438
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:45,476
I'll work hard on the internship.
Goodbye, Mr Zhao.

439
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,609
Oh, right, Mr Zhao.

440
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,816
About my plan,

441
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:55,039
I'd like to personally tell my father.

442
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,501
Can you...

443
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,411
Don't worry.

444
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,468
Thank you, Mr Zhao. Goodbye, Mr Zhao.

445
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,733
For the last question,
it's my personal question as a host.

446
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:16,487
Do you have any preference
when you listen to the radio?

447
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,493
I don't like it
when someone request a song I don't like.

448
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:27,880
We'd like to thank Mr Yi Jin
for coming on the show today.

449
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,166
Thank you.

450
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:30,771
You're welcome.

451
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:32,634
It's...

452
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:33,916
It's Yi Jin?

453
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:35,511
What did Mr Zhao say?

454
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:37,641
It was Yi Jin.

455
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,306
What are you talking about?

456
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:49,262
Did you know who is the guest
of our radio show today?

457
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:51,413
It was Yi Jin.

458
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:54,917
If I was in the station,
I could meet Yi Jin.

459
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:58,828
I missed my chance to meet Yi Jin.

460
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,708
This is a curse of your destiny.

461
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:03,841
My condolence to you.

462
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:05,163
My condolence...

463
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,682
You don't have to apologize.

464
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:17,699
We all have our own difficulty
in this line.

465
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:21,301
Scandals are like swamps.

466
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,757
It's not easy to get your name cleared.

467
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,107
I will let him know.

468
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,305
Don't worry.

469
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:37,956
He gave us a call on this.

470
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:39,634
He sounded genuine.

471
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,107
-Next time...
-We'll talk about it when it comes.

472
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:45,754
Alright. I'll send you to the school.

473
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,780
(Xiamen Special Education School)

474
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,036
Children, we know that...

475
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:10,373
Chinese Braille is made up of
vowel and consonant sounds.

476
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:12,726
The two combines to
become a Chinese character.

477
00:32:13,995 --> 00:32:16,967
Two to three Chinese characters
make a phrase.

478
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:21,057
Phrases are arranged into
a complete sentence.

479
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,364
Moreover, in between some phrases,

480
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:33,617
we need to do word segment continuation.

481
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:38,315
Today, we're going to practise
word segment continuation for numerals.

482
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:41,139
Mr Su.

483
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:57,931
Xiao Wei.

484
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,900
Twelve is a numeral.

485
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,374
Remember to do a continuation.

486
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:03,777
I got it.

487
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,745
Good girl.

488
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:18,855
Alright. Class dismissed.

489
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:20,090
On your feet.

490
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,816
Goodbye, Mr Su.

491
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:27,557
Goodbye.

492
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,783
Mr Su.

493
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:47,503
Do I know you?

494
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:51,002
I think you don't.

495
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,287
Do you need help?

496
00:34:11,454 --> 00:34:12,849
Do, do you need help?

497
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,232
We've met...

498
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,355
at the radio station.

499
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,543
Yes, in the elevator.

500
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:27,484
I'm the new teacher intern.

501
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:28,823
I'm Sang Wu Yan.

502
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,717
How about you, Mr Su?

503
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,035
Su Nian Qin.

504
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,817
Nian Qing?

505
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:37,289
Nian Qing?

506
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,532
Nian Qin.

507
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,759
Q, I, N.

508
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,142
Su Nian Qin.

509
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:43,654
Mr Su,

510
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:46,289
do you know where is
the school director's office?

511
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:48,608
I'll take you there.

512
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:50,180
Okay.

513
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,976
-Slow down.
-Wait for me.

514
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,906
Slow down, slow down.

515
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:01,083
Slow down.
