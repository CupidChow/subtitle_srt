3
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:06,763
What happened?

4
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:10,045
It was fine before you went out.
Why are you so angry after returning?

5
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,299
You said I went out to apologize to him,

6
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,452
to give each other an out.

7
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:22,530
He could've just followed it through.

8
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,028
Instead he said things like,

9
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,799
"I accept your apology."

10
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,916
I thought something big happened.
This looks like Young Master Su's style.

11
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:34,894
Look at you.

12
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,230
What's wrong with me?

13
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,521
You should rebuke him if you are able to.

14
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:57,009
When are these small lights installed?

15
00:02:58,497 --> 00:02:59,521
Small lights?

16
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:02,120
When I first went out to pick you up,
didn't you see it?

17
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,079
Miss Xi.

18
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,083
It's really you. Why are you here?

19
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:28,373
Wu Yan.

20
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,440
I came to Tongcheng Count
to do an offline promotion.

21
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,259
So I stopped by the local radio station.

22
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,130
My university classmate works here.

23
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,702
Do you work here too?

24
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,735
When I remembered this was your hometown,

25
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:48,267
I just thought you might be working
in the local radio station.

26
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,822
As soon as I came back,

27
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:52,222
I worked part-time
in this small radio station.

28
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:55,603
Three years have passed since then.

29
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,606
I heard that Nian Qin also
came to Tongcheng.

30
00:03:58,686 --> 00:03:59,912
How are both of you doing?

31
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,728
Nothing happened.

32
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,303
Do you regret it?

33
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:08,155
You just left like that last time.

34
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:13,436
I was asked this question three years ago.

35
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:15,502
I regretted that initially.

36
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,468
But looking back,

37
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,431
I might have underestimated myself
at that time.

38
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,743
I dare to love and give.

39
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:23,938
I am not afraid of losing
if I dare to give.

40
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,499
Now I understand...

41
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:31,070
why someone like Su Nian Qin who
lives in the cloud would fall for you.

42
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,222
I will be honest with you.

43
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,494
I embarrassed you at the radio station
with selfish intentions.

44
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:37,850
I regretted it.

45
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:42,798
However, I found out that
even if he lost you,

46
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,729
he wouldn't pay attention to me.

47
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,022
Xi, who do you think...

48
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,980
is the luckier person between me and you?

49
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,861
I do not regret.

50
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,068
But I did think about it before.

51
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:00,809
If I have never met him, or maybe,

52
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,956
I have never been with him,

53
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,514
I might not be who I am now.

54
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,990
What if it was me?

55
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,676
I will choose to be you.

56
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,564
After all, you still have a chance.

57
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,403
Maybe those incidents
were all misunderstandings.

58
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:15,573
Misunderstandings?

59
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,566
Indeed.

60
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,970
He is indeed someone
who is easy to misunderstand.

61
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,353
This name, Su Nian Qin, is a curse.

62
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,783
Nian Qin, occupied with love.

63
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,909
Maybe it's his nature.

64
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:34,937
Do you know
Su Nian Qin is actually someone,

65
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,909
who doesn't like to cheat.

66
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,369
In his opinion,

67
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,663
he won't commit to what he can't do.

68
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:44,316
If he doesn't know how to answer,
then he won't answer.

69
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:47,570
Because he didn't tell me anything about
his family and his past,

70
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,363
I was angry with him.

71
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,426
But I didn't understand until later.

72
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:54,792
Not mentioning it,
is the way he uses the most to escape.

73
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,690
Help me find a quieter place.
A place that has good food.

74
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,480
I am inviting someone to dinner tonight.

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,520
But boss, you have a meeting
this afternoon.

76
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,568
We are not sure what time it will end.

77
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,776
Then, supper will do.

78
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,510
Right. That won't do.

79
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,220
It's not safe so late at night.

80
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:26,624
Shall we have dinner earlier?

81
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:29,243
If we come back earlier,
then I can continue with the meeting.

82
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,827
(Wu Yu)

83
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,359
Hello.

84
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,447
Wu Yan.

85
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:51,848
I am Wu Yu.

86
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,471
Mr Wu, hello.

87
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:55,754
It is like this.

88
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:59,112
I have a friend from Japan.
He brought his kid's picture book.

89
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,551
I had a look.
I think it would suit Xiao Jie.

90
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,949
Thank you.

91
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,308
You are thoughtful.

92
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,701
Are you free tonight?

93
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,187
I will pick you up after work.

94
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,467
I will be done around 5:30 PM.

95
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:21,572
Great.

96
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,358
Keep up with the white car ahead.

97
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,811
How is it? It is not bad, right?

98
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,187
It is so delicate.

99
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,641
I want it all.

100
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,757
How much does this cost?
I'll transfer the money to you.

101
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,070
No, no.

102
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,099
Then I'll transfer it to you
based on the menu's price.

103
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:45,828
All right.

104
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,946
The food in this shop tastes very good.

105
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,065
-Try it.
-Okay.

106
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,097
-Thanks.
-Please enjoy.

107
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:55,616
Come.

108
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,621
This is too spicy.

109
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,238
Wu Yan, sometimes I feel that you
are like a child who hasn't grown up.

110
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:13,848
Excuse me.

111
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,110
Thanks.

112
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,227
Drink some water.

113
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,573
Is it better now?

114
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:28,774
Much better.

115
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,540
(Nian Qin)

116
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,351
Hey.

117
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,711
Come out.

118
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,812
Where to?

119
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:49,056
Look to your right.

120
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,202
My...

121
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,189
I am eating.

122
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,753
I can see.

123
00:09:58,286 --> 00:09:59,673
Can you stop doing it?

124
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,122
I will give you five seconds.

125
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,827
Otherwise, I will ask the manager
to clear the room immediately.

126
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,108
Including you.

127
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,656
What kind of a joke is this?
You don't own this place.

128
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:09,860
Five...

129
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:13,697
Four...

130
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:15,821
Three...

131
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,988
I am sorry. I need to step out.

132
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,646
Where are you?

133
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,303
Su Nian Qin.

134
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,697
Can you stop creating problems, please?

135
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:41,019
Sang Wu Yan, you are dreaming.

136
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,440
Unless I die,

137
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,909
otherwise, you can never
be with another man.

138
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:50,110
We were having a meal together.

139
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:54,938
What are you doing?

140
00:10:58,045 --> 00:10:59,383
You've been drinking?

141
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:03,551
You actually drank with another man!

142
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:05,463
What are you talking about?

143
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:08,038
Adults eat and drink together.
It's normal, please.

144
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,354
It's the same in my eyes.

145
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,457
Can you be a proper, sensible man?

146
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,998
So now you call me a man?

147
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:14,874
So?

148
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,899
Does it have anything to do with this?

149
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,156
You are who you are, I am who I am.

150
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:20,811
I'm not yours.

151
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,291
There is nothing between us.
Why should you control me?

152
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,161
Because I'm not like you.

153
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,628
There is no way for me
to fall in love with someone so easily,

154
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,275
let alone forget about it.

00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:51,361
From all the girls I've met,
you are the one...

170
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,922
who cries and laughs the most.

171
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,300
Every sentence that you said with a smile,

172
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,129
I remember it clearly.

173
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,455
Do you know that...

174
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:10,374
you develop a liking to anything easily,

175
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:14,259
and you will devote all of
your emotions into it.

176
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:19,376
I am really afraid that
you've fallen for someone else.

177
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:36,093
Let me know at least.

178
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,481
Did you listen to that song?

179
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,992
Do you still hate me?

180
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,005

181

00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:58,487
I heard it.

184
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,955
I have never hated you.

185
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,213
It's already hard enough to love you.
Why should I hate you?

00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,457
Hey.

194
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,436
Wu Yan, are you okay?

195
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,514
I am fine.

196
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:59,436
Sorry about that. I left in a hurry.

197
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:00,734
Wu Yan.

198
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,392
That Mr Su just now,

199
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:07,345
was the person who gave you
the watch, right?

200
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,296
How did you know that?

201
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,962
It was easy to guess.

202
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:14,893
Is it so obvious?

203
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:16,139
What did you say?

204
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:22,463
Mr Wu, I am sorry.

205
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:25,548
I don't think I'm suitable to date you.

206
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:29,787
Wu Yan.

207
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,799
Actually you don't need to be nervous.

208
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,462
We can always be friends.

209
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,731
It's late today.

210
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,951
Rest early.

211
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,460
(Nian Qin)

212
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,780
(Senior)

213
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,324
Hello, senior.

214
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:56,933
I'm going back now.

215
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,930
Then I'll come back now.

216
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,146
He said that he is here to see you.

217
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:48,433
While we tried to comfort Xiao Jie,
he walked straight over to play the piano.

218
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:51,598
Xiao Jie calmed down slowly
and got attracted by it.

219
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,389
So this is...

220
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,205
An old friend.

221
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,411
Xiao Jie.

222
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:13,964
How is it?

223
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,062
Did you feel uncomfortable just now?

224
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:19,632
It's fine.

225
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,639
What did you eat?

226
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,750
Thank you for today.

227
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,821
You played the piano
to calm Xiao Jie down.

228
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,279
You're welcome.

229
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,649
Isn't this what you told me before
about...

230
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,811
Orff music therapy?

231
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,101
Thank you anyway.

232
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,734
I will buy you dinner another day.

233
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,924
(Wu Yu)

234
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,606
Hello, Mr Wu.

235
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,253
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,739
I'm sorry.
It's not convenient to speak now.

237
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,493
I'll call you another time.

238
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:14,483
Bye.

239
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,092
Sang Wu Yan.

240
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:21,796
Why do you still like to simply grab a man
and say that he's your boyfriend?

241
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:24,925
He's called Wu Yu?

242
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,676
Why do you always get involved
with men whose surname is Wu?

243
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:29,825
I...

244
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:34,828
He just wanted to have a date with you,
but he got used by you.

245
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:36,587
Won't he feel miserable?

246
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,336
Why does it matter to you?

247
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,193
Yes, it didn't matter before,

248
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,655
but it will be soon.

249
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,951
You...

250
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:52,585
Give it back.

251
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:55,990
What?

252
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,706
I'm here to get the watch back.

253
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,634
You took it from my room that day.

254
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,163
I forgot to ask it back from you.

255
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,270
I didn't go there to get the watch.

256
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,573
I just...

257
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,537
It's not...

258
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:09,791
Could it be that...

259
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:12,423
after we have not met for a few years,

260
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,161
you are so stingy that...

261
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:17,107
you want me to return the watch
that you gave me?

262
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,759
I never thought
of getting this watch back.

263
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,219
I went there that day because
I wanted to return that watch to you.

264
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,357
After hearing from Wu Yu,

265
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:37,518
I realised that
the original watch is very valuable.

266
00:19:38,356 --> 00:19:39,450
In the future,

267
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,059
if I hear that man's name again
from your mouth,

268
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:44,111
I'll really beat him up.

269
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,315
Besides,

270
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:54,990
the watch is for you.

271
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,834
No matter what,

272
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,943
you are not allowed to return it.

273
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,448
I'm sorry to bother you.

274
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,148
Boss.

275
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:17,880
The dinner is about to start.

276
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,995
We really have to hurry up.

277
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:22,197
Let's go.

278
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,274
Didn't you say that you want to thank me?

279
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:28,426
There is no need to wait.

280
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,587
I have a dinner later
but I have no female companion.

281
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:34,758
I really can't help you with this.

282
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,919
I feel out-of-place when I attend
that kind of events.

283
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,027
I am here.

284
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:40,611
It is precisely because of you,
I will feel even more nervous.

285
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:42,405
Nervous about what?

286
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:43,637
I...

287
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,579
What is it?

288
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,527
Maybe...

289
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,861
I better not go in.

290
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,397
No way.

291
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,978
Miss Sang, don't be nervous.

292
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,550
It is just a small cocktail party.

293
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,743
You don't have to talk. Just relax.

294
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:14,278
Just go in for a drink and eat something.

295
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,641
Still, I better not go in.

296
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:20,060
You have to lead me.

297
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,856
You can see the way.

298
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,518
I am not going.

299
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:42,418
I really can't do this.

300
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:45,303
Now I'm so nervous, I...

301
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,209
It is a small event, don't panic.

302
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,365
You could break free,
meaning that you are not that nervous.

303
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:55,311
I... So you're a sprightly
beast with a human face.

304
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:59,528
If you dare
to run away when I'm not paying attention,

305
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,222
I can do something more beastly.

306
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:02,548
What?

307
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:06,804
For example, to secretly kiss you
in front of everyone.

308
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,851
You are shameless.

309
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:11,214
Try it.

310
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:15,301
Qin has something to say.

311
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,122
Boss.

312
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:20,724
It's Toro's Design Director.

313
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:25,278
Where are you going?

314
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,465
I'm going to the washroom.

315
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:30,875
Remember what I said.

316
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:32,913
I promise that I won't run away.

317
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:34,408
Focus on your business.

318
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,595
I have not seen you for a long time.

319
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:49,782
Come.

320
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,180
(TC Hotel)

321
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:35,579
Mr Zhang, I would like to speak to you.

322
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,919
Miss.

323
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,773
You seem like you are enjoying the food.

324
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:48,314
Have I seen you before?

325
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:49,864
Is that so?

326
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,909
Are you talking about some new Bond girl?

327
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:55,262
Anyway, you're intriguing.

328
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,101
May I know your name?

329
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:59,210
-No.
-I have no ill intentions.

330
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,593
I'm afraid I do.

331
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:06,221
Your outfit is quite special.

332
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:09,026
Just plain, casual clothes.

333
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:11,053
I don't know why I am here.

334
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,013
So did you sneak in?

335
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,100
I came in from the main entrance.

336
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,522
You are the staff then.

337
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,930
You dare to eat here secretly?

338
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,865
Well,
I am trying to see if it's poisonous,

339
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:27,731
edible of if it's delicious.

340
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:30,967
So may I ask, is it poisonous?

341
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,986
You are so lame.

342
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,332
What to do?

343
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,967
Women now are so full of motherly love.

344
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:42,417
They like men who are
obviously lacking love,

345
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:45,271
the so-called "cold, handsome man".

346
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:47,457
The colder he is,

347
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,618
the more that they think they can
warm his heart.

348
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,335
As for people like me,
perfect and flawless,

349
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,028
we are brushed off.

350
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:57,595
He came here for work, unlike you.

351
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:01,018
Look at you, a professional playboy.

352
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:02,980
Not professional.

353
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,551
I'm just someone
who hasn't found his true love yet,

354
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:10,214
a poor man who is searching miserably.

355
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,846
Actually, I really admire Mr Su.

356
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,226
He started out late,

357
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,534
but he still managed to get
to where he is now.

358
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm sure it wasn't just relying
on his talents.

359
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,917
He must have suffered a lot too.

360
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:24,226
Plus, he didn't have to do that.

361
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:25,575
Relying on the Su family's
financial resources,

362
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,839
it is enough for him to
splurge for a lifetime.

363
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,875
So I think he did this
to tell everyone that he could do it too.

364
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,754
Excuse me.

365
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,030
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,328
-It's alright.
-I'm sorry.

367
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:48,082
-It is fine. We will clean up.
-I'm sorry.

368
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:49,447
No worries.

369
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:51,862
Relax, I won't make you pay.

370
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:59,081
Rui Xing.
You didn't help to entertain our friends.

371
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,435
What are you doing here?

372
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:04,279
I am asking this lady about
the condition of the food.

373
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,396
Who is she?

374
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,753
A staff.

375
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,077
Impossible. No uniform, no badge.

376
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,759
Miss, do you have the invitation card?

377
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:17,654
I don't think anyone would dress like this
if she was invited.

378
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,138
Who are you actually?

379
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,353
Plain makeup and casual clothes...

380
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,024
will not conceal her beauty.

381
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,129
Not to mention that
she is here to accompany me.

382
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:35,858
Not here to please you.

383
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:42,618
I accidentally knocked over
the dining table.

384
00:26:42,698 --> 00:26:44,745
-It was my fault.
-It's okay.

385
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:49,334
I believe that
Mr Peng and Ms Peng would not mind.

386
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:51,335
No, it's fine.

387
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:53,383
They've cleaned it up already.

388
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:54,828
Nian Qin.

389
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:56,263
Is she your friend?

390
00:26:58,587 --> 00:26:59,824
No.

391
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,065
She is my fiancee.

392
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,261
I just want to take this opportunity
to introduce her to you.

393
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:18,011
Don't forget that,
I'm a beast with a human face.

394
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,028
Wu Yan.

395
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:22,869
This is Ms Peng.

396
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:26,395
This man is Toro's young boss,
Mr Peng Rui Xing.

397
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:32,253
I thought I had finally found
the only lady...

398
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,687
who is not attracted by Mr Su's charm.

399
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:35,826
Turns out,

400
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,140
she is Mr Su's fiancee.

401
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:41,003
Of course I love him more than
anyone else,

402
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,485
including himself.

403
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:44,998
Do I need to express it?

404
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:50,926
When did Mr Su get engaged?

405
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:52,983
Why didn't we hear the news?

406
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,228
It's been a long time.

407
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,927
Not a recent event.

408
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,064
When we get married,

409
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,764
we will definitely send you
the wedding invitation.

410
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,665
Xiao Lu, I have good news.

411
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,916
When did I become engaged to you?

412
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,315
Three years ago.

413
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:32,299
We were at home,

414
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,162
during the last quarrel.

415
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,239
Do you remember?

416
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:38,854
I remember.

417
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,702
Before you left,

418
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:47,173
what was the last thing you said to me?

419
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,898
I will be very tired if you always
act like this.

420
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,378
Wrong. The sentence before that.

421
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,186
The previous sentence?

422
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:58,222
When I come back,

423
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:01,546
we will register to get married
right away if you are willing to.

424
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:04,565
I am.

425
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:12,974
I said I'm willing.

426
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:14,688
I'm not proposing to you.

427
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,796
I am just repeating what I said
at that time.

428
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,117
You asked, I agreed.

429
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,625
There is no turning back.

430
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:25,915
That was three years ago.
It's past the best-buy date.

431
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:27,299
I said yes anyway.

432
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,661
Hurry back home. I need to go home, too.

433
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:36,451
Then remember to take your
household register.

434
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,100
Come with me to the
Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow.

435
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,843
Su Nian Qin, you...

436
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:46,073
You...

437
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,598
Stop following me. I've already arrived.

438
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,218
No, it's too dark.

439
00:30:06,382 --> 00:30:08,940
Now you are starting to
talk nonsense with your eyes open?

440
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,982
I meant everything I said just now.

441
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,629
Everything I said to you
has no expiration date.

442
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,398
What I said before still stands as well.

443
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:44,027
I will be very tired when
you act like this.

444
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,094
Leave me alone.

445
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:11,973
Why did you come down so early today?

446
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,597
This one is for you.

447
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:15,787
This shop has good food, it just opened.
Try it.

448
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,311
Then I'll eat more.

449
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:20,560
Honey, I miss you.

450
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,876
Come.

451
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,338
We see each other every day.

452
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:27,264
I will be very tired
if you act like this.

453
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:31,437
Boss, the restaurant is this way.

454
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:35,871
Do I make people feel tired?

455
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,869
What time does
the afternoon meeting start?

456
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:44,280
Three o'clock.

457
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,596
Then...

458
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,361
Have a great day at work.

459
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,705
I will.

460
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:05,675
Mr Wei, please.

461
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:06,963
Thank you.

462
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:11,977
I asked you to come, because...

463
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,082
If it's about Wu Yan, forget it.

464
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:17,410
After talking to you last time,
she lectured me seriously.

465
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,350
When I thought about it,
I didn't think it was right.

466
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,501
You, a man who always
makes our Wu Yan cry,

467
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:29,784
there is really nothing to say
between you and me.

468
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:31,631
Just a friendly reminder.

469
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:35,442
I am your boss now.

470
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,889
You are my boss.

471
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:50,393
Boss, what do you want to ask?

472
00:32:50,473 --> 00:32:52,699
I will tell you everything I know.

473
00:32:59,763 --> 00:33:01,709
The history of your relationship
with Xu Qian.

474
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:03,177
Give me a brief summary.

475
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,772
Didn't you pursue Xu Qian?

476
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:11,788
How did you pursue Xu Qian?

477
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:13,366
Tell me about it.

478
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:16,143
Boss.

479
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:18,779
That is my private life.

480
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,000
You...

481
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,628
Actually, you just have to understand
one thing to resolve the issue.

482
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:32,204
Do you want her or your pride?

483
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,652
-Of course it's her.
-That's right.

484
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,810
Guess you already know the answer.
Then pursue her.

485
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,953
Look at me.

486
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:43,036
Picking her up and
sending her off to work.

487
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:45,699
Buying her delicious food
and writing her songs.

488
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,246
I would like to think that
I'm very romantic.

489
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,273
If there is nothing else,
I will go back to work first.

490
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:00,736
Boss.

491
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,860
(TC Hotel)

492
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,034
Mr Su.

493
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:23,718
The leaves have been delivered.

494
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:27,062
Mr Su.

495
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:28,584
Do you have any more orders?

496
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,487
Do you need me
to sort out a cheat sheet for you?

497
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:39,584
Cheat sheet?

498
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:46,249
I think you seem to be pursuing Ms Sang.

499
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,043

501
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:08,452
Wu Yan has so many letters again.

502
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,402
This is for the Lone Island Playlist.

503
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:12,857
Why is it here?

504
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,279
I guess the newbie,
Zhao, didn't sort it out.

505
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,595
Thanks.

506
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,649
Which audience is so thoughtful?

507
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:36,418
I guess he is in love with Wu Yan.

508
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:40,447
(Sun is for the day. Moon is for
the night. But you are forever)

509
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:43,060
Wu Yan.
Hurry up and show us what's written.

510
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,735
"Sun is for the day.
Moon is for the night."

511
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,325
"And you are..."

512
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:51,682
What?

513
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,204
"Forever."

514
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:02,100
Nowadays, letters from listeners
are much more interesting.

Dismiss.

518
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:36,406
Boss, it's raining outside.

519
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,810
Wu Yan, you care so much about
that letter.

520
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,063
It's nothing.

521
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:57,130
Just that in Xiamen,
it is full of this type of leaves.

522
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,496
I've always liked it.

523
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,708
Maybe it's from an old friend or...

524
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:04,750
it is written by someone who has
crushed on you for a long time.

525
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,241
I do have such a friend actually.

526
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:14,852
But his English is very poor
and his handwriting is ugly.

527
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,420
Call your secretary to pick you up.

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,363
I brought an umbrella.

532
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,898
Let me hold an umbrella for you
on rainy days.

Why did you start to stop speaking

536
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:27,661
It is all because of you.

537
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:29,588
You didn't speak human words before.

538
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:31,771

You are obviously lying.

544
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:55,412
Do you think I need to lie to you on this?

545
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,459
This is as far as you go.

546
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,988
You are a CEO.
Shouldn't you be busy with work?

547
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:11,241
You didn't focus on boosting
the national economy.

548
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,878
It makes me look like I am harming the
nation and the people.

549

I feel bad about it.

550
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,852
You act so fiercely towards me.
Don't you feel bad about it?

551
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,029
This is your stop. Time to get off.

No.

I don't want to.

555
00:39:36,194 --> 00:39:37,714
I'll stop at the stop near your house.

Mr Su.

557
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:06,022
Why are you all soaked?

558
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,522
Su Nian Qin didn't bring
an umbrella again?

This is new to me.

560
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:14,805
Do you think
he's destined to never have an umbrella?

561
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
(Nian Qin)

562
00:40:36,154 --> 00:40:37,346
Hello.

563
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,303
Ms Sang, it's like this.

564
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,506
Mr Su caught a cold
and is feeling feverish.

565
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:44,761
He said,
you know what medicine works for him.

566
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,275
Me?

567
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:51,771
When did I ever buy him any medicine?

568
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,031
No.

569
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:04,569
Doesn't any fever medicine
work just fine?

570
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:06,467
He hasn't caught a cold before.

571
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:30,592
Mr Su said,

572
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:32,871
he didn't dare get sick
the past three years...

573
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,158
because you weren't there
to take care of him.

574
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,538
Qin.

575
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:43,822
Get some rest.

576
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,160
You can naturally recover from a cold.

577
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,345
And even if he wants to eat,
it shouldn't be cold medicine.

578
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,019
I'm hanging up. Good night.

579
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,279
It seems that he is not lacking
an umbrella,

580
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,287
it is that he must have you in his life.

581
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:14,462
Who can you blame?
You can only blame yourself.

582
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:15,997
You spoiled him.

583
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:28,259
Have you checked the weather?

584
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,177
It rained so heavily yesterday.

585
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,315
It is the rainy season.

586
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,752
I hope when we go to Zhongshan,
it will not catch up to us.

587
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,953
No, I checked.

588
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,321
It will be cloudy.

589
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:43,286
Oh, right.

590
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:50,067

591
