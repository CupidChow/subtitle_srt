3
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
I'm exhausted.

4
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,760
Okay, bye bye.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,000
Who were you talking to on the phone?

6
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,433
Cheng Yin.

7
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,880
Is she still alone in Tongcheng County?

8
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,280
I asked her to come over
to write her paper, but she won't come.

9
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,040
Are you feeling a little lonely
without Cheng Yin here?

10
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,440
I am. But she still doesn't seem
to want to see you now.

11
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
What's the matter?
She sees me as a love rival?

12
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,076
(Outpatient Building)

13
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,080
Mr. Su, it means she doesn't
actually want to avoid you.

14
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,240
It's just that this Cheng Yin
is paranoid of you.

15
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,880
I've only noticed this recently.

16
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
I wonder if it's a coincidence.

17
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
I don't think it is.

18
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,240
Judging by the current situation,
I hope you can make more time for her.

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,240
The best situation for her is if you're
with her, Cheng Yin won't be there.

20
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,800
The less Cheng Yin appears,
indicates that her condition is improving.

21
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,316
But would it really be alright
if I don't bring her in for treatment?

22
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,956
Treatment is a double-edged blade.

23
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,079
Although the current treatment
will delay the healing process,

24
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,480
it will minimize the mental impact...

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
and damage
she will have to bear in the future.

26
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,720
In your expert opinion,
which approach should I take?

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,396
Actually, you've already
made a decision deep down,

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,516
haven't you, Mr. Su?

29
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,600
Boss, Ms. Sang just called.

30
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,400
Madam just called.

31
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,040
What are you doing now?
Why aren't you home yet?

32
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,243
I'm having a business dinner.

33
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,640
Are you drinking again?
Don't you dare drink.

34
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,280
Sometimes, I can't turn
down these invitations.

35
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,280
Anyway, I'm going to check
you when you get home.

36
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,113
Okay.

37
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,960
Sir, you're back.

38
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
I'd better be going then.

39
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,513
Goodbye.

40
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
No smell of alcohol.

41
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,200
But why do you smell like the hospital?

42
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,680
The perfume Qin put on lately
is a little weird.

43
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,113
Really?

44
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
If you don't believe me,

45
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,800
you can come closer
and examine me thoroughly.

46
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,313
Sure.

47
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,153
What do you think?

48
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
It's alright.

49
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,320
Do we have any food?
I'm starving.

50
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,840
We do.
What's more, I made them myself.

51
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,640
This is certainly not made by Aunt, right?

52
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
Is it bad?

53
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,640
What else did you make?

54
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,720
I only made the meatballs.

55
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
What do you mean by this?

56
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,680
Make your own food next time.

57
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,360
Wu Yan.

58
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,233
Sang Wu Yan.

59
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,913
Sang Wu Yan,

60
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
didn't you hear me calling you?

61
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm not your pet. Why should
I rush over to you whenever you call?

62
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,996
I don't treat you like a pet.

63
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,920
You do.

64
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
Be reasonable, okay?

65
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,640
What kind of pet can be this adorable?

66
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
Stop bluffing.

67
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,872
Good girl.

68
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,673
Come here.

69
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,096
I called you because I really
wanted to apologize to you.

70
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:51,320
Your tone was really mean, okay?

71
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,800
Let's make some ground rules.

72
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,520
Don't be mean to me,
don't drink and don't smoke.

73
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,673
Okay.

74
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll punish you if you break the rules.

75
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,433
What's the punishment?

76
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,079
You tell me.
What's the punishment?

77
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,120
No talking for three days.

78
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,513
Okay.

79
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,320
Su Nian Qin, not talking
is exactly what you want, isn't it?

80
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
Su Nian Qin, you don't even
have the courtesy to repent.

81
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,913
Wu Yan,

82
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,800
I think there's something
you forgot to do.

83
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,713
What is it?

84
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Think about it.

85
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,920
Something that you must do
after you finish the meal.

86
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,713
Gargling?

87
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
Wash the dishes.

88
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
Hello, is this Ms. Sang?

89
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,480
I am Yu Wei Lan.

90
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,553
Hello.

91
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,076
If you're looking for Nian Qin,
he is...

92
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,993
No.

93
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
I'm actually looking for you.

94
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
Me?

95
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,120
Ms. Sang, you don't
seem to want to talk to me?

96
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,240
No, I'm not.

97
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,040
That's okay.

98
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,480
As a stepmother
who was once hated by Nian Qin,

99
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
I've become very thick-skinned now.

100
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,553
Wu Yan,

101
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,714
can I address you
the same way Nian Qin and Xiao Lu do?

102
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,680
In the past,

103
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,960
Nian Qin and I had
a difficult relationship.

104
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
For a long time,

105
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,880
he didn't talk nicely to me even once.

106
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,120
But that has changed.

107
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,320
You know, Wu Yan,
it's all because of you.

108
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,360
You changed him.

109
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,440
I didn't really do anything.

110
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,760
You made him fall in love
with you, didn't you?

111
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,680
I think, for a while,

112
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,960
Nian Qin had lost the ability to love.

113
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,760
Then he met you.

114
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,173
You brought light to his eyes.

115
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,400
You made him understand that
if we work together,

116
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,720
every family will find happiness
in their own way.

117
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,240
That's all we need.

118
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,200
Thank you.

119
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,040
There is nothing to thank me for.

120
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,480
This is just me, as a mother, trying
to convince my son's lover for him.

121
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,600
I hope that you can marry him in peace.

122
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,038
You can say I'm doing it
for selfish reasons.

123
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,200
Where is Nian Qin?

124
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
He's sleeping.

125
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,596
That's what I thought.

126
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,436
I was wondering
why he didn't come to stop me...

127
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,214
after we're talking
on the phone for so long.

128
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,240
Do you also feel that
he was a little overprotective of you?

129
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,240
I mocked him over this too.

130
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,960
Actually, there's a lot
of things he doesn't like about me.

131
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,920
He doesn't like me misplacing stuff.

132
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,240
And I don't know how to cook.

133
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,840
And he doesn't like me
singing out of tune.

134
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
Looks like I failed to teach him well.

135
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't worry, Wu Yan.

136
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,520
I'll correct his prejudice.

137
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,480
When you have time,
come home with Nian Qin.

138
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
I'll have to see when he's free.

139
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,113
Okay.

140
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,480
It's a deal then.

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,833
Bye bye.

142
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,280
I was just being polite with her.
And you really took time out.

143
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,313
What?

144
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,916
I mean
when I see Xiao Lu's sister later,

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,320
what should I call her?

146
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,080
You've asked this question
three times on our way here.

147
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,480
Madam Yu.

148
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,278
Yu Wei Lan.

149
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,436
Madam Su, Mrs. Su.

150
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,640
Sister of Xiao Lu. Anything you want.

151
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,200
What do you call her then?

152
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,033
Yu Wei Lan.

153
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,036
What about your dad?

154
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,160
Is he nice? Is he scary?

155
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,160
He's getting old now,
so he has become a lot nicer.

156
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
As for his temper, it's as good as mine.

157
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,553
Let's go.

158
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,680
Hold on, hold on.

159
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Let me check if my makeup is running.

160
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,200
I mean I just feel that
your glasses look nice.

161
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,400
You look nice too.

162
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,593
Don't worry.

163
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,033
Let's go.

164
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,320
This is Nian Qin's mother's piano.

165
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,036
I've always thought
that this piano's soundboard,

166
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,454
produced the best sound I've ever heard.

167
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,640
You can sit down and try it.

168
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,120
Can I?

169
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
I've asked my brother-in-law.
He's fine with it.

170
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,713
Okay.

171
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,800
You've met her now.
Don't walk over there.

172
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,040
She's timid. You will scare her.

173
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,367
I plan to get married with her
after she gets her master's degree.

174
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,796
That's great. It's happening soon.

175
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,036
I'd better start preparing.

176
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,040
Preparing what?

177
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
What does she think about it?

178
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,520
From what I see, it's nice enough
that she wants to marry you.

179
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,280
What... What are you doing here?

180
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,880
Your dad...

181
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,980
We'll just go there
when it's time for dinner.

182
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,953
Okay.

183
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,996
What song did you just play?

184
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
How come I've never heard it before?

185
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
I think it's nice.

186
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,960
I was just noodling.

187
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,920
So.

188
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,040
You're feeling like composing
a song, aren't you?

189
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
I just played a few random melodies.

190
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
If I really want to compose a song,
melody is just the beginning.

191
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,920
The hardest part is the arrangement.

192
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,720
What mode should it be,
what chords should I use,

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,240
everything has to be structured
and precise.

194
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,640
Song composition is not that easy.

195
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,560
Is it that complicated?

196
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,320
I thought you could just compose one
when you're in the mood.

197
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
It isn't complicated.

198
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It's called logical.

199
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,160
What are the scale and chords you used
in the song you wrote for me?

200
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,359
C major.

201
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,319
The simplest chord and the simplest scale.

202
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,520
The simplest?

203
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,119
So you're just not
doing it from your heart.

204
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,760
Here's the thing.

205
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Major keys sound brighter.

206
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,520
Minor keys sound more sombre.

207
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,040
So that means major chords are how
you sound like when you are usually happy,

208
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,080
minor chords are how you sound like
when you usually talk.

209
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,800
That's easy then.

210
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,356
Just use C major
to compose one more song.

211
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,880
It's so simple.
Isn't it easy to compose one?

212
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,440
It's been so long since I wrote a song.

213
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,520
You said it yourself just now.

214
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,880
Every new melody is a new beginning.

215
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,196
Your interpretation is always so...

216
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
Did I interpret it wrongly?

217
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,200
You know,

218
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,160
I think a lot of times,

219
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,600
we insist on doing something
not because we really want to do it,

220
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,080
but because we have to do it.

221
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,480
Because we can't resist it.

222
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,640
That's why I've been
working in the radio station.

223
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,200
Reason is telling me that
I have to keep trying to leave,

224
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,600
yet I'm still hosting shows.

225
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,480
You're doing the same thing too,
aren't you?

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,480
It's like you never stop playing piano.

227
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,400
Dinner time.

228
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,273
Coming.

229
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,480
I'll take it as a yes then.

230
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,720
What's next?

231
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,875
Nian Qin,
why did we have to leave so early?

232
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,000
I didn't even get
a chance to talk to your dad.

233
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,080
He's a bad conversationalist.
There's nothing to talk about.

234
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,480
That's not true.

235
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,080
I think he's just like how you said he is.
I think he's quite friendly.

236
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
What are you watching?

237
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,120
Just some film.

238
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,913
Nian Qin,

239
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,400
close your eyes.
I'll tell you what the movie is about.

240
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,116
The movie is now at the part where
the protagonist is searching high and low,

241
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
for his best friend, William.

242
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,640
However, no one knows who his friend is.

243
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,600
His name is not even on the student list.

244
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,520
The doctor...

245
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,600
tells him that...

246
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,920
everything that happened
between him and William...

247
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,200
Boss, here's the information of the film.

248
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,414
This film is based on the real-life
experiences of mathematician John Nash.

249
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,596
John Nash was awarded the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994,

250
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,920
for his game theory.

251
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,000
But Nash and his wife
had a lifelong battle with his paranoia.

252
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,680
He saw the world in a way
that no one can ever imagine.

253
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,560
This sentence is special.

254
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,960
Look at the camera.

255
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,120
Three, two, one.

256
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
Not bad.

257
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,600
One more, one more.

258
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,400
Here we go.

259
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,320
Those who are in 422 come here.

260
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,353
Come.
Let's get a picture.

261
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,676
Nice. Let's take one more.

262
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,600
Take a few more.

263
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,680
Three, two, one.

264
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,796
Look, he's so handsome.

265
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,713
Yes.

266
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,156
Wu Yan, congratulations
on your graduation.

267
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,556
-Thank you.
-Wu Yan, is this your mom?

268
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,520
She looks so elegant.

269
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,880
Hi.

270
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,396
Excuse me, I have to take my wife
and mother-in-law,

271
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,680
to other places to take pictures.

272
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,080
You're calling me mother-in-law already?

273
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,240
Mrs. Sang, I've been planning to get
married with Wu Yan after she graduates.

274
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,040
Since you're marrying my daughter,
I should accept nothing less.

275
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,515
What other family's daughter has,
my Wu Yan deserves nothing less.

276
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,516
You hear me?

277
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,433
Of course.

278
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,520
I'll give her the best of everything.

279
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,720
How do you want to get
your makeup done tomorrow?

280
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,396
I want a natural look.

281
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,360
What about the groom?

282
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,320
He just needs to do his hair.

283
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,520
Can you make me look pretty
and make him look ugly?

284
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Why?

285
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,640
Because this way, others won't
think I'm not good enough for him.

286
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,160
-Bye bye. See you tomorrow.
-Bye bye.

287
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,680
Wu Yan, it's been a long time.

288
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,680
What are you doing here?

289
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,614
I've received Su Nian Qin's
wedding invitation.

290
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,160
So I came here as soon as I could.

291
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,120
I asked Qin just now,
and found out that you're here.

292
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,594
Wu Yan, you still have
a chance to change your mind.

293
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,000
Change my mind about what?

294
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,280
Marrying him.

295
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,240
I can be a backup.

296
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,840
Whose backup are you planning to be?

297
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,400
Mine?
You may not have a chance.

298
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,920
Or do you want to be his backup?

299
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,760
That's even impossible.

300
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,873
Nian Qin, let's go.

301
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,593
What's the matter?

302
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,360
I need to take you to buy something.

303
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:16,516
Buy what?

304
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,280
It is a very, very simple
pink coloured men's shirt.

305
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,996
I have to prove that you look better
than Peng Rui Xing in pink.

306
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,160
Otherwise, I'm not comfortable
with simply marrying you.

307
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,913
I have one.

308
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
You're so forgetful.

309
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,040
You do?

310
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,200
The colour that only a truly handsome man
can look good in.

311
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,593
That's true.

312
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,480
Only a truly handsome man
can look good in this.

313
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,080
Are you happy now, my wife?

314
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,713
I am.

315
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,360
Can you sign this now, my wife?

316
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,332
Two families are brought
together due to a marriage.

317
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,796
Our matrimony is a match made in heaven.

318
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,370
When the peach tree is in full bloom,

319
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:28,079
then comes the time for us to build
a harmonious home.

320
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:31,320
May our home be fruitful and prosper.

321
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,835
I'm writing down my promise
to grow old with you on paper.

322
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,356
The nuptials shall be
announced on red leaves.

323
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
This will serve as proof. Su Nian Qin.

324
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,396
Who wrote this?

325
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,313
Me.

326
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,753
What's the matter?

327
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,300
(Sang Wu Yan)

328
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,100
(Marriage Certificate)

329
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,520
Why did you give it to me?

330
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,116
It's for you to keep it, of course.

331
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,080
You can use it to denounce me
in the future.

332
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,196
Alright.
I have to go now.

333
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,320
Where are you going?

334
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,873
Have you forgotten?

335
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,320
My family's tradition.

336
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,161
I have to go back
to the old house tonight.

337
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,660
(Wu Yan: Nian Qin)

338
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,320
Nian Qin, why are you calling so soon?

339
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,760
I hear the notification of your message.

340
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,560
I was wondering if you couldn't
sleep and wanted to talk to me.

341
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,800
You couldn't sleep either?

342
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,160
I was sleeping.

343
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,240
I put my phone under the pillow.
I woke up when it vibrated.

344
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,280
What's wrong? Why aren't you sleeping?

345
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,920
I couldn't sleep.

346
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Why are you able to sleep?

347
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
Wu Yan, rise and shine.

348
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,000
It's 6:30 a.m.
Time to get up and get ready.

349
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,080
I don't want to get up.

350
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,676
You brat, it's your wedding day
and you still won't get up?

351
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,320
Do you want the wedding to be cancelled?

352
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,280
Get out of your bed now.

353
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
Mom, just let her sleep a little longer.

354
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,793
Nian Qin?

355
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm up, I'm up now.

356
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,440
You found out.

357
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,920
Now the surprise is gone.

358
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,480
Found out what?

359
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,080
What surprise?

360
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,480
Don't forget.

361
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,080
Blind people generally rely
on sound or sunlight to tell direction.

362
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,720
When you walk later,
just walk toward the light.

363
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,400
Why did you call me here?

364
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,913
Nothing.

365
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,480
Do you think my bow tie is too big?

366
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,880
Should I change to a different knot?

367
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,120
Are you getting nervous?

368
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,280
Of course not.

369
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,996
Since I proposed to you
three years ago,

370
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
I've been preparing myself for today.

371
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,840
There's no way I'm nervous.

372
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,640
Wu Yan, it's almost time.

373
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,913
Okay.

374
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
Just walk toward the light.

375
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,833
I got it.

376
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,296

Is he a Japanese man?

462
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,236
He has to make me stand
at the front door and say welcome back,

00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480

00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,280
Stop laughing, okay?
I'm really upset now.

466
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,600
What did he say?

467
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,520
He didn't say a word.

468
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,840
What about other times?

469
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,880
Except for this, he's usually normal.

470
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,116
No matter what,

471
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,716
even if I stood at the door
and the door was wide open,

472
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,400
he wouldn't give in.

473
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,960
He had to make me go over the process.

474
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,680
He's too unreasonable.

475
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,120
Just leave him at the door
and let him wait for the whole night.

476
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,676
If I really ignored him,

477
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,640
he might have stood
there until the next day.

478
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,680
Serves him right.

479
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,320
But it would make me feel bad.

480
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,237
I just don't get him.

481
00:42:45,322 --> 00:42:47,796
I mean, before we got married,
we lived together for a while too, right?

482
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,920
How come this has never happened before?

483
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,356
Because women
aren't the only ones who are ritualistic.

484
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:55,955
For him, this is like a ritual of a man.

485
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,680
Before marriage,
you two were boyfriend and girlfriend.

486
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,760
After marriage, he wants a ritual...

487
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,120
to show that you're his wife
and that you're part of his life.

488
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,440
But why did he have to choose this way?

489
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,000
Maybe he doesn't want you to neglect him.

490
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,876
And me welcoming him
home intimately every day,

491
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,560
means I'm not neglecting him?

492
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,800
Is he that lovey-dovey?

493
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,200
Yes. He just likes to express himself
in very specific ways.

494
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,200
Such as putting the ring
on your finger to affirm your status.

495
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,916
Writing the marriage vow for you
to make a commitment.

496
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,150
He hopes to express that
you're his number one priority.

497
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,476
Maybe he also hopes that
you can use the same way,

498
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,756
to express
that he's your number one priority too.

499
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,240
This is his ritual.

500
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,320
Can I interpret this as
he loves me too much?

501
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,633
Of course.

502
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,596
So that means unless we divorce,

503
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,714
I have to put up with him
like this for the rest of our lives.
