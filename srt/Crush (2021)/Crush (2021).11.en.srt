3
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,102
You know very well that...

4
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:05,866
certain things and people...

5
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,236
annoy me the most.

6
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,581
Yet you blatantly
leave them right in front me.

7
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:17,704
To you, I'm blind?

8
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,481
Is that why you're picking on me?

9
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:37,940
Su Nian Qin.

10
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:41,231
Must you be so bitter?

11
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,199
You're acting like a hedgehog all day.

12
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,687
Resenting everything, everyone
and yourself.

13
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,052
You're happy being like that?

14
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,482
I'm wrong for lying to you.

15
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:58,173
But this is uncalled for.

16
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:01,040
Everyone in the family has been
apologetic to you.

17
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,811
But what about you?

18
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,413
You've been acting so heartless.

19
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:08,857
Never once did you return home to visit.

20
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,408
What do you want me to do?
What else can I do?

21
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,198
Leave it.

22
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,792
It's alright.

23
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,478
I'm still here, right?

24
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,629
I need some time alone.

25
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,717
There hasn't been news
about Yi Jin for some time now.

26
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,640
Have you heard anything
from the news department?

27
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,687
Nope.

28
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,367
Wu Yan.

29
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,311
Why are you so quiet today?

30
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,424
Aren't you a fan of Yi Jin?

31
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,097
I'm listening to your conversation.

32
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:55,931
Hello.

33
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:57,887
Have you eaten?

34
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,491
I'm eating now while having a chat.

35
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:01,691
Chatting?

36
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:07,148
I'm chatting with my colleagues
about Yi Jin.

37
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,098
They said Yi Jin is otherworldly.

38
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,410
You're having meat?

39
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,597
How did you know?

40
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,111
It sounds like
you're really enjoying the meal.

41
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,323
What kind of meat?

42
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,001
I'm having...

43
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,278
What is it?

44
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,891
It's nothing.

45
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,443
I've got work.

46
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:33,073
Got to go. Bye.

47
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:09,916
Wu Yan.

48
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:32,987
You're burning up.

49
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,172
Is it an allergy to beef?

50
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,489
Let's go to the hospital.

51
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,848
(Outpatient)

52
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,143
Her allergy is due to the lack of...

53
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,535
a specific protein-digesting enzyme
for beef.

54
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,335
I'll give her a box of astemizole.

55
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,572
After taking it, the rash will go away.

56
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,010
Be sure to be more careful next time.

57
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,203
Alright. Thanks, doctor.

58
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,306
You're welcome.

59
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,532
You had beef for lunch, right?

60
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:57,728
You know you're allergic to beef
and yet...

61
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:59,990
I just had it by mistake.

62
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,970
You're even careless about what you eat.

63
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,450
Bring your own lunch to work after this.

64
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,881
That's such a hassle.

65
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,731
I'll pick you up at lunchtime
so you can eat at home then.

66
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,699
That won't be necessary.

67
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,860
He's a tyrant.

68
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,602
He's always uncompromising.

69
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,135
Aren't you still
buying him new clothes after all?

70
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,776
I dirtied his clothes back then.

71
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,350
I feel guilty over it.

72
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:39,503
Is that really why?

73
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,705
You just want him to wear the clothes
that you picked out for him.

74
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:43,914
Am I right?

75
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,992
This seems to be the brand of clothes
he wore the other day.

76
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:47,980
Come on.

77
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,351
This one.

78
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,417
This is it.

79
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,107
Let's just go.

80
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:13,692
Forget about it.

81
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,455
His family isn't the kind
that's short of money.

82
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,615
You don't have to burn a hole
in your pocket for him.

83
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:21,891
They do seem pretty well off.

84
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,042
What is it?

85
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,007
It's nothing.

86
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,098
Ms Xiao Lu.

87
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:35,940
You're home.

88
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,044
Why are you...

89
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,993
Nian Qin said you'll be
bringing lunch from home.

90
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,407
I'm preparing it now.

91
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,655
I shouldn't trouble you over this.

92
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:46,376
It's fine. I enjoy cooking anyway.

93
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,673
Weren't you two quarrelling the other day?

94
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:51,913
Why are you...

95
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:53,738
We're always like that.

96
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:56,170
Things just got way more heated up
than usual that day.

97
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,614
Did that frighten you? I'm really sorry.

98
00:09:58,694 --> 00:10:00,598
No, no, no. Let me help you.

99
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:02,318
-You don't have to.
-It's fine, it's fine.

100
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,459
Oops.

101
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:16,292
I poured too much soy sauce in it.

102
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,250
Don't worry.

103
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,981
I'll fix it up in a jiffy.

104
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,446
May I ask you a question, Ms Xiao Lu?

105
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,165
Nian Qin's clothing
are bought by you, right?

106
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,560
They seem pretty expensive.

107
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,954
He earns that much just by writing songs?

108
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,024
The money isn't a lot.

109
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:37,442
But it's enough for him to spend.

110
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:38,803
Then again,

111
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,733
he still has a home after all.

112
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:42,505
So don't worry about money.

113
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,697
Home?

114
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,019
He has a home?

115
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,120
The one in those pictures?

116
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,796
Yes. Otherwise, we...

117
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,595
He didn't mention it to you before?

118
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,513
He must have his own reasons then.

119
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,264
You can ask him once he's back.

120
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,252
It's not my place to talk about it.

121
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:06,597
Would you mind me
asking questions about you then?

122
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,788
That depends on what questions
you're asking.

123
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,460
Nian Qin said
you're a sister of his relative's.

124
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,170
That makes you two related?

125
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,946
I guess so.

126
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,416
But then he said that
he grew up in a welfare home.

127
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,194
If he has a family,

128
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:29,392
why is he sent to the welfare home?

129
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,890
It's quite complicated
to explain everything.

130
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,039
Can you try asking something simpler?

131
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:44,402
He said his mum passed away.

132
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,814
Is his father still alive?

133
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,009
Of course.

134
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,581
But Wu Yan...

135
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:52,134
I only agreed to answering questions
about myself.

136
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:53,678
That's against the rules.

137
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,309
Fine, I'll give you that one for free.

138
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,232
So,

139
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:01,892
what's the actual nature
of your relationship with him?

140
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,247
Like his aunt, I guess.

141
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:12,183
An aunt without blood ties.

142
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
My sister is his stepmother.

143
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,545
Incoming call from Yu Wei Lan.

144
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,543
Incoming call from Yu Wei Lan.

145
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,952
Incoming call from Yu Wei Lan.

146
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:58,963
Incoming call from Yu...

147
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:13,516
Happy birthday, Nian Qin.

148
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:21,354
What's the matter?

149
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,623
Nothing.

150
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,898
My nails are too long.
I can't play the piano well.

151
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,908
Let me help you trim them.

152
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:49,428
Done.

153
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,210
Nian Qin, what did you play just now?

154
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,430
It was very nice.

155
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,761
Could you play it again for me?

156
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,916
I just made it up.

157
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,595
Choose something else.

158
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,750
I want to listen to "Moonlight."

159
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,538
I did my homework.

160
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,402
Sister.

161
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:40,239
It's alright now.

162
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,624
The condition has stabilized.

163
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,822
You don't have to wait here.

164
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:47,149
Get Nian Qin over instead.

165
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,216
Sister, stop forcing me.

166
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,712
I really can't do it.

167
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:56,624
What if...

168
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,287
What if you go get him?

169
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,830
Why would he ever want to see me?

170
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,387
Fine.

171
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,044
I'll go one more time.

172
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:10,723
But this is really the last time.

173
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,373
Xiao Lu.

174
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,072
Thank you.

175
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,060
(The World Minute of Waterloo)

176
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,566
Su Nian Qin, listen to me.

177
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:38,601
Your father has very serious liver cancer
and needs a liver transplant.

178
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,795
Last night, he was admitted into
the intensive care unit.

179
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,847
No matter what, just pay him a visit.

180
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,101
It may even be your last chance.

181
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:45,778
Don't allow yourself to regret
in the future.

182
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:46,916
Su Nian Qin, you...

183
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,134
Regret?

184
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm the one most familiar with regret.

185
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:55,297
What else is more regretful than me
coming into this world?

186
00:15:57,006 --> 00:16:01,317
Let them know that
I won't attend the funeral.

187
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:35,724
Hello, Wu Yan.

188
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,559
Sorry for interrupting.

189
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,298
Do you have time to meet me now?

190
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,177
I'm in no position to say anything
about your family affairs.

191
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,303
But I think that
while we may appear to be...

192
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,893
accommodating Nian Qin all this while,

193
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,553
have we really put ourselves in his shoes?

194
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,254
We've always been trying to
make up to him, haven't we?

195
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,380
That's exactly why he despises it.

196
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,072
Isn't it?

197
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,427
Just like he said,

198
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:16,230
everyone tries to act
caring and loving to one another...

199
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,188
in hopes of erasing
the wounds that he has already suffered.

200
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:21,966
But for him,

201
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:23,790
it's just whitewashing.

202
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:25,543
Ms Xiao Lu.

203
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,558
Has anyone really tried listening to him?

204
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,502
Back then
when we got separated in the subway,

205
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,769
I was anxiously trying to find him.

206
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,357
But he instead remained very calm.

207
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:39,709
He told me that...

208
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,296
no matter where I lost him,

209
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:45,394
as long as I return to where we separated,
I'd be able to find him.

210
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:51,144
He's really a kid who's extremely stubborn
and good at patiently waiting.

211
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,776
I think Nian Qin is really just...

212
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:58,235
a little boy who was abandoned
since the day his mother passed away.

213
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:02,003
He got abandoned from that very day
and has never walked out of it since then.

214
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,994
He was the one who abandoned himself.

215
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:09,921
Since everyone has been...

216
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:12,375
trying hard to create
this facade of happiness...

217
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,573
Since everyone has been
fervently moving forward...

218
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:16,565
while denying the reality of his loss,

219
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,788
thus he could only lose himself.

220
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:27,281
Although I can see where
you're coming from,

221
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:30,705
I'd still stand by Nian Qin
no matter what.

222
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:33,621
I only wish to see
the person I love happy.

223
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,922
If he's really unwilling to,

224
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,854
why not just go on separate ways?

225
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,062
It's because he has a responsibility.

226
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:42,518
The illustrious enterprise
of the Su family of Lion Mountain...

227
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,395
cannot fall into the hands of others.

228
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,163
The Su family of Lion Mountain?

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,361
Family enterprise?

230
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:03,958
It's nothing, really.

231
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,819
They just happen to be your typical
wealthy and influential household.

232
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:14,818
They own the expensive RD Cosmetics
and I think they manufacture oil rigs too.

233
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,187
Oil... Oil rigs.

234
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:20,902
I guess it's some equipment
for oil drilling.

235
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,616
They even export and sell them overseas.

236
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:25,875
My goodness.

237
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,615
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,260
I thought I already knew him well.

239
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,328
I thought...

240
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,635
I thought he's just an orphan
who grew up in a welfare home...

241
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,890
who happens to also be very talented.

242
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,554
He's quite a jerk himself
but that's because...

243
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,710
he's been hardened by his ill fate.

244
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:47,861
But now he has a father and a stepmother
out of nowhere?

245
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,500
Along with his wealthy family background?

246
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,586
It's all so complicated.

247
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,421
Calm down now.

248
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,247
The important question at hand is,

249
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,989
why did Su Nian Qin hide
all of this from you?

250
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:02,340
Having a wealthy family is
supposedly a good thing.

251
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,593
Why won't he tell you about it?

252
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,115
Could it be that I look like someone...

253
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:12,551
who'd marry a wealthy husband
just to plot for his death...

254
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,212
and inherit his wealth?

255
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,295
That can't be it.

256
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,569
I look like a decent and cultured person.

257
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:19,720
You...

258
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,817
At the beginning,

259
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:23,653
I even saw him as a poor lonely orphan...

260
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,732
and was worried for his source of income.

261
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:27,565
I've never had my eyes on his money.

262
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:29,403
From the very beginning,
I fell for him because...

263
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:32,264
His nice pair of glass-like eyes.

264
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:34,889
That's not true.

265
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,078
Get lost.

266
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:37,952
It's so frustrating.

267
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,483
He took me as a material girl
all this while.

268
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:45,875
No smooth sailing for Mr Su's love life.

269
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,175
Sang Wu Yan.

270
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:07,140
(Sang Wu Yan)

271
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,515
Wu Yan, where are you?

272
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:17,789
Why aren't you home yet?

273
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,882
I came over to visit Cheng Yin.

274
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,323
I'll be staying over here tonight.

275
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,430
Okay then, bye.

276
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,396
I don't need it.

277
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,958
Wu Yan, he doesn't have to come
from a prestigious family.

278
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,984
If his family is influential and wealthy,

279
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:55,998
they'll be out of our league.

280
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:12,783
Mum, Yan Yan here.

281
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:20,861
Mum, I just want to check if you two
went out for a walk.

282
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:23,795
No.

283
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm alone at home.

284
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:28,127
I'm just about to go out.

285
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,824
What about dad? He's still at school?

286
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:33,945
Your dad...

287
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,353
His school is conducting
a teaching assessment.

288
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:41,557
He... He's busy.

289
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:46,242
Mum.

290
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:51,424
What's the matter?

291
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,612
I just want to let you know that
you don't have to send me money anymore.

292
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:57,661
The internship pay is enough
for my expenses.

293
00:22:58,408 --> 00:23:01,344
With that little amount of pay?

294
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,972
Girls should be independent.

295
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,636
Spending your own money
helps to keep your head up.

296
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,721
Your life expenses
will be supported till you graduate.

297
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,716
As for the rest,

298
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:15,290
we'll talk about it after you graduate.

299
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,110
Make sure you do well
for your thesis writing.

300
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:25,165
When you get your certificate
during the graduation ceremony,

301
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,485
take more photos.

302
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:29,785
Your father wants to see them.

303
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,342
I got it, Mum.

304
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:36,869
You two rest early then.

305
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,132
I'll hang up.

306
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,367
As for these materials,
I think we can squeeze them...

307
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,338
into two episodes.

308
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,654
What do you guys think?

309
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:59,602
Or if there's a better idea,

310
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,308
feel free to speak of it.

311
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:06,107
(Nian Qin)

312
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,008
It's fine. Go ahead and answer the call.

313
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,744
It's okay. Let's discuss first.

314
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,344
It's me.

315
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:31,600
Relax. I'm not here
to ask you to go home.

316
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:36,199
Where's Wu Yan?
She hasn't gotten off from work?

317
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,304
I don't know.

318
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,335
She hasn't been answering my calls
for the whole day.

319
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,963
Nian Qin, I...

320
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:49,913
I think it's my fault.

321
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:54,786
It's like this.

322
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:57,801
She started asking stuff about our family.

323
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:00,931
I also asked for her help
to persuade you to go home.

324
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:02,656
In the midst of all that,

325
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:07,234
she got to learn quite a lot
about your background.

326
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,140
(Picked Up a Fragment of a Star)

327
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,253
The reason she likes this song so much...

328
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,979
is possibly that
she's similar to that lady...

329
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,627
who's been imprisoned in the cage.

330
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:28,699
The disabled kid...

331
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:33,421
was the beginning of her suffering.

332
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,332
Su Nian Qin.

333
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:39,060
I've picked up some
fragments of the stars.

334
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,528
From this second onwards,
your time is renewed.

335
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,799
♪Turning to the next page
of the storybook♪

336
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,370
♪You said the wind will dry

00:25:56,826 --> 00:26:01,206

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,669
Su Nian Qin.

342
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,042
Why didn't you switch on the lights?

343
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:19,255
Where did you go?

344
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,530
I went to work.

345
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,617
Why did you ask Ms Xiao Lu
about my background?

346
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,104
I have my reasons for hiding it from you.

347
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:35,214
If you really wanted to know,
why didn't you ask me directly?

348
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:48,251
Wu Yan.

349
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:11,179
I'm sorry. I'm being too selfish.

350
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,306
Next time, don't be home so late.

351
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:26,207
I'll take you to see my family tomorrow.

352
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:28,300
I don't want to.

353
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,424
Then why did you lie to me?

354
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:43,534
Why didn't you tell me
the truth of your family background?

355
00:27:43,614 --> 00:27:46,730
Does it matter that much?

356
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,641
The point here is that you hid it from me.

357
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:53,259
I've asked you
about your life after you turned six.

358
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,301
Which is why I'm bringing you
to see them tomorrow.

359
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:56,559
Su Nian Qin.

360
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:58,731
You can't always be so tyrannical.

361
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,426
Always demanding this and that.

362
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,514
You asked about it from someone else.

363
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:08,906
But now you refuse to see them
and I'm still the one being tyrannical?

364
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,009
Wu Yan.

365
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,386
The point here is that you hid it from me.

366
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,908
I've asked you before
about your life after you turned six.

367
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,172
You can't always be so tyrannical.

368
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,097
Always demanding this and that.

369
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,871
To be honest,

370
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,460
it isn't a big deal even if she knew.

371
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,330
Why not tell her the truth yourself?

372
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,737
Tell her about what?

373
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:52,795
That because of my disability,
my biological father abandoned me?

374
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:56,293
That after my mum died,

375
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:58,507
he remarried three times
and now his current wife...

376
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,900
was once a friend of mine?

377
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,647
This is such a nuisance
in the middle of the night.

378
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:21,471
Exactly. It's been going on
for more than an hour.

379
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,389
-How can we possibly sleep?
-Everyone, settle down.

380
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,037
I've notified the relative of the owner.

381
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,597
She'll be arriving any minute now.

382
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:28,084
I'm so sorry for the disturbance.

383
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,771
My apologies for disrupting everyone.

384
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:31,568
I'll head in now to tell him...

385
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,562
I'm really sorry.

386
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:41,807
It's fine.
Just go inside and see what's going on.

387
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:44,825
Everyone, you may disperse now.
Please return home now.

388
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:00,437
Actually,

389
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:03,631
I'm quite impressed by Wu Yan.

390
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,409
You, me and my sister...

391
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,388
have known each other for over ten years.

392
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:15,051
You've always been
cold and arrogant to everyone.

393
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:17,852
I thought this was your nature,

394
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,393
and that's how you'll be forever.

395
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:23,724
But it wasn't until
I saw you with Wu Yan,

396
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:27,579
that I realise that wasn't the case.

397
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:29,965
You know how to be happy,

398
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:33,784
feel sadness or get mad.

399
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,768
It's as if her slightest facial expression
could upturn all your emotions.

400
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,799
The fact that she caused you to blow up
is actually making me feel...

401
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,740
quite happy.

402
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,285
I'm tired.

403
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:55,898
You're not going to look for her?

404
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:57,359
No.

405
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:17,910
Xiao Lu, please start the car
and take me out.

406
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,523
What... What is it?

407
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:21,807
I must find her.

408
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,892
Nian Qin, are you sure she'll walk
such a long distance...

409
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:33,997
to Cheng Yin's place by foot?

410
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,424
She probably took a taxi.

411
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:37,513
She won't.

412
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,371
She's simple-minded.

413
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:42,424
Nian Qin, don't worry.

414
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:44,332
Public security in this area
is quite good.

415
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,579
She'll probably be fine.

416
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,843
It's my fault
for not taking good care of her.

417
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:51,202
Stop thinking like that.

418
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,954
You said before that...

419
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:57,754
it's not compulsory for one to be
taken care of in this world.

420
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,434

00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,890
That idiotic, nasty jerk.

453
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,564
You could've asked me why I refuse to go.

454
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,791
I remember you told me this before.

455
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,762
Lovers shouldn't hold back
if they choose to love.

456
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,650
If not, they'll get hurt.

457
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,316
He hurt me first.

458
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:13,565
What did he do to you?

459
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:19,248
I haven't spoken a word
but he started interrogating me instead.

460
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:21,156
And his tone was so bad.

461
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:23,376
Why must he say it like that?

462
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,154
Would it kill him to actually
say it nicely?

463
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:26,729
As far I know,

464
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,984
he's always been that way.

465
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:30,646
It never bothered you before.

466
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:31,770
I...

467
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,125
Before this,

468
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:39,710
you saw the situation from
the perspective of the superior.

469
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,994
Subconsciously, you felt that
in comparison to this disabled orphan,

470
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,500
you'd always have the upper hand.

471
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,111
That's why you weren't bothered by it.

472
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:52,280
Simply put, it's the superior feeling of
being generous because you can.

473
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,666
However, with Su Nian Qin turning
out to be a wealthy family's son,

474
00:35:56,746 --> 00:35:57,915
you feel inferior now.

475
00:35:57,995 --> 00:35:59,818
It's making you become more sensitive.

476
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,812
This is what you'd always say.

477
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:04,651
I...

478
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:06,798
So that's really it?

479
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:08,014
Of course.

480
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:09,955
Alright.

481
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,018
What good does it do
for a married couple to quarrel?

482
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:13,489
Just talk it out nicely.

483
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,327
Maybe he'll call you soon.

484
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,539
Who said anything
about being a married couple?

485
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,173
I left my handbag and phone at his place.

486
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:21,616
No one would pick up even if he called.

487
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,919
Good, now you can have
some peace and quiet.

488
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,481
Serves that nasty jerk right
for throwing his temper...

489
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,516
at our dear Lady Sang.

490
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:31,653
Why don't the both of us
pray to our ancestors for him

491
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,175
to have nightmares every night?

492
00:36:36,688 --> 00:36:37,936
We can't do that.

493
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,352
He'll really be worried then.

494
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,227
Why don't you contact him instead?

495
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:46,256
I don't want to.

496
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,058
I'm still mad at him.

497
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:19,972
Wu Yan.

498
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,306
Why didn't you answer
any of my calls yesterday?

499
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,842
Wu Yan.

500
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm... I'm not Wu Yan, Mrs Sang.

501
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:38,925
Mr Su?

502
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:40,849
Yes.

503
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,066
Hello, Mrs Sang.

504
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,137
My apologies for disturbing you.

505
00:37:44,217 --> 00:37:45,235
Where's Wu Yan?

506
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:48,130
She left her phone at my place yesterday.

507
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,754
She's probably at work now.

508
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:56,117
Mr Su, is it convenient
to have a word with you now?

509
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:57,539
Yes, Mrs Sang.

510
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:01,164
I reckon Wu Yan has told you about this.

511
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,565
Due to some reasons related to you,

512
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:06,524
her father and I
are against your relationship.

513
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:09,695
I hope you understand
our concerns as parents.

514
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:14,335
I've spoken to Wu Yan about it.

515
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:17,385
We ended up quarrelling.

516
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,931
Wu Yan has been spoiled by me.

517
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:23,139
But she never once spoke
to me in that way.

518
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:25,483
But no matter how,

519
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:27,748
she's still our daughter.

520
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:31,157
Since she's adamant on being with you,

521
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:34,228
we have no other way but to yield
to her decision for now.

522
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:36,804
Her father and I spent
most of our lives working so hard...

523
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:40,186
so that she won't have to
suffer in future.

524
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:44,866
So she can then find a suitable man
to have a smooth life together.

525
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:46,194
But because of you,

526
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,328
she gave up all our arrangements
made for her.

527
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:54,329
I really hope
you understand what this means...

528
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:57,749
and treat her well.

529
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:00,064
I understand.

530
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,561
You're home, Wu Yan?

531
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,999
Even if you're yearning for her,
you ought to eat something too.

532
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,284
I bought beef noodles.

533
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:31,905
It's from Wu Yan's favourite restaurant.

534
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,738
Eat up first, will you?

535
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:38,379
-The rest of it...
-What time is it now?

536
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:42,170
It's almost time for her to go out.

537
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:43,960
Xiao Lu.

538
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,685
Can you please
pass Wu Yan's stuff back to her?

539
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:00,316
Wu Yan.

540
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:02,662
Nian Qin's being a little stubborn.
That's all.

541
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:04,913
-Please don't...
-I have my own temper too.

542
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:09,281
Ms Xiao Lu, I don't mean to be rude.

543
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:14,320
But have you guys considered that
maybe his awful temperament...

544
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:16,481
was actually shaped by being
too lenient to him?

545
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,406
Yes, we did think about that.

546
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:23,778
I'm sorry, Ms Xiao Lu.

547
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,256
I... I'm not really in a good mood now.

548
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:27,807
It's okay.

549
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,444
I'm on your side this time.

550
00:40:29,524 --> 00:40:31,980
Take time to calm down and rest.

551
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:33,641
But try not to take too long.

552
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,390
If there's anything, just call me.

553
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:37,717
Thanks, Ms Xiao Lu.

554
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:39,668
I'll head up now.

555
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,496
Goodbye.

556
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,176
Don't stay apart too long now.

557
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,414
Just tell me when you want to come home.
I'll come over to fetch you.

558
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:50,482
Bye.

You're reading this kind of novel?

Are you pursuing an artistic girl
this time?

What era is this?

567

A person is undermined for not reading...

568
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,932
and judged for the books one read
at the same time?

569
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:38,526
What a show off.

570

Wu Yan, your turn.

In two weeks,

576
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,997
my internship at the special
education school will end.

577
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,990
The school will organize a spring outing.

578
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,795
We'll be visiting Seawall Park.

579
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,080
Come join us.

The kids will miss you too.

Why choose the seaside
for a spring outing?

Don't people go there only during summer?

583
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,571
There's no springtime
in Manchester's seaside.

584
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,825
It's always snowing.

585
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:45,170
What?

586
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,140
I'm quoting it from the books.

587
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,614
I learnt that from Mr Yi Jin.

It doesn't matter to me.

591
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,862
Blinds can't see anyway.

592
00:43:00,047 --> 00:43:03,040
Am I not here to describe it to you now?

593
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:05,985
But you're right too.

594
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:09,506
Just listening without seeing
isn't enough to fully comprehend it.

595
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:11,179
But...

596
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,739
Many movies are based on original novels.

597
00:43:14,232 --> 00:43:17,391
If you want to know the story,
reading the original novel will do too.

598
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:20,590
You may even end up falling in love
with reading novels.

That one was interesting.

603
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,168
Let me think of other novels you can read.

604
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:32,686
You think they published everything
in the books for blinds.

605
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:35,345
So many classical works
never got published.

606
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:37,458
Is that so?

607
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:43,355
Let me think again.

610
00:44:04,054 --> 00:44:07,440
I didn't need to lift up my head
to know it was her.

611
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,868
Her toenails were always pink
in the summer.

612
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,009
I noticed them right away.
