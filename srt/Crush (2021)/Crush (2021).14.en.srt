(Emergency)

4
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:50,424
Dad.

5
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,163
Stop moving.

6
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,888
You're back.

7
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,444
Your mum told me.

8
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:05,710
No.

9
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:09,170
I'm sorry, Dad.

10
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,441
I didn't know that you're sick.

11
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,398
Silly girl.

12
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:19,722
You don't have to apologise.

13
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,921
I'm fine.

14
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:29,817
I heard from mum that
you have a boyfriend now.

15
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:35,851
When will you introduce him to me?

16
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,983
Dad.

17
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,321
Did mum tell you...

18
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,299
that my boyfriend...

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,163
is visually impaired?

20
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:01,480
Moreover, he comes
from a complicated family.

21
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,941
Do you love him?

22
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,188
I...

23
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,889
That's the only thing that matters.

24
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,333
Nothing else matters.

25
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,918
I know my daughter well.

26
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,895
You insist...

27
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:35,752
to do something you like
but not something you're good in.

28
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:38,582
You want to love...

29
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,059
but not to be loved.

30
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,749
I...

31
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:48,575
will support all of your decisions.

32
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,988
But you...

33
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,826
You have to promise me...

34
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,273
to take care of yourself.

35
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:04,440
I don't ask for anything else.

36
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:42,173
Mum.

37
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,265
-Mum.
-Go back now.

38
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,473
I'll take care of him.

39
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,272
You should take a rest.

40
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,782
You're just a child. What do you know?

41
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:54,275
-I...
-Take your luggage and go home now.

42
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,672
I'm no longer a child.

43
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,028
I've grown up.

44
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,009
I can do my part. I can take care of Dad.

45
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,446
Furthermore, I'm part of this family.

46
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,474
Your dad needs to be turned
every two hours.

47
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,866
Do you know how to do that?

48
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:11,083
Also,

49
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,687
he needs intravenous drip every night
and it usually ends at 3:00 AM.

50
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,313
You have to inform the nurse
when it's done.

51
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,921
Can you promise that you won't doze off?

52
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:21,999
Also,

53
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,665
there's a urinal under the bed.

54
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:26,358
Do you know how to use it?

55
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,424
Furthermore, you're a lady.

56
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,516
It's not convenient for you to do it.

57
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,936
Whether you can take care of him
is not your call.

58
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,495
Go home.

59
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:39,765
Your main mission
is just to pay your dad a visit.

60
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:42,759
It's to make him happy
and to keep him motivated.

61
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,412
Let me make it clear.

62
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,351
If I were the one who's lying in the bed,

63
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,581
it wouldn't matter to me if you're back.

64
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,578
You may go anywhere you want.

65
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:53,980
People raise children for their old age.

66
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:55,994
Your dad and I have pension.

67
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:57,596
We don't have to rely on you.

68
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,474
Just make sure that
you can sustain yourself.

69
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,809
Mum!

70
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,257
I don't have the time for argument.

71
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,471
I don't want your dad
to overhear our conversation.

72
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,961
I've said what I'm supposed to say.

73
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,186
If I talk too much,

74
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,698
you'll complain that
I'm interrupting your life.

75
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:21,834
Fine.

76
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,340
I need to tell you something.

77
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,488
After the surgery,

78
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:32,391
your dad was transferred to ICU.

79
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:34,067
The moment he woke up,

80
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,433
he asked about you.

81
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,304
He asked where you were.

82
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,955
He blamed me for scolding you.

83
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:48,041
Wu Yan, think about it.

84
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:50,038
Your dad was not feeling well.

85
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:51,882
He almost lost his life.

86
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,606
What about you?

87
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,269
Your love life is everything.

88
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,755
Your dream is everything.

89
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,829
I don't get it.

90
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,930
Is your parents' love worth nothing?

91
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,501
Is it really a matter of course?

92
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,382
Here's your new phone.

93
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,169
You should give Wu Yan a call.

94
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,301
Her dad fell sick.

95
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,426
You should know it.

96
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,750
No parents would use illness as an excuse
to trick their children to go home.

97
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:12,271
Nian Qin.

98
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:14,337
To be honest,

99
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,973
you're unschooled in the way of the world.

100
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,091
I...

101
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,064
Xiao Lu.

102
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,019
Actually, I received a phone call
from Wu Yan's mum.

103
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,301
Her mum said...

104
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:40,527
they oppose our relationship.

105
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:45,860
For me,

106
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,882
Wu Yan has turned against them.

107
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,621
I know I'm a selfish person.

108
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:03,917
In the past,
I didn't think that it was wrong.

109
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:06,795
If I don't think for myself,

110
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:09,722
can I expect someone else
to think for me?

111
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,118
She doesn't want me to know about it.

112
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,695
So, I pretend not to know.

113
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:21,380
I even proposed to her.

114
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:27,818
However...

115
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,161
Now...

116
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,722
I don't know what to do.

117
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:42,935
If you don't give it a try,

118
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:46,192
how would you know that
you won't be accepted?

119
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,220
(Emergency)

120
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,058
Here you are.

121
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:02,785
Look at Hao.

122
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:05,065
He's here early in the morning
to pay your dad a visit.

123
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:08,052
If you ask me, Wei Hao is lovelier.

124
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,042
Wei Hao just told me...

125
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,266
he's in a relationship
with your high school friend, Xu Qian.

126
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:20,372
Like I said earlier, she's so lucky.

127
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:22,278
That's why she found a guy like Wei Hao,

128
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:26,309
who is caring and responsible.

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,999
Mum.

130
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:31,803
What's wrong?

131
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,193
Was I wrong?

132
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,455
Why are you here?

133
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,626
My parents told me. Your dad fell sick.

134
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,450
Of course I have to pay him a visit.

135
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,548
Thanks.

136
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:53,610
Why are you so polite with me?

137
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,893
I'm not chasing you away.

138
00:11:56,973 --> 00:12:00,013
Aren't you looking
to work with another record company?

139
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,749
Don't delay your work because of me.

140
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:05,876
Actually, I'm hesitating.

141
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,211
I kind of want to stay in the hometown.

142
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,395
Xu Qian's grandma is not in good health.

143
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:12,853
Someone has to take care of her.

144
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,949
You've become more mature.

145
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,185
I'm serious.

146
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,450
I plan to propose to her one year later.

147
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,694
I wonder if we can come home together
when the time comes.

148
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,777
Why must it be one year later?

149
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:26,202
I need to save up for the wedding.
I have to be financially independent.

150
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:27,614
I mustn’t mistreat her.

151
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,270
Xu Qian can sustain her own life.

152
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,536
You're right.

153
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,104
All right, you may go home now.

154
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,065
Sure.

155
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,436
What are you doing?

156
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,854
Shouldn't I bid goodbye to them
before I go?

157
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:41,215
You're a grown up now.
You should know better.

158
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,353
Mrs Sang, I'm leaving.

159
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,394
One day soon, I'll pay you guys a visit
together with my girlfriend.

160
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,795
Why are you leaving so soon?

161
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,039
Hold on. Let me send you off.

162
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,326
Mum, I can send him off.

163
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,645
Bye, Mrs Sang.

164
00:12:57,964 --> 00:12:59,480
All right, let me send you off.

165
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,917
It's okay, just stay here.

166
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,188
I'm going back to Xiamen.
Call me if you need me.

167
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:08,944
What's wrong?

168
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,192
Did you chase him away?

169
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:16,957
I... I didn't do that.

170
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,897
I can't keep him here forever, can I?

171
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,297
Even so, you shouldn't chase him away.

172
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:25,887
He's here to pay your dad a visit
and he brought so many things.

173
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,725
I feel bad for that.

174
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,516
I planned to let him
take some of them back.

175
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:32,760
Mum, don't do that. He has a girlfriend.

176
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,882
Why do you still try to be close with him?

177
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:36,343
What's wrong?

178
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,627
If it weren't for you,
he might have become my son-in-law.

179
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:42,484
He's such a nice kid.

180
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,487
Compared to Su...

181
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:47,404
What's his name again?
He's obviously better.

182
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,864
Will you stop comparing?
What is there to compare?

183
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:51,655
Su Nian Qin is great. He's the best.

184
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:52,988
Why are you shouting?

185
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,748
Keep quiet.

186
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:31,118
You claim that he's great in every aspect.

187
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:34,896
You also claim that he loves you.

188
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:39,612
Something big happened in our family.

189
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:42,252
However, he didn't come...

190
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,865
and pay your dad a visit.

191
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,872
He's too busy.

192
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,485
As you know,

193
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,990
it's not convenient for him to come here.

194
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,840
Please be understanding.

195
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:10,998
You're considerate of him.

196
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,340
But I don't get it.

197
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:18,033
Your dad and I raised you up with love.

198
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:21,992
Did we do that so that
you can be considerate to someone else?

199
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,057
Sure.

200
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:25,039
You're thinking about him.

201
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:26,686
What about him?

202
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,540
(Missed calls)

203
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,365
(Wu Yan)

204
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:33,287
Su Nian Qin.

205
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,667
Come with me! You must come with me.

206
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:38,343
Your dad is dying.
You have to meet him one last time.

207
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:43,508
Nian Qin, this way.

208
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:47,565
Do CPR.

209
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:54,749
We're ready.

210
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,065
-Get ready emergency injection.
-Okay.

211
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:19,986
Dad.

212
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,792
Take a look at this.

213
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:25,240
My boss really likes my proposal.

214
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,840
She thinks it can bring
the underground bands...

215
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,317
some exposure.

216
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:36,258
That way, more audiences will realise
there are many good musics...

217
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:37,872
which have gone unnoticed.

218
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:41,307
It sounds interesting.

219
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,251
When it's out,

220
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,878
I'll listen to the broadcast every day.

221
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,265
Sure.

222
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:54,869
If it's a success,
I'll become a broadcaster.

223
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,223
However, if that happens,

224
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,721
I'll have to stay in Xiamen forever.

225
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,132
Then you'll be...

226
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:14,516
I overheard the conversation yesterday
between you and your mum.

227
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,239
Don't mind your mum.

228
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:21,126
Her bark is worse than her bite.

229
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:24,840
In fact, she's thought it through.

230
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,161
She told me,

231
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:30,743
it's your life after all.

232
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:37,266
The path that she thinks is right for you
doesn't necessarily mean that it is right.

233
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,370
Moving forward,

234
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:43,191
if you settle down in Xiamen,

235
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:47,464
have your own career, and family,

236
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,868
just make some time...

237
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:54,656
to pay us a visit at times
with your family.

238
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:56,814
That's good enough.

239
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:00,557
What does that mean?

240
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:01,714
I won't do that.

241
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:03,240
I'll come home every day to annoy you.

242
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,241
I'll make sure you get annoyed
and chase me away.

243
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:07,690
Look at you.

244
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:13,675
No doubt you look arrogant and spoiled,

245
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,398
but since young,

246
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,564
you have never let
your mum and me get worried.

247
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,419
One of your mum's proudest achievements...

248
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:35,799
is that you managed to get into any school
that she wanted you to go.

249
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:39,024
She's so proud of that.

250
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:45,935
I spoil you all the time
but when I think back,

251
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:52,004
I've been focusing on teaching
all these years.

252
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,893
I have never talked to you properly.

253
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:04,657
You've always been good at school.

254
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,294
You have never gone out of line.

255
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,561
Everything has worked out well.

256
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,750
So, we don't think...

257
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,229
you suffer from any stress...

258
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:21,925
and worry.

259
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,461
That's precisely why...

260
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:29,446
we've neglected something.

261
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,831
I know your feelings.

262
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,578
However, I didn't handle it well.

263
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:44,110
Don't say that.

264
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:45,916
I have a big heart.

265
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:48,399
I have never thought about it.

266
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,687
So you shouldn't worry.

267
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:54,083
Dad.

268
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:55,521
Try this.

269
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,110
I picked it for you.

270
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,526
Isn't it sweet?

271
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:18,591
All right.
I'll adjust it before sending it to you.

272
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,591
Don't worry, Ms Xi.

273
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:25,285
Even if I'm not the broadcaster,
I'll get this show done.

274
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:28,926
Therefore, I would like to ask you
if I have to stay here...

275
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:32,460
to take care of my dad,
please take care of the show.

276
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:36,893
Okay, thank you, Ms Xi.

277
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:38,947
That's all.

278
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,660
(Nian Qin: Wu Yan, go and visit
my dad with me tomorrow)

279
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,182
Incoming call from Wu Yan.

280
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:21,946
Incoming call from Wu Yan.

281
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,437
Incoming call from Wu Yan.

282
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:27,653
Sorry, the number you've
dialled is unavailable.

283
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,587
Please try again later.

284
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,872
Nian Qin.

285
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:09,046
You can't keep going like this.

286
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,482
Nian Qin.

287
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:15,747
Nian Qin!

288
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,630
Nian Qin!

289
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:19,057
Somebody!

290
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:20,289
Nurse!

291
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:26,141
Here, just a little bit more. Yes.

292
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,304
More.

293
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,613
You're indeed my dad.

294
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:33,797
You're so handsome!

295
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:36,352
That's because my daughter has got skills.

296
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:41,902
(Xiao Lu)

297
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,273
Hello.

298
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:44,688
Hello, Wu Yan.

299
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:46,783
Is your dad feeling better?

300
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:49,995
My dad's condition is stable.

301
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,152
He's in the hospital.

302
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:52,293
What's wrong?

303
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:55,663
Can you come back?

304
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:59,299
Nian Qin's dad almost died two days ago.

305
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:02,765
He's brought back to life
but things aren't looking good.

306
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,243
I worry that
he might not be able to take it.

307
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:13,806
Ms Xiao Lu. Tell me slowly. Calm down.

308
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:14,931
What's happened?

309
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:17,939
Nian Qin's dad has always been
looking for a liver for transplant.

310
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,416
His condition was okay not long ago.

311
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:22,370
However, it suddenly worsened.

312
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:25,489
Nian Qin...

313
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,105
Nian Qin is...

314
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,661
What's wrong?

315
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,333
He sat outside the ward,
refusing to eat nor talk.

316
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:36,101
He ignored everyone.

317
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:38,145
In the end, he passed out.

318
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:40,801
Now, he's getting
intravenous drip in the ward.

319
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,956
None of us can handle him.

320
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,928
Will you please come back to see him?

321
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:47,742
Please.

322
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:50,487
Okay, got it.

323
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,719
I'll be gentle.

324
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,636
Just go back if you need to.

325
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:12,362
I'm okay.

326
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:14,964
But, Dad...

327
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:17,947
Since your dad wants you to go back,
you should go back.

328
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:20,156
You can't do anything here anyway.

329
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,156
But...

330
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:24,391
But...

331
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,148
No buts.

332
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,678
Just do whatever you need to do.

333
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,254
You're not so indecisive in the past.

334
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:34,651
Listen to you.

335
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,785
Can't you talk nicely?

336
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:39,629
Am I wrong?

337
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,051
Dad.

338
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,296
Dad.

339
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:01,572
I'll be back soon.

340
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:03,890
Go on.

341
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:12,292
I'm going.

342
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,817
Bye.

343
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:22,056
Yan.

344
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:27,867
Have a safe journey.

345
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,131
I'm leaving.

346
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,980
(Tongcheng, Xiamen)

347
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:14,589
No tickets are available.

348
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,527
Excuse me.

349
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:20,354
Can we go to the bus station?

350
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:21,806
It's getting late.

351
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,700
Why don't you leave tomorrow?

352
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,235
I can't. I've checked.

353
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:27,480
Even the earliest high speed rail
ticket is not available.

354
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,419
I'd better take a bus.

355
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,347
I'll reach there tomorrow
early in the morning.

356
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,295

It's early in the morning.

379
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,177
Your brother-in-law
can't eat anything at the moment.

380
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:38,480
Why did you cook?

381
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:40,167
It's for Nian Qin.

382
00:30:40,951 --> 00:30:42,883
Where is Nian Qin?

383
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,624
He's in another ward.

384
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:49,072
He had a fight with Wu Yan
and that was a huge blow to him.

385
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:50,513
Then, something happened to his dad.

386
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:52,093
So, he broke down.

387
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,979
I'll check on him.

388
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,785
I've listened to your songs.

389
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,316
They're well written.

390
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:11,066
However, the quantity is too little.

391
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,074
I don't need much.

392
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,359
I don't have to work so hard
to make money.

393
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:17,988
However, you'll need
to sustain your family in the future.

394
00:31:18,322 --> 00:31:21,221
A good life is built on a material basis.

395
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:23,745
I can become a teacher
at the blind school,

396
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:27,621
so that I can enjoy a stable income
and social insurance.

397
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:32,565
You can consider that.

398
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:41,965
Nian Qin.

399
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,002
It's been a long time.

400
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,552
It's been a long time
since we had a conversation so peacefully.

401
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:51,686
I forgive you.

402
00:31:56,635 --> 00:31:59,938
When my dad's heart stopped beating
right in front of me,

403
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:02,862
I got scared.

404
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:06,429
I've never imagined it.

405
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:10,601
I haven't done my duty as a son.

406
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:13,577
Wu Yan reminded me.

407
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,166
The past...

408
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,797
is no longer important.

409
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,582
Your dad will make it through...

410
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:27,341
because you're here.

411
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:32,778
When your dad gets better,
you should meet with Ms Sang.

412
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,523
Apologise to her.

413
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:35,763
Apologise?

414
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:38,534
Yes.

415
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:40,346
I accused her parents...

416
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,478
of tricking her to go home
using sickness as an excuse.

417
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:43,831
I was wrong.

418
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,435
However, I know it well that
to her family,

419
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,732
I'm just a burden.

420
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,604
Nian Qin, how could you...

421
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,311
Ms Sang is here.

422
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:02,608
Have a good chat with her.

423
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:17,569
Why are you here?

424
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,860
Ms Xiao Lu said that you refused to eat.

425
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,545
You also ignored everyone.

426
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,672
She told me to check on you.

427
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,319
You're really something.

428
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:35,243
Why are you so sure that
I'll listen to you?

429
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,115
Why are you laughing?

430
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:41,028
Su Nian Qin. Must you talk like that?

431
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:42,883
Let me ask you.

432
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:46,020
When did my mum call you a burden?

433
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:48,692
Isn't that your own assumption?

434
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:53,549
What matters is not your visual impairment
nor your family background.

435
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:55,461
Those aren't important at all.

436
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:57,036
I've never thought...

437
00:33:57,116 --> 00:33:59,381
these could be the obstacles
that stop us from being together.

438
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:00,586
But...

439
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,336
Do you think you're the only one
who face difficulty?

440
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,305
Do you think you're the only one
who has a temper?

441
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:10,326
My dad fell sick.

442
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:12,081
I went back to take care of him.

443
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:15,825
I was so worried. I was struggling.

444
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,232
I was exhausted.

445
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,652
However, so many days have passed.

446
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,358
You didn't even give me a call.

447
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,308
It took me
so much of effort to travel here.

448
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:29,622
I came back in a rush to coax you.
Then what?

449
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:32,223
Do I deserve all the smack talk?

450
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,060
I...

451
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,080
I really don't know why I came back.

452
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:40,205
For once, I thought...

453
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:42,475
you loved me too.

454
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,825
That's why I...

455
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:47,623
That's why I put up
with your unreasonableness.

456
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:49,640
Now, I realise,

457
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,025
you love only yourself.

458
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,815
Everything else
is not as important as your dignity.

459
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,668
Because of your low-esteem,

460
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:01,921
you have taken the moral high ground
that you deem right...

461
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:05,619
to hurt me
and everyone around you. Am I right?

462
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,813
I thought I could tolerate you.

463
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:15,236

I was a bit mean to him.
