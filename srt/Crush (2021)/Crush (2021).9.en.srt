=Episode 9=

3
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,030
It's my duty
to carry the family's burdens.

4
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,750
But I don't want him
to face these problems.

5
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,240
If we get into a relationship
and it becomes serious,

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,110
he'll have to face this one day.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
I don't want him to deal with this.

8
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,440
I think you should at least give it a try.

9
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,030
Give him and yourself a chance.

10
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,360
Although I understand what you mean,

11
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,160
I feel
that avoiding starting something...

12
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,470
because it might end one day
means you're not being true to yourself.

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Okay, I'll stop talking.

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,280
You should decide how it goes
between the two of you.

15
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,520
Where are you going?

16
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,030
To my boyfriend's place.

17
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,200
Boyfriend?

18
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,829
The one I met before this?

19
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,390
The school is going on a break soon.
Where are you going to stay?

20
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,310
I can still stay
at the hostel for a few days.

21
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,640
After that,
I'll go for a short-term rental.

22
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,310
Why would you go through so much trouble?

23
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,030
Just stay at my place.

24
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,310
I'll just inform Cheng Yin about it.

25
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,230
Hold on.

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,440
Thank you.

27
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Don't need to be so polite with me.

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,800
Look at the environment here.
There should be everything you need.

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
You don't need to move anything in.

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,280
Just give me a call if you need anything.
I'm leaving.

31
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm taking this with me.
You can have the rest.

32
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,640
Thanks for your fruits.

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,720
Six lemons.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
That's enough.

35
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,670
Su Nian Qin,
you look like you're part of the sofa.

36
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,030
Here, have some lemon juice.

37
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,280
You're not drinking it?

38
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Don't you like this?

39
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
I made it with fresh lemons.

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I'll drink it later.

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,590
Okay.

42
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,360
What are you doing?
Are you going to listen to some radio?

43
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,800
Xiao Lu sent an audio file to me.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,870
She wants me to listen to it.

45
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,360
Audio file?

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,960
♫The overlapping wishes♫

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,320
Isn't this Xu Qian's voice?

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,120
Why did she send Momo's voice recording
over to you?

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,801
Momo?

50
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:24,881
It's my best friend's band.

51
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:27,161
They're also my university coursemates.

52
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:29,200
You've met them.
Wei Hao and Xu Qian.

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,310
Do you remember?

54
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,100
Your childhood friends
with a complicated relationship?

55
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,940
♫It's as if the heat is waving♫

56
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,360
Indeed.

57
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,881
Even though they haven't practised
for a long while,

58
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,401
it still feels good when you listen to it.

59
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,641
♫And the sunset is bustling♫

60
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,960
I really feel
like watching Momo's jamming session.

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,840
Drink your lemon juice, quick.

62
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,190
♫Longing for boastfulness
As it speaks my mind♫

63
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,280
♫We long for fire♫

64
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,870
♫The expansion in our hearts♫

65
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,130
♫Kickstarts my journey♫

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,870
♫The expansion in our hearts
Speaks my mind♫

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,310
-We played well today.
-Yes.

68
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,800
When did we not play well?

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
The bass seems to have been submerged
in water.

70
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,470
-Hello?
-I think something's wrong with it.

71
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,070
-Look.
-It's rusted.

72
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,960
-Is it time to get a new one?
-It's all right. I'll make do.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,550
Do you mean...

74
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,920
that I got in?

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Are you sure?

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,990
Of course.

77
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,120
Thank you.

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,960
See you then!

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,920
By the way, the band
that you brought over the last time,

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,360
I let Nian Qin listen to the recording
of their practice session.

81
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Nian Qin says it's quite good.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,870
Really?

83
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,030
I plan to produce a show
that focuses on young, indie artists.

84
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,870
I think getting people
who are extremely new like them,

85
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,640
basically amateurs,

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,960
is very interesting.

87
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,470
By the way,
how has Nian Qin been recently?

88
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,270
I haven't heard about him in a while.

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,430
I'm going to tell you secretly.

90
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,960
Nian Qin has been busy dating recently.

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,920
I've known that he has been interested
in that girl since the beginning.

92
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,240
I'm so curious.

93
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,520
What kind of girl is she?

94
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,150
She's quite an adorable girl.

95
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,470
Has a unique name too.

96
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,240
She's called...

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,270
Wu Yan.

98
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,240
Senior, you need to keep it a secret.

99
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,150
Or else, you know what's going to happen.

100
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,710
I know, don't worry.

101
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,840
What are you busy with
so early in the morning?

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,590
I'm bringing my boyfriend on a date.

103
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,710
We're going to an early movie.
There's fewer people.

104
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,240
Are you trying to choke your boyfriend?

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,360
Nonsense.

106
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,190
I'm trying to awaken all the senses
in the body.

107
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,640
So that even in a crowd,
he'll be able to find me.

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
Do I smell good?

109
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,750
What is this?

110
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,680
I came back at 3 A.M. last night.

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,590
I didn't even have the energy to change.

112
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,870
Poor you.

113
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,200
Rest well then.

114
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,680
I'm leaving.

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,520
Bye-bye.

116
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,350
He's going into the Egyptian centre.

117
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,480
He's hiding in the corner
and waiting for the mummy to appear.

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,909
The shadow appeared.

119
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,280
The mummy...

120
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,680
Stop watching.

121
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,040
The more scared I get,
the more I want to watch it.

122
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,760
The scarier it gets,
the more she wants to watch it.

123
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,990
It really is like being poisoned.

124
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,480
-Make way, make way.
-Excuse me.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,920
Make way, make way.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Move inside.

128
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm sorry, please make way.

129
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,630
Go that way.

131
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,750
Don't push.

132
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,440
Oh, no, his phone is in my bag.

133
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,600
He's so stubborn,
he's not going to ask for help.

134
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,340
Oh, dear.

135
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,750
Su Nian Qin!

136
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,400
That was fast.

137
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
I was so worried.

138
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,870
What is there to worry about?

139
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,830
No matter where we split up,

140
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,790
I'll be waiting for you at the same spot.

141
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,110
But what if I'm the one who got lost?

142
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
The scent of your perfume is so strong,
it's going to be easy to find you.

143
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,750
Su Nian Qin!

144
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,070
Where's Wu Yan?

145
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,870
I've downloaded all the movies
she spoke about.

146
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,600
She went to the grocery store
right outside to get some Hawthorn sticks.

147
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,230
On the way back,
she saw some candied haws,

148
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,430
but we didn't get the ones that she loved.

149
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,990
She kept thinking about it
since we got home.

150
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,200
She couldn't stand it anymore,

151
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,350
so she went to get some food
to curb the craving.

152
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,110
Nian Qin,
why are you suddenly talking so much now?

153
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,870
It's nothing. That's quite nice.

154
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,310
I'm leaving. You go on.

155
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,230
Sir, I didn't hear you wrongly, did I?

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
Correct.

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,590
After you hand over your tasks,

158
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,670
you can go over to the crew to see Nie Xi.

159
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank... Thank you, sir.

160
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,030
Thank you for the care
you've given during this time.

161
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,800
I'll come back and visit often.

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,270
So, I... I'm leaving now.

163
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,520
Thanks, thanks, thanks!

164
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,520
Mr Zhong, I'm back.

165
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,390
What took you so long?

166
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,480
I've been waiting for you for half-a-day.

167
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,430
How did you know that I'm coming back?

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,320
During the meeting, Nie Xi went
to see the people Mr Jiang wants...

169
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,520
and insisted on getting you back.

170
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,470
-Why?
-It could be any reason,

171
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,910
but it's definitely not because
of your work performance.

172
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,360
Don't assume that all young people like me
have a mild temper.

173
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,680
You have a mild temper?

174
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,590
The entire station knows that you
could explode at any moment, okay?

175
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,840
-How dare you say that?
-Sang Wu Yan.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,270
I requested you back
not so that you can play...

177
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,520
or flirt around.

178
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,230
Arrange these materials.
We'll need it for the live show tomorrow.

179
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
Xi... Xi.

180
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,520
Flirting?

181
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,550
Where did you get this from?

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,600
Xiao Lu bought it. I'm not sure.

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,030
That's too troublesome for Xiao Lu.

184
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,510
Just eat it.

185
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,990
I'll pay back any favours to her.

186
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,720
Do you want to try it? I can feed you.

187
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,280
-No.
-You've touched it. Eat it.

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,030
You're exaggerating.

189
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,830
It's not that sour.

190
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,910
Don't you love to drink lemon juice?

191
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,350
Since when did I love lemon juice?

192
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,870
No way, Su Nian Qin.

193
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
(Mum)

194
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,870
-Hello?
-Not going home yet?

195
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,510
Because I have to work overtime today.

196
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,230
Why are you working so late?

197
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,550
It's very dangerous for a girl
to walk alone at night.

198
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,880
I've already told you.

199
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,590
This really isn't a good job.

200
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,070
On top of that, we're not there with you.

201
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,800
There's no one to take care of you.

202
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,630
Mum, I'm working quite well here.

203
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,160
What do you mean well?

204
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,320
You're alone in an unfamiliar place.

205
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,670
Wouldn't you be bullied?

206
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
Tell me honestly.

207
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,470
All this while until today,

208
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,510
you're always been so busy.

209
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,880
What have you been busy with?

210
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,880
Is it because...?

211
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,630
Mum, don't speculate.

212
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,000
My colleagues are quite nice to me here.

213
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,110
There really is no problem.

214
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,270
Then finish work soon.

215
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,800
Don't loiter outside.

216
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,830
Be aware of your safety when you're alone.

217
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,040
I know.

218
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,480
Xi.

219
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
You haven't been improving recently.

220
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,400
Your focus and angles
in the writing are both wrong.

221
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,430
I'll change it.

222
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
You don't need to.

223
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
Just leave it be.

224
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,840
But, Xi...

225
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
What...? This?

226
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,520
What's wrong with this?

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,560
Nothing is wrong.

228
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,150
I've arranged these materials long ago.

229
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,180
There definitely won't be a problem
for the live show.

230
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,550
So she...

231
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,110
I have no idea either.

232
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,520
Maybe Xi just wants to break you in.

233
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,020
(Nian Qin)

234
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,600
Hello?

235
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,000
Hold on.

236
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,390
Here's your coffee. Enjoy.

237
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,310
Thank you!

238
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,310
See, he came all the way just to see me,
and left.

239
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,550
Maybe he can tell
that I'm having trouble at work.

240
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,870
Our Su can see quite clearly...

241
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,880
when he needs to.

242
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,270
Wake up. You're so love sick.

243
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,560
Your boyfriend just needs to come over...

244
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
and you'll forget any problems
that you're having.

245
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
I can't just keep thinking about it.

246
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,800
I just don't understand.

247
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,270
This Xi has always been quite nice.

248
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,110
She's usually quite friendly to me.

249
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,230
Although sometimes
she's a little too strict,

250
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,880
she gives out the vibes from a teacher.

251
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,200
Why did it suddenly change?

252
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,510
Why is this...?

253
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,920
Are you being pranked?

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,960
You're so carefree,

255
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
you might not even realise
when you've offended someone.

256
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,030
I don't think anyone would do that.

257
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,720
Wu Yan is just an intern.

258
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,120
Would someone waste time to prank her?

259
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,670
Wu Yan,

260
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,390
I think it's best not to overthink.

261
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,680
In the workplace,

262
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
the most important thing
is to not take yourself too seriously.

263
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,630
We lose our worth...

264
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,870
once we've left our parents and school.

265
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,550
How someone would react
depends solely on their mood.

266
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,150
We can't change anything, anyway.

267
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,030
It's important to just do your best.

268
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

269
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,360
-Hello?
-Why are you not back yet?

270
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,670
It's only past 9 o'clock now.

271
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,870
Yes, you have the routine
of an old person.

272
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,390
My goodness.

273
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,310
You...

274
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,870
People who drink with you so late
are definitely not good people.

275
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,870
Not at all! They're my best friends.

276
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,150
And I asked them out.

277
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,840
The car is here.

278
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,150
I...

279
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,720
We're leaving.

280
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm going to hang up. Bye bye.

281
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,240
Was that your mum?

282
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
No.

283
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,960
I'm staying at my friend's place.

284
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,080
You should bring Xu Qian with you. Go.

285
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,840
Then you should leave first.

286
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll be worried if you're gonna wait
for a cab by yourself.

287
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
Good bye.

288
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,320
You take good care of Xu Qian for me.

289
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,600
-Go.
-Bye-bye.

290
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Bye-bye.

291
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,630
Thank you, sir.

292
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,350
Su Nian Qin, you are absolutely...

293
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,510
My classmates asked
if it was my mum who called just now.

294
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,670
My goodness.

295
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,910
Don't move. I'm acting drunk.

296
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,240
Give it back.

297
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,670
-No.
-This is mine.

298
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,550
Is it?

299
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,910
Su Nian Qin,
were the glutinous rice balls nice?

300
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,640
I don't know.

301
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
I gave it to Xiao Wei.

302
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,640
I was wrong.

303
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,600
I shouldn't get such a sweet candy
for Xiao Wei.

304
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,000
She'll get cavities.

305
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,680
Oh, my God.

306
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,000
How long has he been missing?
(Topic: Yi Ji)

307
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm about to post a missing person notice.

308
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
What if the great god Yi Jin...

309
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,020
is frustrated with
the music scene's present standards...

310
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,720
and decided to devote himself
to other things?

311
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,080
Are you telling me he isn't coming back
after the New Year celebration?

312
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,030
I'm so jealous of you young girls.

313
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,200
You don't gain weight
even when you're eating two sets of meat.

314
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,430
Tell me.

315
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,390
Why would she suddenly...

316
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,600
come and speak to me?

317
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,310
It's just...

318
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,910
But Xi was really nice to me before this.

319
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,600
Is this Xi that you're talking about
Nie Xi?

320
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,390
I know her.

321
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,110
Of course you know her.

322
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,800
She did your interview before this.

323
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,430
No, she's Xiao Lu's senior.

324
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,510
She's quite close to Xiao Lu.

325
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,870
Xiao Lu gave you Momo's recording
before this.

326
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,270
I asked Xi to help find a studio too.

327
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,840
Everything makes sense then.

328
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,720
That means even before the live show,

329
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,320
you and Xi were quite close already.

330
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,760
Not really close.

331
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,030
We're just friends.

332
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,600
That was unexpected, Su Nian Qin.

333
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,990
You always look so distant,

334
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,550
but you're actually quite popular.

335
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,800
What do you mean?

336
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,030
I don't mean anything.

337
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,310
It's a psychological analysis.
You wouldn't understand.

338
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,360
Wu Yan,

339
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,120
can you eat less
when you're home for New Year?

340
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,910
Your belly is getting kind of soft.

341
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,120
Who says you can touch me?

342
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,310
You're still touching?

343
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,670
Stop it.

344
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,030
You're not allowed to touch. No touching.

345
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,200
Are you sure you don't want me
to send you?

346
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,390
It's all right.
I'm not bringing a lot of luggage.

347
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,550
There's no need for you to travel.

348
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,880
The car is here.

349
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm leaving.

350
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,200
I'll come back earlier
to spend time with you.

351
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,390
Be good.

352
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,310
I'm leaving.

353
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,550
Be good. I'm leaving.

354
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,870
Bye.

355
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,960
Be good when you're alone.

356
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm leaving.

357
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,240
Bye-bye.

358
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,790
Where's our daughter?

359
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,880
Still sleeping?

360
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
She's studying.

361
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,630
Studying?

362
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,120
Don't bother her.

363
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,030
"Rain is hitting the eaves,"

364
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,390
"the swallow has returned home."

365
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,960
"Next to Zhuque Bridge,"

366
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,680
"the boat has long sailed."

367
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,110
"After we part this year,"

368
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,430
"when will we meet again?"

369
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,270
Read that again.

370
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,630
"Rain is hitting the eaves,"

371
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,230
"the swallow has returned home."

372
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,550
"Next to Zhuque Bridge,"

373
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,750
"the boat has long sailed."

374
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,120
"After we part this year,
when will we meet again?"

375
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,720
"I wonder under the umbrella,"

376
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,320
"in Wuyi Alley,"

377
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,670
"the light colours of twilight."

378
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,240
What's wrong?

379
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,790
I suddenly realised...

380
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,760
that your voice sounds nice.

381
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,880
What are you doing?

382
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,080
Why are you suddenly studying old poems?

383
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,150
Nothing.

384
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,150
I'm doing lesson preparations.

385
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,110
When I get back,

386
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,110
I need to teach the children
at the special eds school.

387
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,761
I'm doing lesson preparations.

388
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:20,801
Then why are you wearing your earphones?

389
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,630
This...

390
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,600
Well...

391
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,840
There's a kid
who is very slow in learning.

392
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,510
He can't finish the
winter holiday assignments and called me.

393
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm just giving him some guidance.

394
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,990
Okay, Mum.

395
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,390
Go cook.

396
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,990
The student is asking me what's happening.

397
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm already a teacher,

398
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,480
but my mum
is still asking about everything.

399
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,910
Isn't that shameful?

400
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,480
Now that we're out,
it wouldn't be as stuffy, right?

401
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
We're wasting so much effort for this.

402
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,680
Why can't we just sit her
next to the window to get some air?

403
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,030
Do you know him?

404
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,440
Take grandma to the park.

405
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,550
I'll be over in a second.

406
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,030
That's my mum.

407
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,670
She doesn't come home for New Year
often before this.

408
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,080
Wu Yan saw her by chance.

409
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,150
So why did you...?

410
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,150
I prepared some gifts for house visiting.

411
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,510
Bring it back and tell Aunty I said hi.

412
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,110
That's funny.

413
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,880
You want to say hi to her.

414
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,550
No, but...

415
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,720
If you see her in the future, ignore her.

416
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,920
If she asks to borrow some money
or for your help,

417
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,680
pretend you don't know me...

418
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,910
and just refuse.

419
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,150
Why would you say that about your mum?

420
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,430
Because I'm tired.

421
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,670
I keep seeing her getting hurt
by another prick the same way.

422
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,630
Then coming back
and leaving over and over again.

423
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,150
It's always been like this.

424
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,080
I'm...

425
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,960
tired.

426
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,790
So,

427
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,720
don't care and don't ask.

428
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,030
Just pretend that you didn't know.

429
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,630
You're helping me by not doing anything.

430
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,760
I've told you.

431
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,150
You're helping me by not doing anything.

432
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,030
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

433
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,960
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

434
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,560
What are you doing?

435
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm not doing anything.

436
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,310
What about you?

437
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,550
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

438
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,270
The New Year celebration
is just like that.

439
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,910
Like what?

440
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,750
We have a reunion dinner,
watch performances.

441
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,630
Give some red packets,
play with some firecrackers,

442
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,200
watch the fireworks and stuff.

443
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,430
It's boring.

444
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,240
So you're calling me because you're bored?

445
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,720
No.

446
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,870
I'll share a playlist in NetEase with you.

447
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,440
Let's listen to some music together, okay?

448
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,360
Playlist?

449
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,200
You've never seen a playlist?

450
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,750
My goodness.

451
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,390
Let me show you the world.

452
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,260
(Picked Up a Fragment of a Star)

453
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,390
Wu Yan. "Picked Up a Fragment of a Star."

454
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,110
Did you know?

455
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,200
Although I'm a science student,

456
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,680
when I was chatting online
about Yi Jin before this,

457
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,430
I was really creative
with blowing his trumpet.

458
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,720
It means using very extravagant words...

459
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,080
and poems and other things
to compliment Yi Jin.

460
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,790
But ever since I've fallen for you,

461
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,790
I feel that a lot of times,

462
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,480
I would think of you
when I hear a certain song.

463
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,750
The feeling the song gives me...

464
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,430
is the same one I have for you.

465
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,990
After a while,

466
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,600
I've collected a lot of songs
without realising it.

467
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,840
I want to describe my feelings,

468
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,680
but I can't find the words for it,

469
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,600
or when I miss you a lot,

470
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,270
I'll listen to those songs.

471
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,960
And soon after that,

472
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,630
I stopped blowing his trumpet.

473
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,390
I feel that...

474
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,510
if I share this playlist with you,

475
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,000
you will definitely understand.

476
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,120
You'll clearly know my feelings for you.

477
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,880
So why is it called
"Picked Up a Fragment of a Star"?

478
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,150
Because...

479
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,390
there's a secret you've forgotten,

480
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,670
but I know of it.

481
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,630
Su Nian Qin,
the universe in your heart isn't all dark.

482
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,510
I've picked up a fragment of a star.

483
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,080
So no matter...

484
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,840
where I lose you,

485
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,390
I'll definitely be able to find you.

486
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,800
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

487
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,600
five, four, three, two, one!

488
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,910
Happy New Year, Nian Qin!

489
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,240
Happy New Year.

490
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,840
Okay. I'm going to listen to some songs.

491
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,050
♫The warm sunlight idly crawls
Into the window♫

492
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,690
♫A faint and tipsy scent
Of the aroma of coffee♫

493
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,580
♫Suddenly, you're by my side again♫

494
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,870
♫Smiling as bright as the stars♫

495
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,820
♫Turning to the next page
Of the storybook♫

496
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,179
♫You said the wind will dry the tears
Shed by the clouds♫

497
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,680
Why are you so quiet...

498
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,040
after coming back
from the New Year holidays?

499
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,239
Did I tell you that I need
to give an open lecture?

500
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,040
I'm anxious about it.

501
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,790
Nian Qin,

502
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,960
what do you think students
like to listen to?

503
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,350
Like when you were
in special education school...

504
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,720
as a student,

505
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,760
is there anything that you would like
to learn in particular...

506
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,630
but wasn't taught by the teachers?

507
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,590
I was only in the welfare home
until I was 6.

508
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,829
So the time I spent
in the special education school...

509
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,240
is just around one year.

510
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,720
I don't remember very well anymore.

511
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,390
Just there until you were 6...

512
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,670
Were they good to you?

513
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,960
I mean, the aunties taking care of you.

514
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,960
There's really no good or bad.

515
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,520
Taking care of abandoned kids...

516
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,830
is just a job to them.

517
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,240
It's not because of love from their hearts
or any other feelings.

518
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,240
Of course,
just like how we treat Xiao Wei,

519
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,670
they would have their favourite child.

520
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,960
But for me,

521
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,000
I liked to be alone when I was a child.

522
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,960
I always feel that the world
is really noisy.

523
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,800
Everyone is talking,

524
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,150
but it's none of my business.

525
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,200
I only feel calm...

526
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,150
when music starts playing.

527
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,910
There's the safe feeling
of being wrapped up.

528
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,520
What happened after you turned 6?

529
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,350
I don't want to continue with this topic.

530
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,200
Okay.

531
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,520
Since you've already gotten a boyfriend,

532
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,040
why are you still bringing me
clothes-shopping?

533
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,240
You know why.

534
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,390
I see you cooped up at home
studying every day.

535
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,150
So I brought you out for some fresh air.

536
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,480
That's not it.

537
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,000
I think you just don't want to tire out
that person at home.

538
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,000
By the way,
when you're back home for the New Year,

539
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,870
did you tell your parents
that you're in a relationship?

540
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,870
You should do it soon.

541
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,200
See, our mum has all my messages.

542
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,200
Shouldn't you leave a copy
of all his messages...

543
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,000
with our parents?

544
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,240
Since you're not going home,

545
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,000
if anything happens,

546
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,520
he would be a bigger suspect than I am.

547
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,000
Suspect number one.

548
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,720
Why can't you hope
for something good for me?

549
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,520
Aren't I hoping
for something good for you now?

550
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,120
Let's shop, buy clothes.

551
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,320
What do you think? Do I look good?

552
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,870
No.

553
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,830
You can't even see,
but you're saying it doesn't look good.

554
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,720
Nian Qin,

555
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,000
are there no treatments for your eyes?

556
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,110
No.

557
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,240
It's congenital.

558
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,830
Do you want my eyes to be cured so badly?

559
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,000
Not really.

560
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,680
But if you see what I look like,

561
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,630
you might not date me.

562
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,000
I know that you're a beautiful girl.

563
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,000
How would you know?

564
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,430
I can hear it.

565
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,000
No.

566
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,320
My beauty is incomparable.

567
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,960
Think of it this way.

568
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,830
If I'm not the prettiest,

569
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,240
then I would be the cutest.

570
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,200
If I'm not the cutest,

571
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,820
then I would be the person
who loves you the most.

572
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,830
Since you put it that way,

573
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
now I really want to know...

574
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,350
what the person who loves me the most
looks like.

575
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,990
Come here.

576
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,150
These are my eyebrows. They're messy.

577
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't really like to groom them.

578
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,320
These are my eyes.

579
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't have a lot of lashes,

580
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,110
and my eyes love to tear up,

581
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,870
but my eyesight is perfect.

582
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,910
This is my nose.

583
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,150
It's small.

584
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,960
I have to check to see if there are flaws,
so I can return you.

585
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,150
You want to return me?

586
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,670
No way.

587
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,990
What's up?

588
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,720
Everyone,
including us that are "normal..."

589
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,440
would feel the anxiety that I mentioned...

590
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,720
when interacting with people.

591
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,240
The level of anxiety differs for everyone,

592
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,720
and it's different based
on experience too.

593
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,630
It's unavoidable.

594
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,550
It's not something only you have,

595
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,150
and it doesn't happen
because you're not good enough.

596
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,550
The important thing is that you
should bravely open up your heart,

597
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,150
bravely speak up,

598
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,390
so that people know your thoughts.

599
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,480
That way, you will find...

600
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,590
that the possibilities in our future...

601
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,000
are a lot more than we can imagine.

602
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,760
Okay. That's the end of the lesson.

603
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,680
Dismiss.

604
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,440
All rise.

605
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Goodbye, Miss!

606
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,720
Ms Sang.

607
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,750
Xiao Wei.

608
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,960
Xiao Ling told me
that she saw Mr Su before the class began.

609
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,910
Did you invite him to listen in?

610
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,520
I didn't know that.

611
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,670
But thank you for letting me know.

612
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,350
Go back to your seat.

613
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,460
Let's see.

614
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,220
Xiao Lu, did Nian Qin come to the school?

615
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,240
Yes.

616
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,620
(Sister)

617
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,120
Hello?

618
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,200
Okay.

619
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,430
Please send the flight number to me.

620
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,910
I'm going to start driving. Bye.

621
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,830
Xiao Wei and Xiao Lu
were double witnesses.

622
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,350
Don't deny it.

623
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,630
You slipped away.

624
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,000
You have to help me take a picture.

625
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,680
How are these two things related?

626
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,910
Of course they're related.

627
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,720
You're my boyfriend,

628
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,520
so you need to help me take pictures.

629
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,870
Why do you need a photo?

630
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,910
Because I dressed up differently today.

631
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,590
Just push here later.

632
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,280
Just push when I tell you to.

633
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,750
Push.

634
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,830
Push twice more.

635
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,000
Don't you know that the secret
to taking pictures is to take two more?

636
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,870
Push three more times.

637
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,280
Then?

638
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,630
Then...

639
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,200
have we never taken a picture together?

640
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,520
Let's take a picture together.

641
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,960
Come here.

642
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,800
Don't block, don't block.

643
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,270
Here.

644
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,320
You need to smile.
You look good when you smile.

645
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,200
Look at the camera.

646
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,910
Let me see.

647
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,520
It looks quite good.

648
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,960
Wait a moment.

649
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,960
Hello?

650
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,800
Wu Yan, why are you not home again?

651
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,200
I...

652
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,830
I have something going on in school.

653
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,590
Come back at the end of the month.

654
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,830
Your dad and I
have contacted a high school.

655
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,110
They're looking for a psychology teacher.

656
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,030
Mum...

657
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,520
Bring your resume
and those certificates back.

658
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,240
You need to prepare for it.

659
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,430
There's an interview.

660
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,440
It's inconvenient for me to discuss this
with you now.

661
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,150
I can't talk now. Talk later.

662
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,910
What do you mean inconvenient?

663
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,390
Why have you been sneaking around lately?

664
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,670
Okay, I'm hanging up. Bye bye.

665
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,880
What's wrong?

666
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,830
My mum called.

667
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,200
She told me something about work.
