3
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,076
Wu Yan, are you returning
to your hometown?

4
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,928
Ms Xiao Lu, I know why you're here.

5
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,685
But please don't waste
your energy any more.

6
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:17,860
Wu Yan.

7
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,201
Actually Nian Qin wanted to meet
you immediately the other day.

8
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,867
But his father suddenly had an operation,

9
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,273
so he stayed over at the hospital.

10
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:24,282
But when the operation was over,

11
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,230
he immediately said
he wanted to meet you.

12
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,134
After that day, he felt particularly sad.

13
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,237
He already made his decision...

14
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,550
That's his business.

15
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,320
It has nothing to do with me any more.

16
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,651
Ms Xiao Lu, everyone seeks benefits
and avoids the disadvantages.

17
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,057
So do I.

18
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:42,412
Before this,
I've tried my best to love him.

19
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:44,093
I really did my best.

20
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,270
So now, please let me go.

21
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,527
Hopefully...

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,314
Hopefully he'll find someone
braver than me.

23
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:54,773
My ride is here.

24
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,073
I'll be off now.

25
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,669
The privet flowers
have fallen completely.

26
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,472
I'm home.

27
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,336
What's the matter?

28
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,622
In the end, Wu Yan still went back
to Tongcheng.

29
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,524
She was adamant on leaving.

30
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,340
When she texted me, she said
she'd already boarded the train.

31
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,488
I don't know why all of the sudden...

32
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:02,086
I just got everyone to go perform
at the night market.

33
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:05,527
It's because after the thing
with Wu Yan happened,

34
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,973
honestly I feel very sad.

35
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:15,057
Mr Sang was the kindest person
I've ever met.

36
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,746
He just left us suddenly.

37
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:19,693
When I think about it, I'll...

38
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,456
I don't want myself to feel so sad.

39
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,200
But after they came,

40
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,181
I realized that I wasn't the only one
greatly impacted by Wu Yan's incident.

41
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,179
Surprisingly,
everyone decided to go home.

42
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,099
But I guess it makes sense.

43
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:50,019
Ever since everyone graduated,
so many things happened.

44
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:55,084
It's as if there's a growing distance
between what we originally wanted...

45
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,688
and things that we liked before.

46
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,694
It happens to everyone.

47
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,861
Wu Yan...

48
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,900
Take her for an example.

49
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,279
She may seem like a child who grew up
in a happy family,

50
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,051
but she faces hardships too.

51
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,036
She has to face reality as well,
doesn't she?

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,332
It must be the same
for Liu Lei and the rest.

53
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,542
They've got to make plans
for their future after all.

54
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:21,765
Future?

55
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:24,350
It's about that again.

56
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,921
Of course.

57
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,708
Try to think about it.

58
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,732
Have you every wondered what
everyone will be doing at the age of 30?

59
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,386
Will everyone still be playing in band?

60
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,666
What else could it be?

61
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,267
That's right.

62
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:40,614
I almost forgot.

63
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,394
You were the earliest to leave.

64
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,103
Right from the start, you'd always felt
that this was unrealistic.

65
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,796
That's not how I feel.

66
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:52,150
It's just that I realised from the start
that I can't afford to be like you.

67
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,316
It's still the same for me.

68
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:59,032
Not everyone gets to live
a satisfactory life.

69
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,557
Everyone has just been making decisions
based on their respective circumstances.

70
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,718
You don't have to feel
uneasy simply because others...

71
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,163
have chosen a different path.

72
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,906
What then?
Just go our separate ways like you said?

73
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,943
What about us then?
Our decisions are different too.

74
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,435
Let's calm down and try this another time.

75
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,674
There you go again. Once we quarrel,
you'll say that we should cool off.

76
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,745
-Then it never gets settled eventually.
-What else can we do?

77
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,122
So I don't even have the rights
to keep calm now?

78
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:28,757
Please.

79
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,196
I'm not like you.

80
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:34,725
I face reality every day by staying calm
in order to resolve the problems.

81
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:35,955
What about you?

82
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:38,186
Can't you be more realistic?

83
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:40,465
Just a little will do.

84
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:41,853
Can't you?

85
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:45,077
Alright, I understand now.

86
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,859
I have to remind you again.

87
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,228
According to the detailed test report,

88
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,796
although you're considered very lucky,

89
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,147
but cases of patients accepting
the operation after coming of age...

90
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,747
are really rare.

91
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,460
To be honest with you,

92
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:24,326
the operation success rate
is extremely low.

93
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,747
Furthermore,

94
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:33,150
there is no saying about
your recovery progress...

95
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,781
of your post-operation sight.

96
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,680
It can even cause other
pathological changes...

97
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,713
after the undergoing the operation.

98
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:44,820
Are you sure of taking these risks?

99
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm sure.

100
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
(Ophthalmology)

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,519
Actually from a medical standpoint,

102
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,509
your condition
doesn't necessitate a treatment.

103
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:57,627
I understand.

104
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:58,987
In my own view,

105
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:02,309
I don't consider myself disabled
and in need of treatment.

106
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,001
But do you know, doctor?

107
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:07,959
Someone once told me that
she admired my eyes.

108
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,633
But she also said that
it would be nice if she had someone...

109
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,864
to share that scenery together with.

110
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:15,883
Before this,

111
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,647
it's true that I never wanted to see,
nor to be seen by others.

112
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:22,396
That was the only way for me
to fend myself from everything else.

113
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:23,994
But right now,

114
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:29,180
I want to know
how the world she sees looks like.

115
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,196
Although I may never see her again.

116
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,085
Doctor.

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,625
Please help me.

118
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,585
I never thought we'd be back here...

119
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,500
just after a couple of days.

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,763
I, too, wasn't expecting...

121
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:53,678
that they'd find a suitable cornea
so swiftly.

122
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:54,921
(403 operation room)

123
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,684
That's because you didn't know
how hard we've been looking for it.

124
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,229
Not long after you signed up
for the waiting list,

125
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,180
your father got to know about it.

126
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:05,340
When he realized you haven't found a donor
while his days were short,

127
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,328
so he quickly signed the donation form.

128
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,790
Surprisingly, the hospital informed us
so soon that a match has been found.

129
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,494
Doctor, we'll go in now.

130
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,562
Thanks, senior.

131
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:37,065
You're welcome.
We're from the same hometown.

132
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:40,560
Once you've settled down, don't forget
to let me know about it.

133
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,586
I definitely will. Senior, when you're
free another day I'll treat you to a meal.

134
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,935
Sure, maybe a few days later.

135
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:47,200
I've got quite a lot of work
at the moment.

136
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,731
Alright, you don't have to see me off.

137
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:49,737
Okay, I'll contact you later.

138
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,898
Great.

139
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,439
Hello. Will you be getting off
work early today?

140
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,910
How about this? I'll go to meet you.

141
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,707
There's something I want to tell you.

142
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,349
From today onwards,
I'll be joining everyone else...

143
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,072
as a fellow worker.

144
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,361
As for those times in the band,
I thank everyone for it.

145
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,194
Tonight's on me.
Drink as much as you please.

146
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:35,894
I'll be in charge of your ride home.

147
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:40,091
I can't believe you actually
got yourself a job.

148
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,509
Since you did this,

149
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,494
I can no longer brag to my colleagues
that I know someone...

150
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:49,051
who is extremely stubborn
and persistent on living his dreams.

151
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,387
Dude.

152
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,694
Do you have to dress up like him?

153
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,451
Like a computer repair guy.

154
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,260
I'll be repairing computers after all.

155
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,266
If that's the case,
let's forget all about it.

156
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,649
It's not a bad idea.

157
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:09,962
Cheers.

158
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:12,477
May everyone have a bright future.

159
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,144
He said that he'll send us back
but he ends up drunk instead.

160
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,682
We'll head home now.

161
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,590
Xu Qian, he did it all for you.

162
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,309
Should the day come when he can no longer
keep up with you,

163
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,190
talk it through.

164
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,530
Try not to hurt him too much.

165
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,659
You drank a lot. Head home quick.

166
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:54,657
We had to drink that much
in order to forget everything.

167
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,036
I'll get you a glass of water.

168
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,077
Xu Qian.

169
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,175
Come home with me, will you?

170
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:30,012
Wei Hao.

171
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,895
Why did you take that job?

172
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:35,342
You don't even like going to work.

173
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,991
Isn't that what you want?

174
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,436
What I want?

175
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:49,346
I never wanted you to change yourself
for me.

176
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,710
Being yourself is enough.

177
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,090
There's no need for you
to unwillingly make a change for me.

178
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,279
Am I not doing it for you after all?

179
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,547
You want stability.
I work hard to become more stable.

180
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:13,654
The reason I want to go home
is also because your grandma...

181
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,925
needs someone to look after her too,
doesn't she?

182
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,674
Stop making decisions on your own.

183
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,383
I've never asked you to
take care of my grandma.

184
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:22,680
Xu Qian.

185
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,027
Why won't you accept my heart?

186
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,896
Fine.

187
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,180
Tell me what you want.

188
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,261
It's not about what I want.

189
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:34,804
I've never wanted anything to happen.

190
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,812
You did those things solely
based on your own decisions.

191
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,934
I should be the one asking you
what you want.

192
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,436
Let's get married.

193
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,179
I can't get married,

194
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,342
nor return home.

195
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,296
You should know very well that
I've always wanted to leave that place.

196
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,637
I spent so much effort
graduating out of that place.

197
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,127
I can't go back there.

198
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,535
Wei Hao, stop being foolish.

199
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,075
Marriage or going back home...

200
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:19,396
can't resolve the issues between us.

201
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,481
What issues do we have?

202
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,313
I don't think we have any.

203
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,436
You're always so naive.
You think that everything is simple.

204
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,040
But the world isn't like that.

205
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,805
Fine.

206
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,789
Do whatever you want.

207
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,534
I'll go home by myself.

208
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,265
I'm leaving now.

209
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,348

00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,465
why Xiao Lu is taking so long
with the doctor.

266

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,283
They're fine.

269
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:54,541
Why did you suddenly decide
to have the operation?

270
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,641
It has such a high risk,

271
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,053
yet you never discussed it with me.

272
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,560
I'll bear the risks
as they're my own eyes.

273
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,713
How about you?

274
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:12,094
Are you feeling better?

275
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:18,065
It doesn't really matter.

276
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,849
The doctor said that
I might be bed-ridden after this.

277
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,296
But don't worry.

278
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:29,404
I'm not going to force you
to inherit the family business.

279
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:33,150
You can continue the life
you're living now.

280
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,942
I'll come home.

281
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:37,361
I'll take charge of the company.

282
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,614
What makes you think that...

283
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,843
you can return home whenever you want?

284
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,045
Fine then. A dime a dozen.

285
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,105
Last time you said that...

286
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,353
you're bringing home someone
you're marrying.

287
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,493
Where is she?

288
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,926
She doesn't want me anymore.

289
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:47,512
Nian Qin. I heard my sister say
you're going home?

290
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:49,030
How was the chat just now?

291
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,796
Why did you suddenly agree to it?

292
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,386
Nothing much.

293
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,312
I just decided to go home.

294
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,488
If that's the case,

295
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,066
will you and your father...

296
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,247
No.

297
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,557
With the state that we're both in now,
how can we possibly fight?

298
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,696
I've just confirmed with the doctor.

299
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:14,117
We can remove the bandage in three days.

300
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:15,795
Are you excited?

301
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,168
It's sunset now, isn't it?

302
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:35,567
Do you know why
I like to listen to the broadcast?

303
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,958
It's because I hate sunsets.

304
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:44,203
Watching the sun disappear bit by bit,

305
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:46,215
a day is over again.

306
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:48,093
Things end up unfinished once more.

307
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,108
Closing my eyes,

308
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:52,396
putting on my earphones and
listening to the broadcast.

309
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,686
I open my eyes after a while.

310
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,449
The sky has turned dark.

311
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,429
Another long night has arrived
for me to waste again.

312
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,628
Mother came to visit once again.

313
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,613
I didn't need to raise my head up
to know it was her.

314
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,472
Where there's sunlight,

315
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,373
brightness isn't the only
important thing.

316
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,234
The warmth matters as well.

317
00:23:51,314 --> 00:23:52,354
Do you feel it?

318
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,250
Continue ahead, go.

319
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,528
Alright, stop.

320
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,478
Get ready to turn right.

321
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,491
Let me see.

322
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:55,575
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

323
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:57,027
Walk about seven steps.

324
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:57,999
Go.

325
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,031
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, stop.

326
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,783
Make a left turn.

327
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:06,115
Go forward.

328
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,376
Alright, stop, stop.

329
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,166
Okay, you can put it down now.

330
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,570
A little more to the left.

331
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,770
Alright.

332
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,493
What is in this photo?

333
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,625
It's something that I really like.

334
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,900
But you really can't see it.

335
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:34,501
It's such a pity.

336
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,439
I really like it.

337
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,269
What are you doing?

338
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:47,737
I...

339
00:25:47,817 --> 00:25:50,215
It looks so nice. I really like it.

340
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,254
Only a really good looking man
can put on such a nice colour.

341
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:15,702
I want to see it now.

342
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,333
Put it on for me, will you?

343
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,119
What colour did you get?

344
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:24,186
The kind that you usually wear.

345
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,252
White.

346
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:28,293
Then don't forget to label it for me.

347
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:29,492
I will, I will.

350
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,088
Did you see any photos of Wu Yan?

351
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,336
I remember we took a picture together.

352
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:13,250
No, I didn't.

353
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,816
The last time I came,
I found a broken frame...

354
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,259
but without picture.

355
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,554
Then have you seen a GoPro?

356
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,732
No.

357
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,702
I'm going out.

358
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,223
What about this feeling of the wind
and the sunlight touching your face?

359
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:02,654
What's the matter?

360
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,631
Nothing.

361
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,166
It's just that...

362
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:08,287
it'd be great if such
a beautiful scenery...

363
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,730
could be shared with someone.

364
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,268

How is your mum doing?

367
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:41,386
She's fine.

368
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,349
She's tired after acting out.
She's asleep now.

Wu Yan.

370
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:47,228
Your mum still seems to think that
your dad is still around.

371
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:49,533
Are you sure she doesn't need
a checkup at the hospital?

372
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:53,031
We'll see again after some time.

373
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:55,813
Maybe she's overwhelmed by sadness.

374
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,348
She needs time.

375
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,326
What about you? Are you okay?

376
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,663
I'm fine. How else could I be?

377
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:07,075
I'm a young healthy adult. I'm fine.

378
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:09,447
I almost forgot.

379
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:12,648
You're looking for a part time job
at a radio station, right?

380
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,603
I happen to found one. How about this?

381
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:17,118
I'll forward the message to you.

382
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,817
He's a director
for a small radio station here.

383
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:22,538
You'll just have to contact him yourself.

384
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,588
Thanks.

385
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:35,078
Luckily, the board of directors
didn't give you a hard time.

386
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,036
Even if they did, it doesn't matter.

387
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,062
After all, I've returned
and RD belongs to the Su Family.

388
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:45,386
So that's that.

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,926
Anyone can be ruthless like that.

390
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:54,436
You used to complain that
I stink of money.

Now it's your turn.

392
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,953
Wei Lan has prepared a teacher for you
to learn business from the beginning.

393
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,047
Learning that alone is enough
to make you suffer.

394
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,037
Alright.

395
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,181
Nian Qin, I've something to tell you.

396
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:37,956
I heard that...

397
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,773

We're a small radio station.

402
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:53,361
We're seriously understaffed.

403
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:55,587
Usually the night shift is
handled by just one person.

404
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,227
There won't be a radio director.

405
00:31:57,307 --> 00:32:01,433
Plus, a lady working alone
all night long, won't it be dangerous?

406
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:02,697
It won't be a problem.

407
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,120
I can manage it alone.

408
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,342
I have to take care of my mother
during the day.

409
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,742
Well then... Next Monday.

410
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:12,860
You start work next Monday night then.

sounds quite plain.

So this is his final song then?

Acquired.

477
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,901
My father was a foreman.

478
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:50,204
When I was two years old,
he had an accident at the workshop.

479
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:51,657
He went blind.

480
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,221
He's considered lucky then.

481
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:59,123

they said the accident was
due to his own mishandling.

489
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:25,540
After coming out of the hospital,
he couldn't find a job for a long time.

490
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,199
He then started drinking.

491
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,574
When he was drunk, he would hit my mum.

00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:31,575
After he sobered up,

493
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:34,216
only then he'd go down on his knees,
begging my mum not to leave.

494
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:36,052
He'd repent every time,

495
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,128
but continued to do it.

496
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,540
And later on?

497
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,821
When I was almost ten years old,

498
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:45,990
my mum divorced him.

499
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:48,221
She remarried, bringing me along.

500
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,848
You start work next Monday.

501
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,187
You may go now.

502
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,096
Okay.

503
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,178
How about this, grandma?

504
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,125
You take a bite and I'll take one too.

505
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:25,741
Let's see who's eaten the most.

506
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:26,841
Here.

507
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:29,126
Here.

508
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:32,068
I'll take a bite too.

509
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,194
Look, grandma.

510
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,466
Xu Qian is back.

511
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,354
Didn't you complain that
nothing tasted nice the other day?

512
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,374
I bought you your favourite
canned yellow peaches in syrup.

513
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,990
Wu Yan, thank you.

514
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,733
You must be very busy.
Yet you came all the way here.

515
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:15,790
It's fine.

516
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:19,773
The entrance exam is
something pretty manageable for me.

517
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,324
Plus, I'm here to replace Wei Hao.

518
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,085
He's working overtime so he couldn't come.

519
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:28,599
How could he simply
trouble others for this?

520
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,614
The both of us are close
so there's nothing troublesome at all.

521
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:33,361
I understand.

522
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:34,756
But it's none of his business...

523
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,200
in the very first place.

524
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:41,278
The way things are now for you two
is uncalled for.

525
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,524
I really don't get it.

526
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:47,472
Things turned out this way
because he wanted to go home.

527
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,800
But from my perspective,
it isn't really a big deal.

528
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,873
Just think for a moment.

529
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:54,137
Back then he said he wanted to marry me.

530
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,606
Wu Yan, let's get married.

531
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,585
For someone like me,

532
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:04,697
how can I possibly get married?

533
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,765
What should I tell his parents then?

534
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:09,586
The truth?

535
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:12,543
That I don't have a father...

536
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,970
and I have a mother
who's following men around?

537
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,446
Plus I have a grandma to take care of?

538
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:20,877
You can see it yourself.

539
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:23,303
What of kind of situation this is.

540
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,604
A young lady like me sounds terrifying.

541
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:26,691
Doesn't it?

542
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,063
There you go,

543
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,112
saying stuff like this again.

544
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:32,983
Because that's the truth.

545
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:36,090
The truth that will follow me forever.

546
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:48,478
What's wrong?

547
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:49,552
Nothing.

548
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:51,955
I'm just a little unfamiliar with this.

549
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:53,640
If this happened back then,

550
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,105
you'd jumped at me
and start giving me a lecture.

551
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:57,720
Back then...

552
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,858
Back then I was less matured.

553
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:03,113
Wu Yan.

554
00:41:03,193 --> 00:41:04,771
Can I ask you a question?

555
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:10,340
Do you still...

556
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,981
think of him sometimes?

557
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:17,355
It's so cold.

558
00:41:20,692 --> 00:41:21,888
Brain freeze.

559
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:24,663
Wu Yan.

560
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,888
Recently, I've been thinking of quitting
and going back home.

561
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:29,752
Are you serious?

562
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:30,970
Yes.

563
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:33,620
Three years have passed.

564
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,203
I've worked hard.

565
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,226
As a human being,

566
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,801
there's no point in
giving yourself a hard time.

567
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,529
If you want, then just come back.

568
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,944
I'm always here after all.

569
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:48,951
So is Wei Hao.

570
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:58,210
I'm already inside.

571
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,660
My dear Lady Cheng.
Don't worry about me, okay?

572
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,457
Tongcheng is my hometown.

573
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:19,217
Just allow me to be a hospitable host
and look after you, please?

574
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:20,429
If I were to wait for you,

575
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:22,401
I'd probably be done
by the time you arrive.

576
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,603
So I'll talk to you later, alright?

577
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:31,777
I'm hanging up now, bye.

578
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,977
Mum, after moving in with Cheng Yin,

579
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:49,908
I probably won't be able
to always come and visit you.

580
00:42:49,988 --> 00:42:51,712
Plus for this semester,

581
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:55,862
the research project needs to be finalized
and I'll have to start on my thesis paper.

582
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:59,366
But once I'm free,
I'll definitely come home to visit you.

583
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,342
You just do you.

584
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:03,347
Why are you rambling so much?

585
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,573
Wu Yan, I really don't need you
to look after me.

586
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:25,332
I feel free being on my own.

587
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:27,568
I don't need anyone to look after me.

588
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,869
Just go wherever you want to.

589
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,116
But I can't go back now.

590
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,982
This is my home.

591
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:55,038
If I don't come back here,
where else can I go?

592
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:56,935
Why is this small old lady keep...

593
00:43:57,015 --> 00:43:59,218
trying to kick her daughter
out of her house?

594
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:01,460
My dear daughter.

595
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,751
You think I will want you to pay rent
when you have a house to come back to?

596
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:08,227
I'm doing this to support
young people like you.

597
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:10,162
Isn't this the life concept...

598
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:14,506
you wanted when you kept telling me that
you wanted freedom in your life?

599
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:16,755
Okay, you're the best, the best of all.
