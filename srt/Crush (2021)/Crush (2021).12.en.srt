(The Biography of Romain Rolland)

4
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,700
(Decisive Moments in History)

5
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,470
It's the temperature.

6
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,670
When there's sunshine,

7
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,670
what's crucial is not merely the light,

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,950
warmth is important too.

9
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,200
Do you feel it?

10
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,620
The Little Prince

11
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,030
I had dinner with Mr Li today.

12
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,490
We talked about that band
you were listening to.

13
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,150
Mr Li wants to sign them.

14
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,820
He also asked,

15
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,390
when you will be releasing new music.

16
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
See how it goes.

17
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,950
By the way,

18
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,079
as for the radio ads recording
you accepted earlier,

19
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,800
please spare some time and get it done.

20
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,800
Is it the one Xi talked about?

21
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,930
Yes.

22
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,880
It was supposed to take place

23
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,680
at the radio station
as editing is required.

24
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
But, you are reluctant to move around.

25
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
Well, I have informed them that

26
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,600
we will get it done in our studio,

27
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,880
and send them the recording.

28
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,390
Just do it there.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,870
I mean the radio station.

30
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,380
The Silver Linings Playbook

31
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,440
Why hasn't Su Nian Qin
come and pick me up?

32
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,030
I told them to get ready.

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,200
Wu Yan.

34
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,110
Guess who will come this afternoon?

35
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Bradley Cooper.

36
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,959
Forget it, it doesn’t matter.

37
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,399
it's Yi Jin.

38
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
Xi just told me.

39
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,270
It is for the public service ads.

40
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,990
His agent agreed.

41
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
i thought the previous arrangement was

42
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,840
just a short recording from his end.

43
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,190
This morning,

44
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,800
his agent called up out of the blue,

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,080
said Yi Jin is coming over to do it.

46
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,470
Finally I have a chance to meet him.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,430
But, Zhong Cheng said...

48
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,150
he is a very reserved person.

49
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,150
Reserved? Really?

50
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,490
It's just an ads recording.

51
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,640
Is this grand meet-and-greet necessary?

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,120
These people are here for Yi Jin.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
Well, well, well.

54
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,960
Seems like he is doing better

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
without me.

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Fine.

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,470
What an idiot.

58
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,360
How could I feel hurt

59
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,870
in just a few days time?

60
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,990
No.

61
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,840
God has heard me.

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,960
Let him hurt for a few more days.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
Let him hurt badly.

64
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,750
Long time no see.

65
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,550
He seems cordial with the chief.

66
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
Is he doing it on purpose?

67
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,990
Well, that's great.

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,800
Sang Wu Yan.

69
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,310
Why are you standing still over there?

70
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,030
Hurry up and serve water to our guest.

71
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,840
Can I have your autograph, Mr Yi Jin?

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,840
When will you release new songs?

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,150
Is it possible for Mr Yi Jin

74
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,270
to be the guest of our program for once?

75
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,310
-Yes.
-Exactly.

76
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Water is ready.

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
-What’s going on?
-I have no idea at all.

78
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,710
As for guest appearance in your show,

79
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,550
just speak to my agent will do.

80
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,030
Wu Yan.

81
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,800
Are you getting

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Mr Yi Jin's autograph?

83
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,780
If you are,

84
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,380
could you please help me as well?

85
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,080
Mr Yi Jin, sign this.

86
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,840
It's just a post-it note.

87
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,430
Just go ahead and sign it.

88
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,990
I hurt my hand.

89
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,750
Sorry, we'll do it next time.

90
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,990
Let's leave.

91
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,120
We've waited for such a long time.

92
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll excuse myself first, Wu Yan.

93
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,870
I need to talk to Nie Xi.

94
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,430
to find out why they haven't started.

95
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,469
Wu Yan.

96
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,749
I just want to check with you.

97
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,990
Do you really want to eat at the canteen?

98
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,030
It is not nutritious at all.

99
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,430
Why not we have a meal together?

100
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,310
After that, we can go for a movie.

101
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,960
Is that western restaurant great?

102
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,800
Actually, I've never been there before.

103
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,550
The online review is good though.

104
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,670
I can eat beef to
my heart's content, right?

105
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Beef?

106
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,590
Of course.

107
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,560
It's a steakhouse,

108
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,040
so it's a place to enjoy beef.

109
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,310
But, it's too late for movie after dinner.

110
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,750
It's not convenient for me to go home.

111
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
Don’t worry about it.

112
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,750
I will drive you home.

113
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,760
-Really?
-Yes.

114
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,270
Then you are really the lucky one.

115
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:20,880
Let me tell you,

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,720
that friend of mine is...

117
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,990
Sang Wu Yan.

118
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,270
Follow me home.

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,110
No way.

120
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,720
Mr Yi Jin.

121
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,480
Can we talk?

122
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,070
I don't know if there's anything Wu Yan
did wrong.

123
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Why not I apologize to you on her behalf?

124
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:56,820
What's going on?

125
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,500
Yi Jin

126
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,400
Why are you giving me this?

127
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,550
I don't need it.

128
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,350
Aren't you the one who said,

129
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,510
once the label is attached,
it becomes a personal belonging?

130
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,520
When did I...

131
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,630
Then you should write your own name.

132
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,390
You wrote the stage name here,

133
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,790
as if I'm an autograph seeker.

134
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,150
Don't you know it's lengthy

135
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,350
to write my name in Braille?

136
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,790
It will not fit your forehead.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
Hey, Su Nian Qin.

138
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,080
You are so cute.

139
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,070
Shut up.

140
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,510
How dare you tell me to shut up!

141
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,710
You are asking the person whom

142
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,430
you pursued with great effort to shut up?

143
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,750
Su Nian Qin, haven't you
figured out what going on here?

144
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,310
Do you feel it?

145
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,280
This is how your name is written.

146
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,310
Stop making trouble.

147
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,550
I like it that way.

148
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,910
He came to the station suddenly.

149
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,080
Isn't it because...

150
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,310
Yes.

151
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,870
It's obvious, isn't it?

152
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,790
Recently,

153
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,990
it seems he has reached puberty.

154
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,750
Are you okay?

155
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,060
Team Leader's Office

156
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
Come in.

157
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,550
Are you looking for me, sir?

158
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,910
The roadshow proposal next Wednesday,

159
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,750
you will be our representative.

160
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
Me?

161
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,390
What's wrong?

162
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,030
You want a leave to handle school matters?

163
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,430
No, I...

164
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,550
But, my...

165
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,830
I know.

166
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,920
You feel inferior
for not having a professional background.

167
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,230
You lack confidence.

168
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,190
You are just a listener in meetings.

169
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,000
But, since you have

170
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,150
taken this job offer,

171
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,750
you decided to pursue this career,

172
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,110
I hope you can be more confident soon.

173
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,350
Non-professionals
can become professionals.

174
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,760
Go for tuition whenever necessary.

175
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,920
Get the necessary certifications.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,630
No matter which industry you're from,

177
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,310
after all, it's about your ability.

178
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,840
Sure, I will be well prepared.

179
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,880
That's all.

180
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,880
You may go to work now.

181
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,710
Thank you, sir.

182
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,560
I believe most likely our team leader

183
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,870
is offering Xu Qian a permanent position.

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,270
What? She is just an undergraduate.

185
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,710
She is not from our major either.

186
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,200
That's a big difference.

187
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,520
You got master degree abroad,

188
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
there's nothing to be afraid of.

189
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,070
If she's like what you described,

190
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,760
how did she manage to join the company?

191
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,710
If she's able to join,

192
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,430
maybe there is a way for her to stay on.

193
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm completely clueless.

194
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,360
She was appointed to submit the proposal,

195
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,910
that's really strange.

196
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,470
This is a great opportunity to showcase

197
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,160
your skills in front of the boss.

198
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,220
Exactly.

199
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,830
I asked team leader about the headcount.

200
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,880
He said there's a budget slash this year.

201
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,780
The headcount is uncertain.

202
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,400
Okay.

203
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,790
Good. See you then.

204
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,870
Thanks, Xiao Lu.

205
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,550
Bye.

206
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,710
Face reader?

207
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,280
So? What did she say?

208
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,760
Is it

209
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,790
negative feedback for our music?

210
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,840
Xiao Lu said,

211
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,990
Galaxy Records

212
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,920
may be interested to sign us.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,910
There's an audition next Wednesday.

214
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,040
What did he say?

215
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,720
That means

216
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,110
our dream might be coming true.

217
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,870
We'll become a professional band.

218
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
We'll be able to make money through music.

219
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,400
That means

220
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,840
I may not need to go to work anymore.

221
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,880
What a surprise!

222
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,920
Once-in-a-lifetime!

223
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm becoming a singer soon.

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,030
We are singers!

225
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,630
What am I?

226
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,840
We are singers now!

227
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,510
You came just at the right time.

228
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,600
I have good news.

229
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
Galaxy Records just called us.

230
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,890
We are going for an audition.

231
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,430
I won’t be joining.

232
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,650
Keep it up, guys!

233
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,600
What's wrong, girl?

234
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,160
Are you leaving the band?

235
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,320
An audition with a big company

236
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,480
is definitely about singing commercially.

237
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,430
I need to work regularly.

238
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,550
I can’t be a singer like you all.

239
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,600
So...

240
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,680
Why must you work in such a way?

241
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,990
What is stopping you?

242
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,710
Let them talk to each other first.

243
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,160
No, Xu Qian.

244
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,440
You're thinking too far ahead.

245
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,600
Just stay present.

246
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,030
Let's go for the audition first.

247
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,720
We will talk about the outcome later.

248
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,200
I have a roadshow proposal at that time.

249
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
After all,

250
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,590
it's not about the time-clash.

251
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,390
-It's that we...
-That's not a big deal at all.

252
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,490
I'll speak to Xiao Lu again.

253
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,160
Just reschedule the audition will do.

254
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,550
Wei Hao.

255
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,110
Why can't you look just a step forward?

256
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,270
Think about this.

257
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,470
If we pass the audition,

258
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,710
and they want to sign a contract with us,

259
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,790
I can't proceed.

260
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,280
Won't that end in disbandment too?

261
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,160
I enjoyed singing with you all.

262
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,880
I really want to perform with you

263
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,480
during the graduation party.

264
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,920
But,

265
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,790
hobbies and livelihood,

266
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
they are basically two different things.

267
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,360
It's true.

268
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,920
I reiterate what i said earlier.

269
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,340
We are about to graduate.

270
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,740
It's time to be wake up

271
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,310
and plan for the future.

272
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,880
What are you doing?

273
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,600
Xiao Lu has asked someone to fix it.

274
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,120
It’s mine now.

275
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
Isn’t it nice?

276
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,950
It's too big for you.

277
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,910
Women wearing men watches is a trend now.

278
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,030
It's cool.

279
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,030
As long as you like it.

280
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,110
Isn't this your apology gift?

281
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,510
Of course I have to accept it.

282
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,700
Mother

283
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,990
Hello.

284
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,200
Your mother called?

285
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,680
I checked my phone.

286
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,840
My mother's call was answered.

287
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,720
You took the call?

288
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,510
What did she say?

289
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,550
Nothing much.

290
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,200
She was asking about

291
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,480
your dissertation defence.

292
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,480
Wu Yan.

293
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,000
Is there anything

294
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,840
you wish to tell me?

295
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,270
I don't think so.

296
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,560
Oh, yes.

297
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,720
When I played on
your precious piano earlier,

298
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,980
I was getting impatient

299
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,820
and kicked it twice.

300
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,550
-What?
-I was so scared.

301
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,480
But then I thought,

302
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,430
surely this precious piano

303
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,080
can't be more important than me, right?

304
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
Wu Yan.

305
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
I don't think

306
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,360
I've asked you this before.

307
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,320
Are you really

308
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,030
not bothered by my blindness?

309
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,840
I envy you instead.

310
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,960
You have a pair of eyes

311
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,960
that are pure, pristine, untainted

312
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,600
by the unavoidable things out there.

313
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,240
I really like your eyes.

314
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,150
Nian Qin.

315
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,910
I don’t think I've asked you this.

316
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,910
Why do you want to be a songwriter?

317
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,120
Haven't you guessed it long time ago?

318
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,200
Is that so?

319
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,360
Although I can't see the world,

320
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,360
but I want all people to notice me.

321
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,840
without knowing who I am.

322
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,900
Come to think of it,

323
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,160
it is also a kind of revenge.

324
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,120
Liar.

325
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,640
You don't have the heart to do it.

326
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,830
What?

327
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Nothing.

328
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,080
I think such revenge

329
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,790
is really cool.

330
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,550
Let me practice now.

331
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,400
Wu Yan.

332
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,360
Wait a minute.

333
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,700
Rhythm will be wrong if you play this way.

334
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,640
Haven't I taught you before?

335
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,620
Place your fingers like holding an egg.

336
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,870
Wait a minute.

337
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,360
Let's not pick this up.

338
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,080
For ordinary people,

339
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,720
how long does it take to master a song?

340
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,660
Everyone has different skills.

341
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,710
Some may take three years,

342
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,720
some may accomplish it in just a few days

343
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,200
What about me?

344
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,760
It's hard to tell.

345
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,760
Then I don't want to learn any more.

346
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,800
Mainly because you seem

347
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,480
to be in pain to teach.

348
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,430
It's nothing compared
to your pain of learning.

349
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,480
I want to showcase to students

350
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,200
in my last class

351
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,270
and bid farewell in elegance.

352
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,600
Well, they don't have the chance now.

353
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,440
Today

354
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,270
is my last class.

355
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,320
Of course,

356
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,360
I'll still go for the outing tomorrow.

357
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,100
I'll be back frequently to see you.

358
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,390
Thank you very much.

359
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,270
I thoroughly enjoyed

360
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,600
spending time with all of you.

361
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,760
Thank you for
helping me grow a great deal.

362
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,840
Thank you.

363
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
All rise.

364
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,480
Thank you, Miss Sang.

365
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,550
You don't seem to be in bad mood.

366
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,430
-I thought...
-It's not a permanent goodbye.

367
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm joining them for the outing tomorrow.

368
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,120
What about Xiao Lu?
Hasn't she arrived yet?

369
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,810
She is busy with something.

370
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,930
Oh, I see.

371
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,600
Let's take a taxi home.

372
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,760
Wu Yan.

373
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,430
I'm thinking

374
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,150
maybe we can take the bus?

375
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,320
You want to

376
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
take the bus with me?

377
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,310
It's boring to take a bus.

378
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,960
Let's loiter together.

379
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,120
This is how my parents fell in love.

380
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,290
-Are you humming, Su Nian Qin?
-No.

381
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,510
Obviously you did. I heard it.

382
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,990
You sing very well.

383
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,550
You're pitch is perfect.

384
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,270
Because I never learned to be out of tune.

385
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,510
Then you can sing your own composition.

386
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,760
No.

387
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
Will you sing for me?

388
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,150
No.

389
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,790
Sing for me, please.

390
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,720
No.

391
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,360
Just sing.

392
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,760
I worry that you wouldn't
even order delivery when you're busy.

393
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,430
So I brought it for you.

394
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,150
Now I'm relieved.

395
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,480
I'd better get going.

396
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,030
I still hope you'll attend tomorrow.

397
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,880
I will wait for you.

398
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,510
Don’t wait any more, just start.

399
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,880
No.

400
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,910
Wei Hao, I understand what you think,

401
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,750
but we can start first

402
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,510
-while waiting for Xu Qian.
-I said no.

403
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,880
She is not here.

404
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,830
Our band is incomplete.

405
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,430
Don't force him.

406
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,960
What's the use of arguing?

407
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,270
Up to you then.

408
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,550
I'm sorry.

409
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,910
Please wait for a little longer.

410
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,340
Wei Hao: We're here waiting for you

411
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,080
Xu Qian.

412
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,000
It's our turn.

413
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,580
Line up, students.

414
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,270
Come this way.

415
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,150
Watch your steps.

416
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,910
Come, line up properly.

417
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,110
One, two, one, come over.

418
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,210
Follow my pace and walk forward.

419
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,150
Line up properly.

420
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,360
Do you smell the scent of grass?

421
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,670
What about the sound of the lake?

422
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,230
The feeling of wind blowing in the face?

423
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,420
Sun ray on the face?

424
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,760
What's wrong?

425
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,240
Nothing.

426
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm just thinking,

427
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,450
wouldn't it be great if I'm not enjoying

428
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,080
this beautiful scenery alone.

429
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,390
Let's have our meal first.

430
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,480
Xiao Lu has left,

431
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,750
but we are still here.

432
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,840
It's awkward.

433
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,360
It's my fault.

434
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm sorry.

435
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,240
You all leave first.

436
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,540
I'll wait for her.

437
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,790
Sure.

438
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,030
Just continue what you're doing.

439
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,200
I'll excuse myself first.

440
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Don't be in such a hurry.

441
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,430
Wei Hao.

442
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,080
Whatever happened between you and Xu Qian,

443
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,960
that's your own business.

444
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,800
We are not in the position to comment.

445
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,240
But, this time round,

446
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,030
you've hurt your buddies.

447
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,240
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

448
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,960
You go back first,

449
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,790
I've to look for something at the park.

450
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,840
Mr Lee.

451
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,150
Could you bring them back first?

452
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,800
I need to search for my lost item here.

453
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,840
Sorry for troubling you.

454
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,240
-Wu Yan.
-Wu Yan.

455
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,520
Xiao Wei.

456
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,880
Go back with Mr Lee and the rest.

457
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,240
I'll visit you when I'm free.

458
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,580
Okay.

459
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
Mr Lee.

460
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,480
Mr Su.

461
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,870
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,230
Could you help me look after Xiao Wei?

463
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,360
I have to look for her.

464
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
Alright.

465
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,070
Hey lady.

466
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,480
What are you doing here?

467
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,110
Hello.

468
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,870
May i ask

469
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,560
if there is loss and found corner
in this park?

470
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,720
I lost something.

471
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,910
I just came from the management office.

472
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,860
We did not receive

473
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,240
any lost item today.

474
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,630
Is there any other place

475
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,760
I could look for it?

476
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,450
I may have dropped it on the floor.

477
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,890
It's possible that the cleaner
swept it off unintentionally.

478
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,960
Why don't you
check it out at the recycle corner.

479
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,150
The garbage today

480
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,480
is still around.

481
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,480
Is it?

482
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,600
Thank you.

483
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,000
-Garbage.
-Wu Yan.

484
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,550
Why are you here?

485
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,670
How could you ask me to leave by myself?

486
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,150
I'm looking for something urgently.

487
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,870
It takes time to locate it.

488
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,590
Then you should let me stay by your side.

489
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,170
Why do you always make me worry?

490
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,560
Just wait for me here, okay?

491
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,390
I will be back soon. Please wait for me.

492
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
Hey...

493
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,510
Where is it?

494
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,910
Where did it go?

495
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,080
Haven't I told you not to come over?

496
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,720
You're a clean freak.

497
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,790
Why are you here?

498
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,300
Why are you disobedient?

499
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,310
Stop searching.

500
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,080
What is so important?

501
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,200
Can't we just buy a new one?

502
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,720
There's no way to get a replacement.

503
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,500
It's the audiobook I made for you.

504
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,370
You mentioned earlier

505
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,310
about that interesting movie.

506
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
I saw my colleague

507
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,990
reading the book by chance.

508
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,190
I was thinking

509
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,790
to record it for you.

510
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,120
I've almost finished it.

511
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,390
Now it's gone.

512
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,150
I found it.

513
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,830
Thank goodness. Everything is intact.

514
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Give it to me.

515
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,080
Wait, it's a little dirty.

516
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,430
I'm saying,

517
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
give me your hand.

518
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
You...

519
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,880
After that,

520
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,000
kiss in between his eyebrows.

521
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,360
It ends here.

522
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,720
Speaking of this,

523
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,750
I was in the studio,

524
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,510
there was an ad hoc program to handle.

525
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,080
That's why I missed out the last bit.

526
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,080
Wait for me.

527
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,610
I found it.

528
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,680
"I can feel the snowflakes

529
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,080
melting between my lips

530
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,960
and his warm skin,

531
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,790
in a gradual manner."

532
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,520
"I took a deep breath,

533
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,719
then I told Tiffany,

534
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,040
I believe

535
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,040
I need you too."

536
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,040
Judging from your look,

537
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,760
seems you haven't figured it out.

538
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,870
Let me explain it to you.

539
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,170
In fact, at this moment,

540
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,090
The male protagonist is saying,

541
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,719
"I love you."

542
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,349
I love you not because I need you.

543
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,389
I love you, therefore I need you.

544
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,600
Got it?

545
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,429
It seems you'll never figure this out.

546
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:49,781
Close your eyes.

547
00:34:49,861 --> 00:34:52,172

You all went to the music company

560
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,000
Xiao Lu introduced?

561
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,320
Xu Qian did not show up after all?

562
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,050
In fact it's not really a surprise.

563
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,000
Stop staring.

564
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,960
Even she could tell
that Xu Qian made up her mind.

565
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,820
Okay.

566
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,660
That's the story.

567
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,520
That's how it is.

568
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,350
What are you implying?

569
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,040
Are we disbanding?

570
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,430
Watch your words.

571
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,040
Why not

572
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,310
let me ask Xiao Lu again.

573
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,140
Let's see if she could give
a second chance.

574
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,270
Forget it.

575
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,400
There's no point
without the lead vocalist.

576
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,070
Brother, get real.

577
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,200
If you really want the band to persist,

578
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,630
be decisive and get a new lead vocalist.

579
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,260
What are you doing here?

580
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,200
There you are. Have a seat.

581
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,660
Quick.

582
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,730
Look.

583
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,450
I've ordered your favourite dishes.

584
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,750
These are not my favourite food.

585
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,230
Only you think they are.

586
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,670
How could you talk like this?

587
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,560
You are graduating soon.

588
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,230
As I'm not able to attend the ceremony,

589
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,760
I thought to rush over
and have a meal with you.

590
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,660
Why are you being ungrateful?

591
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,750
Ungrateful?

592
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,070
Have I ever said
you are welcome to my graduation?

593
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,720
Have I demanded you to dine with me?

594
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,150
Just leave.

595
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,280
What are you up to?

596
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,200
You!

597
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,550
Forget it.

598
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,840
Please leave.

599
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,670
And don't come back.

600
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,840
Xu Qian!

601
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
Why would a person like you

602
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,830
be a mother?

603
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,520
Why?

604
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,780
Please take note that musical therapy

605
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,740
is ineffective in the short term.

606
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,760
Within a short duration,

607
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,150
musical therapy is unable to provide

608
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,350
psycho-transformative space for patients.

609
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,450
Therefore,

610
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,680
musical therapy
requires long-term treatment,

611
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,200
in order to achieve the expected outcome.

612
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,270
That's it?

613
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,200
How was it?

614
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,630
I have a question.

615
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,030
Your thesis

616
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,040
seems meaningful and well done.

617
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,920
Why don't you

618
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,200
further pursue this?

619
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,270
Undergraduate studies

620
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,960
only touches the surface.

621
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,390
There's still a long way to go

622
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,040
to conduct the actual research.

623
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,670
To join the radio station is my dream.

624
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,130
Then why are you

625
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,060
enrolled in Psychology in the first place?

626
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,390
This is because

627
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,680
I felt obliged to meet

628
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,670
my parents' expectation.

629
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,780
Think about it.

630
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,310
They have put in a lot of effort

631
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,150
to raise me up to 18 years old.

632
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,640
They nurtured my learning wholeheartedly.

633
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,040
At least I must return their favour.

634
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,230
To me, majoring in Psychology

635
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,560
is not that difficult.

636
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,430
Although it's not really my cup of tea,

637
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,840
but I don't dislike it either.

638
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,670
Things are not easy for my parents.

639
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,290
They may seem decent

640
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,720
on the outside,

641
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,180
But I could tell that

642
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,390
in order to give me a good life,

643
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,570
they work so hard all these years.

644
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,270
It has not been easy.

645
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,280
By obtaining my degree in psychology,

646
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,550
At least this makes them feel relieved.

647
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,280
Even if I don't like it,
it's only four years.

648
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,200
Compared with what they've been through,

649
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,480
It's actually nothing.

650
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
What's wrong?

651
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,560
I can't say for sure.

652
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,830
I just feel

653
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,310
a little envious about you
and your parents,

654
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,110
the mutual understanding.

655
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,150
I suddenly realized that...

656
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,690
you are not that childish after all.

657
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,040
I'm childish?

658
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,670
How dare you call me childish?

659
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,960
If I was childish,

660
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
I wouldn't have won you over

661
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,840
with my major in psychology.

662
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,530
Oh yes, Nian Qin.

663
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,430
I'll be quite occupied during graduation.

664
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,660
I'll move to Cheng Yin's place.

665
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,070
It's nearer and easier for me.

666
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,990
Is that fine?

667
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,630
Deal.

668
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,680
Remember to attend my graduation ceremony.

669
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,610
Don't have to dress up or anything.

670
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,680
Just wash your face and come over.

671
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,100
Okay, be a nice boy.

672
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,870
Play the piano and take your meals.

673
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,960
Be obedient.

674
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,860
That's all.

675
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,000
I've finished my thesis presentation.

676
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,590
Your advice is most welcome
and appreciated.

677
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,550
Thank you.

678
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,470
Next.

679
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,830
Sang Wu Yan.

680
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Psychology Theses, Donghu University

681
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,040
Good day, lecturers.

682
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,440
The topic of my thesis is

683
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,760
The Orff therapy towards the

684
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,450
practical research on autistic children.

685
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,520
The Orff therapy

686
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
is based on Orff's music

687
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,720
and its target respondents.

688
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,490
It was invented by German musicians,

689
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,960
Gertrud, Carol and Iemgard

690
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,960
after a long-term research.

691
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,960
Orff music education approach,

692
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,790
is the world's most famous,

693
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,280
most influential system.

694
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,350
You're still keen

695
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,290
to look at our original composition?

696
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,320
I've spoken to Mr Lee.

697
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,680
He felt that your original music

698
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,150
is very unique.

699
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,870
If being a signed artist doesn't work out,

700
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,240
we can still consider
other forms of collaboration.

701
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,680
Plus, Xu Qian came to me.

702
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,960
She explained what happened that day.

703
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,150
In fact, I do understand your situation.

704
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,020
Xu Qian?

705
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,200
She went to meet you?

706
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,240
She came and apologized to me.

707
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,120
There's nothing to be sorry about.

708
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,800
I could tell that

709
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,180
she came over after a long deliberation.

710
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,110
Are both of you still on good terms?

711
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,930
Wu Yan.

712
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,760
I bought the tomatoes you told me earlier.

713
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,960
Let's cook...

714
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,870
What's wrong with you?

715
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,280
There's nothing to be surprised about.

716
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,630
I fried an egg for Wu Yan before.

717
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,640
What?

718
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,590
You're really...

719
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Xiao Lu.

720
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,350
Before this,

721
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,430
was I really immature?

722
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,980
Why are you suddenly asking this?

723
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,320
Nothing.

724
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,630
Let me do it.

725
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,110
It's fine.

726
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,110
I'm the one who takes care of Wu Yan.

727
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,710
Where is Wu Yan?
She moved to Cheng Yin's place.

728
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,860
You should relax.

729
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,810
She is busy with school matters

730
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,430
Staying nearer makes things easier.
