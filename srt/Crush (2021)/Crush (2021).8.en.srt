3
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,240
The sofa is on your right.

4
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,240
Where is your room?

5
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,400
It's on the right.

6
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,840
You...

7
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,240
I'll get a new one for you.

8
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,040
No.

9
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
I want to remind you to be careful.

10
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,070
Don't injure yourself.

11
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,110
I feel really warm.

12
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,040
You're not feeling warm.

13
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,110
You're having a fever.

14
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,950
Why did you come to my place?

15
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,800
You refused to answer my calls, right?

16
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,480
Let's get you treated.

17
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,200
What are you doing?

18
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,040
Let's go to the hospital.
Do you think you can go down on your own?

19
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,950
No, you...

20
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,640
Just tell me the direction
to go downstairs.

21
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,040
Hold on.

22
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,950
There are nine steps.

23
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,430
Then, you have to turn left.

24
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,710
The light has gone off.

25
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,360
It doesn't affect me.

26
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,480
Nine.

27
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,350
Eight.

28
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,830
Seven.

29
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,230
Six.

30
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,430
I'm scared.

31
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,950
Whenever the lights went off,

32
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,760
I didn't dare to use the staircases.

33
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,080
-Are you okay?

♫No matter how long the journey is♫

67

They'll take us no matter what.

69
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,990
♫We'll be together♫

70
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,230

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,540
♫Be together♫

72
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,630
♫Yes, I believe♫

73
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,510
Go to the hospital.

74
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,160
(Emergency Room 6)

75
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,550
She has measles.

76
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,320
I think her immunisation
has dropped lately.

77
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
That's why she got it.

78
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,600
I'll prescribe some medicine for her
to reduce the fever.

79
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,710
She'll recover
after taking a few days off.

80
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,070
Have you ever had measles?

81
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,510
If not, you should stay away from her.

82
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,830
I've had measles before.

83
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,710
You'd better be honest.

84
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,830
Are you trying to trick me?

85
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,800
Look at the steps you've taken.

86
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,480
First, you made me curious.

87
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,920
Then, you set up a mysterious personality.

88
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,270
After that, you turned back.

89
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,990
You let me discover
your most fragile side.

90
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,160
After torturing me emotionally,

91
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,360
you became free and easy again.

92
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,920
Thank you.

93
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,680
Incoming call from Yu Xiao Lu.

94
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Hello.

95
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,030
We just came out from the clinic.

96
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,160
I'll send her back.

97
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
You don't have to pick us up.

98
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
Keep some food at home.

99
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,950
By the way, for the next few days,

100
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,070
you don't have to come to my place.

101
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,920
Okay, thanks.

102
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,480
Was that Xiao Lu?

103
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,550
Why did you stop her
from going to your place?

104
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,950
She's never had the measles.
You might pass it to her.

105
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,160
Stop looking.

106
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,510
You're dilly-dallying.

107
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,790
I'm not going to work
at the radio station.

108
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,230
I have to attend lots of interviews.

109
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,480
I can't apply leaves so frequently.

110
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,080
Then, Wu Yan...

111
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,910
She's so pure.

112
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,790
I knew it.

113
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,550
She has the basis to stay pure.

114
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm not in the position.

115
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,550
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,070
I have big money to make.

117
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm going to make big money too.

118
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,360
What's wrong with you?

119
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,560
I'll keep you company.

120
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
Why are you awake?

121
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Are you going to sleep on the couch?

122
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
He's quite the gentleman.

123
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,160
What did you say?

124
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I said I want to have some water.

125
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,480
Hold on.

126
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,750
Fresh warm water is better for health.

127
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,270
Well...

128
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,120
What's wrong?

129
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,680
Nothing, I'm just thirsty.

130
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,480
Just hold on.

131
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,390
What are you reading?

132
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
A biography.

133
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,710
Whose biography?

134
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,360
It's a biography of a famous person.

135
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,310
Do you watch movies?

136
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,390
What a silly question.

137
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
No.

138
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,120
What is so nice about watching movies?

139
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,070
The world is rich and colourful.

140
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,750
However, we only have the chance
to experience one of them.

141
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,350
Edward Yang De Chang once said,

142
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,750
"Movies have extended
a human's life three times."

143
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,040
I think movies
are kind of like a program...

144
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,990
that lets us experience
different kinds of life...

145
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,760
in our limited life.

146
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,520
It's just like an adventure
that has gone off track.

147
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,190
The same can be applied to reading.

148
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,870
However, movies are more straightforward.

149
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,630
To me,

150
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,600
touching something
is more straightforward than seeing it.

151
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,270
Do you cry when you read novels?

152
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,109
I usually cry when I watch movies.

153
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,040
Men and women are different
in terms of emotional structure.

154
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,390
However, as the case may be,

155
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,200
you're just a natural crybaby.

156
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,560
Yes.

157
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,320
At this moment, I have the urge to cry.

158
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,390
I have a question.

159
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,630
Did you listen to the broadcast?

160
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,230
I've answered your question.

161
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,990
How about yours?

162
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,710
After asking me the question,

163
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,590
you left without saying a word.

164
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,080
What did that mean?

165
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,710
You didn't even answer my phone calls.

166
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,520
You also stopped Xiao Wei
from telling me...

167
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,680
that you went to see her.

168
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,990
You said touching something...

169
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,920
is more straightforward
than seeing it, right?

170
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,440
Fine.

171
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,990
Let me try.

172
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,390
You're real.

173
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,040
The water is turning cold.

174
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,960
Sang Wu Yan,
go to bed if you want to sleep.

175
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,980
♫Dreams of a light year♫

176
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,590
♫Is as vast as the sadness♫

177
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,500
♫The earth is quiet♫

178
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,060
♫Like the eyes of the stars♫

179
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
♫I want to see clearly♫

180
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,470
♫Every expression on your face♫

181
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,750
♫This way, it won't shatter♫

182
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,000
♫The heart♫

183
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,560
♫From one star♫

184
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,550
♫To another♫

185
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,670
♫Tears are like crystals ♫

186
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,450
♫Submerged in the sea of stars♫

187
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,060
♫Continuing its trajectory♫

188
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,370
♫By taking your surname♫

189
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,770
♫I won't be all alone♫

190
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,460
♫By myself♫

191
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,240
♫Would you then♫

192
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,140
♫Notice me?♫

193
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,720
♫There is a distant star like me♫

194
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,900
♫Shining brightly♫

195
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,460
♫Because I don't know♫

196
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,240
♫How to express myself♫

197
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,210
♫My past is full♫

198
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,390
♫Of ups and downs♫

199
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,000
♫I won't hide from it♫

200
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,940
(Don't try this at home
as it's merely to cater to the plot)

201
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,040
Su Nian Qin.

202
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,920
I remember I fell asleep...

203
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,880
on the couch last night.

204
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,710
When I woke up,

205
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,510
I was in the bedroom.

206
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,840
Thank you.

207
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,680
No wonder you keep aloe vera
in the kitchen.

208
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,510
Do you always injure yourself?

209
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,200
You had a bad sleep last night,
didn't you?

210
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,350
Do you still want to eat?

211
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,320
Are you sure...

212
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,510
it's safe to eat?

213
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm sorry.

214
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,560
No doubt you graduated
from a prestigious university...

215
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,920
with an excellent result,
(Resume)

216
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,001
but for the internship position,

217
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,920
we're looking for someone who knows
the basics of financial analysis.

218
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,680
I understand that.

219
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,640
Anyway, thank you for interviewing me.

220
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,760
Zhao Ying, hurry up.

221
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,440
My drum set is drenched.

222
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,310
What an unlucky year.

223
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,520
Not only our did our vocalist
leave the band,

224
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,721
our rehearsal room got flooded too.

225
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:07,321
I think all the instruments are ruined.

226
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,990
The vocalist is back.

227
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,750
I apologise for what I did previously.

228
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
If you don't mind,

229
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,080
can I rejoin the band?

230
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,360
It's better
to have something than nothing.

231
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,160
Sorry.

232
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,300
I came down with the measles.

233
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,800
I couldn't apply for a leave in time.

234
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,220
You're sick?

235
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,140
Is it serious?

236
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,320
It's not serious.

237
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,480
I just need a couple days of rest.

238
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,040
That's good to hear. Get a good rest.

239
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,440
The schoold holiday is in two days.

240
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,160
It's okay. You can come back next year.

241
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,200
Okay. See you next year.

242
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,990
Su Nian Qin.

243
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
How do you celebrate the new year?

244
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
Are you going to celebrate it alone?

245
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm not alone.

246
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,700
(Wei Hao)

247
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,510
Hello? What's wrong?

248
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,590
Goodness, is it really that serious?

249
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,040
I'm fine. It's just the measles.

250
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,840
I just need to rest for two days.

251
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,310
I'll ask around.

252
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,350
I'll get back to you.

253
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,160
I have to go.

254
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Hello, Ms Xi.

255
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,950
Sorry to disturb you.

256
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,470
I need a favour from you.

257
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,990
My friend's rehearsal room was flooded.

258
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,190
Can you help?

259
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,160
We formed the band during our first year
in the university.

260
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,230
We performed in all kinds of event.

261
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,480
I see.

262
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,270
Have you ever considered
being a professional singer?

263
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,000
We...

264
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,230
We sent demos to record companies.

265
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,760
However, to us,
sharing the same musical idea...

266
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,520
with the company is very important.

267
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,590
To be frank,

268
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,320
we don't wish for our work
to be affected by business factors.

269
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,110
I'm sorry. He's...

270
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,440
It's okay. I get it.

271
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,830
Afterwards,
can I sit in at your rehearsal?

272
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,750
Of course.

273
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,870
Can someone help me out?

274
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,680
Here comes our vocalist.

275
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,070
What a beautiful lady.

276
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,230
Hello, I'm Yu Xiao Lu.

277
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,310
Hello.

278
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,440
Xu Qian, you've met me before, right?

279
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,560
At the radio station.

280
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,520
Hello, Ms Xi.

281
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Ms Xi, you're...

282
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,350
Wu Yan sought help from me.

283
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,920
Hence, I decided to seek help
from my junior.

284
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,950
Can we start now?

285
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,830
I wish to take a look at your rehearsal.

286
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,840
Sure, let's begin.

287
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,320
I'll explain to you later.

288
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,280
♫The overlapping wishes
Plays up the colour and fragrance♫

289
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,350
♫The so called stubbornness
Never worries about time♫

290
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,310
♫The raindrops evaporate right away
The elders speak with feelings♫

291
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,210
♫A flower is incomplete
Without its leaves♫

292
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,400
♫I finally found my way♫

293
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,350
♫The long awaited summer
Is burning with heat♫

294
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,280
♫It's as if the heat is waving
The fluctuation is just a pretense♫

295
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,640
♫The day is quiet
And the sunset is bustling♫

296
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,880
What do you think?

297
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,180
Pretty good.

298
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,720
They're a good fit for my upcoming show.

299
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,710
♫We long for fire♫

300
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,400
I knew you had a motive.

301
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,080
♫Longing for boastfulness
As it speaks my mind♫

302
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,150
♫The expansion in our hearts♫

303
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,280
♫Kickstarts my journey♫

304
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,030
Is that so?

305
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,350
Okay, got it.

306
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,470
Go ahead with the rehearsal.

307
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,800
Sure, I have to go.

308
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,720
Bye.

309
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,230
You...

310
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,080
The water will be ready soon.

311
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,270
I didn't say I wanted a drink.

312
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Where do you keep the medicine?

313
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,590
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

314
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,680
Just tell me where it is.

315
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,470
It's in the drawer.

316
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,800
What are you doing?

317
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,840
Nothing.

318
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,510
Let me see.

319
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,910
Let me see.

320
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,400
Look at you.

321
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,440
Why do you always hurt yourself?

322
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,230
It's always because of you.

323
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,640
All right, sit there.

324
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,680
Don't point here and there all the time.

325
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,110
I can't see where you are pointing.

326
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,400
How would I know?

327
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,950
Fine. All right.

328
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,230
Here, go there.

329
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,660
Here.

330
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,040
Sit here.

331
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,110
You're...

332
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,270
You're quite strong.

333
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,510
So, you're not putting up with the pain.

334
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,080
The truth is,
you can't feel the pain at all.

335
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,520
I think because of that,

336
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,440
you think that I would have
the same tolerance when you left me.

337
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,590
I've answered your question.

338
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,710
What about you?

339
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,080
I'm sorry.

340
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,160
You...

341
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,440
What did you say?

342
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,640
-Forget it if you didn't hear it.
-I heard it.

343
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,800
Why were you apologising?

344
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,720
Well...

345
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,680
I left without saying goodbye.

346
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,560
Forget it.

347
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,200
I forgive you.

348
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,760
It's really easy to coax me.

349
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
You should learn from me.

350
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,440
I'm sorry...

351
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,070
Why didn't you use aloe vera this time?

352
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,160
Stop dwelling on it.

353
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,160
Aloe vera
doesn't work on injuries like this.

354
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,160
I'm not thinking about it.
No one is thinking about it.

355
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,390
Fine, stop moving.

356
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,950
I'm sorry, Ms Xiao Lu.

357
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,990
Sorry to have taken up your time.

358
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,470
It's okay. Don't mention it.

359
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,110
By the way, during the rehearsal,
I recorded a video.

360
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,230
Would you mind?

361
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,640
Of course, I promise...

362
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,230
I'll only send it to some of my friends
in the music industry.

363
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,190
-I won't spread it.
-No problem for sure.

364
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,350
We've always wanted
to get some professional views.

365
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,720
Ms Xiao Lu, can I have your opinion?

366
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,760
It's getting late. Let's not hold her up.

367
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,310
You should call her Ms Yu.

368
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,950
I'm sorry. He's just too young and naive.

369
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,640
He won't do that again.

370
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
It's okay, you can call me Ms Xiao Lu.

371
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,590
Come here often.

372
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,990
I'll allocate some time
to talk with all of you.

373
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,070
By the way, this is the key. Take it.

374
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,800
Ms Xiao Lu, are you sure?

375
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,470
Or what?

376
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,590
Do I have to send someone
to watch over you?

377
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,510
I have faith in my senior's friends.

378
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,630
She can't run away anyway.

379
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,159
Thank you.

380
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,790
Wait for us.

381
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,590
I'll pay you a visit in a few days.

382
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,590
Su Nian Qin.

383
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,790
Su Nian Qin.

384
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,720
Su Nian Qin.

385
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,310
Su Nian Qin, wake up.

386
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,030
Are you having a nightmare?

387
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,720
I'll not miss out on the chance
two times in a row.

388
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,440
Do you think I'll miss out on the chance?

389
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,760
You shouldn't do that.

390
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,790
I know.

391
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,480
My mum told me girls
shouldn't make the first move.

392
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,870
It will make men feel
that we're easy to get.

393
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,760
I think my mum is right,

394
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,280
but I refuse to listen to her.

395
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,030
You...

396
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,520
Su Nian Qin!

397
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,240
I like Su Nian Qin.

398
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,590
Since the first time
I saw him by the lake,

399
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,680
I've fallen in love with him.

400
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,310
Why?

401
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,760
You're asking why again.

402
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,310
Love at first sight.

403
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,440
The blind doesn't understand English.

404
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,380
Why are you smiling
if you didn't understand it?

405
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,440
Tell me. Why are you smiling?

406
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,000
You always bully me!

407
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,200
Why are you so bad?

408
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
Stop moving.

409
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,390
I didn't touch you.

410
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,830
You can't reach me, can you?

411
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,200
Like I said, with light or not,
it doesn't matter to me.

412
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,070
Can you feel the difference?

413
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,920
Like this.

414
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,360
Open it.

415
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,950
Close it.

416
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,790
Open it.

417
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,060
♫Nothing much to say♫

418
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,000
♫I've been waiting for something♫

419
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,510
♫It's written in the stars♫

420
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,520
It's warmth.

421
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,550
♫There's a voice in my ears♫

422
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,570
Sunlight is not all about brightness.

423
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,790
Warmth is very important too.

424
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,440
♫The sun showers deliberately♫

425
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,201
Don't you feel that today's sunlight...

426
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:19,690
♫Drop on my shoulders
I suddenly recall something♫

427
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,390
is so warm?

428
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,290
♫Subconsciously♫

429
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,090
♫I recognise you♫

430
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,510
♫By your astonishing voice♫

431
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,300
What's warm is your palm.

432
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,050
♫You look up and smile at me♫

433
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,360
♫You say the lyric is a tongue twist♫

434
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,050
♫I quench the galaxy♫

435
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,640
♫In the dark, naturally♫

436
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,480
♫We hug and hold hands♫

437
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,590
What's wrong with the curtains?

438
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,920
Xiao Lu is my relative's sister.

439
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,790
She stays here to take care of me.

440
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Hello.

441
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,350
I'm Sang Wu Yan.

442
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,640
I have to stay away from you.

443
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,440
I have measles and it's contagious.

444
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,590
It's okay.
I had vaccines when I was young.

445
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,160
Have a great chat. I'm going home.

446
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,750
I came here unprepared.

447
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,400
I didn't bring anything.

448
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,200
I'll come back soon.

449
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,870
So, it's a success?

450
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,790
I'm here to see if you need anything.

451
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,590
Since you need nothing, I'll leave now.

452
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,240
After all, someone is here with you.

453
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,510
By the way,

454
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,390
I'll clean the guest room
so that Wu Yan can come and stay.

455
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,000
Why did you choose this place?

456
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,440
I chose it because of Cheng Yin.

457
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
There is no lift in the building.

458
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,680
Furthermore, it's cheap.

459
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,950
Come in.

460
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,510
Remove your mask.

461
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,680
You won't pass it to me.

462
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,960
This is new to me.

463
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,200
All of us had vaccines when we were young.
Why are you still down with measles?

464
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,550
How do you know that I have the measles?

465
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,030
Wei Hao told you.

466
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,790
You've transformed
into a career woman today.

467
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,270
I'm still attending interviews.

468
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,510
I came to your place
right after the interview.

469
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,510
You're still attending interviews?

470
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,000
Why did you leave before getting a job?

471
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,920
-I thought...
-Or what?

472
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,350
I can't take leaves frequently
to attend interviews.

473
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,480
Since I've made up my mind,

474
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,480
I don't want to hold myself back.

475
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,520
How was the interview?

476
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,000
Don't ask.

477
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,440
It was the ninth interview.

478
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,200
I think they won't take me in.

479
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,070
Since I was given a chance,
I just gave it a try.

480
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,790
I must be out of my mind.

481
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,590
I told them the truth.

482
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,750
Wu Yan, I'm sorry.

483
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,480
I didn't tell you before resigning.

484
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,790
I know that you
have high expectations for me.

485
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,550
-But I...
-Stop it.

486
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,760
You make me sound like a counsellor.

487
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,350
I get it.

488
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,400
I thought it through after I cooled down.

489
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
It's the same as me wanting to work
at a radio station...

490
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,160
instead of taking
the postgraduate entrance examination.

491
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,520
It's just a matter of choice.

492
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,110
I'm sure you have your own reasons.

493
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,520
No matter what, you have my support.

494
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,030
However, you and Wei Hao...

495
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,720
Didn't I tell you...?

496
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,960
Just forget it.

497
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,440
Don't mention it again.

498
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,360
Why?

499
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,200
You know my family well.

500
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,200
We can't choose our parents.

501
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,640
I hate it, but I know it clearly...

502
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,870
that I have
to bear my responsibility nevertheless.

503
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,240
It's natural for me to be responsible
for taking care of my family.

504
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,160
However,

505
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,440
I don't want him to face the same thing.

506
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,000
If we become a couple,

507
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,400
and if we both
take the relationship seriously,

508
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,200
eventually, we will have to face it.

509
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,760
I don't want him to face it.
