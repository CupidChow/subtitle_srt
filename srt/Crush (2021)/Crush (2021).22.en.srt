Thank you, everyone.

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,544
I'm taking a break from now on.
Please don't send any email to me.

7
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,947
Wishing you a happy new year.

8
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:36,903
Boss, but...

9
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,114
You may leave now.

10
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:45,519
Stop following me around.

11
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,446
Our boss is a workaholic.

12
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:51,153
For the past three years,
I've never seen him taking a break.

13
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,213
It's so sudden.

14
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,319
I guess he's
entering the next phase of life.

18
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,477

How far are we from the radio station?

21

We are three intersections away.

22
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:44,930
Hurry up.

What's wrong?

26
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,994
My colleague wasn't
feeling well all of a sudden.

27
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:13,873
I had to send her out in a rush.

Welcome back to
"The Lone Island Playlist".

32
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,575
Chinese New Year
is just around the corner.

33
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,329
It means the spring is not far away.

34
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,105
Today, I'm going to recommend a song...

35
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,021
which I have been
avoiding for a long time.

36
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,467
In the past,
I played the song once in a while.

37
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,495
I refused to listen to the song...

38
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,808
because to me, the song is too sweet.

39
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,474
It makes me feel
as if Yi Jin, who wrote the song,

40
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:02,282
is a complete stranger.

41
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:06,708
Now, the show of the day
has come to an end.

would it be too formal?

like a rat before a cat...

As the saying goes, "While the priest
climbs a post, the devil climbs ten".

How dare you call my mum a devil?

72
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,401
To be frank, your mum is quite adorable
especially when she nags.

73
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,934
She reminded me of someone.

74
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:07,089
Who is it?

75
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,634
My mum.

76
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,557
When I was young, she always nagged at me,

77
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,211
especially during piano practice.

78
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,688
I was annoyed back then.

79
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:20,957
Now, when I think back,

80
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:23,365
each trifle is extremely precious.

Don't worry.

82

Mrs Sang, take a look.

99
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,742
Mum, are you looking for a son-in-law
or a slave?

100
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,425
Stop making noise.

101
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:18,565
Well...

102
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,713
Can we finish all of them?

103
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,522
Why not?

104
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:23,793
Tonight,

00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:28,729
your second aunt, second uncle-in-law,
third aunt, third uncle-in-law cousins,

106
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,377
Tian Tian and Nuo Nuo are coming.

107
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,109
We only bought this many vegetables.

108
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,899
I worry that it's not enough.

109
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,083
Look at me.

110
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,714
Get me a bottle of soy sauce.

111
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:50,078
I forgot to tell you just now.

112
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,188
Go get me a bottle of soy sauce now.

113
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:53,709
Sure.

114
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,936
Let's go.

115
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:56,896
Why are you dragging him along?

116
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,218
I was wondering.

117
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,586
There are so many things
but Su carried everything on his own.

118
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:04,600
The wet market is crowded.

119
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,550
His shoes will be covered in mud too.

120
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,908
You should go alone.

121
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:09,245
Go now.

122
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,996
But he's so eager to help.

123
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,216
Am I right, Su?

124
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,089
Fine.

125
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,877
I'll go there by myself.

126
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:20,952
Just keep a close watch on the fire.

127
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:22,013
Got it.

128
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:23,301
Mrs Sang.

129
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,450
Have a safe trip.

130
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,242
Let her go.

131
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:10,400
Even if you haven't seen a pig before,

132
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,801
it's impossible that you
haven't tasted pork before, right?

133
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:14,848
What is the relation?

134
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,416
Think about it.

135
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,548
In those movies that we watched,

136
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:23,008
those proposals were so romantic that...

137
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:25,315
all the audiences
were moved to tears, right?

138
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:26,684
For instance, the movie
that we watched yesterday.

139
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:27,823
Have you forgotten?

140
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:30,161
For the girlfriend, the male lead...

141
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,152
learned how to make
her favourite Tiramisu.

142
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:36,031
He spent one month mastering the skills.

143
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,460
Then, on her birthday,

144
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,395
he made Tiramisu
and hid the diamond ring in it.

145
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:45,177
When the girlfriend was indulging in it,
something hit her teeth.

146
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,724
She took it out and realised,

147
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:49,730
it's a diamond ring.

148
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,769
Then, the male lead said,

149
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,967
"Marry me".

150
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,473
It sounds quite boring.

151
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:00,442
She might choke herself.

152
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,429
Can't you be a tad more romantic?

153
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:03,801
Goodness.

154
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:06,945
That's me.

155
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,904
There's no other way.

156
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,099
Then I'm not going to marry you.

00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,380
Then I'll do it again.

Why is this diamond so tiny?

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,755
It wouldn't be
comfortable if it's too big.

182
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,084
Won't your finger feel tired
if it's too heavy?

183
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,498
No, it won't.

184
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:28,821
Why is it pink in colour?

185
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:31,222

They said it's known as coloured diamond.

Could it be a scam?

193
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,332
You might have gotten a fake diamond.

194
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:49,320
All right.

195
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:53,213
Why didn't you switch on the lights?

196

197
00:13:56,363 --> 00:13:57,776

Mum.

201
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,732
I've agreed to marry Nian Qin.

202
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,508
That's great.

203
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:23,761
That's really great.

204
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,127
Tomorrow is
the first day of Chinese New Year.

205
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:31,878
We'll pay your dad a visit together.

206
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:04,569
Here, here come the dishes.

207
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,942
Let's eat up.

208
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,020
Eat up.

209
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,029
Let's dig in.

210
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,239
Here, let's eat.

211
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,623
It's cured meat made by my mum.

212
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:14,991
It's delicious.

213
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,350
Let me get some rice for you.

214
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,085
Su, I made these fish balls.

215
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,218
Try it.

216
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,425
Thank you.

217
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,701
Su, have some fish.

218
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:23,945
It's a local specialty.

219
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,216
You can't find it anywhere else.

220
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:26,228
-Thank you.
-Here.

221
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,222
Su, let's cheers.

222
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,047
Enough, stop bullying my husband.

223
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,224
When did that happen?

224
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:43,757
That's right.

225
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:46,142
You didn't even inform us.

226
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:48,611
Su, when do you plan to get married?

227
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,752
Nian Qin, can we play together?

228
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:26,294
I want to play with Nian Qin too.

229
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:27,866
Sure.

230
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:32,696
Nian Qin, why didn't you
celebrate New Year at home?

231
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,523
Wu Yan invited me over.

232
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,818
That's why I'm here.

233
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,326
Nian Qin,

234
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,463
Grandaunt says that
you couldn't see before.

235
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:41,858
Is that true?

236
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,147
I wasn't completely blind.

237
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,908
Nuo Nuo,
when you're moving in front of me,

238
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,633
I could sense your movements before this.

239
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:54,806
However,
I couldn't tell colours apart back then.

240
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:58,855
I relied on the descriptions by others
to relate colours and objects.

241
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,418
Therefore,
when I gained back my eyesight,

242
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:05,230
many colours appeared before me at once.

243
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,462
I spent quite a long time
getting used to it.

244
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:12,768
So, you didn't know
which things are which colours?

245
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,334
I could relate something to its colour.

246
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:19,327
For example, the sea is blue in colour.

247
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,872
So is the sky.

248
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,745
So is my favourite shirt.

249
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,220
What about white?

250
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,730
It's the colour of clouds and your teeth.

251
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,915
What about pink?

252
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,888
It's the colour of Wu Yan's lips.

253
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,676
That's my favourite colour.

254
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,051
You...

255
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,325
Don't talk nonsense
in front of the children.

256
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:50,227
All right, go have fun outside.

257
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,328
Go.

258
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,085
Wu Yan.

259
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:34,704
Check out the management office.

260
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:38,242
I think I've forgotten
to pay for the management fees.

261
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:39,659
I paid.

262
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:40,783
It's paid.

263
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:43,544
Furthermore, it's Chinese New Year.
Apparently everyone is on leave.

264
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,842
Just do what I said.

265
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:51,041
All right.

266
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,137
Su.

267
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:00,980
About the things I said to you before,

268
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,740
I've always wanted you to know...

269
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:05,926
that I'm sorry.

270
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:07,617
It's okay.

271
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,507
Mrs Sang, I got it.

272
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,333
Some subject matters...

273
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,458
should be brought up
to your attention by her dad.

274
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:22,445
Too bad he's no longer here.

275
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:26,165
(Grave of beloved father, Sang Jin De
and mother, Cheng Jia Ying)

276
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:32,782
Mrs Sang.

277
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:33,989
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,917
It's all my fault.

279
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,396
Everything happens for a reason.

280
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,810
No one should be blamed.

281
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,114
You should stop blaming yourself.

282
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:52,668
Before his demise, Wu Yan's dad
spoiled Wu Yan.

283
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:56,989
Back then, I always blamed him
for spoiling her.

284
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:02,481
Before he passed away,
he reminded me about something.

285
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:03,952
Then, I realized,

286
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,368
before that, Wu Yan...

287
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,287
was something I showed off to everyone.

288
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,586
She's known as "other people's child".

289
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,414
It's very tiring to be her.

290
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:21,079
I always stopped her
from pursuing her own dream.

291
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,993
When I think back,

292
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,777
I'm really grateful
that she didn't listen to me...

293
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,713
and she didn't exploit herself.

294
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,295
Su, bear it in mind.

295
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,911
Wu Yan was raised with love
by her dad and me.

296
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,625
You must treat her well.

297
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:46,528
You have to respect her
and support her dream.

298
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:50,534
Su.

299
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:52,750
I'm entrusting...

300
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,448
Wu Yan to you.

301
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,440
(Grave of beloved father, Sang Jin De
and mother, Cheng Jia Ying)

302
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,133
Mr Sang.

303
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:06,230
Mrs Sang.

304
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,315
Don't worry.

305
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,579
You...

306
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:18,504
What are you talking about?

307
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,854
Mum, are you putting the fear
of god into my husband?

308
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,365
You haven't even married him
but you already take on his side.

309
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:28,631
I'm not.

310
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:32,266
Mum, let's go to karaoke later,
the one dad usually went.

311
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:33,862
I've booked a room.

312
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,943
Sure.

313
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,731
Su, do you want to come?

314
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,216
Of course he's coming along.

315
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,061
You have no idea
how beautiful his voice is.

316
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:44,435
He's a jukebox in human form.
Just name any song.

317
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,294
My son-in-law is really something.

318
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:50,088
Of course, he's really good at singing.

You must have gotten drunk last night.

342
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:40,066
I listened to Mrs Sang's
and Wu Yan's singing for the whole night.

343
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,179
Their singing was definitely
more powerful than alcohol.

344
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:44,227
My mum made dumplings.
The filling is sea cucumber.

345
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:45,659
She told me to send some dumplings here.

346
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,006
Why don't you have some dumplings?

347
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,078
It's okay.

348
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,189
Are you alone? Where is everyone?

349
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,341
Mrs Sang is paying New Year's call.

350
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,787
Wu Yan went to see Cheng Yin.

351
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,982
I wanted to tag along
but she refused to let me go.

352
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:01,349
Cheng Yin?

353
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:03,222
Are you kidding?

354
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:06,683
Cheng Yin passed away three years ago.

355
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:10,111
What did you say?

356
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,576
You didn't know that?

357
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:18,203
Three years ago, Wu Yan and Cheng Yin
were trapped in the lift...

358
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,602
at our apartment.

359
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,854
Xu Qian and I
received a phone call from the hospital...

360
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,934
and we only learned about it
when we reached there.

361
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,234
Cheng Yin has claustrophobia.

362
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:30,186
She was trapped in the lift
for a long time.

363
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:34,416
Moreover, none of us knew that
she had severe heart disease.

364
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,794
What does that mean?

365
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:40,733
I guess Wu Yan made up all this
in her mind...

366
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,613
in order to resolve her nervousness...

367
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:47,541
or loneliness or depression.

368
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:52,376
Whenever she feels lost,
she would make up a person...

369
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:54,567
with Cheng Yin's personality
and mannerisms...

370
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:56,267
to converse with herself.

371
00:25:56,347 --> 00:26:01,162
I think it's a positive way
of self-adjustment.

372
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:04,897
The best way is not reminding her
to seek help from a psychologist...

373
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:07,779
but pretending not to know
and care for her.

374
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,123
Reduce her alone time.

375
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:12,699
Try not to let her negative emotions
affect her.

376
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:16,651
I think we should do the same to Wu Yan.

377
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,128
Keep an eye on her...

378
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,946
lest there be any emergencies.

379
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,090
I got it now.

380
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:28,554
Thank you.

381
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:46,894
Nian Qin.

382
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,323
Are you waiting for me?

383
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,346
You went to see Cheng Yin?

384
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:56,756
Didn't I tell you?

385
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,617
Cheng Yin said it's such a valuable ring.

386
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,782
If we get a divorce one day,
I must not give it back to you.

387
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:22,843
Boss, I've looked into the address.

388
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:23,943
I went there.

389
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:25,122
The landlord said that...

390
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:27,491
the person who entered into
the rental agreement is Ms Sang.

391
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,561
He is unsure of other details.

392
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,764
What's wrong?

393
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,036
Nothing.

394
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,223
Wu Yan.

395
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:57,650
Stop going to university.

396
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,451
After the new year break, will you
come to Xiamen to keep me company?

397
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:02,550
I didn't know that you're a conservative.

398
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:04,734
How is that conservative?

399
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:07,400
It's no different than stopping women
from going out...

400
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,134
and getting educated.

401
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:12,574
Are you jealous of me
because I'm more cultured?

402
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:13,792
What?

403
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,178
I found out that...

404
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:18,983
you didn't even graduate
from elementary school.

405
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:21,103
Ms Xiao Lu has betrayed
your secret a long time ago.

406
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:25,115
Didn't you say that
you don't have any classes anymore?

407
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:26,825
You only have the thesis left.

408
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:30,542
You can work on your thesis in Xiamen.

409
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,071
Su Nian Qin, what's wrong with you?

410
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:35,599
You're getting more and more clingy.

411
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,485
You were not like this before.

412
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:41,452
I worry that someone else
might steal you away.

413
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,559
Who?

414
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,696
Who can be more charismatic than you?

415
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:47,563
Cheng Yin.

416
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:51,321
That jealousy of yours is too much.

417
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,281
So, will you come with me?

418
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:07,278
Give me some time.

419
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:11,064
I need to move my dad's office...

420
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:14,126
and hand over my projects to someone else.

421
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,113
I have to get many things done.

422
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,620
(Tongcheng University
Autism Research Centre)

423
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,227
Okay.

424
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:42,393
Okay, got it.

425
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:43,571
Sure.

426
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:02,616
Mum.

427
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:04,386
Wei Hao has parked the car.

428
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,427
The boxes are already inside the car.

429
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:08,346
It's almost time.

430
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:09,605
Let's go.

431
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:26,070
We're leaving.

432
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:40,560
We're leaving.

433
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,581
Wu Yan.

434
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,220
Give me the key.

435
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,664
I'll lock the door.

436
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,854
(Yu Xiao Lu)

437
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:19,510
Hello, Ms Xiao Lu. Anything?

438
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,734
Wu Yan, can you do me a favour?

439
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,384
Please come to Xiamen
and take Nian Qin to the hospital.

440
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,658
What's wrong?

441
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,433
It's for an eye check-up.

442
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,491
Something is not quite right
with his eyes.

443
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:36,299
Dr Li who has been treating his eyes
is finally back from the USA.

444
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:38,939
However, no matter how hard
I try to advise him, he won't listen.

445
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,791
Sure, I'll give him a call.

446
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,297
No,

447
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:45,454
you must come here
and make him go to the hospital.

448
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,383
I have to make him go to the hospital?

449
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:51,130
If I could do that,
I wouldn't be Sang Wu Yan.

450
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,274
In this world,

451
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:54,974
if there is anyone who could force him
to do anything,

452
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:56,835
it would be you, Sang Wu Yan.

453
00:32:58,425 --> 00:33:01,710
My useless nephew
is as cute as I am, right?

454
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,984
Otherwise,

455
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,215
you wouldn't have agreed
to be my niece-in-law.

456
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:19,802
Nian Qin, I'm back.

457
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,702
What's wrong with your eyes?

458
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:26,824
Let me see. Don't touch it.

459
00:33:28,944 --> 00:33:30,174
It's okay.

460
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:32,355
It's spring,
the air is full of fluffy catkins.

461
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:34,452
Lately, I always...

462
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:35,876
Let me see.

463
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:40,810
Do you feel better?

464
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:43,897
I think we should go to the hospital.

465
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:45,967
Ms Xiao Lu told me...

466
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:47,292
It's okay.

467
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:49,519
Well...

468
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:51,268
Are you hungry?

469
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:52,773
Let's go out for dinner.

470
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:54,794
No, you shouldn't go out.

471
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:57,135
Be good.

472
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,853
Why do you refuse to go to the hospital?

473
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,270
I know my own condition.

474
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,456
Why should I go through those examinations
like a fool?

475
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,049
They're useless.

476
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,909
What if your eyesight
goes back to the old condition?

477
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:16,387
Back then, I could see
when you're trying to steal a kiss.

478
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,913
Stop flattering yourself.

479
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:25,195
I'm sorry. Please let me through.

480
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:29,958
Here.

481
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:32,766
Watch your steps.

482
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,186
-Here's the sidewalk.
-Thank you.

483
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:52,425
-No problem.
-Goodbye.

484
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:53,674
Slow down.

485
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,287
What's wrong?

486
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,601
Nothing.

487
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:14,875
I suddenly recalled
the time you're walking alone...

488
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:16,403
with a blind man's stick.

489
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,080
Wu Yan.

490
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:24,284
Even if my eyesight
goes back to square one,

491
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:25,531
I don't mind.

492
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:26,849
But I mind.

493
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,722
Are you worried that I might go blind
and become your burden?

494
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:33,723
How could you think like that?

495
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:36,402
What should I think?

496
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,796
I just don't wish to see you struggling
in darkness with very limited light.

497
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:44,281
I just want to see
how beautiful the world is.

498
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:46,768
You have no idea
how beautiful your eyes are.

499
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:49,566
It would be a shame
if they're merely decorations.

500
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,485
Sang Wu Yan.

501
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,332
You're still judging a book by its cover.

502
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,701
-What is so bad about it?
-Of course it's bad.

503
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,140
I fell in love with your appearance first.

504
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,320
Could that be a wrong judgment?

505
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,438
That's the only
correct decision you've made.

506
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:10,225
After all, it's really difficult
to find someone as flawless as me.

507
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:11,580
My goodness.

508
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,736
Since when did you become so slick?

509
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,323
I learn from my wife.

510
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,204
If I lose my eyesight,

511
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,236
will your promise still count?

512
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,309
Cheng Yin once said,

513
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:42,104
Love is eternal blindness.

514
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:46,177
I'm not sure if you've fallen in love
because you couldn't see back then...

515
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:50,142
but the moment I saw you,

516
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,438
I've lost my mind.

517
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:54,569
It's still the same until now.

518
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:58,800
I've decided it'll be the same forever.

519
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:20,951
Let's go for a check-up tomorrow.

520
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,573
Can I say no?

521
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:24,734
No way.

522
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:26,708
Do you want me to run away from home?

523
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:30,745
I don't want to go.

524
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,603
(Outpatient Building)

525
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,424
Have you reminded the doctor?

526
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,216
Su Nian Qin, now, you're in a tight spot.

527
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,361
You...

528
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,247
Isn't the doctor here yet?

529
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:50,791
He's here.

530
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,786
He's getting changed after a surgery.

531
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,661
-Hello, Dr Li. Long time no see.
-Hello.

532
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,683
Last year, I was abroad.

533
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:02,174
I was unable to attend your wedding.

534
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:03,453
So sorry for that.

535
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,560
It's okay.

536
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:08,088
As for Nian Qin,

537
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,073
what's wrong with him?

538
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:13,537
How could you let him take alcohol?

539
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,249
The pain is mainly caused by
excessive drinking in the past.

540
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,476
Also, he must not overwork.

541
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,444
It's best
if someone can take care of him.

542
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:33,463
As for the rest, we'll discuss further
after the examination. You may leave now.

543
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:35,190
I'm going to conduct
an examination on him.

544
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,203
Sure. Thank you for the help.

545
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,388
Don't mention it.

546
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,631
I didn't pay enough attention
to his health.

547
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,751
In short, it's because of my bad temper.

548
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,677
Don't say that, Wu Yan.
You've done your best.

549
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:56,829
Take it slowly.

550
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:58,294
When two people live together,

551
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,232
they have to go through
an adjustment period.

552
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:03,054
Furthermore,
everyone knows that he's bad tempered.

553
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,812
Not many people can put up with it.

554
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:06,202
But...

555
00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:09,162
But Qin and you
get along so well with him.

556
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:11,773
He's Qin's boss, his livelihood.

557
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:13,579
I'm his aunt.

558
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:14,834
As his elder,

559
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:17,067
I can't lower myself to his level, can I?

560
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,622
What's wrong?

561
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,323
I'm going to say thank you to Dr Li.

562
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,018
What's wrong?

563
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,512
What's wrong?

564
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,898
I'm thinking I can stay in Xiamen.

565
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:43,829
I have all the raw data
from the field research.

566
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:45,255
As for the thesis,

567
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:47,584
I can finish it in Xiamen.

568
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,488
You want to take care of me?

569
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,127
I'm more than happy to accept it.

570
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,937
If it weren't for the doctor,
I wouldn't be bothered.

571
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,236
I really have to thank my faulty eyes.

572
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:07,072
If I become blind,
perhaps the treatment...

573
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:08,558
Don't talk nonsense.

574
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,469
Let's stay at our old house.

575
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:14,626
Why?

576
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,852
It's quite comfortable.

577
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,358
I like the living room.

578
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,162
However, it's on one condition.

579
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,453
No matter what it is, I'll agree to it.

580
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:30,105
Just don't ask me
to catch a star for you.

581
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,308
I won't be so unreasonable.

582
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,869
Furthermore, if I really want a star,

583
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:36,682
you'll have to figure it out.

584
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:38,502
I watched a movie before.

585
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:41,777
The male lead
promised to give his lover a star.

586
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,960
In the end, he bought a piece
of meteorite...

587
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,532
to fulfill his promise.

588
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,754
Wu Yan.

589
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:49,066
How about watching
movies of other genres?

590
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,877
Why?

591
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:53,639
Nian Qin.

592
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,624
When do you plan to bring Wu Yan home?

593
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,529
My sister and your dad want to see her.

594
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,541
We'll talk about it.

595
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:21,498
Nian Qin.

596
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:23,581
Check out if the arrangement is right.

597
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,064
Let's put it this way.

598
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:35,199
It's not here.

599
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,736
Something is not right.

600
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,405
Everything is not right.

601
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,698
What is not right?

602
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:45,349
Why don't you do it on your own?

603
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,515
What are you doing?

604
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:03,182
What are you doing?

605
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,860
(Kettle)

606
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,279
Step forward for five steps.

607
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,978
Put it down.

608
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,276
Turn right.

609
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,241
Move forward.

610
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,534
Five steps. Two, three, four, five. Okay.

611
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,622
Stop.

612
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:44,653
Turn right.

613
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,566
Okay, bend down.

614
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,378
Okay.

615
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,819
Turn right.
