3
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,122
I...

4
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:07,461
Why am I here?

5
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:10,252
Why don't you get changed first?

6
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,330
I have something to ask you.

7
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,554
It's important.

8
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,195
Let me get changed first.

9
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:19,472
Su Nian Qin.

10
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,757
I...

11
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,411
I still love you.

12
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,848
Do you love me?

13
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:52,844
Always.

14
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,304
I'm relieved you are still a crybaby.

15
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,603
I'm not.

16
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,778
Your bathrobe is loosened.

17
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,899
It's not.

18
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,914
Serves you right.

19
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:34,226
You just mock me instead of consoling me
when you see me like this.

20
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,067
How should I console you?

21
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:40,065
Should I say that I'm just kidding?

22
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,496
That I actually don't like you?

23
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:42,646
You...

24
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,201
Why don't you put that effort
into lyric-writing...

25
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,102
instead of teasing me all the time.

26
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,048
Let's go.

27
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,207
Oh, no. It's really loosened.

28
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,237
I'm just fooling with you.

29
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,854
I don't believe you.

30
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:02,580
I just want to verify
if you are braver now.

31
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,733
So?

32
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,348
It was just right.

33
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,030
You don't have to go to the office?

34
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,078
Work here is done.

35
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:17,838
I'm going back to Xiamen tomorrow.

36
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,721
What?

37
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,459
(Nian Qin)

38
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:42,623
Hello?

39
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:44,238
You are home?

40
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,963
I am at the office.

41
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,101
Why did you go to the office immediately?

42
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:52,653
I have to make up for lost time.

43
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,990
To get my wife back,
work had been delayed a few days.

44
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,094
If you keep going on like this,
I am hanging up.

45
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,227
Don't.

46
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,531
Call me at this hour every night.

47
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,987
You have been gone for three years.

48
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,974
You probably don't know that
I am now a routineer.

49
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,317
I am hanging up.

50
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,234
Let me share you a playlist.

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,541
Didn't you say that
listening to a song...

52
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:18,655
makes one feel the presence
of the other person?

53
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,785
Once I send you the playlist,
you will understand.

54
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,344
Okay.

55
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,214
Open it after I hang up.

56
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,771
Su Nian Qin. Are you embarrassed?

57
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,460
(You are Spring)

58
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:44,895
Nian Qin. What happened?

59
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,314
She is back.

60
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,500
I am sorry.

61
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,719
What's the matter?

62
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,261
You set up this dinner gathering
but you turn up late.

63
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:16,662
We have to hold back our hunger.

64
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:18,929
I got stalled at the pedestrian street.
I am really sorry.

65
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,083
There is no hurry.

66
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,491
Someone is not here yet.

67
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,587
Here he is.

68
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:32,789
Long time no see, Wu Yan.

69
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,004
Why do you look like
you are here for a blind date?

70
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:52,739
Are you not going to introduce him to us?

71
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,074
This... this is my boyfriend.

72
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,967
Hi. I'm Sang Wu Yan's fiance,
Su Nian Qin.

73
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:04,011
Nice to meet you, brother-in-law.

74
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:06,572
Why are you so tacky today?

75
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,228
Aren't you the classy Su?

76
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:09,531
Where's your classiness?

77
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:13,294
In that case,
I will make a toast to you, Su Nian Qin.

78
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,200
This is a toast to my brother-in-law.

79
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,389
Don't try to stop me.

80
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,382
Okay.

81
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,073
But honey, you can't...

82
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:26,470
You drink, Wei Hao.

83
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,815
After I make a toast, you drink.

84
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,161
Then I will make a toast
to my brother-in-law too.

85
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:51,670
No problem.

86
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,887
I will drink for him.

87
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,215
-We will leave now.
-We will leave now.

88
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,891
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

89
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:14,378
He can't even drink
yet he still insisted.

90
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,762
What a great couple.

91
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,082
Wu Yan. Your ride is here.

92
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:21,553
Get in, Wu Yan.

93
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,750
I'll call this ride for you
using my account.

94
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:27,053
I will go now.

95
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,361
You be good.

96
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:33,688
I am here. Where are you going?

97
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:37,734
Okay, okay.

98
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,085
Go back with me.

99
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,553
Wu Yan, you...

100
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,671
Let's leave this couple alone.

101
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,856
But...

102
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:11,474
Come in.

103
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,562
Here.

104
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,164
You...

105
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,866
Don't talk.

106
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,726
Hold on.

107
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,713
Go.

108
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,625
Be quiet. Be quiet now.

109
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,780
Be quiet.

110
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,856
What are you looking at?

111
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,242
You hid the photos, didn't you?

112
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,220
Where are they?

113
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,130
Stop it.

114
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,294
You removed all the photos?

115
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,249
No.

116
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,984
There's nothing here.

117
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,272
Su Nian Qin.

118
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,873
All these years, you sent someone
to take photos of me.

119
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:47,962
Do you admit it?

120
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,917
What photos?

121
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:56,516
Those photos that Ms Xiao Lu obtained?

122
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:00,285
I never saw them.

123
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,509
I dare not do so.

124
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,650
I was afraid
I would rush to you if I saw them.

125
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,275
That is why you couldn't
recognised me back then.

126
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:15,259
I could.

127
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,847
Actually, I have practised it beforehand
about what I should do.

128
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,701
But...

129
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,998
But, I saw you with my own eyes,

130
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,927
I chickened out.

131
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,517
You are lying.

132
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:38,606
You never saw my photos.
How could you recognise me?

133
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,253
I remember your voice.

134
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,969
And also your smell.

135
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,818
Many times...

136
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:51,828
throughout the years,

137
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,027
because I can clearly feel you are gone,

138
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,432
I actually didn't feel like
doing anything...

139
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,004
or wanting to live.

140
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,254
But I need to live on...

141
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,307
because I have responsibilities
to fulfil.

142
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:18,162
Hence I could only tell myself
to pretend that you never left.

143
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,661
That you were by my side,
just in a different way.

144
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,973
I sound like a psycho,

145
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:32,415
don't I?

146
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,005
But this psycho loves me.

147
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,692
What can I do?

148
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,150
♪Dreams of a light year♪

149
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,740
♪Is as vast as the sadness♪

150
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,580
♪The earth is quiet♪

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,080
♪Like the eyes of the stars♪

152
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,140

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,900
♪Every expression on your face♪

154
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,580
♪This way it won't shatter♪

155
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,900
♪The heart♪

156
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:53,479
Wu Yan.

157
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,133
Wu Yan.

158
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:58,053
Wu Yan. What time is it? You had so much
fun until you forgot your time?

159
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,211
Quick!

160
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,414
Cover yourself.

161
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,333
No, go back in. Cover yourself.

162
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:10,159
Oh, my goodness.

163
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,550
Why are you shouting at me
early in the morning?

164
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,491
I only came back after my gathering
ended at midnight.

165
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:16,721
I am so sleepy.

166
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:18,358
Let me sleep a little longer.

167
00:15:18,438 --> 00:15:20,702
You're a grown-up now
yet you still party so hard.

168
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,561
How can I not worry?

169
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:32,714
You are unbelievable.

170
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,931
I must be blinded.

171
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:36,601
Get up quick.

172
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,862
I am still drunk.

173
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,346
My head hurts.

174
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:43,634
Don't you always drink excessively?

175
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:45,713
How come you still get drunk so easily?

176
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,199
I need some clothes.

177
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,888
I can't wear this anymore.

178
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:56,883
Okay.

179
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,975
Let's see.

180
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:09,625
It fits you well.

181
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,893
You bought this for me?

182
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,232
Stop asking and get changed first.

183
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,873
Why are you taking off your clothes?

184
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,472
How should I get changed
if I don't take off my clothes?

185
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,261
You've got a point.

186
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:27,602
I was too nervous.

187
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,083
Here you go. Quickly change into it.

188
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:51,764
Wu Yan.

189
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,109
Sang Wu Yan!

190
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,895
Wait. I...

191
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,432
You were fast in reaching out for help.

192
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,511
I am sorry, aunt.

193
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,023
It was my fault.

194
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,144
I didn't look after Wu Yan properly
and allowed her drink so much last night.

195
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:48,923
That is not the main point.

196
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,190
I won't ask
why you brought a man home for now.

197
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,527
Who is this man?

198
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,747
He is my boss.

199
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,835
How did it go? Did she get scolded?

200
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,050
You already got chased out from the house,
of course she will get scolded.

201
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,287
Pity me.

202
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,790
What did I do wrong?

203
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,837
If it's not for my future,

204
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,362
I would have quit my job.

205
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,562
I heard that.

206
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:43,774
No, no.

207
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:48,200
Buddy.

208
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,694
Don't worry too much.

209
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:51,508
Regarding this hurdle
of your mother-in-law,

210
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,994
steel yourself and just tough it out.

211
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:00,723
Wait a minute.

212
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,230
I remembered that you were the one
who forced me to drink last night.

213
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,041
He is my ex-boyfriend.

214
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,388
You even came all the way
to argue with me at that time.

215
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:27,664
Don't you remember?

216
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,054
Didn't you say that he was blind?

217
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,519
And that he was an orphan?

218
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,918
I had told you at that time.
He is not an orphan.

219
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,155
He has a family.

220
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:42,057
Also, he got his sight back now.

221
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,646
So you lied to me?

222
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,323
I didn't lie to you, I...

223
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:49,160
This is a complicated matter.

224
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,374
It's also a long story to begin with.

225
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,846
But Mum, three years have passed.

226
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,016
You know that...

227
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,524
I still like him from the beginning
till the end.

228
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:02,497
Maybe he is not within your standards.

229
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:06,571
But I've already decided to spend my life
with him.

230
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,088
I am sorry, aunt.

231
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:22,413
It is my fault.

232
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,515
Mum, I'll see him off first.

233
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,450
I will talk to you later.

234
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,435
Go.

235
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:29,615
Quick.

236
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,412
Don't worry.

237
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,195
I will give you a call once I am done.

238
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:51,173
You should go back in.

239
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,908
They are taking forever
to see each other off.

240
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:18,436
Who is this person?

241
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,672
Who is he to make Wu Yan lose her mind?

242
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:25,703
Aunt.

243
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:28,357
He's actually just a normal handsome guy.

244
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:29,741
And a little rich.

245
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,738
Handsome guy?

246
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,772
Both of you only care about looks.

247
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,450
Aunt. I feel wronged.

248
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,216
I am already married to Wei Hao.

249
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,055
How could you say that I only care looks?

250
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,161
What?

251
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:56,435
He is indeed...

252
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,829
quite good looking.

253
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,644
Just like Wu Yan's father back then.

254
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:25,407
Don't hide and make calls in the room.

255
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:28,089
Don't think I don't know
what you are up to.

256
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:29,415
Got it. I won't call him.

257
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,045
Go to bed.

258
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:52,947
How did it go?

259
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,201
What do you mean?

260
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,338
It's nothing. She just nagged at me.

261
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:01,617
It's really nothing.

262
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,992
If she scolds me badly,

263
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:05,539
that means this matter
is not that serious.

264
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,166
Think about this question instead.

265
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:09,481
Do you want to treat me
to a movie tomorrow?

266
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:12,515
I said,

267
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:15,164
do you want to treat me
to a movie tomorrow?

268
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,888
What movie do you want to watch?

269
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:20,703
You were the one who wanted
to watch a movie last time.

270
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,212
You have not picked one yet?

271
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,303
In that case, start thinking about
which movie we will start with tomorrow.

272
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
I almost forgot.

273
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,218
This was in my pocket the whole time.

274
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,364
Here you go.

275
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:12,660
The photos are still at my rented house.

276
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,915
Take this first.

277
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:15,728
Since you insisted on getting them
from me last night...

278
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,729
and wouldn't let me go
if I don't make a promise.

Have you been waiting for long?

297
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,643
It seems like the ice have already melted.

298
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:03,816
No.

299
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,477
Should I get you another one?

300
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,512
I don't feel like having
cold drinks anyway.

301
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:10,935
Let's go watch a movie now.

302
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,958
Why are there just the two of us here?

303
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:27,246
What movie did you pick?
Is the movie terrible?

304
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,734
That's why nobody came to watch it?

305
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:30,568
I booked the entire hall.

306
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:34,251
Alright, show's over.

307
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:36,561
You know, remember this one time, we...

308
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,590
Why are you looking at me?

309
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,821
Look at the screen.

310
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:04,859
Eyes on the screen.

311
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,623
Why did you fall asleep?

312
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,811
You didn't have enough sleep last night?

313
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:53,455
No.

314
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,592
It's too boring.

315
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:01,629
I actually prefer
having you tell me what's going on.

316
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,460
(Mum)

317
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,870
Hello, Mum?

318
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:12,475
Put him on the phone.

319
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:15,450
If not, you are not allowed
to go out next time.

320
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,796
I... Mum, please don't...

321
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:19,925
What are you doing?

322
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:23,507
Hello, aunt?

323
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:24,785
I am Nian Qin.

324
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,866
I will send her home on time.
Don't worry.

325
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,634
Okay, goodbye.

326
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,289
That's it?

327
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,116
That's it.

328
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,658
I...

329
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:52,762
Where are we going now?

330
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:53,922
It's time to go home.

331
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:55,489
Where did your guts go?

332
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,489
Are you going to give in
to my mother so quickly?

333
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,817
You should get going.

334
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:15,859
You still have a plane
to catch later, right?

335
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:19,520
I will watch you go upstairs.

336
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,972
You should get going first.

337
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:24,591
Okay then.

338
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:25,828
Go on.

339
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,056
Nian Qin.

340
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:13,192
You were more attractive last time.

341
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,405
Right now,

342
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:19,841
you are a little clingy. That's boring.

343
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:23,898
I will get going now without turning back.

344
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,739
I don't have time to go over.
I am so busy now.

345
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:00,758
Okay then.

346
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:02,793
We are grown-ups now.

347
00:31:02,873 --> 00:31:05,818
Let's not do celebrations
like those youngsters any more.

348
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:06,860
Okay?

349
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:09,385
Remember to take care of yourself.

350
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:10,835
Eat your meals on time.

351
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:12,347
Call me on time too.

352
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,489
Got it. I will hang up now.

353
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,083
Why are you here?

354
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:57,078
Why are you waiting out here?

355
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,623
It's cold. You should have
waited somewhere else.

356
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:01,164
What if you catch a cold?

357
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:04,402
I did that on purpose
to make your heart ache.

358
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:06,399
Madam,

359
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,475
my heart is already aching
when you've done nothing at all.

360
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,818
Didn't you say that you were busy?

361
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,002
You lied to me on purpose?

362
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:17,972
I wanted to give you a surprise.

363
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:22,152
You were freezing in this cold weather
just to give me a surprise?

364
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,505
If you'd told me earlier, I would have...

365
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,046
Su Nian Qin.

366
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:27,071
You are annoying sometimes.

367
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:29,748
You are dull and unromantic.

368
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:33,351
I don't even know why I fell for you.

369
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,185
You are right.

370
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:38,767
I still remember that someone
wrote a letter to scold me on air.

371
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:41,036
That person must have hated me a lot.

372
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,024
What's more annoying is
she can't help falling in love with me.

373
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,462
Do you really think that
the world can only revolve around you?

374
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,968
Isn't that true?

375
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:58,256
You're so smug.

376
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,443
I am so hungry. What are we eating later?

377
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:27,733
Anything that you like.

378
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,636
I think there is a short circuit.

379
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:36,821
Don't be afraid.

380
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,917
Which floor are we at?

381
00:33:40,997 --> 00:33:42,831
The elevator just moved
for a while just now.

382
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:44,782
I bet we are at the third or fourth floor.

383
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:46,972
Nian Qin.

384
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,017
I am here.

385
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,403
I am afraid.

386
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:02,613
Don't be afraid.

387
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,853
The lift is under
24-hour camera surveillance.

388
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,287
Someone will come shortly.

389
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,424
But what if they fell asleep?

390
00:34:09,504 --> 00:34:10,580
That won't happen.

391
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,989
Don't think too much.

392
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:13,583
Someone will be here anytime soon.

393
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:15,309
Previously,

394
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,322
I was in a similar situation like this
with Cheng Yin.

395
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:23,678
Did you get out immediately?

396
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:26,503
At that time,

397
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,018
we...

398
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:36,247
Later on, we...

399
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,593
Wu Yan.

400
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,082
Look at me. I am here.

401
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,975
Don't be afraid.

402
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,960
Let's talk about something else.

403
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,446
What do you want to eat later?

404
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,383
I am craving for something very spicy.

405
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:02,586
No.

406
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,922
It is bad for your stomach.

407
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:07,813
I want tomato noodles with egg then.

408
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:09,432
Why?

409
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:13,271
Because when the weather is cold,
my mother would make that for me.

410
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,525
Tomato noodles with egg.

411
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:18,379
When you take a few sips of the soup,
you'll feel warm.

412
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,513
Okay.

413
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,034
I can satisfy this craving of yours.

414
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,563
Do you still remember
the MP3 player that you gave me?

415
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,232
It contains a bunch of random stuff.

416
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,947
Yes.

417
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:36,340
Other than the recording
of your reading novels,

418
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,546
there are also
sounds of you shouting at me.

419
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:41,821
And also...

420
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,799
And also the song that you sang.

421
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:48,608
It was off pitch.
Do you have to look so entertained?

422
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,965
You are annoying.

423
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,927
If you were to sing the demos
for my songs previously,

424
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:56,088
no one would want them
even if I pay them to take it.

425
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,101
The way you speak is still so offensive.

426
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:01,241
Do you want me to do a live concert now?

427
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:02,347
Sure.

428
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:04,920
I think the most appealing part...

429
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,461
of your singing
is the true expression of emotions.

430
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,381
If the neighbours heard you sing,

431
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,784
they will be fighting over
your concert tickets.

432
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:13,916
Then,

433
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:17,175
I might have to move to another place.

434
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:19,765
Su Nian Qin, you...

435
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,349
We're sorry. Sorry to disturb.

436
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,191
Don't leave your shoes everywhere.

437
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:58,067
Do I look like a sloppy person?

438
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,616
Okay, Young Master Su.
How would I dare disobey you?

439
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,710
What are you doing?

440
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,064
I am making you tomato noodles with eggs.

441
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,458
You can cook?

442
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,337
It's impossible that you know how to cook.

443
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,923
Why is it impossible?

444
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,147
It smells so good.

445
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,707
It's hot.

446
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:04,820
Take your time.

447
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,468
You are still so impatient.

448
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,526
Why do you...

449
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,377
Of course.

450
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:30,700
You wouldn't remember it.

451
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:33,890
Help me tie up my hair.

452
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:36,498
Quick.

453
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,286
Nian Qin.

454
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,396
What do you think if...

455
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:58,197
I work as an anchor
for the radio station in Xiamen?

456
00:38:58,277 --> 00:38:59,354
What do you think?

457
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,366
What do you mean?

458
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:03,563
Do it if you want to.

459
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,356
Can't you answer me seriously?

460
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:12,492
Previously, my friends said that
I am not a professional anchor.

461
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:16,638
The show I did in that small radio station
didn't become a hit too.

462
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,672
Who told you that?

463
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,951
I think you should stop
being friends with them.

464
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:24,502
I mean it.

465
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:27,679
They don't see the potential in you
and don't even support your dreams.

466
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,019
Friends aren't like that.

467
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:33,712
What are you laughing at? Turn around.

468
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:34,896
Your hair is messy.

469
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,940
(East Lake Music Broadcast)

470
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,550
After you left, we continued
to make a few more episodes.

471
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,897
But it didn't last long.

472
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,002
Firstly, we weren't well prepared.

473
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:01,950
Secondly,

474
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,191
we lack someone willing to put effort in.

475
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:06,761
It is quite a pity.

476
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:10,658
Actually, this is the show that I created.

477
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:12,354
I should be responsible for it.

478
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,823
That is why...

479
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,497
Xi, I want to come back.

480
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:42,226
I started to work as an anchor
at that radio station...

481
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,168
after I graduated.

482
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:46,798
Why don't you look
happy and excited for me?

483
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:50,245
I only know that
someone is leaving again tomorrow.

484
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:54,548
This is for you.

485
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,950
The candy has melted
because your palm is hot.

486
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:22,637
How did you learn to read these?

487
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:25,905
By reading them slowly.

488
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:27,933
After you left,

489
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,806
I told myself that...

490
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:36,057
I must achieve something impressive
so that I can prove myself to your mother.

491
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,784
But when I started
handling our family business,

492
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,240
I knew nothing about it.

493
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,751
I can't even understand
what's written on the contracts.

494
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:49,026
I didn't know what I was doing
and messed everything up.

495
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,989
Did your father give you an earful?

496
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,614
He is not afraid of losing money.

497
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:57,198
He was just worried that I'd quit.

498
00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:00,970
He knows how stressful
it is in this industry.

499
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,391
Later on, someone told me that
drinking can relieve stress.

500
00:42:08,988 --> 00:42:10,673
Who dare to fool you like that?

501
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:12,037
I will hunt him down.

502
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:14,530
You better not drink any more.

503
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:16,719
I can't do that.

504
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,723
I must be drunk tonight.

505
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,213
Why?

506
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:22,696
Why do you think so?

507
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,490
You...

508
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,077
Don't act like a spoiled child.

509
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,228
Focus on your work.

510
00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:29,669
We will see each other and have fun
during Chinese New Year.

511
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,220
What fun can we have
during Chinese New Year?

512
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:35,805
You are on mute now.

513
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:38,662
Stop babbling. Go back to work.
