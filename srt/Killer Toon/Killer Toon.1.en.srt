TO Mi-sook I like you.

33
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,145
I like you.

34
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,319
Mi-soak.

35
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,242
Mi-soak.

36
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,500
Black monster!

37
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,590
It's a ghost!

38
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:56,964
Mi-soak.

39
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,633
Don't see!

40
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,932
- So disgusting!
- Why are you here?!

41
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,053
Ghost?

42
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,931
That woman's the ghost!

43
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,057
Whose mom?

44
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,142
Mi-sook, I think.

45
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,144
Yeah, you didn't know?

46
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,562
- Let's go.
- Why?

47
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,657
- Want Mi-sook as a friend?
- No.

48
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:16,857
Then let's go.

49
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,943
Alright, so disgusting.

50
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,238
- She's a monster!
- Yuck!

51
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,239
So irritating!

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,584
I'd rather just kill myself..

53
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,678
So embarrassing,
I wish mom was dead.

54
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,899
MQfn!

55
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,039
Mom! Mom! Don't die! Mom!

56
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,953
The black monster is her mom.

57
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,037
I'd rather die.

58
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,757
So irritating!

59
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:23,929
Mom...

60
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,474
Die...

61
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,644
Please...

62
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,269
JUSt die!

63
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,032
Your call cannot be connected,

64
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,334
please leave a message...

65
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,662
Ms. Kang, I saw the manuscript.

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,497
Ms. Kang...

67
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,166
Kang ji-yurl,

68
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,590
how do you know

69
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,717
the secret of my mom's death?

70
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,056
Only she and I were there.

71
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,603
So how the hell do you know?!

72
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,647
How did you find out?!

73
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,746
Is someone there?

74
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,536
Who is it?

75
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,242
Anyone there?
Please open the door!

76
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,117
Hello? Anyone there?

77
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,573
Hello?!

78
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,758
Who are you?

79
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,766
Why are you doing this to me?

80
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,766
Who is it? Come out! Come out!

81
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,106
Kang! Is that you?!

82
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:40,672
KILLER TOON.

83
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,504
Suh Mi-sook,
head of Daum webcomic,

84
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,343
she was 39 years old.

85
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,762
Estimated time
of death is 1 a. m..

86
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,096
According to the security log,

87
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,467
she was alone in the office

88
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,343
until she was discovered
by a janitor at 6.

89
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,015
That all you got?

90
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,685
And that CCTV.

91
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,441
I combed the footage,

92
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,482
but after 11 p.m.,
no one else came in or out.

93
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,693
And that?

94
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,364
It's... not possible to
exit through there.

95
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,703
Then it's obvious Suicide.

96
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,838
Let's notjump to conclusions.

97
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,792
And this?

98
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,044
It's locked, so not yet.

99
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,384
Should I look into
probable cause first?

100
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:31,927
Sure.

101
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,057
Check the call log,
question her colleagues.

102
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,222
Regardless...

103
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,314
of the outcome,
you handle the case.

104
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,686
What?

105
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:49,863
Captain and I have
promotion to think of.

106
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,280
Promotion?

107
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,529
And since you're primary,
you'll take the heat?

108
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,078
You're fully capable of
handling a suicide case,

109
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,621
prick.

110
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,414
Boss!

111
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,498
What now?

112
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,752
You should come check this out.

113
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,723
Are you alone?
It's dangerous out here.

114
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,266
Running an errand.

115
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,312
Miss, my house is
just up this way,

116
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,610
could you drive me?

117
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:25,208
You're such a nice kid,
do you live nearby?

118
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,877
Yeah, that Hog Farm.

119
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,345
Pretty shoes What's your name?

120
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:34,884
Mi-jin.

121
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,889
Mi-jin.

122
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,850
Pretty name too,
how old are you?

123
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,352
16

124
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,893
Liar.

125
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,018
You look no more than 10.

126
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,528
That's when I died.

127
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,234
What?

128
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,369
Help me.

129
00:12:59,404 --> 00:12:59,948
Help me.

130
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,690
Hog Farm Area contaminated.

131
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,826
- She's clean.
- What?

132
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,034
Corpses are the best witnesses
but this one's a mute.

133
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,125
No sign of intrusion
at the scene?

134
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,081
None.

135
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,706
Prints on the knife
were all hers.

136
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,003
Same thing here.

137
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,671
Cause of death is severing of
carotid artery here,

138
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,174
with the Xacto knife
in her hand.

139
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:30,139
From the way it looks,
she must've punctured it.

140
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,981
What is that?

141
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,067
Nothing, go on.

142
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,692
What baffled me...
is this part.

143
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:43,031
It was inflicted before death,
must've been very painful.

144
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,910
So you're saying.

145
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,657
It's self inflicted?

146
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,793
- Are you insane?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,666
Insanity is the only answer.

148
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,549
Scientifically,
it's definitively a suicide.

149
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,468
My instincts say it's a murder!

150
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,304
Your instincts?

151
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,926
You're at it again?

152
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,432
Asshole, I'm not falling
for it any more.

153
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,897
You know the new commissioner?

154
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:13,514
Yeah.

155
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,810
He likes big, bold
headline cases.

156
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,436
Of course.

157
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,480
You idiot.

158
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,576
Then this is the perfect case.

159
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,035
A famous artist's work
unfolds in real life.

160
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,409
Can't you feel it?

161
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,128
So play up the media with this?

162
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,169
Right.

163
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,419
Whatever happens,
we'd be linked to big cases.

164
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,261
Woke up somewhere else again?

165
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,348
Yes.

166
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,681
An unfamiliar road this time.

167
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,101
Don't even remember driving.

168
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,604
Was it a nightmare?

169
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,115
It doesn't feel like
a dream any more.

170
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,820
Not a nightmare, but real life.

171
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,954
Like in the dream,
things disappear,

172
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,754
and I wake up with
mysterious scars.

173
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,426
Heard of
Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome?

174
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:28,761
It's a syndrome that the author
Lewis Carroll suffered.

175
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,095
The fictional world and
reality collide

176
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,648
and the wall of reality collapses,

177
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:42,984
it's a symptom that
artists sometimes get.

178
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,947
As dreams and reality collide,

179
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,573
it affects your senses.

180
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,991
Rest is the best treatment,
so take it easy.

181
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:02,124
Yeah, let's rest rest.

182
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,762
Embalmerjo.

183
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,095
Electrocuted while
working on subway rail.

184
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,947
Shit!

185
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,707
Fuck me.

186
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,834
That startled me.

187
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,553
Made contact?

188
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,849
Yes, I notified the victim's family.

189
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,676
But it was so awkward.

190
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,262
They kept saying she had
no reason to kill herself...

191
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,394
No, I meant the artist!

192
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,067
Her cell phone's still off.

193
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,274
No other contact info?

194
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,360
Coroner ruled it a suicide?

195
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,949
Should I write it up?

196
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,494
Yo, useless prick
just do what you're told.

197
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,376
Ruled a suicide no evidence,

198
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,086
there's no case here.

199
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,546
You just sit back,
I'll take care of it.

200
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:29,886
Take care of what?

201
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,050
Finally, now you want to
work efficiently?

202
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,558
Only took 3 years under you.

203
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,771
Forget it.

204
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,563
I submitted the report,
just work on case plan.

205
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,436
I got a kid on the way
next month.

206
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,606
Why is that relevant?

207
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,070
Well, it's just...

208
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,234
What?

209
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,951
I need paternity leave too
I'll take good...

210
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,787
You're a real piece of work.

211
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,456
Paternity leave my ass.

212
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,204
Ms. Suh!

213
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,711
Ms. Suh!

214
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,854
This is really unexpected
Please come inside.

215
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,683
I left my cell phone off...

216
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,330
Anyone home?

217
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,668
Ms. Kang ji-yun?

218
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,414
I'm from the police.

219
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,461
Suicide?

220
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,174
The Ms. Suh I know
would never do that.

221
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,182
Do you always work here?

222
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,767
Yes.

223
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,607
Then,

224
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,614
did you draw this here too?

225
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,822
How do you have that?

226
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,123
It was the last thing
she saw before her demise.

227
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,453
Was it your manuscript?

228
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,461
Yes, I sent it
as soon as it was done.

229
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:55,292
Has anyone seen this
other than you two?

230
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,507
Probably not
I uploaded it to her server,

231
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,552
and the designers get it
after her approval.

232
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,803
- Maybe someone you...
- Never.

233
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,894
Not one.

234
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,849
Not a single person.

235
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,934
Perhaps an intern
or a visitor to the studio...

236
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,311
Never!

237
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,906
I work here alone.

238
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:26,114
I sign my work
with my blood as a seal.

239
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,372
Blood?

240
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,460
People say I'm making
a big deal,

241
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,499
but my work is a part of me,
it's very symbolic.

242
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,466
What's this all about?

243
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,804
You were the last person
she called.

244
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,059
I didn't receive it.

245
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,859
After submitting it
I turn my phone off.

246
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,158
_ Hey! ' L811 g9!

247
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,161
These are Ms. Suh's
autopsy photos.

248
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,162
The coroner ruled it a suicide,

249
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,709
but I don't think
she killed herself.

250
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,669
Because of this.

251
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,216
This is the fatal stab wound.

252
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,965
It's an inch deep
into the neck.

253
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,890
It's not just a stab wound
but a hole bored into her.

254
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:34,228
Before she died
her face was slashed...

255
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,399
many times,
and they're self inflicted.

256
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:45,660
It's the same method as
your protagonist's death.

257
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,111
One more thing.

258
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,578
Look.

259
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,579
Spirits playing a trick?

260
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,713
At first I thought
it was a copycat.

261
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,591
Where were you on that night?

262
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:10,014
Home... I was working at home.

263
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,178
Can you verify that?

264
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,436
Boss!

265
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,942
It's Suh's last call.

266
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,192
She left a voice message.

267
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,782
Ms. Kang, I saw the manuscript.

268
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,576
Ms. Kang...

269
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:36,203
how do you know the secret of
my mom's death?

270
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,170
Only she and I were there.

271
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,040
So how the hell...

272
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,634
I've never told
anyone in my life!

273
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,295
So how the hell do you know?!

274
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,930
The fictional world
and reality collide,

275
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,350
and the wall of reality collapses...

276
00:25:55,471 --> 00:26:00,773
It's the same method as
your protagonist's death.

277
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,960
Embalmerjo.

278
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,330
Electrocuted while
working on subway rail.

279
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,136
Moron.

280
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,682
What is it?

281
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,024
This is... you can make calls,
browse the Internet,

282
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:45,696
and most importantly,
you can read comics.

283
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:46,905
Heard of webcomics?

284
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,194
Dumbass, still reading
kiddie books?

285
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,860
Act your age!

286
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,506
Fuck that,
you're a techno illiterate.

287
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,534
Fuck what?! Whatcha call me?

288
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,245
Don't do that! It will break!

289
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,702
Just marry it, why don't you!

290
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,875
This right here is a phone.

291
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,965
Hello, Best Funeral Home.

292
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,134
Where?

293
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,004
Okay, Electrocution?

294
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,218
The paramedics didn't do...

295
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,466
No, we can take care of it.

296
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,351
Okay, thank you.

297
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,395
It's double! Hear that?

298
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,265
I, it's my grandma's
memorial service.

299
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,476
Hwa-sook again?

300
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,524
- She's just a friend.
- You useless shit.

301
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,480
I loved my grandma!

302
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,484
Forget it, dumb-ass,
what's the point?

303
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,820
Generosity is wasted
on the living.

304
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:39,492
At least the dead put
food on my table.

305
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,242
Know that?

306
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,245
Go to Hwa-sook.

307
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,749
Drop me off then.

308
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:57,976
Daughter?

309
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,599
How did you know?

310
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,936
It doesn't have the thing
Penis.

311
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,646
These are private matters!

312
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,610
I'm justjealous that's all.

313
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,615
Congrats, prick.

314
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,537
For what?

315
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,207
You wanted out of this case

316
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,871
for paternity leave and shit.

317
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,796
I'm sending you to
unit ♪2 as support.

318
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,331
You're luring me?

319
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,545
I work just fine

320
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,091
without a useless prick like you.

321
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,305
It's so weird.

322
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,891
I know you're not that smart,

323
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,433
but your instincts
and timing are perfect.

324
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,181
Enough, buddy.

325
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,685
Why don't you just ask politely?

326
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,653
Let's work this case, please.

327
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,779
Let's work the case,
you useless prick.

328
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,451
I accept your request.

329
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,824
Thank you very much.

330
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,872
To celebrate!

331
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:04,918
What is it?

332
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,041
Proof that you still got it.

333
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,589
I met Suh's family
and found this.

334
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,013
It's identical to Kang's comic.

335
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,939
Shit!
Your skin's gonna peel off!

336
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,276
Goddammit!

337
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,946
Double pay is hardly enough!

338
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,700
That idiot's screwing
a living bitch, and I'm here...

339
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,167
What's this?

340
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,379
That fucking idiot
left this in here?

341
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,507
He's gonna bitch at me
for breaking it.

342
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,126
What a piece of shit!

343
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,761
Even this pisses me off.

344
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,408
Wait, the legs were...

345
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,415
What the hell...

346
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,289
I'm drunk.

347
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,922
Shit!

348
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,719
I must be drunk.

349
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,099
If you're dead,
just go to hell in peace.

350
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,192
Startling me and shit.

351
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,315
I gotta quit drinking.

352
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,121
Now it works.

353
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,285
A good ol' beating is
always the answer.

354
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,324
Taking care of the sick
is scarier than hell...

355
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,830
Taking care of the sick
is scarier than hell...

356
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,337
You'd be called a Buddha.

357
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,715
If you did that for 10 years.

358
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,337
You did all you can
for her in 5 years.

359
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,843
Know what I thought
after her passing?

360
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,767
'Now...

361
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,273
I can sleep peacefully
for once'.

362
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,567
Shit.

363
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,366
That was it.

364
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,381
Sir.

365
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,389
Should we start?

366
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,563
Go outside.

367
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,897
Sir?

368
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,818
I'll do it myself, so go away!

369
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,438
NQW!

370
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,750
Honey...

371
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,601
Goddammit...

372
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,462
Help me, please.

373
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,632
Honey... please...

374
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,975
Grant mercy and peace!

375
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,266
To the deceased!

376
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,982
Please! Sweetie! Let me live!

377
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:24,067
Do me this favor!

378
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,457
Suh's mom, this diary,
they all existed...

379
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:43,215
And she died
as seen in the comic.

380
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,003
If the work was not released,

381
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,175
then Kang's the only suspect.

382
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,845
But only Suh's prints were

383
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,185
recovered at the scene.

384
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,772
It can't be premeditated.

385
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,147
- Gotta be something...
- Then what's your take?

386
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,316
What?

387
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,239
Electrocuted while
working on subway rail.

388
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,971
Boss, it's the same.

389
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,138
Can't be!

390
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,391
Dammit, where is this?!

391
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:09,840
Let go! Let go of me!

392
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,937
Grant mercy and peace!
To the deceased!

393
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,569
What was that?

394
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,281
Come out, now!

395
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,473
Bus Route 3418.

396
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,563
Police Hospital.

397
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,656
Okay, call all hospitals
with a morgue.

398
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,666
He must be working
at one of them, got that?

399
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,996
Boss! You actually believe this?

400
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,625
You trust my instincts, right?

401
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,999
This is insane!

402
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,188
Come out!

403
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,425
OPEN up! Open!

404
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,284
OPEN up!

405
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,229
Police hospital? I got it.

406
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,895
Can civies enter
a police hospital?

407
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,651
It's still a hospital.

408
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,112
Kang's not answering.

409
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,071
Keep trying!

410
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,998
Police Hospital.

411
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,535
Boss, this way.

412
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,251
I'm sorry...

413
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,592
Don't kill me.

414
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,210
Please stop!

415
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,114
Mister!

416
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,620
Are you okay?

417
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,666
Sir!

418
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,089
Please... please!

419
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,512
Go away!

420
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,015
Goddamn fuck I said I'm sorry.

421
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,816
Please, I'm begging you.

422
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,546
Spare me.

423
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,377
Spare me.

424
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,383
Don't move!

425
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,145
- Ms. Kang.
- He's dead.

426
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,726
You are under arrest
for the murder of )0 Sun-KL.

427
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,577
So.

428
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,573
You went there to save him?

429
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,829
That's your claim?

430
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,331
Yes.

431
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,750
By analyzing your drawings?

432
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,919
Cos ghost in the comic
will kill him?

433
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,671
So the ghost was the killer?

434
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:38,347
I'm not sure what it was,
but...

435
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,106
- a woman...
- Ms. Kang.

436
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,736
Why did you lie to me?

437
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,157
You claimed you were at home
when Suh was killed.

438
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:01,161
And got arrested
at the scene ofjo's death,

439
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,784
but you blame it on a ghost?

440
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,003
It was you all along!

441
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,296
No!

442
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,208
Why would I kill them?

443
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,630
Why?

444
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,463
Ms. Kang... Kangji-yU/Y,

445
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,966
how do you know the secret of
my mom's death?

446
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,554
And it's verified that.

447
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,930
Jo embalmed his wife himself.

448
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,065
It can't be...

449
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,779
It's all made up...

450
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,156
A figment of my imagination.

451
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,490
Imagination?

452
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,994
Then how do you explain this?

453
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,290
I thought it was
a copycat murder at first,

454
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,920
but...

455
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,504
how do you explain
the details of her life?

456
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:52,583
That's...

457
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,011
Reveal someone's big secret
to create a big hit,

458
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,013
and as if that's not enough,

459
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,848
if your comic came true,
then it'd be a sensation.

460
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,009
How close am I?

461
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:02,927
No, I could never.

462
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,896
Past and the future unfold
exactly as your work,

463
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,936
who else can explain this better?

464
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,393
No, I didn't kill anyone.

465
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,692
You planned and carried out
these killings!

466
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,531
- No, no.
- You killed them!

467
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,865
You created these stories!

468
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:20,237
They're not mine! I just...

469
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,782
I just copied...

470
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,159
Copied?

471
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,249
My stories...

472
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,007
aren't mine.

473
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,889
They're not.

474
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,395
It was this time last year.

475
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,776
My "History of Lunacy" was
a huge success.

476
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,161
Not only online
but as a book too.

477
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:05,327
My readers revered me,

478
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,418
and Daum signed me
with the highest advance,

479
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,420
even without a project
in the works.

480
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:16,342
But my happiness
didn't last long,

481
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,754
because my mind went
complete blank.

482
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:19,468
Editor-in-chief 5 because
my mind went complete blank.

483
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:19,587
Editor-in-chief 5.

484
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:19,758
Editor-in-chief 5 I could
not draw a single image.

485
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:22,553
I could not draw
a single image.

486
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,146
Then only day,
I received an e-mail.

487
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,442
I thought it was spam,
so I erased it at first.

488
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:39,445
But it contained the story
that I wanted to draw.

489
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,068
I never found out who sent it.

490
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,911
Or why it was sent to me.

491
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,701
And those images were

492
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:50,497
never before seen by anyone.

493
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:57,083
Soon I waited desperately
all day for the e-mail.

494
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:23,160
My greed as an artist
trumped my conscience.

495
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,155
It's the same,
like it was photocopied.

496
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,161
Det. Kim!

497
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,750
Det. Kim!

498
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,668
Yeah, what?

499
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,041
Whatcha doing?

500
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,793
I... am a fan, actually.

501
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,178
I'm thinking of taking one.

502
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,672
Sir! This is a crime scene!

503
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:49,473
I kid, I kid! So prickly.

504
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,185
- Got everything?
- Of course.

505
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,182
Everything's here on the PC.

506
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,601
Brass balls on her.

507
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:01,105
People went nuts over her,
but she's a total fraud.

508
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,696
There's more upstairs
Please take a look.

509
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,034
Sure.

510
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,291
Boss, it's Young-su.

511
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,208
Yes, we got the evidence.

512
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,538
Okay,

513
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:21,335
check the [P of the sender
and get the real address.

514
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,018
6 years ago...

515
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,525
Seriously? You're a cop now!

516
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,272
Yeah! I passed! I passed!

517
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,570
Amazing! I love you!

518
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,535
Finally, I'm not
a freeloader any more!

519
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,201
- Awesome!
- This is it!

520
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,246
Let's get married!

521
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,081
I'm gonna tell dad,
don't hang up!

522
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,621
All right.

523
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:02,171
Dad! Young-su got into
the academy!

524
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,761
Young-su, baby!
I'm proud of you!

525
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,620
Hog Farm.

526
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,660
Excuse me.

527
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,657
Are you the detective?

528
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,578
What's wrong with it?

529
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,666
Looks like someone split
a wire from this addy.

530
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,006
Bootlegged?

531
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,421
Who knows,
but the way it looks,

532
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,922
it's been there
for a few years.

533
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,391
Why didn't we know about it?

534
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,351
So where is it?

535
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:41,604
Judging by the wirework,
it's up that direction,

536
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,351
to the Happy Mansion.

537
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,191
That place?

538
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:49,903
So, we're done?

539
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,864
Let's go, get the stuff, hurry!

540
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,321
Wait, you gotta come,

541
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,914
how do I know where to go?

542
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:00,535
It's right there,
why should we go there?

543
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,748
Hurry LIP!

544
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,221
That area was abandoned

545
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,561
even before the redevelopment plan.

546
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,055
- Why?
- Because!

547
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,144
It's haunted!

548
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,184
Haunted?

549
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,061
You don't believe me?

550
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,772
Go look at the mural
Check it out.

551
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:33,572
Mural?

552
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,284
Go see it for yourself!

553
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,042
They erased it 'cos it's a bad omen,
but it's not all gone.

554
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,412
And the haunted part?

555
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:50,919
One day, a girl drew a picture,

556
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:54,593
then a kid really died
the way it was drawn.

557
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,263
After that, there were rumors
that she was possessed,

558
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,266
that she talked to ghosts.

559
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,934
Then what?

560
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,233
She was lynched by other kids,

561
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:10,947
and the villagers went
nuts over her.

562
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:15,113
She started a fire
in the building and left.

563
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:19,576
Was her name Kangji-yun?

564
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:21,873
No, it wasn't.

565
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,792
Her dad was an embalmer,

566
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,374
surname was jo, I think.

567
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,800
Boss!

568
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,179
Like Young-su said, Jo Sun-ki
lived in that building.

569
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,673
And that runaway daughter...

570
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,468
Happy Mansion ♪301
And that runaway daughter...

571
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:39,635
Happy Mansion ♪301.

572
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:40,134
Happy Mansion ♪507
she was reported missing.

573
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:40,305
She was reported missing.

574
00:53:40,306 --> 00:53:42,385
Jo Suh-hyun
she was reported missing.

575
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:42,511
Jo Suh-hyun

576
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:43,351
jo Suh-hyun
Interesting thing is,

577
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:43,852
jo Suh-hyun.

578
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,687
Kang also lived there
around that time.

579
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:47,602
Happy Mansion Kang also lived
there around that time.

580
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:47,813
Kang also lived there
around that time.

581
00:53:47,814 --> 00:53:48,104
Kangji-yun Kang also lived
there around that time.

582
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:49,477
"Kangji-J/U".

583
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:56,405
The victim, home address
All connected to Kang?

584
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,491
- She's still in interrogation?
- Yes.

585
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,532
Tell Young-su to standby,
I'm on my way.

586
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,660
Well, he, Young-su...

587
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:09,581
He rushed off to the hospital
with his wife...

588
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:10,589
What?

589
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,008
Should I get him?

590
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,335
Right this second!

591
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,595
We tracked down the IP.

592
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,012
Where?

593
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,849
Happy Mansion in jungreung.

594
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:28,019
Didn't you live there?

595
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:29,850
Yes.

596
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,194
And...

597
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,359
Recognize her?

598
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,706
How did you know the kid?

599
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:57,219
It was 5 years ago,
before my debut.

600
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,358
Style is not original,
but the story's the worst!

601
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,695
Can't follow anything,
and so dull!

602
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,530
JUSt give up!

603
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,199
Dozens of rejections,

604
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,068
and my efforts went to waste.

605
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,247
Money was drying up,
and I thought I was done,

606
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,373
when I met her.

607
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,789
Look at that crazy bitch!

608
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,583
Stop it!

609
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,123
Don't mess with
the ghost talker!

610
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,500
Move aside.

611
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,546
Just go!

612
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,260
Don't mess with her!

613
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,505
Crazy bitch!

614
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,890
Think you're all that?

615
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:46,802
I'll kill you!

616
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,015
Get back here!

617
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,233
Goddammit!
Buncha thumb suckers!

618
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,190
Hey, you okay?

619
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,114
Kiddo!

620
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,785
Stay here,
I'll fetch some meds.

621
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:32,481
Happy Birthday dear 5 -h yun,
Happy Birthday to you!

622
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:59,300
It's okay, Suh-hyun
I'll protect you.

623
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,593
It's okay.

624
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,929
That's how we began.

625
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,470
Sharing feelings of abandonment.

626
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:13,147
Or bonding over
morbid drawing style.

627
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,690
No.

628
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,521
She didn't even want to
talk about the drawings.

629
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:24,658
What we needed
was companionship.

630
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,083
So why did she
start a fire and run away?

631
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,044
That's a fabrication.

632
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,292
To kick us out.

633
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,461
My kid's dead
because of that witch!

634
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,878
No! It wasn't me...
Get back inside!

635
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,130
- I really didn't do...
- It's that bitch!

636
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,176
Don't!

637
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,514
You killed her!

638
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,178
Stop it! Don't do this!

639
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,394
You should die too! You better!

640
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,150
Bring my baby back!

641
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,610
Get out!

642
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,154
These two really are mad!

643
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,400
Hey!

644
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:11,030
The kid was run over by a truck,
like in her drawing!

645
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,701
She's possessed!

646
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,083
What the fuck! Stab me, go on!

647
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,123
Come on, man!

648
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,509
Possessed?

649
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,093
Afraid that you'll
share the same fate?

650
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,224
Crazy fucks!

651
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,639
Crazy?

652
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,519
Shall we find out
who's the crazy one?

653
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,688
Dunno who gave you permission
to set up shop here,

654
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,277
but if you don't leave.

655
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,692
I'll burn this place down!

656
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,150
- Let's leave.
- Shit! Dammit!

657
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:50,778
My daughter! Bring her back!

658
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:17,771
Stop that!

659
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,185
What? What? What?

660
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,278
I said stop!

661
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,745
Drink up!

662
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,454
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

663
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:49,553
A few days later,
there was a fire.

664
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,258
The day I won the contest...

665
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,186
It was arson,

666
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,944
and because she wasn't around,

667
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,361
people blamed her for it.

668
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,860
That was the end of us.

669
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,392
Look at that.

670
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,735
But, how?

671
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,203
Yeah, combine the Su-hyun
case with ours.

672
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,502
It looked like
she squatted there.

673
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,589
And request forensics
for tomorrow.

674
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:08,502
And Young-su?

675
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,719
Tell him to take
his paternity leave.

676
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,429
He'll know what it means.

677
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,264
Okay, good work.

678
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:23,397
You really think it's her?

679
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,267
The comic was a forgery.

680
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,484
Came from an e-mail,
and that brought us here.

681
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,065
And the image on the monitor,

682
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,818
you confirmed
it was drawn by her.

683
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,492
- She just drew...
- Ms. Kang!

684
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,662
Do you accept that
people die like the comics?

685
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:47,629
You say murdered by
ghosts, I say a human,

686
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,084
regardless,

687
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:52,255
Suh-hyun is
the source of all this.

688
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,341
She has no reason to kill.

689
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,927
Mr. )0, the deceased,

690
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,261
was once reported for
child abuse.

691
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,273
And the editor-in-chief...

692
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:10,228
we'll ask when we catch her.

693
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,150
But my biggest question is,

694
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,906
why she's making you
draw the comic.

695
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,132
How much?

696
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,011
- $12 please.
- I see.

697
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,594
Been a while, come to
the building yard - Suh-hyun.

698
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,677
- Thank you.
- Good bye.

699
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,979
What is it?

700
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,782
Got a call from Suh-hyun?

701
01:02:58,817 --> 01:02:59,534
Huh?

702
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,031
What's with the shock
on your face?

703
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:05,873
My smokes...

704
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,511
What are you doing?

705
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,023
Open this door!
Kang ji-yun, Hey!

706
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,070
Are you nuts?! Open the door!

707
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,659
Kang ji-yun! Stop right there!

708
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,575
Stop!

709
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,249
Triangulate Kang's
cell phone, now!

710
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,627
$-hyun?

711
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,966
$-hyun?

712
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,064
Suh-hyun.

713
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,690
$-hyun?

714
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,869
Been a while, come to...

715
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,212
Suh-hyun.

716
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,799
Suh-hyun.

717
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,117
- Yes, boss.
- Where you at?!

718
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:40,755
My wife... had a checkup
because of an irregularity...

719
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,832
So what, shithead!

720
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,134
It's her first pregnancy, so...

721
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,004
Forget it, we're fucked.

722
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:48,755
What?

723
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,515
Kang took off!

724
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:51,382
Seriously?

725
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,426
She may be an accomplice.

726
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,098
How did that happen?

727
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,060
I got out of the car
to get smokes.

728
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,775
In front of the restaurant?

729
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,315
Yeah, anyway,

730
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,859
I'm sorry to say,
but I need you to come in.

731
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,449
We'll be made men
once this case is solved.

732
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,281
I'm at the hospital...

733
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,040
How did that happen?

734
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,205
In front of the restaurant?

735
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,978
Ms. Kang Where's Suh-hyun?

736
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,028
I don't know.

737
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,941
- Really?
- Yes.

738
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,526
You didn't hide her?

739
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,195
I only know she went missing.

740
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,412
Missing...

741
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,885
Didn't you draw this with her?

742
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,637
No, I didn't.

743
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,352
So how did you know?

744
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,101
It's been 6 years.

745
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,652
Help me.

746
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,958
Mister.

747
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,077
Take my hand.

748
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:26,204
Help me.

749
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:36,594
It hurts.

750
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,475
Help me, please.

751
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,310
Hold on, I'll get you out.

752
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:48,519
Honey! Dad approved!

753
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:52,106
We can get married!

754
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,985
I'm so happy!
I can't believe it!

755
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,987
Are you ITBPPY?

756
01:09:59,278 --> 01:09:59,778
Yeah.

757
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,248
Honey, something wrong?

758
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,330
It's nothing.

759
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,250
All right, what do we do first?

760
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,624
Let's lock down the date!

761
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:16,255
Honey! I'm so happy,
I can't breathe!

762
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,477
Help me.

763
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:43,781
Shit.

764
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,999
It wasn't on purpose.

765
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,168
Isn't it her fault
for being there?

766
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,012
Why is it my fault?

767
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,849
Why should my life end

768
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,227
even before it starts over this?

769
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:15,734
How you two found out
is not important.

770
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,826
But it's important to
seal it forever.

771
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,036
Don't kill me.

772
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,750
Don't kill you?

773
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,046
What about me then?

774
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:41,473
What if it gets out? Fuck that.

775
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,017
And my unborn daughter?!

776
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,410
Saw a ghost when jo died?

777
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,707
Crazy bitch,
ghosts don't exist.

778
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,588
Help me.

779
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,500
Help me.

780
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,551
Help me, mister.

781
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,153
Stay back! Get away!

782
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,026
Ms. Kang Ms. Kang, wake up...

783
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,365
Boss...

784
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:25,465
Are you nuts?

785
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,722
Help me, boss.

786
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,347
Lower your gun first.

787
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,816
This isn't me...

788
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,152
What the hell are you saying!

789
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:44,739
I told you we shouldn't have
gotten involved!

790
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,777
Okay, let's drop the case.

791
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:53,744
The case is closed,
so lower your gun.

792
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:03,507
Mi-jin...

793
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,086
ghost...

794
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:10,806
Young-su...

795
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,884
Help me.

796
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,935
It's my fault.

797
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,890
Boss... Think about your child.

798
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,775
Your unborn child!

799
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,816
My baby...

800
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:26,730
Young-su.

801
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,351
Det. Kim's gun from the scene.

802
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,702
He kidnapped the suspect
who fled from you?

803
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,791
Yes.

804
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:27,008
And you got here
by tracking him down?

805
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:29,002
Yes.

806
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,513
But he shot himself
when you showed up?

807
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:34,848
It's...

808
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,510
not suicide.

809
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:38,510
What?

810
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,809
- Chief, any statement?
- Will you open the scene?

811
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,024
- Take care of it.
- Okay.

812
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,935
We'll make a statement soon.

813
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,147
Snap out of it, asshole!

814
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:53,276
You'll drag me down with you.

815
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,821
These were all suicides.

816
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,247
Got it?

817
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:04,041
He had a child on the way,
and he kills himself?

818
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,504
Son of a bitch!

819
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,676
You said you heard
gunshots, right?

820
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,592
About 3 shots.

821
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,469
Idiot!

822
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,268
He only fired
one shot, that's it!

823
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:27,898
The rest were still
in the magazine!

824
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,239
Young-su... said...

825
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,534
- a ghost...
- Shut up!

826
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,161
Are you nuts?

827
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,249
So a ghost killed a cop?

828
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:45,086
Listen to me,
logically speaking,

829
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,288
you're the primary suspect
in this case!

830
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,916
Got that?

831
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:55,923
Our heads will roll
if you keep this ghost shit up!

832
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,550
Dumbass...

833
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:07,896
You keep your mouth shut!

834
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,191
Young-su killed himself.

835
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,908
We'll put you in
protective custody.

836
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,499
Until the case is over,
do not talk to the media.

837
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,423
Did you find Suh-hyun?

838
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,214
An APB is out on her
We'll hear something soon.

839
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,128
- Take her home.
- Yes, sir.

840
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,223
Det. Choi, let's go.

841
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,021
Boss.

842
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,684
Yeah?

843
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,818
I found something weird
at the crime scene.

844
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,114
What is it?

845
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:48,038
While searching Kang's home,
Young-su was interested in this.

846
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,079
Mi-jin.

847
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,043
Ghost...

848
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:00,713
Mi-jin...

849
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,232
Boss, should I look into this too?

850
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:12,770
What is it?

851
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,899
If Suh was killed
like in the comic,

852
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,356
maybe there are other cases.

853
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:22,034
Useless prick,
do your fucking job.

854
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,952
That desperate to slack off?

855
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:52,972
15-ton truck runs over girl,
cause unknown.

856
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,317
It's green light,
please cross the street

857
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:02,324
2007, Unsolved cases.

858
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,361
Head of mental institution
found dead in bathtub.

859
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,578
Lawyer found dead,
no clear motive.

860
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,624
Shocking past and truth!
Vengeful ghost comes with a story.

861
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,334
"Kangji-J/U".

862
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,486
New e-mail.

863
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,429
My drawings...

864
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:17,020
they're stories of dead people.

865
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:23,147
After mom's death,
I was surrounded by corpses.

866
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,735
Dad said I reminded him of mom.

867
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:30,904
Get in there.

868
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:33,953
Don't come out.

869
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,872
You remind me of your mother.

870
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,665
What do you want me to do?!

871
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:46,045
I did all I could!
I did my best!

872
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,242
That's when I started

873
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,747
hearing the dead.

874
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:22,415
I never wanted any.

875
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,425
Stop, Suh-hyun, enough.

876
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:37,058
It'll be okay, I promise.

877
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,748
The drawings are great.

878
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:09,470
But story is the best,
it feels so alive.

879
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,133
This really is yours?

880
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,474
Of course.

881
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:23,521
I'm very confident
about the story.

882
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,978
Where's Kang, asshole?!

883
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:29,648
It was an emergency,
I had to use the toilet...

884
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,446
Goddamn fuck!

885
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:36,655
What's this?

886
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:40,125
Congrats,
publication date is out.

887
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,664
Seriously?

888
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,288
The title's "History of Lunacy"
Like it?

889
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,209
Of course!

890
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,799
I'll come by tomorrow
with the manuscript.

891
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:51,841
Thank you, thank you so much.

892
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:38,683
I'll burn them all!

893
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,686
Don't you dare take it outside!

894
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,015
Only as a reference?

895
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,767
Really?

896
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:53,198
You can't publish this!

897
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:55,409
They're stories of the dead!

898
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,869
My manuscript...

899
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:02,408
My manuscript... What
are you doing?! Stop!

900
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:06,916
Let me go My manuscript...

901
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,545
is burning.

902
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,711
No, those aren't yours!

903
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:19,808
No! They're mine!

904
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:22,936
Mine!

905
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,726
All mine.

906
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,227
“Nun.

907
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:33,279
No!

908
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:02,471
You can't...

909
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:30,912
Please...

910
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,508
Suh-hyun.

911
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:41,430
Suh-hyun.

912
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,225
Suh-hyun...

913
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:51,146
I won the comic contest.

914
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,482
Now we can live happily.

915
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:58,574
That's why I need this.

916
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,738
The dead, the dead!

917
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:05,080
I'll put these outside
and come back.

918
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:07,699
No!

919
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:11,624
You know the dead
are killing people.

920
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,373
Who cares who gets killed.

921
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:17,008
We're not the ones
killing them!

922
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:23,595
You understand me, right?

923
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:30,981
I'll be right back
I'll come back, okay?

924
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,396
JiWun!

925
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,001
Mine! They're mine!

926
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,015
No amount of effort
does a thing,

927
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:09,474
but it just happens for you.

928
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:17,736
Why must you waste your talent?

929
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,988
Are you nuts?

930
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:25,277
Then just give me that gift.

931
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:33,040
I'm the one...

932
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:36,046
who needs their stories.

933
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:40,001
Suh-hyun... I want it...

934
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:39,852
Yvyun, what happened?

935
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:42,525
Where's Suh-hyun? Where is she?

936
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:47,819
I didn't see her today.

937
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,175
Anything from
the basement sweep?

938
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,215
I got the results,
but it's weird.

939
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:09,055
Aside from your prints,
only Kang's showed up.

940
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,799
Not a single one of
Suh-hyun's prints.

941
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,676
Fuck, I knew it.

942
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:13,768
Sir?

943
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,515
Suh-hyun is dead.

944
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,399
What do you mean?

945
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,168
I'm sorry.

946
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,040
As with "History of Lunacy"

947
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:44,920
this new book is also a hit.

948
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:48,757
I've been wondering
while reading,

949
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,594
do you believe in ghosts?

950
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,676
- Ghosts?
- Yes.

951
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:57,845
I...

952
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,018
actually... don't.

953
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:03,104
You don't believe in ghosts?

954
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,562
I tell stories of ghosts,
but to be precise,

955
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:14,408
I used ghosts as a metaphor
to express the dark secrets

956
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:17,073
that we all have inside of us.

957
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:25,252
From petty mistakes
to grave wrongdoings,

958
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,880
we all live with guilt
in our lives.

959
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:38,845
Don't we all have at least one of
these stories in us?

960
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:32,648
Kang ji-yun.

961
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,484
You killed them all!

962
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:37,614
No.

963
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:41,115
Why do you think
they were suicides?

964
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:51,045
Because of those who care
for nothing but greed,

965
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:54,757
the dead wanted me.

966
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:57,673
No, you wanted them.

967
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,598
That's why you killed Suh-hyun.

968
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:18,403
It's all because of your greed.

969
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,120
- Greed?
- Yes!

970
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:27,873
That thirst for avarice!

971
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:32,545
Yeah?

972
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,380
You're any different?

973
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:39,965
What?

974
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,416
Help me...

975
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,213
You moron!

976
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:22,087
You wanna die? Is that it?!
You think this is...

977
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:20,607
No.

978
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:23,982
It was an accident.

979
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:26,279
At the time...

980
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,364
That's not the truth.

981
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,834
No! No!

982
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,292
I will kill you!

983
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:20,709
Young-su...

984
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:23,708
Young-su...

985
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:08,583
"Kang Ji-yun."

986
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:22,105
