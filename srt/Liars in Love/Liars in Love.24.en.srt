Sun Wei's original plan
was to go abroad with Chengzhen.

Since Sun Wei can leave Zhou Mingde,

72
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,100
she must have the evidence
of Zhou Mingde's crime.

118

It's normal for them to be unhappy.

119

I'm not a kid anymore.

138

When I grew up, I found that

142
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,870

for deceiving children.

143

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,340
Later,

193
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,790
you will see a lot of food you like.

194
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,560
Be good.

195
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,410
Stop sleeping.

196
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,540
We're almost there.

197
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,990
Brother.

198
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,790
Back then,

199
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
I wanted to save them.

200
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,340
But there was nothing I could do.

201
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,770
Yu,

202
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,160
how did you know about this?

203
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,580
Of course I know.

204
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,570
Did Zhang Ran tell you?

205
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,590
Because I am...

206
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,060
Zhang Ran.

207
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,160
You arranged a car accident

208
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,320
to kill me

209
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,350
when I came back to take Zhang's position.

210
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,510
You did it for fearing that

211
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,340
I might affect your plan
to steal the Zhou's Group.

212
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,940
You don't know, do you?

213
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,870
Yu was in the car.

214
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,260
Help him.

215
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,630
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:28,990
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,030
You can't go in.

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,280
[In Operation]

219
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,230
I survived by luck.

220
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,940
Doctor.

221
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,330
How is my son?

222
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,730
We did our best.

223
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,930
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,700
But Yu was not that lucky.

225
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,440
All these years,

226
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,210
Aunt has tried so hard to protect us

227
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,880
so that you didn't hear anything about Yu.

228
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,210
But you killed Yu.

229
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,310
Thanks to you,

230
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,290
I lost my parents

231
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,130
and almost lost my life twice.

232
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,590
You even made Aunt lose Yu.

233
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,800
Many people died because of your ambition.

234
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,640
Zhang Ran.

235
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,470
Zhang Ran.

236
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,370
What about Zhou Yu?

237
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,520
So you must

238
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,170
pay this debt.

239
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,710
Since Aunt knew the hospital director,

240
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,120
it didn't leak out.

241
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,510
You just thought

242
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,510
I was dead.

243
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,500
After that, I lived as Yu

244
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,210
and started to get close to you.

245
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,220
Then, I became

246
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,180
the eldest son of Zhou Mingde,

247
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,950
Zhou Yu.

248
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,990
I told my aunt about

249
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,460
how you refused to save my parents.

250
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
Later, she investigated secretly.

251
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,650
Then she found out

252
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,490
the murderer who killed his son

253
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,720
is his husband.

254
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,480
Impossible.

255
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,340
Totally impossible!

256
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,790
With Aunt's help,

257
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,430
I started to appear in public

258
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,480
to make people believe that I'm Zhou Yu.

259
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,150
I was getting used to the life of being Yu,

260
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,869
and learned everything about Yu.

261
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,599
You found me very soon

262
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,030
and let me take over the African branch.

263
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,790
What do I want?

264
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,710
I came back to seek revenge on you

265
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,800
and take back everything
of the Zhang family.

266
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,420
So,

267
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
dad.

268
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,400
Dad.

269
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,770
Don't call me dad.

270
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,540
Are you satisfied with my story?

271
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you satisfied

272
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,680
with killing your son by yourself?

273
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,110
Zhou Mingde,

274
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,640
you will be punished by the law.

275
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,610
If you kneel in front of my parents...

276
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,130
Oh, right.

277
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,490
They are in heaven.

278
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,240
You can't see them.

279
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,790
Your story is very interesting.

280
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,740
But do you have evidence?

281
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,870
Of course.

282
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,950
Chengzhen gave me the USB.

283
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,340
I checked with my computer.

284
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,150
The information inside is enough

285
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,230
for Zhou Mingde to be in prison forever.

286
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,390
Wait for me on the road.

287
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,520
I'll be right there.

288
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,270
Okay.

289
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,330
I’ll wait for you here.

290
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,380
Jiang Lai.

291
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,380
Are you okay?

292
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,400
My bag.

293
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,490
The USB is in my bag.

294
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:44,830
Stop chasing.

295
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,310
It's okay.

296
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,290
We can't catch up.

297
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,490
I'm glad you're fine.

298
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm fine.

299
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,730
Chairman.

300
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,830
Why are you so angry?

301
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,170
What are you doing here?

302
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,350
To help you.

303
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,800
Help me?

304
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,490
Who do you think you are?

305
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,890
Are you out of mind?

306
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm your special assistant.

307
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,490
If I don't help you now,

308
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,070
do you still expect your son to come?

309
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,660
I...

310
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,880
I made it wrong.

311
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,780
It’s your nephew.

312
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,250
Zhou Mingde.

313
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,940
You were famous in the mall for decades.

314
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,520
Can't you even recognize your own son now?

315
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,830
What do you want?

316
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,820
Chairman.

317
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,690
You're not young anymore.

318
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,560
Don't lose your temper.

319
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,530
Think about how to solve the problem.

320
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,400
Get lost!

321
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,970
Do you really think I'm that easy
to get rid of?

322
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,150
Look this.

323
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,280
Zhang Ran took it

324
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,170
from your little son, Chengzhen.

325
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,550
I accidentally

326
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,200
got it.

327
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,110
I couldn't help myself

328
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,040
and had a glance.

329
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,200
I finally know

330
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,430
how you instigated Sun Wei

331
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,490
to make an accident and kill Zhang Ran?

332
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,700
You're so cunning.

333
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,520
That's why you could become the chairman.

334
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,930
It's really that a degraded man

335
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,530
can be subjected to much indignity.

336
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
How dare you talk to me like that?

337
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Chairman.

338
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,120
Don't say that.

339
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,430
If you really don't care about this,

340
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,330
I'll give it to the police.

341
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,320
Tell me.

342
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,500
What do you want?

343
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,300
Ward 1388.

344
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,580
Come up and help me clean in five minutes.

345
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,180
Thank you.

346
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Don't forget,

347
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,310
you were behind Sun Wei's car accident.

348
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,830
If I'm going in,

349
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,680
I won't spare you.

350
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,070
Chairman,

351
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm not as cruel as you.

352
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,930
I just want all your shares.

353
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,710
Zhou's Group?

354
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,190
I only have 40% of the shares.

355
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,630
You want all my shares?

356
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,220
Do you think it's possible?

357
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,070
20 percent?

358
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,190
25 percent?

359
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,670
See you at the shareholders' meeting

360
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,670
in three days.

361
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,630
No.

362
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,750
I have to call Qi Wei

363
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,010
to treat the wound first.

364
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,200
We won't be able to get back the bag
if we don't hurry.

365
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,350
Give me your phone.

366
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,290
Qi Wei will find the two racers.

367
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,310
Chen Jun checked it.
The license plate is fake.

368
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,040
And you met the racers
right after you got the USB.

369
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,390
It must not be a coincidence.

370
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,750
You mean

371
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,800
Zhou Mingde sent someone
to get back his criminal evidence?

372
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,350
Compared to Zhou Mingde,

373
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,680
I think it's more likely Li Tingjiang.

374
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,650
Think about it.

375
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,350
When Song Biao kidnapped Su Qing

376
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,680
and threatened Sun Wei,

377
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,240
it was Li Tingjiang who hid Song Biao.

378
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,300
Zhou Mingde and I found Song Biao
at the same time.

379
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,400
Whether Song Biao accused Sun Wei

380
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,060
or Zhou Mingde's reaction

381
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,870
when hearing about Sun Wei's death

382
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,930
seems to be true.

383
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,520
You mean

384
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,210
Li Tingjiang killed Sun Wei?

385
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,790
Sun Wei went to the airport alone.

386
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,870
Obviously,

387
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,570
someone she trusts
went to pick up Chengzhen.

388
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,500
Then this person

389
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,080
is probably Li Tingjiang.

390
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,920
But why did Li Tingjiang kill Sun Wei?

391
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,460
Aren't they in cahoots?

392
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,870
That's what I don't understand.

393
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,200
Could it be that

394
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,370
it's what Li Tingjiang gave to Zhou Mingde
for exchange?

395
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,200
But it's unreasonable.

396
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,930
He didn't get anything from it.

397
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,590
He's just a special assistant
to the president.

398
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,230
No matter what,

399
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,950
Li Tingjiang must have gotten some benefits

400
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,400
by killing Sun Wei.

401
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,810
As for Song Biao,

402
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,270
I asked Chen Jun to investigate it.

403
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,270
He has a daughter,

404
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,390
but no one knows where she is.

405
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,930
Maybe Li Tingjiang threatened him with this.

406
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,680
What should we do now?

407
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,790
We don’t have evidence
of Li Tingjiang’s crime,

408
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,230
and we don’t even have evidence
of Zhou Mingde’s crime.

409
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,110
Maybe we have.

410
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,070
There’s more than one evidence
of Zhou Mingde’s crime.

411
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,340
What we lost

412
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,800
can only prove his killing of Zhang Ran.

413
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,730
I saw him refuse to save my parents.

414
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,310
I saw it with my own eyes.

415
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,630
You mean

416
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,630
you want to expose him
with your real identity?

417
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,430
No.

418
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,450
Don't you remember the shareholders' meeting
is in three days?

419
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,530
If you use Zhang Ran's identity now,

420
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,490
you'll lose all of Zhou Yu's shares.

421
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,650
How can you beat him?

422
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,270
How will you get back everything
that belongs to the Zhang family?

423
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,310
If I don’t have the courage

424
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,240
to report Zhou Mingde as Zhang Ran,

425
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,510
how can I

426
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,390
revive the Zhang family?

427
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,700
But I feel worried.

428
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,530
Jiang Lai.

429
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,100
Don’t be afraid.

430
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,070
I have you,

431
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,980
I have family and friends.

432
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm not afraid of anything.

433
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,070
Is there anything I can do for you?

434
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,430
Have you heard it?

435
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,790
Zhou Yu is not Zhou Yu?

436
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,510
He's the son
of Chairman Zhou's wife's brother,

437
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,110
Zhang Ran.

438
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,290
Isn't that

439
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,480
the grandson of

440
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,430
the chairman of Zhang's Group?

441
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,310
My goodness.

442
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,400
It's so messy.

443
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,250
This is not the most ridiculous.

444
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,280
The most ridiculous thing is that

445
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,670
he went to the police station two days ago

446
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,270
and reported the president.

447
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,210
But I saw the president

448
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,710
when I came to work this morning.

449
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,020
It's said that there's not enough evidence.

450
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,240
He just needs to cooperate
with the investigation.

451
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,020
Someone else said

452
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,470
Zhou Yu...

453
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:29,910
No.

454
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,800
Zhang Ran,

455
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,080
is jealous of the scale of Zhou's Group

456
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,670
and wants to fight for the property,

457
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,930
so he deliberately framed the president.

458
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,670
It is said that

459
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,410
the assault

460
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,350
was also set up by him.

461
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,880
What are you talking about?

462
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,670
According to the Criminal Law,

463
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,290
anyone fabricating facts
and slandering others,

464
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,910
in a serious case,

465
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,030
constitutes libel,

466
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,390
and will be sentenced
to at most three years in prison.

467
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,450
What are you talking about?

468
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,450
What slandering?

469
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,990
We're just chatting.

470
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,110
What are you talking about?

471
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,630
Just gossip.

472
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,280
Tingting is the one

473
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,060
who gossips most.

474
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,390
Yes.

475
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,030
You...

476
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,710
It's just for releasing my work stress
and being healthy.

477
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,790
Just some proper mouth exercises.

478
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,180
Yes.

479
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,670
I didn't hurt anyone.

480
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,850
Mr. Zhou used to treat everyone well.

481
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,970
Everyone knows how capable he is.

482
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,030
He's definitely not the kind of person

483
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,160
who would deliberately frame others.

484
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:20,630
Li...

485
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,890
Special Assistant Li,

486
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,910
what you said

487
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,670
is good.

488
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,270
Before you get off work today,

489
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,430
go to HR to get the paperwork done.

490
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,030
You're fired.

491
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,670
This...

492
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,070
Special Assistant.

493
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,150
This is too much.

494
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,040
No need to do so.

495
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,170
Tingting!

496
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:36,770
Tingting!

497
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,100
Why is here a board meeting again?

498
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,880
What does Zhou Mingde

499
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,760
want to do?

500
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,070
There are

501
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,230
rumors everywhere!

502
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,000
But he looks calm.

503
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,110
What is he doing here?

504
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,180
Before the meeting,

505
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,270
I have two things to tell you.

506
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,720
I know

507
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,560
there are a lot of rumors

508
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,400
about me.

509
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,720
To avoid bringing

510
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,280
unnecessary trouble to the company,

511
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,550
I've decided

512
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,310
to resign from the president.

513
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,700
Why didn't he inform us?

514
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,630
I don't know.

515
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,390
And...

516
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,030
The thing is that...

517
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,150
I've transferred

518
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,830
25% of my shares to

519
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,070
Li Tingjiang,

520
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,080
and recommended him

521
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,280
to be the acting president.

522
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,210
What?

523
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,620
What?

524
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,590
Are you giving it to me?

525
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,320
Take it away.

526
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,270
After the board's voting with hands,

527
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,550
Li Tingjiang is specially appointed

528
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,950
as the acting president.

529
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
Thank you for your trust.

530
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,370
For the next period,

531
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,380
I will take the group

532
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,810
out of the swamp.

533
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,300
Chairman,

534
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,590
think about how to solve the problem.

535
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,440
Zhang Ran got it

536
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,870
from your precious son, Chengzhen.

537
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,030
I accidentally

538
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,070
got it.

539
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,060
Turn it off.

540
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,210
I took a look.

541
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,150
I finally know

542
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,460
how you instigated Sun Wei

543
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,570
to make an car accident and kill Zhang Ran.

544
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,930
Don't forget,

545
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,170
you were behind Sun Wei's car accident.

546
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,370
If I'm going in,

547
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,600
I won't spare you.

548
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,310
Remove the power.

549
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,480
See you at the shareholders' meeting

550
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
in three days.

551
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,970
I suggest to dismiss

552
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,030
the acting president, Li Tingjiang.

553
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,230
I agree.

554
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,600
Dear directors,

555
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,850
you know who is in front of you, right?

556
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,780
Zhang Ran.

557
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,880
how many shares do you have?

558
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,600
Who are you to tell me what to do?

559
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,420
All the directors here know it,

560
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,230
Zhou's Group was surnamed Zhang.

561
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,180
Do you think I'm qualified?

562
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,960
Indeed.

563
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,600
I don't have enough shares.

564
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,120
What if we add the assets?

565
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,230
Jujiang Capital?

566
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,320
What does it have to do with you?

567
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,380
Jujiang Capital is yours?

568
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,450
It's not too late

569
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,440
to know it now.

570
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,010
Li Tingjiang.

572
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,250
You're fired.

573
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,750
Even if I don't sit here,

574
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,250
I still have shares.

575
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,450
Zhang Ran,

576
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,090
I still have plenty of time.

577
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,090
There's no time for you.

578
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,460
Li Tingjiang,

579
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,430
return the 50 million that you embezzled

580
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,680
before you leave!

581
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:31,950
50 million?

582
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,370
50 million?

583
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,230
Embezzlement?

584
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,770
This is the evidence
to show your embezzeling with Sun Wei.

585
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,060
Is there anything I can do for you?

586
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,740
You and Qi Wei need to check

587
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,430
the accounts of Li Tingjiang.

588
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,840
Song Biao turned himself in yesterday.

589
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,560
Also,

590
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,830
Song Biao's daughter
has been found by the police.

591
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,490
She has told the police

592
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,150
your crime.

593
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,380
I'm afraid that you'll be busy

594
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,120
for the following time.

595
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,679
Uncle Zhou,

596
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,350
the police should be looking for you soon.

597
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,130
I'm afraid the rest of your life

598
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,880
may have to be spent in prison.

599
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,050
Zhang Ran,

600
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,460
can I

601
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,670
ask you to do me a favor

602
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,710
as a father?

603
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,740
You mean

604
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,020
about Chengzhen?

605
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,670
Don't worry.

606
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,550
I will take good care of him

607
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,730
to make you carefree in prison.

608
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,670
Welcome.

609
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,550
Welcome.

610
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,050
Welcome back, Mr. Zhou.

611
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,240
Welcome back, Jiang Lai!

612
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,270
Come on.

613
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,810
I wiped it for you for three times.

614
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,720
Sit.

615
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,440
Jiang Lai.

616
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,650
I know

617
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,940
it's a bit hasty.

618
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,780
But I still have something to tell you.

619
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,390
I know.

620
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,230
We were together because of lies.

621
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,930
But it's more like

622
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,880
a coincidence of fate.

623
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,630
Lies are said to be like dreams

624
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,970
I became more and more afraid

625
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,700
of waking up from my dream.

626
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,450
You always say

627
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,300
you've seen

628
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,910
too many people

629
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,830
not taking love seriously.

630
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,020
And I know

631
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,080
how careful you are with love.

632
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,430
Actually,

633
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm the coward.

634
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm afraid of losing,

635
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,170
and fear the uncertain future.

636
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,040
But I'm not afraid anymore.

637
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,880
Thank you.

638
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,310
Thank you for

639
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,510
holding my hand firmly every time.

640
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,160
The moonlight is hiding behind...

641
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,310
I know you are in a bad mood recently.

642
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,540
My collar is wet by tears

643
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,000
But don't worry.

644
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,750
I'll always be with you.

645
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,920
You just passed by...

646
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,990
Zhang Ran,

647
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,660
ϙ Only a silence Ϧ

648
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,250
Don't say to unlock the fog

649
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,010
Love is just fiction

650
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,720
Dangerous fireworks light up me

651
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,830
Don't look back

652
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,500
But my steps stop

653
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,190
It's me...

654
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,880
it's my turn this time.

655
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,140
Unwilling to let the stars go

656
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,970
No matter what happens in the future,

657
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,500
I will firmly choose you.

658
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,090
I'll look back

659
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,950
So,

660
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,600
<i>isolated people and comments...</i>

661
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,870
let the lie end.

662
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,930
Let's start over.

663
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,740
I'm lonely

664
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:12,100
I wish you were behind me

665
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,630
I'm Zhang Ran.

666
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,310
Will you marry me?

667
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,390
♫You shine in the dark night♫

668
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,440
My eyes are hazy

669
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,140
But I'm waiting for you to turn back

670
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,310
Cause you drive the oasis

671
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:31,250
Turn back to the desert

672
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,820
Thank you,

673
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,260
Zhang Ran.

674
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,910
Thank you for making me brave,

675
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,900
for letting me, this timid girl,

676
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,140
stop running away.

677
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,560
I don't want the person I like

678
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
to to be homeless.

679
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,800
No.
I will marry Kang Lai.

680
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,090
I only want to marry her.

681
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,090
Make me believe

682
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,280
you will never leave me alone.

683
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,190
You made me believe
that I deserve to be loved.

684
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,280
Could it be the snapdragon

685
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,170
that nobody wants?

686
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,040
Don't worry.

687
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,190
I will use my future

688
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,180
with my umbrella

689
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,430
to protect it.

690
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,320
<i>But the rain wet me</i>

691
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,060
Trust me.

692
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,430
Even if...

693
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,810
This is not the end,

694
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,690
nor the terminal.

695
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,080
but our beginning.

696
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,330
I won't dodge the pain

697
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,610
I feel you in a trance

698
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,640
So,

699
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,450
will you marry me?

700
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,270
My passionate pulse...

701
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,650
Marry him.

702
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,530
Marry him!

703
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,540
Marry him!

704
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,500
Marry him!

705
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,350
The stars shine on me

706
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,600
Marry him!

707
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,460
Marry him!

708
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,530
Marry him!

709
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:50,270
Love has been here long ago

710
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,440
Marry him!

711
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,380
Marry him!

712
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,170
Marry him!

713
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,000
Marry him!

714
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,790
Marry him!

715
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,470
Marry him!

716
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,630
Marry him!

717
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,420
Wait.

718
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,670
I can't accept your proposal so easily!

719
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,510
Because I was

720
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,330
rejected by you last time.

721
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,110
No.

722
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,680
It's only fair if I reject you once.

723
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,410
Fine.

724
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,020
No matter how many times you reject it,

725
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,820
I'll continue to propose to you.

726
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,350
I've prepared the ring.

727
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,250
I do.

728
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,860
<i>I'll wait for you in the crowd</i>

729
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,270
Kiss!

730
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,230
Kiss!

731
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,130
Kiss!

732
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,410
We're in sync

733
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,550
Unbelievable

734
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,700
<i>It's a familiar breath</i>

735
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,450
You managed the farm well.

736
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,490
Of course.

737
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,350
✏is an individual example for each other.

738
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm a fast learner, okay?

739
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,740
But...

740
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,640
are you really going
to live in the farm with me?

741
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
When the tides and tides

742
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,810
I look at you

743
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,940
I told you.

744
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,020
No matter where you want to stay,

745
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,830
<i>Drowned in the river of time</i>

746
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,120
and what you want to do,

747
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,020
I'll always be with you.

748
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:13,320
The only air is you

749
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,190
There's a scene

750
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,510
The picture of us hugging

751
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,610
I saw the dream of that day

752
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,090
The rain outside the window stopped

753
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,890
We're still here

754
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,850
Making a wish to the rain is a tacit language

755
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,140
It won't change

756
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,020
Before the window after rain

757
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:50,640
When the rain falls

758
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,730
<i>The shoulders slowly get closer </i>

759
00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:00,450
I miss you in front of my eyes

760
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:07,430
The scene of us hugging

761
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,670
I saw the dream of that day

762
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,910
The rain outside the window stopped

763
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,820
We're still here

764
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,560
Thank you for loving me

765
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,420
We won't dodge anymore

766
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,050
We promise each other
