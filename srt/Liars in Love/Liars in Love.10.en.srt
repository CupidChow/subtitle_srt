00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,960
It's so romantic.

5
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,370
What's wrong?

6
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,160
Is there something on my face?

7
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,150
Yu,

8
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,390
why don't you like me?

9
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,490
Why do you like Su Qing?

10
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,840
You're making me dizzy.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,680
Answer me! Answer me!

12
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,950
Answer my question!

13
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,630
It hurts!

14
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,710
Why, why?

15
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,940
Why did you push me?

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,250
Hello, sir.

17
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,220
We're closing soon.

18
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,730
Could you please pay the bill first?

19
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,230
What?

20
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,870
It has been paid

21
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,590
when we made the reservation, right?

22
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:52,990
Yes,

23
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,660
but after that,

24
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,640
this lady

25
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,380
ordered...

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,600
ordered 6 bottles of wine.

27
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,730
Then, how much?

28
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,680
66,000 yuan.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,650
66,000 yuan?

30
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,670
Okay.

31
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,290
Thank you.

32
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,190
Slow down.

33
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,220
Chen Jun,

34
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,600
are you here?

35
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes.

36
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,340
Have we arrived?

37
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,130
Not yet.

38
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,910
It's here.

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,370
Let's go.

40
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,690
Get in the car.

41
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,159
I'll give you a ride.

42
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,120
I'm pissed off today.

43
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,890
What are you doing?

44
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,760
Come on, get in the car.

45
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,470
Car.

46
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,070
What are you doing?

47
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,550
Your car seems to have a flat tire.

48
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,440
Is there a backup tire in your car?

49
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,630
A backup?

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,150
H-How dare you curse me?

51
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,710
How dare you call me a backup?

52
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
How dare you call me a back...

53
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,430
How dare you say I'm a backup?

54
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,480
It was Su Qing who knew him later.

55
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm not a backup.

56
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,070
I wasn't talking about you.

57
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,070
I meant the car.

58
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,030
Car?

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,350
Then how can I go home?

60
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,909
Sit tight.

61
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,870
Why are you so slow?

62
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,510
Even turtles are faster than you.

63
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,430
I'm worried about your safety.

64
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,480
Hold tight. I'm speeding up.

65
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,150
The wind is so comfortable.

66
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,810
Yes, it is.

67
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,050
Be careful.

68
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,970
Don't lose control.

69
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,380
It’s so much fun.

70
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,360
Jiang Lai, Jiang Lai!

71
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
What?

72
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,190
Jiang Lai!

73
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,040
What's the matter?

74
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,840
Jiang Lai,

75
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,590
Jiang Lai!

76
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,120
Why are people so different?

77
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,020
What do you want?

78
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,230
Master Zhou.

79
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,670
I want strawberries.

80
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,380
Strawberries without seeds, right?

81
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,870
Wait.

82
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm not finished.

83
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,640
Go ahead.

84
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
And dragon fruit,

85
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,390
also seedless.

86
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,130
Anything else?

87
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,260
Mix them

88
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,460
and make a glass of juice.

89
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:10,930
You...

90
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,130
Be polite.

91
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,540
You really have good taste.

92
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,250
Thank you.

93
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,160
Dear Jesus, Buddha and bodhisattva,

94
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,310
may all fruits with seeds disappear.

95
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,660
Drink it.

96
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
Wait.

97
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,530
What's the matter now?

98
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,470
If I don't fall asleep in half an hour,

99
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,730
remember to...

100
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,950
You must have been a master in your previous life.

101
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,280
Otherwise, how can you be so good at ordering people around?

102
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,760
Next time you sign a contract,

103
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,590
remember to read it carefully.

104
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,670
Yes, my master.

105
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,240
If there's nothing else, you may leave.

106
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,290
Yes, my master.

107
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,730
Close the door.

108
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,910
Jiang Lai,

109
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,970
what did you add in it?

110
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,030
Mr. Zhou,

111
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,290
I've prepared a special drink for you.

112
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,990
Please enjoy it.

113
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,990
I have a meeting at 8:30 a.m.,

114
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,320
and you'll come with me.

115
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,850
It's Saturday.

116
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,910
Except for workdays,

117
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,280
every day is my day off.

118
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
You have no right to ask

119
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,900
or interfere my business.

120
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,270
By the way,

121
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,650
I'll skip breakfast today.

122
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,840
After breakfast,

123
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,070
remember to put the chopsticks and dishes into the sink.

124
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,130
Thank you, master.

125
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,920
Chen Jun,

126
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,830
come with me in a minute.

127
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,660
Where?

128
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,750
Mr. Zhou,

129
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,730
it's Saturday.

130
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,310
I haven't taken a walk like this for a long time.

131
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,550
Did you tell Zhou Yu

132
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,400
anything?

133
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,270
He already knew it,

134
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,550
but

135
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,960
I still hope you can keep it a secret for me.

136
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,600
Don't worry,

137
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,030
I won't put you in danger.

138
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,150
Thank you.

139
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,300
Mr. Zhou,

140
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,120
this is company's property.

141
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,700
I'll stop looking.

142
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,880
Really?

143
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,870
Then...

144
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,600
should we keep following them?

145
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,850
You'll look at them for me.

146
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,730
Here.

147
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,660
This is the last one.

148
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,650
Wonderful.

149
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,110
They bought a stick of sugarcoated haws.

150
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,360
It's good!

151
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,900
You also liked it when you were a student.

152
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,760
Every time you passed the stall selling sugarcoated haws,

153
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,640
the street vendor would greet you.

154
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,580
And...

155
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,520
And what?

156
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,900
And...

157
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,560
Don't they have money to buy one more stick of sugarcoated haws?

158
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,600
It-It's sold out.

159
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,830
Big sister,

160
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,650
can I buy your sugarcoated haws?

161
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,050
It's sold out,

162
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,330
so I can't get it.

163
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,660
But I've already taken a bite on this one.

164
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,920
Are you okay with that?

165
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,460
Then you'll have it

166
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,190
for free.

167
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,490
Thank you, big sister.

168
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,420
You're welcome.

169
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,200
She's a good girl.

170
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,730
Let's go.

171
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,640
Here.

172
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,380
Little girl,

173
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,980
take this.

174
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,050
Thank you.

175
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,830
Bye.

176
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,640
Thank you.

177
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,020
What a tight schedule.

178
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,770
Mr. Zhou, I can't swim.

179
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,820
If anything happens,

180
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,550
I can't guarantee your safety.

181
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,030
You think I'll listen to you?

182
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,030
No.

183
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,050
Hurry up.

184
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,800
I've tried my best.

185
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,490
We're in the opposite direction.

186
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,200
Go back.

187
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,550
No, I mean that way.

188
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,210
Over there.

189
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,580
Hurry up.

190
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,160
You keep an eye on them.

191
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,930
Let me pedal.

192
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,720
Report their actions to me.

193
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,680
You bought so many snacks.

194
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,950
This is really good.

195
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,210
I'm glad you like it.

196
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,270
They bought a lot of snacks,

197
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,080
with food and drinks,

198
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,020
and...

199
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
And what?

200
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,590
Do you want some?

201
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,910
Thank you.

202
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,300
She fed Li Tingjiang a piece.

203
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,210
Fed Li Tingjiang a piece?

204
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,560
Why is she feeding him again?

205
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,820
Doesn't he have hands?

206
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,500
Li Tingjiang is controlling the boat.

207
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,210
Go head.

208
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,190
Are you tired?

209
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,140
Do you need me to pedal?

210
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,710
I'm not tired

211
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,730
but a little thirsty.

212
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,530
Could you get me a glass of water?

213
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,590
She opened a bottle of beverage,

214
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,550
and...

215
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,510
and they leaned together.

216
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Leaned together?

217
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,570
L-Leaned together.

218
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,660
How?

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,410
Th-They just leaned close together.

220
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,070
We're off course.

221
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,270
I can't see it.

222
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,670
Pedal faster.

223
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,230
That way.

224
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,020
No, no, no.

225
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,910
That way.

226
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,910
Hurry up.

227
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,830
Pedal faster.

228
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:22,900
Come here.

229
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,720
Pedal with me.

230
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,840
Hurry up.

231
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,070
Catch up with them.

232
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,560
No problem.

233
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,540
Come on, listen to me.

234
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,030
Ready.

235
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,610
One, two.

236
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,680
One, two.

237
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,680
One, two.

238
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,180
Why are they so fast?

239
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,280
One, two. One, two.

240
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,390
One, two. One, two.

241
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,450
One, two.

242
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,470
Slow down.

243
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,470
Slow, slow, slow!

244
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,580
Why do they look kind of familiar?

245
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,160
Let's sit here.

246
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,770
Okay.

247
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,510
Have a seat.

248
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,550
Mom.

249
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,250
Okay, I got it.

250
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,810
Mr. Zhou.

251
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,319
Mr. Zhou.

252
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,829
My mom suddenly came to Sucheng for me.

253
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,420
Go see her.

254
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,119
Thank you, boss.

255
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,590
I didn't expect this street to be so bustling like it used to be.

256
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,590
I really miss it.

257
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,470
It's been a long time.

258
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,100
I remember you liked to sit in that corner

259
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,200
when our club had dinner parties, right?

260
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,450
Tingjiang,

261
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,840
you actually remember where I sat.

262
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
Not just that.

263
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,740
I also remember you loved to take off your clothes after you got drunk.

264
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,930
If I hadn't stopped you,

265
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,600
you would've been...

266
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,030
No!

267
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,110
Not like that!

268
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,680
You're talking nonsense.

269
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,510
I only took off my coat.

270
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,630
My coat!

271
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,990
Okay.

272
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,070
Coat.

273
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,490
You're still so cute

274
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,410
after all these years.

275
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,970
Dirty hands.

276
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,960
Well, how time flies.

277
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,780
I really miss my college days.

278
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,780
Tingjiang,

279
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,670
why did you suddenly go abroad?

280
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,190
Actually, I thought about

281
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,820
telling you about it,

282
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,000
but back then,

283
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,460
I couldn't promise you anything.

284
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,270
It's fine.

285
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,130
You could told me,

286
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,460
and I would wait for you.

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,530
Never mind.

288
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,740
I'm back now, right?

289
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,830
Kids.

290
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,600
That's enough.

291
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,880
Kids, stop playing!

292
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,390
Stop, stop!

293
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,020
That's enough!

294
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,280
The kids are really...

295
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,500
You...

296
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,730
I'll clean it up.

297
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,990
Okay.

298
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,110
Thank you, big brother.

299
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,190
Thank you, big brother.

300
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,550
Here.

301
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,840
Thank you, big brother.

302
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,370
Do you remember what I said?

303
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,320
Go.

304
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,870
His phone keeps ringing.

305
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,600
Is there something important?

306
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,060
Where are you?

307
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,310
I miss you.

308
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,490
Someone called you.

309
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,110
Aren't you going to call back?

310
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
It's okay.

311
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,030
It's nothing important.

312
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,690
[WW]

313
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,030
That's right.

314
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,900
I can arrange some work for him.

315
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,310
Okay, I'll be right back.

316
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,480
Do you have other plans?

317
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,580
Let me take you home first.

318
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,290
No need.

319
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,790
You've ordered food, haven't you?

320
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,130
I haven't had barbecue here for a long time.

321
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,770
Just go.

322
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I'll be fine.

323
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,080
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,730
My company called me for an emergency.

325
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,790
I'll treat you to a big meal next time.

326
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,870
Well,

327
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,700
see you then.

328
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,280
Here's the barbecue you ordered.

329
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,840
Sir,

330
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,110
I'd also like 2 beers.

331
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
-One beer.
-Okay.

332
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,630
Don't listen to him.

333
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,470
Two beers.

334
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,090
One beer.

335
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,870
Two.

336
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,190
No problem.

337
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
Are you following me?

338
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,590
I was just passing by.

339
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,950
Passing by?

340
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,430
Does a master like you also eat barbecue on the street?

341
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,480
Why can't I?

342
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,830
It's the weekend.

343
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,190
It's legal holiday.

344
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,460
Even if I'm your contractual fiancée,

345
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,900
I still have the right to take a day off, right?

346
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,790
Even on legal holidays,

347
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,640
I can still decide who you can be with.

348
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,550
What's wrong with spending the weekend with my friend?

349
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,280
Your friend?

350
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,840
Just a friend?

351
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,800
It's none of your business.

352
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,470
It's written clearly in the contract

353
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,190
that you have no right to interfere my plans

354
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,390
for legal holidays.

355
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm not interfering your plans.

356
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,230
You're not?

357
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,960
With so many shops

358
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,670
and seats,

359
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,510
do you have to sit in front of me?

360
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,240
If you can sit here, why can't I?

361
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,590
Your beers.

362
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,510
Please enjoy.

363
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,340
Get your hands off it.

364
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,270
-Don’t you remember the last time you were drunk at my house?
-I forgot.

365
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,390
Sir,

366
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,250
two more beers.

367
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,310
Okay.

368
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,630
What are you doing?

369
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,560
It's written in the contract.

370
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,270
Even if it is,

371
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,870
I won't let you take off your clothes in public.

372
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,410
He seems to have a girlfriend.

373
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,490
He left me alone.

374
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
It's hot.

375
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,080
So comfortable.

376
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,360
You know what?

377
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,710
Yu is actually good at

378
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,170
running business, right?

379
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,990
Like father, like son.

380
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,390
That's true.

381
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,710
I've made up my mind.

382
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,030
If Dream City runs well,

383
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,450
I want to

384
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,460
give him the resort project too.

385
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,350
Let's see what surprise

386
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,940
Yu can give me.

387
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,840
What's the matter?

388
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,090
Who were you with tonight?

389
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
I had dinner with some colleagues from my department.

390
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,190
Who were you really with?

391
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,220
I never could lie to you.

392
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,750
I went to see Su Qing tonight.

393
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,400
Zhou Yu is too suspicious,

394
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,140
so I thought what if I could get some important information

395
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,500
from Su Qing?

396
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,680
Then why did you lie to me?

397
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,290
Because Su Qing

398
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,760
didn't provide any useful information.

399
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,010
I didn't expect you to be jealous because of this.

400
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,810
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,290
Zhou Mingde is going to give the resort project to Zhou Yu.

402
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,380
I’ve worked so hard these years.

403
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,670
In the end,

404
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,830
his beloved son is going to take everything from me.

405
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,000
Don't worry,

406
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,250
I have an idea.

407
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,520
Huang Yonghua, the vice president of Dream City Department Store,

408
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,780
must have benefited a lot over the years.

409
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,550
If his transactions are exposed,

410
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,970
the account of Dream City

411
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,480
will be investigated too.

412
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,690
Huang Yonghua has worked for Zhou Mingde for more than 10 years,

413
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,620
so he won't escalate the incident.

414
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,970
We don't need to escalate it.

415
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,240
We just need someone to investigate the account.

416
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,500
As long as investigation continues,

417
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,250
the money on the account will remain frozen.

418
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,160
Three months will pass in a blink of an eye.

419
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
If Zhou Yu has no money,

420
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,500
what can he do?

421
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,330
Is there really nothing going on

422
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,660
between you and Su Qing?

423
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,260
You're the only one

424
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,180
in my heart.

425
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,800
What?

426
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,900
False accounting?

427
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,530
Yes.

428
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,490
Why would someone find out

429
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,150
that we have false accounting

430
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,380
precisely at this critical moment?

431
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,510
I don't know either.

432
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,440
To cooperate with the investigation,

433
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,760
all funds of Dream City have been frozen.

434
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,330
We won't be able to carry out the following events.

435
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,440
If this continues,

436
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,430
I'm afraid it will affect this quarter's sales.

437
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,400
Bring me all the details.

438
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,760
Yes, sir.

439
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,660
I have something to do.

440
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,720
You should go home.

441
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,430
It's about the false accounting, right?

442
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,160
Don't look at me like that.

443
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,730
If there's only one thing our employees are good at,

444
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,870
it will be gossiping at the fastest speed.

445
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,770
It's none of your business.

446
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,770
Get out of the car.

447
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,670
I heard the account involved

448
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,930
the rental contract of Snapdragon Farm.

449
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,230
Don't worry,

450
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,630
I can take care of myself.

451
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,900
Besides, even if you don't allow me to get involved,

452
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,540
I can do it in my own way.

453
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,800
Let's go.

454
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,510
Is this the company Huang Yonghua used

455
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,890
to falsify accounts?

456
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,780
It was established with Zhou's Group's investment.

457
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,800
Since Huang Yonghua dared to cook the books so evidently,

458
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,520
why do we have to sneak around?

459
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,680
Huang Yonghua signed many contracts

460
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,750
via the subsidiary of this company.

461
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,430
If we want to find solid evidence,

462
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,270
we can't alert him.

463
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,800
Why do you have the access card?

464
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,920
Are you here to help or perform a play?

465
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,840
Get in.

466
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,490
Captain,

467
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,990
two people sneaked into our company.

468
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,750
Yes, sir.

469
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll send photos to you.

470
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:16,070
[Archives Office]

471
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,490
There are so many files.

472
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,030
When will we find it?

473
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,960
The evidence must be among them.

474
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,880
Okay.

475
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,430
I found it.

476
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,520
Great.

477
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
That's it.

478
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,480
I'll leave it to you.

479
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,580
How could it be?

480
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,350
Oh no.

481
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,420
Someone is coming.

482
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,730
Hurry up!

483
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,470
Protect the evidence!

484
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,010
Let's go!

485
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,600
Who is it?

486
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,820
Stop!

487
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,650
Stop!

488
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,370
Where are they?

489
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,240
They obviously went this way.

490
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,100
You go that way.

491
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,770
That's strange.

492
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,900
They've left, right?

493
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,480
[Cleaners Room]

494
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,990
So strange.

495
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,680
How long are you going to cover my mouth?

496
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,730
I'll take a look.

497
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,730
They're gone.

498
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,710
Who are you? Stop!

499
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,160
They're here!

500
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,400
This way.

501
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,680
Stop running!

502
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,420
Stop!

503
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,790
The parking lot!

504
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,420
Go get them!

505
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,590
Stop! Stop!

506
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,670
Stop!

507
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,790
Stop! Stop!

508
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,610
Stop running!

509
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,420
You two

510
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,260
search there.

511
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,550
You two go there.
