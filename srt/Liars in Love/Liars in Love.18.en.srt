[Episode 18]

4
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,270
Su,

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,870
you finally picked up.

6
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,729
After Qing came back,

7
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,590
I suppose that the two kids

8
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,830
are getting along well recently.

9
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,300
Maybe the wedding should be on the table.

10
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,820
Qing's still abroad!

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,270
Su, don't you know?

12
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,210
Qing was having dinner with me yesterday.

13
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,080
Zhou,

14
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,530
I know you're worried about their marriage.

15
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,770
But this matter

16
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,450
depends on the two kids.

17
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,660
We can't rush it.

18
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,290
Qing will come back tomorrow.

19
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,490
They need more time before deciding it.

20
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Okay.

21
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,280
What did Su Qing's father say?

22
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,910
Get lost!

23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,010
How is

24
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,700
your dad's health?

25
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,829
Is it still the same?

26
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,970
Not bad.

27
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,850
But

28
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,910
it gets worse during the change of season.

29
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,710
The dizziness

30
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,850
can be seasonal?

31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,980
Call your dad

32
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,200
since all of us are here.

33
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,320
It should be late now.

34
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,380
Isn't there jet lag?

35
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,530
He should be asleep.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,000
The Zhou family must hold a grand wedding.

37
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,140
Besides,

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,330
her parents will also come.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,420
I'd better talk to my parents myself.

40
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,740
Why did she try hard

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,230
to get close to Yu?

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,140
Is there a Lingxi village nearby?

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,270
It's very beautiful there.

44
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,530
Are you going to open a resort over there?

45
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,380
Lingxi Village?

46
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,000
So Su Qing is a fake.

47
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,070
Without the Su’s investment,

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,650
Zhou Mingde,

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,329

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,490

[Add to the blacklist.]

53
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,340
Look.

54
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,280
Don't move.

55
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,310
Look.

56
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,670
What's wrong?

57
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,840
Did I hit you hard just now?

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
That sounds nice.

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,790
Dating and making pottery
with your boyfriend

60
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,190
should be very romantic.

61
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
But you seemed

62
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,900
to put more sight on the soil

63
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,070
than on me.

64
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,260
Are you jealous?

65
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,310
Oh you!

66
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,800
You are even jealous of yourself.

67
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,100
This is me.

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,300
This doesn't look like me.

69
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,850
It's completely like you,

70
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,890
The nose,

71
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,520
the eyes,

72
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,990
and the mouth.

73
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,260
Is this what I'm like in your mind?

74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,470
I want to see

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,830
how well you can make it.

76
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,020
This is snapdragon?

77
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,350
Don't you like snapdragon?

78
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,120
The snapdragon made from pottery
will never wither.

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,250
In this way, it can be with you forever.

80
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,890
I want to quit my job.

81
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,950
Since we're together now,

82
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,550
I think we should

83
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,270
be honest with each other.

84
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,110
So,

85
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,100
I don't want to stay in the company as Su Qing anymore.

86
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,980
Although you joined the company as Su Qing,

87
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,270
during this period,

88
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,460
everyone can see

89
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,190
your capability at work.

90
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,380
Besides,

91
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,860
I don't think

92
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,630
you should lose the job

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,780
for not being Su Qing anymore.

94
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,990
But...

95
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,390
I said I'll take care of it.

96
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,700
I've sent Su Qing an email.

97
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,840
Don't worry.

98
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,660
No matter what it takes,

99
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,420
I will break off the engagement.

100
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,820
By then,

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,810
you can regain your identity as Jiang Lai.

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,390
Everyone of the company will know
that I’m not Su Qing.

103
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,590
How do you solve this?

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,810
Don't worry.

105
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,990
I'll take care of it.

106
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,900
I trust you.

107
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,330
But

108
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,590
I hope

109
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,590
if you have difficulties,

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,790
don't hide it from me.

111
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Because I will always be on your side

112
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,730
and be with you.

113
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,560
OK.

114
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,950
Sun, your life

115
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,530
is still enjoyable.

116
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,030
You agreed

117
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,270
to take the money and go far away.

118
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,700
Why did you come back?

119
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,409
You've been ignoring me.

120
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,559
So I have to contact you.

121
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,510
Don't smoke in my car.

122
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,669
To be honest,

123
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,230
I ran into some trouble.

124
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,350
I need some money to fix it.

125
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,460
I hope

126
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,400
you can help me.

127
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,430
I've paid you.

128
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,480
And we won't cooperate anymore.

129
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,620
I can't help you.

130
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,020
Really?

131
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,990
I would never forget

132
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,240
the accident that year.

133
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,510
Have you

134
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,500
forgotten it?

135
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,490
Are you threatening me?

136
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,800
I dare not.

137
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,380
But a cornered beast can be crazy,

138
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,830
and so

139
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,540
do people.

140
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,790
Song Biao, I warn you for the last time!

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,730
I won't give you a penny.

142
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,210
If you piss me off,

143
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,220
we'll die together.

144
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,210
Let's wait and see.

145
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,270
Chen Jun.

146
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,100
Congratulations.

147
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,660
You got promoted.

148
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,050
Our Special Assistant to Vice President!

149
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,410
Congratulations, Jun.

150
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,250
Still working for Mr. Zhou anyway.

151
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,450
There's no difference in nature.

152
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,910
That's still a promotion.

153
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,740
By the way,

154
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,510
this is the information of candidates
for the resort architect.

155
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,120
Tell me when Mr. Zhou picks the one.

156
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,710
Okay.

157
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,750
Chen Jun.

158
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,990
What are you doing?

159
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,230
Did you forget

160
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,790
you have a cute girlfriend?

161
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,150
Big news!

162
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,590
Let go!

163
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,730
Zhou Yu.

164
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,070
Let me inform you.

165
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,250
Today, now,

166
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,890
I'll take Chen Jun away.

167
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,500
Yiyi, stop it.

168
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,350
I'll accompany you after work.

169
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,050
You always say that.

170
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,580
Every time you get off work late.

171
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,240
Zhou Yu!

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,600
You evil boss.

173
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,820
You're dating while working.

174
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,250
You still have time to make pottery
during lunch break!

175
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,780
Have you ever thought that

176
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,270
your employees also need time
to accompany their girlfriends?

177
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:06,470
Zhou...

178
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,110
Mr. Zhou.

179
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,590
I didn't think that way.

180
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,720
Yiyi.

181
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,750
Yiyi.

182
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,880
I have an important meeting today.

183
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,110
I promise

184
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,790
I'll get off work early today.

185
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,730
Okay?

186
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,180
Chen Jun.

187
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,190
We've only been together for a few days.

188
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,520
You don't even want to go shopping with me?

189
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,330
No.

190
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,440
You must be.

191
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,390
You still deny it?

192
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,240
Yiyi,

193
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,700
let me go shopping with you.

194
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,870
I've always wanted to say that

195
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,990
you're a star with the best taste in clothes

196
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,310
that I've ever seen.

197
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,270
I wonder

198
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,510
if I have the honor

199
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,840
to go shopping with you?

200
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,580
Really?

201
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,920
Yes.

202
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,610
Let's go.

203
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,440
Let's go.

204
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,290
Let's go.

205
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,790
I'm off work!

206
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,670
Miss Su Qing.

207
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,880
Zhou's Group is here.

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,500
[I believe breaking off the engagement
is our common thought.]

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,500
[You can contact me at your free time.
I'm waiting for your reply. Zhou Yu.]

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,500
[Hello, Miss Su Qing.
I'm Zhou Yu from Zhou's Group.]

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,500
[Sorry for bothering.
I want to talk about breaking off our engagement.]

212
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Watch out.

213
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,370
Well...

214
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,620
All right.

215
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm done.

216
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,920
You really have nothing to buy?

217
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,500
That's all.

218
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,020
Great.

219
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,770
Let's find a place to have coffee.

220
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,490
Wait.

221
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,390
Only I bought things.

222
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,790
You didn't buy anything.

223
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,860
I don't need it.

224
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,470
No way.

225
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,040
We went shopping together.

226
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,150
How can I be the only one to buy things?

227
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,520
How about this?

228
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't you think I have good taste?

229
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,790
Let me pick one for you.

230
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,120
Forget it.

231
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,400
Pick one and finish it.

232
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,210
Okay.

233
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,470
Then...

234
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,330
Let's go to that shop.

235
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,990
Its style suits you very well.

236
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,130
What do you think?

237
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,530
Since Sun Wei and the Zhou family
are so cold,

238
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,190
we should do something to remind her.

239
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,590
What the Zhou family cares about most now

240
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,520
is the marriage with the Su family.

241
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,450
If something happens to Su Qing,

242
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,230
they won't be able to explain.

243
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,580
Su Qing is picking clothes inside.

244
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,170
Keep an eye on her

245
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,960
and wait for her to be alone.

246
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,630
Welcome.

247
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,480
Don't block our entrance.

248
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,530
It can affect our business.

249
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,110
Go away!

250
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,910
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,640
Sorry.

252
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
It's so pretty.

253
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,220
Not bad.

254
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,730
Let me see. It's pretty.

255
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,940
Is there no small size?

256
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,150
Sorry, Miss.

257
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,990
For our clothes here,

258
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,050
there's only one piece per size.

259
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,310
The piece in small size was just sold out.

260
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,670
Excuse me.

261
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,280
How about I give you this?

262
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,790
It suits you.

263
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
I'll look around.

264
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,420
Really?

265
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,000
Thank you.

266
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,030
Thank you.

267
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,960
You're welcome.

268
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,390
This is the last one.

269
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,450
Let's look around.

270
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,090
Let's look at something else.

271
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,530
Biao.

272
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,890
Su Qing is out.

273
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,880
She's alone.

274
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,350
Okay.

275
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,590
[Snapdragon Farm]

276
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,560
That's why

277
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,880
you wanted to keep that farm.

278
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,370
Such a good farm...

279
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,150
It's a pity to destroy it.

280
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,460
Boss, have some tea.

281
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,470
Okay.

282
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Have some fruits.

283
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,700
We grow them ourselves.

284
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,900
No additives.

285
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,170
In our place,

286
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,200
you can also have a party.

287
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,040
Many companies have been here.

288
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,760
The materials.

289
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,560
Wait a minute.

290
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,780
It's written here.

291
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,790
Ge.

292
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,270
Where is the boss?

293
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,800
I don't know.

294
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,900
Maybe he left.

295
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,980
He left?

296
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,670
So soon?

297
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,780
I haven't finished introducing.

298
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,270
Why did you call me here in such a hurry?

299
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,670
Zhou Yu's fiancee is fake.

300
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,770
She is not Su Qing.

301
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,130
It doesn't matter anymore.

302
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,260
What matters is that she's kidnapped.

303
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,230
Look.

304
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,090
Who is this?

305
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,600
How dare the crazy guys kidnap

306
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,630
in broad daylight?

307
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,790
They only care about money.

308
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,500
Then why did they contact you?

309
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,180
What's your relationship with them?

310
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,210
They had some business

311
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,820
with the Zhou family before.

312
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,430
But it has been a long time.

313
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,490
They came for money this time.

314
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,230
Business relationship?

315
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,100
I'll report it to the president.

316
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,620
No.

317
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,710
You can't tell him.

318
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,100
It's broken the law.

319
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,060
If we don't tell him,

320
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,320
how can we two solve it?

321
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,400
I can’t let Zhou Mingde know

322
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,650
I have something on him.

323
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,210
If we don't tell him,

324
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,210
what should we do?

325
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,530
Should we call the police?

326
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,330
No.

327
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
We can't call the police.

328
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,950
Okay.

329
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,770
I won't call the police.

330
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,760
But you give me a reason.

331
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,360
It involves some illegal activities
of the Zhou family.

332
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,660
How about

333
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,030
we pay the ransom?

334
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,000
How to pay?

335
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,350
And to pay whom?

336
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,400
What if they don't let her go
after getting paid?

337
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,820
Then let's go together.

338
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,880
I saved some money.

339
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,370
We'll go abroad together.

340
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,190
Do you think the president
will let go of us?

341
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,710
We'll just die together.

342
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,710
If I go in,

343
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,800
Zhou Mingde will be involved.

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,460
Calm down.

345
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,720
Calm down.

346
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,580
If they only want money,

347
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,530
it means we still have time.

348
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,600
Tell me everything about this person.

349

385
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,710
Hurry up.

386
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,900
No one answered.

387
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,590
But Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

388
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,440
Yiyi...

389
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,160
She just

390
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,920
can forget everything when shopping.

391
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,180
Do you know the clothes shop she prefers?

392
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,850
Yes.

393
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,130
Send it to my phone.

394
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,620
Sir,

395
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,950
are you picking clothes for your girlfriend?

396
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,130
We focus on making private clothes.

397
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:04,370
Excuse me.

398
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,240
We have clothes in various styles.

399
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,570
Have you seen this girl?

400
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,550
She

401
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,140
did come here.

402
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,370
She was with another girl

403
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,290
who looks like...

404
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,310
a star.

405
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,330
Where did they go?

406
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,240
They

407
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,920
bought some clothes and left.

408
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,030
To which way?

409
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,960
Do you remember?

410
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,140
I think it's that way.

411
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:22,790
Thank you.

412
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,720
You’re welcome.

413
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,310
Jiang Lai.

414
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,150
You can’t be hurt.

415
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,120
How's Li Tingjiang doing?

416
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,110
Why is there no news?

417
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,410
Does Zhou Mingde know it?

418
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,980
Madam,

419
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,010
don't be too anxious.

420
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,600
I think

421
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,230
he should be back soon.

422
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,910
Who said I was waiting for him?

423
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,470
I can only hear you shouting when coming in.

424
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,470
Sir, you're back.

425
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,150
What are you yelling about?

426
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,240
Mingde, I…

427
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,520
How old are you?

428
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,370
Do you look like a mother?

429
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,490
With your emotions,

430
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,690
how can you take good care of Chengzhen?

431
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,730
Looks like he doesn't know

432
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,790
Song Biao kidnapped the fake Su Qing.

433
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,910
Maybe Li Tingjiang

434
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,870
have solved the problem?

435
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,110
Mingde.

436
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,710
I know I was wrong.

437
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,860
It's so late and you didn't come back,

438
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,470
so I'm worried about your health.

439
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,790
I'm fine.

440
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,860
Maybe some people

441
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,620
want me to be blind.

442
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,450
Did someone

443
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,800
upset you?

444
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,840
Who else?

445
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,330
You think you can hide it from the world?

446
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,250
Yu, that brat.

447
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,210
Unfilial son.

448
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,860
You've been free at home

449
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,740
for a long time.

450
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,950
Tomorrow,

451
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,510
go to the company with me.

452
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,740
Who are you?

453
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,300
Let me out!

454
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,280
Why did you tie me up?

455
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,450
Let me out!

456
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,220
Let me out!

457
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,680
Stop arguing,

458
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,960
or I'll cripple you.

459
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,540
Bro.

460
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,040
Sit down.

461
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Don't be nervous.

462
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,130
Let's eat.

463
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,770
Call our bro for dinner.

464
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,610
Okay.

465
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,470
What's going on?

466
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,870
You turned off the light?

467
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,920
I didn't.

468
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,150
I'll go check.

469
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,830
Bro.

470
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,740
What are you waiting for?

471
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
Get your weapons.

472
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,020
You're not Jiang Lai.

473
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,490
Jiang...

474
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,850
Who is Jiang Lai?

475
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,440
I’ll leave her to you.

476
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,560

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,390
Are you okay?

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,470
Are you hurt?

479
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,860
Are you feeling unwell?

480
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,830
Miss.

481
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,720
Miss.

482
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,440
How's her hand?

483
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,880
Yiyi.

484
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,190
Yiyi.

485
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,750
Why is it so late?

486
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,730
[Zhou Yu, Li Ting Jiang, Chen Jun]

489
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,950
I fell asleep
during the ear-cleaning
with Yiyi.

490
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,830
Where are you?

491
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,070
What's wrong?

492
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Where are you?

493
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,240
Nothing.

494
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,190
I'm fine.

495
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,350
That's good.

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,150
That's good.

497
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,470
I was doing ear-cleaning with Yiyi,

498
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,730
and fell asleep since it's comfortable.

499
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,620
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,400
What's wrong?

501
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,690
Did something happen?

502
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,310
Someone sent me an anonymous email,

503
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,840
saying you were kidnapped.

504
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,390
I'm glad you're okay.

505
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,840
Are you okay?

506
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,230

I won't lose contact again.

511
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,060
I was shocked when I checked my phone.

No.

Okay.

00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,180
Stop calling.

this means that

you suppose your dad

565
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
you colluded with this girl to lie to me

567
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,040

I lied to you,

Fine.

578
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,420
Since you like dating,

579
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,120
I'll grant your wish.

580
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,890
Don't intervene in the resort business.

581
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,090
From now on,

582
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,620
leave it to Mr. Sun.

583
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,180
I'm afraid not.

584
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,630
Mr. Gu of Jujiang Capital has decided
to cooperate with me.

585
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,270
Then our cooperation

586
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,340
is a deal.

587
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,300
Okay. Thank you.

588
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,350
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

589
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,090
I believe

590
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,470
it's your best choice

591
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,710
to invest in the resort.

592
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,390
I trust you.

593
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,570
Thank you.

594
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,520
He plans to invest a lot

595
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,800
in the resort project.

596
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,780
Dad.

597
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,160
You know it.

598
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,470
Mr. Gu only recognizes one person in charge

599
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,230
for the project.

600
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,600
What do you mean?

601
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,640
I mean

602
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,050
this project

603
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,020
must be carried on by me.

604
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,830
Uncle Zhou.

605
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,219
Hello.

606
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,110
I'm Su Qing.

607
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,090
You're Su Qing?

608
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,090
Hello.

609
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,610
We meet again.
