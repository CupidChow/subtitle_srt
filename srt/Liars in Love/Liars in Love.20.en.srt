Do you really think you can be with her forever?

155
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,540
If you weren't my son

156
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,660
and you couldn't help her get the farm,

157
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,030

194
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,560
Dad!

195
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,570
Qing.

196
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,570
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

197
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,140
I wanted to give you a big surprise.

198
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,580
Uncle Su.

199
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,170
Yu has grown up.

200
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,060
You're indeed a young talent.

201
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,800
Not at all.

202
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,260
-Thank you.
-You're good.

203
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,410
Let's not stand here.

204
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,900
Take a seat.

205
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Have a seat.

206
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
Come on.

207
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,050
Let's go.

208
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,880
Thank you.

209
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,170
Come on.

210
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,710
Su.

211
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,240
Come on.

212
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,640
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

213
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,890
I'm so relieved

214
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,570
that your son is in charge.

215
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,650
-Uncle Su.
-Come on, Yu.

216
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,500
Here's to you.

217
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,360
Come on.

218
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,480
Yu

219
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
is not as good as Qing.

220
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
The resort plan is designed by Qing.

221
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,140
It's a perfect blend

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,070
of humanity and architectural aesthetics.

223
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,070
Qing's plan

224
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,970
is extraordinary.

225
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,880
Qing.

226
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,140
Drink a toast to Uncle Zhou.

227
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,210
Uncle Zhou.

228
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,010
Here's to you.

229
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,610
Girls should drink less.

230
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,000
Yu.

231
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,290
Drink it for Qing.

232
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,930
Come on.

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,730
Yu.

234
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,390
You're a good drinker.

235
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,310
Su.

236
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,670
Look at them.

237
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,690
They look great together.

238
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,890
Yu

239
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,700
is really handsome.

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,550
Qing

241
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,980
is outstanding.

242
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,130
Do you know that?

243
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,850
Qing's plan

244
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,930
is very good.

245
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,580
Do you want to see it?

246
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,440
It'll definitely be impressive.

247
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,330
I'm really looking forward to it.

248
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,060
Come on.

249
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,520
Come on.

250
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,250
Let's drink.

251
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,750
Jiang Lai.

252
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,100
Chairman needs

253
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,330
a design plan for the resort.

254
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,280
I'll send you the location.

255
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,810
Hurry up and bring it there.

256
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Now?

257
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,170
Yes.

258
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,410
I'll be right there.

259
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,200
Yu.

260
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,460
Have another drink with Uncle Su.

261
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,980
Okay.

262
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,510
-Yu.
-Uncle Su.

263
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,320
Here's to you.

264
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:17,840
Come on.

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,770
Cheers.

266
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,450
Don't let him drink so much.

267
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,340
He can't drink as much as you do.

268
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,210
Dad.

269
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,570
You're not married yet
and you're worried about him?

270
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,050
Are you okay?

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,930
Girls have to get married
when they become adults.

272
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,410
Thank you.

273
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,980
We'll be a family sooner or later.

274
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,580
Yes.

275
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,850
Su.

276
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,270
I think

277
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
it's time to put the marriage

278
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
on the agenda.

279
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Why are you here to deliver this?

280
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,350
Assistant Zhao asked me to give it to Chairman.

281
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,630
Give it to me.

282
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,140
I'll take it in for you.

283
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,680
Thank you.

284
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you want me to tell Zhou Yu?

285
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,040
No.

286
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm leaving.

287
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,010
Sorry.

288
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,400
Thank you.

289
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,770
Are you really okay?

290
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,860
Yes.

291
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm leaving.

292
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Why do you have time
to invite me for skewers today?

293
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,460
Don't you have to go on a date with Zhou Yu?

294
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,440
You were fined so much
for stealing the phone for me.

295
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,680
I have to make it up to you.

296
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,140
Come on.

297
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,840
Cheers.

298
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,400
Something's wrong with you.

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
There must be something.

300
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,450
Stop talking nonsense and eat.

301
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,760
I know you well.

302
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,010
Tell me.

303
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,210
What happened between you and Zhou Yu?

304
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Is it so obvious?

305
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,000
Maybe Zhou Yu and I

306
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
are not suitable for each other.

307
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,340
Why do you say that?

308
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,530
Be careful.

309
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,640
This way.

310
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,320
This way. Straighten up.

311
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,480
Watch the steps.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
Lie down here.

313
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,410
Okay.

314
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,380
So,

315
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,660
Zhou Yu and I are from two different worlds.

316
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,910
Alright, stop drinking.

317
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,580
-You're drunk.
-Give it to me.

318
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,920
I shouldn't have let you get involved in this.

319
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,040
You drank too much.

320
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,180
Let me send you home.

321
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,480
No.

322
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,830
I won't go back.

323
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,390
I want to call Zhou Yu

324
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,220
and ask him if he loves me.

325
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,340
Where is Zhou Yu?

326
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,800
[Zhou Yu]

327
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,470
Jiang Lai?

328
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,170
Miss Su, why are you here?

329
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,410
Zhou Yu was drunk yesterday.

330
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,600
I sent him home.

331
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,740
I was afraid something would happen to him.

332
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,670
So I stayed here to take care of him.

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,100
Don't worry. I slept on the sofa.

334
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,790
Nothing happened between us.

335
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,390
That's not what I meant.

336
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,550
It's getting late.

337
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,750
See you in the office.

338
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
Are you just back or are you going out?

339
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,840
I had dinner with Qi Wei last night. It was too late.

340
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
So I went back to the farm.

341
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,040
I was drunk last night.

342
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,860
I can't remember anything.

343
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Did Chen Jun send me home?

344
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,140
Maybe.

345
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,650
You don't know

346
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,810
that I had dinner
with Su Qing's father yesterday.

347
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,550
I accidentally drank too much.

348
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,350
Did the talk go well?

349
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,450
Yes.

350
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,350
He kept letting me drink.

351
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,300
I didn't remember anything in the end.

352
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,230
I drank too much.

353
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,680
Great job.

354
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,410
You cooked that?

355
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,860
By the way, let's visit grandpa
together tomorrow.

356
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,640
Do you want to have some?

357
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,360
I've eaten.

358
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,350
[Jiang Lai]

359
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,010
Mingde, you didn't go to the group today?

360
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,560
Are you going out?

361
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,350
No, I'm just packing my closet.

362
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,960
It's a nice day today.

363
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,070
You can wash Chengzhen's clothes too.

364
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay.

365
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,740
I'll go and call the maid.

366
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,350
I forgot to tell you.

367
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,450
I gave her a day off.

368
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,620
You should also

369
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,820
do the laundry for our son, right?

370
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,610
It's better to wash them by hand.

371
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,100
Of course.

372
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,940
I'll pack up

373
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,510
and change my clothes.

374
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,330
Change.

375
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,500
Here.

376
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,580
And...

377
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,770
Good work, everyone.

378
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,770
Drink something.

379
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,850
Thank you, Special Assistant Li.

380
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,250
You've bought so many.

381
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,100
Share them with others.

382
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,790
Okay.

383
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,130
What's this? It's still hot.

384
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,140
It's...

385
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,890
You kept coughing,

386
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,760
so I didn't buy you coffee.

387
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,690
Thank you.

388
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,560
Yesterday...

389
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,240
Jiang Lai.

390
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,720
I don't want Zhou Yu to know
I was there yesterday.

391
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,280
Shouldn't Chengzhen's clothes

392
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,350
be disinfected?

393
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,350
Okay. I'll disinfect them later.

394
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,130
Mingde, are you hungry?

395
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,200
Let me get you something to eat.

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,880
No need.

397
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,820
I have an appointment
with Su and some friends tonight.

398
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,920
You cook Chengzhen dinner.

399
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,650
Okay.

400
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,890
I'll wait for you.

401
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,970
[Vice President Sun is out.]

402
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
She's still so impatient.

403
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,830
Let me ask you.

404
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,710
Ask her.

405
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,150
This is...

406
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,360
This...

407
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,210
This one...

408
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,990
Adjust here.

409
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,120
We'll adjust it this way, right?

410
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,360
Thank you.

411
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,090
Okay. That's all for today.

412
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,870
Thank you for your hard work.

413
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,480
Get off work.

414
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,970
[I just got off work. I'll be there later.]

415
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,260
[At Room 1818.]

416
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,500
Who are you going to call?

417
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,110
No. I just want to tell Mrs. Wang

418
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,390
that she doesn't need to wait for me.

419
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,820
You have an appointment with Mrs. Wang?

420
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,390
Yes, we went out for a walk.

421
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
I was sweating.

422
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,430
I wanted to take a shower

423
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,730
and then take a walk.

424
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,890
Really?

425
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,040
But I just called her.

426
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,880
She said she went to Singapore
to see her daughter today.

427
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,880
Mingde.

428
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,870
I was wrong. I lied this time.

429
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,420
I was too tired. I wanted to take a break.

430
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,760
You're lying.

431
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,390
Who are you dating here?

432
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,240
No one.

433
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm alone.

434
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,300
Mingde, trust me.

435
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,630
We have Chengzhen.

436
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,960
I can't do anything wrong to you.

437
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,590
You know we have Chengzhen?

438
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,990
Who is it?

439
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,580
You won't tell me?

440
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,300
Fine.

441
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,250
I'll wait here with you

442
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,570
to see who will come.

443
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,220
Mingde.

444
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,460
Hello, sir.

445
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,540
Your room service.

446
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,200
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

447
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,250
This is not over.

448
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,570
From now on, you stay at home.

449
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,930
Don't go out until you tell the truth.

450
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,520
Sun Wei asked you
to help her plan the car accident?

451
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,580
What car accident?

452
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,980
Of course it was a car accident

453
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,420
that killed Zhang Ran, the grandson

454
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,160
of Zhang Guodong, the chairman

455
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,820
of Zhou Group and Zhang Group.

456
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,420
She wanted to kill Zhang Ran?

457
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,920
But Zhou Yu should be the biggest threat to her.

458
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,170
Because the real mastermind behind the accident

459
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,800
was Zhou Mingde.

460
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,300
Zhou Mingde heard that Zhang Guodong

461
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,220
had made a private will
to give the group to Zhang Ran.

462
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,080
He wanted to kill Zhang Ran secretly

463
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,610
before Zhang Ran came back.

464
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,780
That was funny.

465
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,300
Zang Ran

466
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,830
wasn't the only one in the car.

467
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,030
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

468
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,230
Don't worry. I'm here.

469
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,940
Did I scare you?

470
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,909
I'm fine.

471
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,550
What nightmare did you have?

472
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,750
Why are you sweating?

473
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,760
Nothing. I'm going to meet a client.

474
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,449
Then I'll pick you up to see the grandpa.

475
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,489
You don't have to pick me up.

476
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,179
It's troublesome to go back and forth.

477
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,510
See you at the hospital.

478
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,760
Okay.

479
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,690
Special Assistant Li?

480
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,150
Aren't you working today?

481
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,600
Is Jiang Lai in the office?

482
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,770
She asked for leave.

483
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,760
She asked for leave with Mr. Zhou.

484
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,830
Special Assistant Li, you're leaving?

485
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,060
No, I have to go downstairs.

486
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:32,900
Senior?

487
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,810
Lai.

488
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,490
I have something to tell you.

489
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,230
Zhou Yu is not here, right?

490
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,060
Let's talk at the group.

491
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,120
I need to go out now.

492
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,100
Be careful of Zhou Yu.

493
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,730
What do you mean?

494
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,130
Zhou Yu's purpose
of returning to China is not that simple.

495
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,910
He most likely

496
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,440
returned to China

497
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,270
to avenge his cousin, Zhang Ran.

498
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,790
Zhang Ran?
