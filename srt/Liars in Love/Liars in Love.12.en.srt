[Episode 12]

4
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,770
I didn't expect that you would come.

5
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,920
We did everything we could.

6
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,270
Now, we can only wait.

7
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,870
Good morning.

8
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,190
Why are you here?

9
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,509
I heard that you are going to have a team building.

10
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,970
I'm here to join in the fun.

11
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,480
Special Assistant Li,

12
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,210
since you're so enthusiastic,

13
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,510
do your job well.

14
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,260
Looks like Lai knows.

15
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,590
Not bad.

16
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,430
Yu.

17
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,829
I've got you a seat.

18
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,210
Why are you here?

19
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm the ambassador of Dream City.

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,410
So I'm also a member of our company.

21
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,630
Mr. Zhou, I had no choice.

22
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,800
Come on.

23
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,930
I like sitting in the back.

24
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,700
Come here.

25
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,610
Thank you.

26
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,140
Morning, Special Assistant Li.

27
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,810
Morning, Special Assistant.

28
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,340
Morning.

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,880
Drive yourself.

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,820
My car is broken.

31
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,020
I sent it for repairs.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,810
Is it good?

33
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,840
You always get car sick.

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Remember to take your medicine.

35
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,630
For car sickness,

36
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,350
ensuring good air circulation is more effective.

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,060
How is it?

38
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,000
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,910
If you feel unwell,

40
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,350
remember to tell me.

41
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,920
It's great to be young.

42
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,260
You have so much energy!

43
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,430
Shan.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,950
Do you think

45
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,310
Special Assistant Li likes Miss Su?

46
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,930
You overthink.

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,209
Listen to me.

48
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,700
Mr. Zhou and Special Assistant Li both like Miss Su.

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,250
Miss Su

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
likes Special Assistant Li,

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,020
but they can't be together because of the marriage alliance.

52
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,260
What a beautiful forbidden love!

53
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,050
You've watched too many idol dramas.

54
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,450
I think you should switch careers

55
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,980
and become a screenwriter.

56
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,150
You know me.

57
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,520
You know what I'm good at.

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,650
Just eat your chips.

59
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,780
Here.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Let me give you a massage.

61
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,340
Say it.

62
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,400
What is it this time?

63
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,560
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,150
It's rare that our son isn't home today.

65
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,020
Can't we

66
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,580
just enjoy the time together as a couple?

67
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,290
But there indeed is something

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,550
I want to tell you.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Go ahead.

70
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,590
Can we start

71
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,940
the resort project?

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,150
Yu's final performance is not out yet.

73
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,150
It's not too late to start it

74
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,960
after your bet is over.

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,000
He just got caught with fake accounts.

76
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,010
By the time they're dealt with,

77
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,420
the deadline will have passed.

78
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,860
Isn't it obvious who wins or loses?

79
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,070
Just wait a while longer.

80
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,710
Honey.

81
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,390
Don't

82
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,710
bite off more than you can chew.

83
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,610
You might end up overwhelmed.

84
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,000
We're finally here.

85
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,490
This place is so beautiful.

86
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,350
If it weren't for Mr. Zhou,

87
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,200
we wouldn't have known

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,620
that the Zhou's Group

89
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
owns such a primitive camping spot.

90
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,909
This is nice.

91
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,659
This is the perfect place for me.

92
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,340
I'm so bored staying in the office every day.

93
00:06:59,370 --> 00:06:59,860
Here.

94
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,410
What are you doing?

95
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm afraid you'll be cold.

96
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,520
What's wrong with you?

97
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,480
Cover yourself. It's too hot.

98
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
Don't get tanned.

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,360
No need.

100
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,490
There's fish!

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,490
Do you want some?

102
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,670
I'll catch some for you.

103
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,470
No need.

104
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,890
We brought a lot of food.

105
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,400
We can catch it for fun.

106
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,910
Special Assistant Li.

107
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,170
Be careful not to fall.

108
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,500
I got it.

109
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,750
Yu.

110
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,810
You're amazing!

111
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,980
Nice, Mr. Zhou.

112
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,820
Here you go.

113
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,790
Nice!

114
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,170
Awesome, Mr. Zhou.

115
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,240
Get one more.

116
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,060
Okay!

117
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,840
There are crabs, too.

118
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,390
It's so small that it's not even enough to fill the gap between the teeth.

119
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,250
Add some water.

120
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,370
Come on, Yu.

121
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,820
One more, Mr. Zhou.

122
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,930
Almost.

123
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,320
There...

124
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,890
Over there.

125
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,810
Where?

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,320
There.

127
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,250
Next to your foot.

128
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,920
Left foot.

129
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,790
Mr. Zhou!

130
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,870
Mr. Zhou, are you alright?

131
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,750
Yu.

132
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,420
Careful. Hurry.

133
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,190
Are you okay?

134
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,150
Are you hurt?

135
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,050
Su Qing.

136
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,000
Pull me up.

137
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,720
Yu.

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,960
Are you okay?

139
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,240
I'm fine.

140
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,550
You lost.

141
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,610
Let me do it.

142
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,040
Let me.

143
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,690
This is heavy.

144
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,490
Leave it to me.

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
We don't need you.

146
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,350
After our last date,

147
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,580
you've been ignoring me.

148
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,900
You didn't reply to my messages.

149
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,030
I couldn't find you,

150
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,480
so I came here.

151
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,770
Yu.

152
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,800
It is so hard to set up the camping table.

153
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,110
Come and help me.

154
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,160
I'll wait for you at the back of the mountain

155
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,200
at 8 p.m. tonight.

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
I have something to tell you.

157
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,560
Special Assistant Li.

158
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,210
Go.

159
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,160
Miss Chen called "Yu."

160
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,440
I'm sending you there.

161
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm on vacation.

162
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,190
I don't have to follow your orders.

163
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,210
Alright.

164
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,170
I'll go.

165
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,900
Be careful.

166
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,640
Why did it rain so suddenly?

167
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,360
I have built the tent for a long time.

168
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,560
Now, it's all in vain.

169
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,470
That's right.

170
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,280
What a pity.

171
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,520
It's not romantic anymore.

172
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,120
Tingting,

173
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,280
if you don't feel well,

174
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,940
why don't you go back and rest early?

175
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,980
No way.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,730
It's not easy for me to come out.

177
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,490
Although I have gastroenteritis,

178
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,520
I can only watch you play.

179
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,120
But my body needs to be with everyone.

180
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,830
Then, lean on me.

181
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,310
Su Qing,

182
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,490
you're so nice.

183
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,670
We can't just

184
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,690
eat and drink?

185
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,250
Let's play a game.

186
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,730
How about King's Game?

187
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,800
What is King's Game?

188
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,460
You don't even know that?

189
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,930
Yeah.

190
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,790
You're so outdated.

191
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,280
To play King's Game, we each draw a card.

192
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,590
The one who draws the king

193
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,990
can appoint someone to do anything,

194
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,700
including, but not limited to

195
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,540
drinking.

196
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,890
Let's play this.

197
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,440
Come on.

198
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,190
Jun.

199
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,650
Learn to serve.

200
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,010
Okay.

201
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,910
Start from you.

202
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,750
I'll have one.

203
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,940
I'm the king.

204
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,110
Special Assistant Li.

205
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,020
Please.

206
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,680
Come on, let's continue.

207
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
Mr. Zhou is so lucky.

208
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
The king draws first.

209
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,530
Yes.

210
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,910
This...

211
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:20,970
You cheated.

212
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,740
It has nothing to do with me.

213
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,860
Jun.

214
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,030
You're indeed Mr. Zhou's secretary.

215
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,810
Serve again.

216
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,270
Hurry up.

217
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,040
No need to draw anymore.

218
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,690
Mr. Zhou.

219
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,750
Of course,

220
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,080
you don't have to drink.

221
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,490
Just answer a question.

222
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,450
I won't.

223
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,260
I'll drink.

224
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,460
Well...

225
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,730
Everyone...

226
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,500
How about…

227
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,230
I quit.

228
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,450
Let's stop the game.

229
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,910
I need to use the bathroom.

230
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,660
Wait for me.

231
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,250
I'll wait for you.

232
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,450
I'll wait for you.

233
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,760
Yes, take a rest.

234
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,650
See?

235
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,650
Am I right?

236
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,960
Good for you.

237
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,380
Although I'm sick,

238
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,040
I can see everything clearly.

239
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,780
I'm back.

240
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,510
Tingjiang.

241
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,520
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

242
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,110
Where is Special Assistant Li?

243
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,240
Why can't I find him?

244
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,730
I heard he went to the team building with Mr. Zhou and the others.

245
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,260
What are you doing?

246
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,180
You scared me.

247
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,960
What are you doing here so late?

248
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,370
I miss you.

249
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,340
Everyone in the company is here today.

250
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,480
It's hard for us to explain if anyone sees us.

251
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,280
Go back first.

252
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,180
What?

253
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,210
Are you scared?

254
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,300
No.

255
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,230
But we will have

256
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,450
plenty of opportunities in the future.

257
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,970
Really?

258
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes.

259
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,290
Where are you going at this hour?

260
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,640
Leave me alone.

261
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,720
Go back first.

262
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,170
Be good.

263
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,770
Okay.

264
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I'll walk you out.

265
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,240
Let's go.

266
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,890
Let's go.

267
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,270
Go.

268
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,410
I'm going.

269
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,850
Did you wait long?

270
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,190
Take it.

271
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,140
What is this?

272
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,580
One o'clock position.

273
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,410
Didn't you always want to stargaze

274
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,840
when you were in school?

275
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,100
I left in a hurry last time.

276
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,330
I didn't have time to say what I wanted to say,

277
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,680
so I asked you out here.

278
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,830
Lai.

279
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,280
I know

280
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,820
when we were in school,

281
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,510
I held back a lot of things.

282
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,190
I must have hurt you

283
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,750
when I left without saying goodbye.

284
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,490
But I'm back now.

285
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,910
Give me another chance.

286
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Let's start over.

287
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,870
I will fulfill

288
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,270
everything I haven't done.

289
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,350
You're juggling two relationships.

290
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,280
I advise you not to act all romantic

291
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,590
because you'll be easily exposed.

292
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,600
Why are you here?

293
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,790
To pick up my fiancee, of course.

294
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,830
Stop acting.

295
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,620
This is between me and Lai.

296
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,080
It's none of your business.

297
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,040
You know she's not your fiancee.

298
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,750
This is also between us.

299
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,350
It has nothing to do with you.

300
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,340
Lai.

301
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,740
What happened between us is in the past.

302
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,430
You should cherish the person beside you.

303
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,880
Otherwise, it will hurt both me and her.

304
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,850
That person is not my girlfriend.

305
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,200
Give me some more time.

306
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,830
I will handle this well.

307
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,890
And then, I can stand in front of you with a clear conscience.

308
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,040
When I was working,

309
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,850
I met all kinds of men.

310
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,280
No matter what kind of identity

311
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,500
or status they had,

312
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,400
when they were exposed,

313
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,060
they would say the same thing,

314
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,040
"Give me some more time."

315
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,940
"Give me another chance."

316
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,540
"I will definitely change."

317
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,880
The girls who came to me

318
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,500
will get soft-hearted

319
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,310
and believe them again.

320
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,560
I thought

321
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,820
they were so silly at that time.

322
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,750
Why would they believe it when it obviously was a lie?

323
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,670
But now I get it.

324
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,800
It's not that they believed it.

325
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,380
It's just because they still had expectations.

326
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,680
But I'm different from them.

327
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,190
I...

328
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,920
Why are you here?

329
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,400
Where is Zhou Yu?

330
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,390
The shower in my room is broken.

331
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,140
Well,

332
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,640
Mr. Zhou said he was going to the mountain.

333
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,890
Su Qing.

334
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,220
Su Qing?

335
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,220
Well, she...

336
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,960
Is Su Qing not back, either?

337
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,860
I think so.

338
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,550
Their relationship

339
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,710
is getting better and better.

340
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,830
Not at all.

341
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,740
I want to go up the mountain.

342
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,010
Now?

343
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,620
Yes.

344
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,080
Right now.

345
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,800
I don't think it's a good time.

346
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,060
Now!

347
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,280
Why aren't we there yet?

348
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,830
Right away.

349
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,520
It must be right this time.

350
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,960
Right away…

351
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,570
I'm not walking anymore.

352
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,900
Where are you taking me?

353
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,640
My shoes are dirty.

354
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,690
I have tissues.

355
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,390
Alright, stop looking.

356
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,710
I'm not going.

357
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,690
Shall we go down the mountain?

358
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,390
Yes.

359
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,740
Wait.

360
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,190
Hold this for me.

361
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,020
What are you doing?

362
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,230
Let me carry you.

363
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,900
Here.

364
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,890
Can you do it?

365
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,750
Yes.

366
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,150
Okay.

367
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,510
Be careful.

368
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,480
It's all your fault.

369
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,360
If you didn't lead the wrong way,

370
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,110
I should have been stargazing with Yu.

371
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,970
Alright.

372
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,470
It's all my fault.

373
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,600
Be careful.

374
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,680
But look,

375
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,720
you can see stars here, too.

376
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,600
It's so pretty.

377
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,250
So we don't have to go to the top of the mountain.

378
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,510
As long as you're willing to look up,

379
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,240
you can also see the stars here.

380
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:36,760
Okay.

381
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,720
You can walk on your own from here.

382
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,990
If someone sees us,

383
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,880
it'll be bad.

384
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,570
What do you mean?

385
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,770
Do you despise me?

386
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,190
No.

387
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,660
It's not like that. I...

388
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
You're a star.

389
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,530
If others see you,

390
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,740
they'll make things up again.

391
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,940
It'll be bad if you have a scandal again.

392
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,780
Again?

393
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,610
You mean I've already had too many scandals?

394
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,190
Are you accusing me of being promiscuous?

395
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,140
I-I'm not talking about you.

396
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,550
I meant those pa…

397
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,780
paparazzi,

398
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,960
and entertainment reporters.

399
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,060
Don't they like to make up stories?

400
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,250
Why are you laughing?

401
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,260
I'm serious.

402
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,510
I see.

403
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,440
Let's go.

404
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,710
Why are you hurt?

405
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,590
I guess I didn't see some branches

406
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,850
because it's too dark.

407
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,250
Just apply some medicine when we are back, and I'll be fine.

408
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,780
Let's go.

409
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,790
Idiot.

410
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,380
Then… Let's hurry up.

411
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,120
Otherwise, we'll delay the fool's medicine application.

412
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,920
In college,

413
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,810
he always showed up

414
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,880
when I was down or sad.

415
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,380
Gradually,

416
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,440
I started to trust him.

417
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,940
I thought he was reliable,

418
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,850
sincere,

419
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,130
and responsible.

420
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,220
I trusted him so much.

421
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,930
I was wrong.

422
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,390
I never thought he was full of lies

423
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,090
and avoided responsibility.

424
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
How can I trust him for so many years?

425
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,580
You ran fast.

426
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,070
What are you doing here?

427
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,060
I'm afraid you'll take things too hard.

428
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,270
If you kill yourself,

429
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,130
I can ask someone to rescue you from the river.

430
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,750
Thank you.

431
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,010
Why didn't you ask me

432
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,380
why I had to ask someone else to rescue you?

433
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,660
Why?

434
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,790
Because I can't swim.

435
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,680
What a cold joke!

436
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,920
Do you regret

437
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,280
rejecting him?

438
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,150
I'm just mad that I was so wrong about him.

439
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,900
You should vent

440
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,030
your anger.

441
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,270
Look.

442
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,840
This is what angers you.

443
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,550
Do it like this.

444
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,390
Go.

445
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,950
It's solved.

446
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,450
Here.

447
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,240
Try it.

448
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,380
Try it.

449
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,820
Childish.

450
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,610
Fine.

451
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,670
I'll do it for you.

452
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,240
Go.

453
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,340
Go away.

454
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,960
As far as possible.

455
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,520
Darn it.

456
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,790
Even if I wake up late, they can't just leave without me.

457
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,850
Even if they didn't wait, they should have informed me.

458
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,160
Who is it?

459
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,780
Are you okay?

460
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,460
Why are you here?

461
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,180
The lunch I prepared for you got cold.

462
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,870
I'm afraid you won't be able to eat hot food when you get up,

463
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,070
so I bought you another one.

464
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,350
Didn't you leave?

465
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,540
Mr. Zhou and the others went back to work.

466
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,410
I thought

467
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,240
I couldn't leave you here alone.

468
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,790
You have a conscience.

469
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,660
Didn't they say Chen Yiyi was staying here?

470
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,200
Why isn't she anywhere to be seen?

471
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,120
I asked around.

472
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,480
She hasn't checked out.

473
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,060
Is that her?

474
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,170
There's a man there.

475
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,810
Chen Yiyi.

476
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I can't get it.

477
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,590
Go after them!

478
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,530
Go!

479
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,790
Everyone loves you.

480
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,050
Who wouldn't like you?

481
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,260
Hurry up.

482
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,200
You go first.

483
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,000
Luckily, you ran fast.

484
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,390
If the paparazzi caught you, you'll be doomed.

485
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,050
Wait.

486
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:49,840
Chen Jun.

487
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,720
Bye.

488
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,250
Chen Yiyi.

489
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,190
Luckily, you two ran fast.

490
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,790
If the paparazzi caught you, you'll be doomed.

491
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,390
Yes.

492
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,000
I always forget that she's a star.

493
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,540
My approach will only bring her trouble.

494
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,820
Goodbye.

495
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,780
Mr. Zhou,

496
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,460
please take a look at the data these days.

497
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,390
Don't worry.

498
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,070
As long as it goes on like this,

499
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,580
our bet will be fine.

500
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,970
Is Jiang Lai here?

501
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,360
No.

502
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,790
Okay, got it.

503
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,950
I told you that Li

504
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,350
is a bad guy.

505
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,860
I was right.

506
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,590
Forget it.

507
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,040
It's a good thing to see a scumbag's true colors sooner.

508
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,160
You can only meet your Mr. Right

509
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,090
after you say goodbye to Mr. Wrong.

510
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,130
I'm not sad because of Li Tingjiang.

511
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,470
Then, why did you ask me out to the arcade

512
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,870
instead of going to work?

513
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,300
I don't know how to face Zhou Yu.

514
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,870
Him?

515
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,410
Why?

516
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,470
I don't know.

517
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,710
I feel

518
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,420
weird.

519
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,460
You've been living together for so long.

520
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,120
A man and a woman, being alone…

521
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Could it be...

522
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,350
Don't talk nonsense.

523
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,500
We're just working partners.

524
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,110
We signed a contract.

525
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,090
That's good.

526
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm warning you.

527
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,060
Although the best way to forget the old love

528
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,270
is to start a new relationship,

529
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,550
you can't just be with anyone.

530
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,080
Zhou Yu.

531
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,280
Absolutely impossible.

532
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,800
Why?

533
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,350
I don't deserve him?

534
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,270
You are the fake Su Qing.

535
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,639
He is the real Zhou Yu.

536
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,870
Once the contract is over,

537
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,150
you'll have to go back to your own lives.

538
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,510
You and him...

539
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,040
are impossible to be together.

540
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,820
Yes!

541
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,550
Look.

542
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,750
You lost again.

543
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,620
Come again.

544
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,630
I don't think he's back yet.

545
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,570
You didn't go to the company all day.

546
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,500
Where did you go?

547
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,000
I've clocked in for fieldwork.

548
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,130
I didn't approve it.

549
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,410
Then, pay more attention next time.
