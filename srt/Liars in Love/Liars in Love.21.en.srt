00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,650
Jiang Lai, come in.

194
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,550
It’s OK. You go first.

195
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,550
I'll take the next one.

196
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,480
No time, no time!

197
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,090
Jiang Lai, I’m sorry.

198
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,410
I was in a hurry to get into the elevator.

199
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,230
It's okay.

200
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,210
Chen Jun.

201
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,600
Did you skip breakfast?

202
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,930
Me?

203
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,960
Yes, yes.

204
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,690
I forgot to have breakfast this morning.

205
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,860
You have to eat your breakfast.

206
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,610
Got it?

207
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:07,920
Okay.

208
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,750
Thanks, Boss.

209
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,750
Boss.

210
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,530
Here we are.

211
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,240
Everyone,

212
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,000
Mr. Zhou treats us to breakfast.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,860
Come and get it.

214
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,880
Thanks, Boss.

215
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,370
Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

216
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,690
Mr. Zhou.

217
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,070
What is this?

218
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,070
Jiang Lai was distributing breakfast in the office.

219
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,200
I mean what’s in the folder?

220
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,070
I need your signature.

221
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,930
Mr. Zhou.

222
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,680
Did you quarrel with Jiang Lai?

223
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,470
No.

224
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,780
It's normal for a couple to quarrel occasionally.

225
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,970
It just takes one person to take a step,

226
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,230
and then 80% of problems can be solved.

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,430
I told you.

228
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,560
We didn't.

229
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,730
I know men can't swallow their pride sometimes,

230
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,940
but it's better than losing your girlfriend.

231
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,570
Right?

232
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,780
If you find it hard to be alone with her,

233
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,270
you can arrange group activities

234
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,550
to create opportunities.

235
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,950
Then it won't be awkward.

236
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,430
I think you're too idle.

237
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,950
Go and re-organize all the investment documents

238
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,990
of the resort.

239
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,200
I want to see the latest one.

240
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,960
You really don't need me to organize a dinner?

241
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,690
Nice weather today.

242
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,300
Look at the clouds outside.

243
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,310
What's going on?

244
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,960
She sat down as soon as she saw me.

245
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,420
I couldn't stop her.

246
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,250
What now?

247
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,710
I'm going to the bathroom.

248
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,090
OK.

249
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,089
When is Jiang Lai coming?

250
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,710
She should be here if everything goes well.

251
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,950
Chen Jun.

252
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,730
You only tell Jiang Lai when there's good food.

253
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,640
Why are you here?

254
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,750
Can’t I?

255
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,670
Jiang Lai.

256
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,369
I want to talk to you.

257
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,440
Jiang Lai.

258
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,390
What a coincidence.

259
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,920
You're here for dinner too?

260
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,800
Yes.

261
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,070
I suddenly want to eat noodles.

262
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,110
Let's go eat noodles.

263
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,510
Okay.

264
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,910
Let's go.

265
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,420
Sorry for interrupting.

266
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,100
Enjoy.

267
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,750
What are we

268
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,500
going to eat?

269
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,510
Sorry.

270
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,810
I was too hasty.

271
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,290
I just want to talk to you.

272
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,710
There's nothing to talk about.

273
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,280
You mean what I said the other day?

274
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,040
I was joking.

275
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,530
I know you were not joking.

276
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,840
I admit

277
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,270
I hesitated that day.

278
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,190
But it's not because I don't want to marry you.

279
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,120
It's because...

280
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,170
It's because I have some matters

281
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,900
♫The bitterness lingers in my heart♫

282
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,120
to deal with.

283
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,050
I don't want to get you involved.

284
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,500
♫The hidden wound♫

285
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,310
♫The emotions are slipping away♫

286
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,440
It's okay.

287
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,990
You can take your time.

288
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,800
♫Should I try to hold on♫

289
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,450
It has nothing to do with me.

290
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,350
It has nothing to do with you?

291
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,660
♫Don't talk about clearing the fog♫

292
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,390
What do you mean?

293
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,560
♫Love is just a fiction♫

294
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,050
Haven't we always been

295
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,690
♫Like a moth flying into the flame with knowing the trap♫

296
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,570
from different worlds?

297
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,430
Is it because of Su Qing?

298
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,150
If it's because of Su Qing...

299
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,750
It has nothing to do with her.

300
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,530
♫Don't look back♫

301
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,770
She's good.

302
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,030
But her appearance

303
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,200
♫But my steps linger♫

304
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,900
made me feel out of place.

305
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,890
♫It's me♫

306
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,470
It's like I can't fit in

307
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,820
♫Reluctant to let the stars go♫

308
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,810
where I belonged.

309

♫The estranged people tell the story to shadow♫

311

I'll tell you if you feel out of place.

312
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,710
You have my heart

313
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,030
the whole time.

314

315

♫I wish you were behind me♫

317

Let me think about our relationship.

318
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
The snapdragon ceramics are ready.

319
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,260
Let's pick them up together.

320
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,370

338

♫But I'm waiting for you to turn around♫

339

This can't go on.

342
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,530
I have to find another way.

343
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,150
It's all your fault.

344
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,740
If it weren't for you,

345
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,820
he wouldn't have had something on me.

346
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Tell me now.

347
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,800
Do you know where Song Biao is?

348
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,150
I don't know.

349
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,830
I really don't know.

350
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,220
Still denying it?

351
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,070
I'll teach you a lesson.

352
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,630
Where is Song Biao?

353
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,630
I don't know.

354
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,550
I really don't know.

355
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,270
You don't know?

356
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,880
Let go of me!

357
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,620
You still don't know?

358
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Let go of me!

359
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,510
Where is he?

360
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,530
Where?

361
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,510
Let go of me!

362
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,110
It's all your fault!

363
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,950
I'm furious!

364
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,560
I really don't know.

365
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,360
Auntie,

366
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,550
why have mom and dad

367
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,750
been fighting these days?

368
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,600
They haven't been fighting.

369
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,740
It's just...

370
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,980
Just some quarrels at work.

371
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,410
Please don't hit me.

372
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,330
I really don't know.

373
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,170
Chengzhen.

374
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
Chengzhen.

375
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,350
Madam.

376
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,920
Where's Chengzhen?

377
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,710
He played with a water gun after lunch.

378
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,110
He's probably taking a nap in the tent.

379
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,150
Chengzhen.

380
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,940
Chengzhen.

381
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,800
Chengzhen.

382
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,070
Where did he go?

383
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,890
He was here just now.

384
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,910
Give me my phone.

385
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,230
Madam.

386
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,430
Before the chairman went out, he told me...

387
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,430
Give me the phone.

388
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,090
Okay, okay.

389
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,390
Here.

390
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,070
Madam.

391
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,900
Go away!

392
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,220
Chengzhen.

393
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,670
Chengzhen!

394
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,050
I'm sorry.

395
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,410
The owner of the farm went on a trip.

396
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,010
We're not receiving guests.

397
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,570
Lai.

398
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,390
Senior.

399
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,110
You've recovered?

400
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm here to thank you

401
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,740
for sending me to the hospital.

402
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,550
It's nothing.

403
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,550
Don't mention it.

404
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,000
Last time I told you about Zhou Yu.

405
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,780
I don't want to hear his name.

406
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,190
I told you this not to

407
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,700
make you annoyed with him,

408
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,530
but to make you be careful

409
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,190
not to be deceived by him.

410
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,550
Since you're so concerned about me,

411
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,010
why don't you do me a favor?

412
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,770
Sure.

413
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,500
There's a box of goods outside.

414
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,540
Help me move it.

415
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,870
Chengzhen!

416
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,850
Chengzhen!

417
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,060
Chengzhen!

418
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,020
Chengzhen!

419
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,310
Chengzhen.

420
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,560
Chengzhen!

421
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,490
Chengzhen.

422
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,000
Mom.

423
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,190
Chengzhen!

424
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,320
Chengzhen!

425
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,200
Where are you?

426
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,940
Sorry,

427
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,830
the subscriber you dialed is not available.

428
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,210
Please redial later.

429
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,220
Chengzhen.

430
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,950
I should call the police first.

431
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,460
What?

432
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,010
Chengzhen is with you.

433
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,830
Okay.

434
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,390
Okay. I'll be right there.

435
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:53,020
[Snapdragon Farm]

436
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,210
This...

437
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,330
Snapdragon Farm.

438
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,870
This is the next stop you mentioned?

439
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,510
Yes.

440
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
You guys go ahead.

441
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,340
Mr. Zhou.

442
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,120
You've been working day and night for a week.

443
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,670
According to Newton's law of conservation of energy,

444
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,770
when you run out of energy,

445
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,130
you should come to nature to replenish it.

446
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,590
And as your assistant,

447
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,830
managing your health is

448
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,630
also one of my important duties.

449
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,210
Newton didn't say that.

450
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,830
Whether he did or not,

451
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,310
just do as I say.

452
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,800
Hold your arms wide.

453
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,170
Close your eyes.

454
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,790
Inhale.

455
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,590
Exhale.

456
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,200
Did you eat garlic this morning?

457
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,080
Mom.

458
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,030
You're sleeping soundly.

459
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,100
Hongbao.

460
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,650
Stop barking.

461
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,690
Stop barking.

462
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,400
Yiyi, don't be scared.

463
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,940
Hongbao.

464
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,120
So adorable.

465
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,400
Jiang Lai.

466
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,800
Jiang Lai.

467
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,510
The farm is closed today.

468
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,240
Go back.

469
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,740
Jiang Lai.

470
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,830
Jiang Lai.

471
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,790
So this is your farm.

472
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,000
It's so beautiful.

473
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,550
Since the farm is closed,

474
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,870
you can entertain your friend, right?

475
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,030
Give me a tour of your home.

476
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,890
Chen Jun.

477
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,250
Bring down my suitcase.

478
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,750
I'm staying here tonight.

479
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,490
Okay.

480
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,790
What's wrong?

481
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,480
Are you going to refuse a girl

482
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,430
who is kind, charming, and cute?

483
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,710
Let's go.

484
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
I can't go on.

485
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
Your farm is too big.

486
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,880
You've gone around the farm.

487
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,590
There's nothing fun about this place.

488
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,070
Why don't you go home?

489
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
What is this for?

490
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,660
We haven't seen this room yet.

491
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,910
You can't go in.

492
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,180
Why?

493
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,490
This is Jiang Lai’s room.

494
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,290
It’s not suitable for visiting.

495
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,840
So it's your room.

496
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,540
I'll stay here with you tonight.

497
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,520
No, you...

498
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,750
Are you really going to live in the farm?

499
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,940
Can't I?

500
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,470
Mom.

501
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,820
Mom?

502
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,740
Chengzhen.

503
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,790
You're awake.

504
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,970
Yu.

505
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,940
Do you know him?

506
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:25,860
Kid.

507
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,540
Who are you?

508
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,490
Chengzhen.

509
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,970
Why are you here?

510
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I'll take you in.

511
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,770
The name of the farm is on your key chain.

512
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,590
Snapdragon Farm.

513
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,220
The taxi driver searched and found it.

514
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,140
Where is it?

515
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,680
Stop.

516
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,980
This is Mr. Zhou's brother.

517
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,050
The mom he's calling isn't her,

518
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,870
but Sun Wei.

519
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,790
Sun Wei?

520
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,480
Chengzhen!

521
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,400
Mom.
Salute.

522
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,610
Chengzhen.

523
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,590
Why are you here?

524
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,270
Mom, I want to go home.

525
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,120
Be good.

526
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,200
We'll be back soon.

527
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,090
Come.

528
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,630
Jiang Lai.

529
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
Thank you.

530
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,910
It's nothing.

531
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,030
Sorry for the trouble.

532
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,210
It's getting late.

533
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,450
I'll take him home.

534
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,500
Next time,

535
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,030
I'll thank you properly.

536
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,510
Let me walk you out.

537
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,900
We're leaving too.

538
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,590
We're leaving?

539
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,140
We're not staying here?

540
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,830
We've already caused her a lot of trouble.

541
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,090
I'm speechless.

542
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,960
You men, what are you afraid of?

543
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,640
Forget it.

544
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,420
I don't care.

545
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,120
Yiyi.

546
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,800
What's going on?

547
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,420
Mom, it's raining!

548
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,700
Oh no!

549
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,330
Aunt left the corn out to dry.

550
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,830
I'll go.

551
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,330
It's too heavy.

552
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,240
You can't move it.

553
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,360
Put it in the bags.

554
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,040
I'll do it.

555
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,880
Let me do it.

556
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,160
You haven't done it before.

557
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,910
Let me do it.

558
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,030
Hold this.

559
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,430
Jiang Lai.

560
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,370
Have you thought about

561
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,030
our relationship?

562
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:55,970
Jiang Lai!

563
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,550
The mountain road to the city is closed.

564
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,150
The road is blocked tonight.

565
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,929
The road is blocked in heavy rain.

566
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,560
Seems even the god doesn't want

567
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,050
certain lovers to be apart.

568
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,980
Yiyi, who are you talking about?

569
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,580
Who else?

570
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,969
I'll send them a towel.

571
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,480
I see.

572
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,980
You mean

573
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,820
us.

574
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,159
Jiang Lai.

575
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,100
Do you have a towel?

576
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,110
Thank you, Vice President Sun.

577
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,990
Are you crazy?

578
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,430
Zhou Yu and the others are here.

579
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,960
I don't care.

580
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Do you know how I've been these days?

581
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,710
Zhou Mingde

582
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,460
didn't do anything to you, right?

583
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,880
I've been with him for so many years.

584
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,080
I know a lot about him.

585
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,820
He won't do anything to me for a while.

586
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,200
That's good.

587
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,220
By the way,

588
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,670
why are you here?

589
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,610
Do you know Jiang Lai?

590
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,990
I went to deliver something to Zhou Yu a few days ago.

591
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,790
Jiang Lai was the only one there.

592
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,080
My appendix has burst again.

593
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,480
So she sent me to the hospital.

594
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,840
I came here to thank her.

595
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,250
Appendicitis?

596
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,740
Why didn't I know?

597
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,510
I'm good now.

598
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,270
I'm good now.

599
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,560
Tingjiang.

600
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,070
Let's leave here, okay?

601
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,670
Let's take Zhen to America.

602
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,830
Let's start over.

603
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,210
Sun Wei,

604
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,200
don't be naive.

605
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,810
The issue with Song Biao kidnapping Su Qing isn't over yet.

606
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,740
Give me some more time.

607
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,060
Song Biao just wants money, right?

608
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,700
I've already bought the apartment

609
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,510
we stayed in for vacation in America.

610
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,970
I put all of our money here.

611
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,670
Take care of Song Biao as soon as possible.

612
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,200
Let's leave here together.

613
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,500
Where is the bathroom?

614
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,130
Who?

615
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,130
What's wrong, honey?

616
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:11,860
Are you okay?

617
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,320
Chen Jun.

618
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,620
There's a spider.

619
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,510
A pig?

620
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,710
Where?

621
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,660
Where's the pig?

622
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,460
What's wrong?

623
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,910
A pig?

624
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:20,970
Pig?

625
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,870
Well.

626
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,290
Yiyi came over to look for the bathroom

627
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,890
and she got scared when she saw a little spider.

628
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,410
No!

629
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,860
The spider...

630
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,380
The spider is so big.

631
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,610
It's not little.

632
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:45,830
Mr. Zhou.

633
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,830
Your clothes...

634
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,800
I was changing my clothes.

635
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,040
I heard someone calling outside.

636
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,770
I thought something happened.

637
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,640
I'll go back and finish changing.

638
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,290
Yu.

639
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,250
Why is the scar on your shoulder gone?

640
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,100
I found it.

641
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,870
Sorry, Yu.

642
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,120
It's okay.

643
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,080
It doesn't hurt.

644
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,800
Don't be scared.

645
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,060
This is our secret.

646
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,860
What scar?

647
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,480
When I was little,

648
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,900
Yu got hit on the back

649
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,060
to save me.

650
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,150
There was a big scar.

651
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
Strange.

652
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,510
Why is it gone now?

653
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,790
That's because I...

654
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,450
Whatever it is,

655
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,080
hurry up and put on your clothes.

656
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,540
We don't have much cold medicine at the farm.

657
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,390
Okay.

658
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,350
Let's go.

659
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,190
I'll take you to the bathroom.
