became your company, Zhou's Group, right?

170
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,710
That was because I worked very hard

171
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,240
and bought their shares gradually.

172
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,670
Eventually my shares exceeded Zhang Guodong‘s.

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,210
But not now.

191
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,980
The Su’s Group withdrew their investment.

192
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,910
Do you know that?

193
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,680
I just heard about it.

194
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,570
[Ask Su’s Group to withdraw their investment in the resort projects]

195
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,090
After the Su’s Group withdrawing their funds,

196
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,220
our company

197
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,640
will have great financial pressure.

198
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,750
We won't last long.

199
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,910
Jujiang Capital is very happy with the resort projects.

200
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,800
They are very optimistic about the development of Zhou's Group.

201
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,730
They want to become a shareholder.

202
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,880
Although Jujiang Capital was established not long ago,

203
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,540
they seem to have large funds.

204
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,390
Accepting their investment

205
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,010
should be able to solve
the pressing problem of Su’s withdrawal.

206
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,750
You should

207
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,620
take charge of this.

208
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,750
Got it.

209
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,310
Another beautiful day.

210
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,990
You're back.

211
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,550
Wontons will be ready

212
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,590
in a minute.

213
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,990
Okay.

214
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,490
Wontons are ready.

215
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,640
I'm hungry.

216
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,590
Wontons are ready.

217
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,390
Have some now.

218
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,740
Listen to me.

219
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,510
When eating wontons,

220
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,380
you should have some soup first.

221
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,070
Do this

222
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,020
and then have a wonton.

223
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,790
You'll feel warm and satisfied.

224
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,470
You're so messy.

225
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,080
There's some soup here.

226
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,089
Do you know

227
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,390
when I was little,

228
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,740
some elderly men would sell wontons

229
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,010
from the wonton carts by the side of the street?

230
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,240
And there were

231
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,700
small sticks on the carts.

232
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,069
When a trader was selling wontons,

233
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,200
he would knock the wood with the stick.

234
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,320
As long as my grandpa heard that sound,

235
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,070
he would go downstairs

236
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,150
and buy me a bowl of wontons.

237
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,670
Jiang Lai,

238
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,480
don’t leave me, okay?

239
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,210
Don't worry.

240
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,700
I won't.

241
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,140
Jiang Lai,

242
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,390
I followed Li Tingjiang all the way.

243
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,990
Guess where he went?

244
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,800
Stop stalling.

245
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Tell me now.

246
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,310
Li Tingjiang came out of a private hospital,

247
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,790
holding a document.

248
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,690
What document?

249
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,120
I asked some insider

250
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,610
of that private hospital.

251
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,040
It was a DNA test report.

252
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,850
He's on his way to the company.

253
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,460
A test report?

254
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,830
Got it.

255
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,010
Chen Jun,

256
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,140
have some more.

257
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,120
Thank you, boss.

258
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,330
Zhang Ran, wait and see.

259
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,030
Come in.

260
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,200
Jiang Lai.

261
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,000
Aren’t you and Mr. Zhou taking today off?

262
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,130
Tingting, have you seen Li Tingjiang?

263
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,430
Yes.

264
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,430
I think he went to the chairman's office.

265
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,950
Yes.

266
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,970
I didn't know you changed the hair strands.

267
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,220
You need to be prepared in advance for everything.

268
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,830
What is fake can never become true.

269
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,960
Let's see how long you can last.

270
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,010
Why didn't you tell me you did that?

271
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,940
I...

272
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,200
I was careless after all.

273
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,860
It was a perfect plan.

274
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,790
Why didn't I expect him to swap them?

275
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,950
So he came to the office in the middle of the night

276
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,680
to ask the cleaning lady to get your hair strands?

277
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,340
Fortunately, I prepared Chengzhen's hair in advance.

278
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,500
I found that Li Tingjiang has been asking

279
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,020
about the paternity testing.

280
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,080
Maybe it has something to do with you.

281
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,080
Strands of hair.

282
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,260
Are you sure they were taken from Mr. Zhou's office?

283
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,710
What happened today…

284
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,310
Don't worry.

285
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,050
I won't tell a soul.

286
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,310
I see.

287
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,880
But now Li Tingjiang knows your secret,

288
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,070
which means he has something on you.

289
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,360
It's fine.

290
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,070
It's almost over.

291
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,450
Almost.

292
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,030
Mr. Zhou,

293
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,000
the chairman wants to see you.

294
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,720
After a few days of monitoring,

295
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,650
we haven't found

296
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,880
any negative news about you

297
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,070
on the internet after Sun Wei died.

298
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,810
I've emailed the person I trust the most

299
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,840
about everything I've done for you over the years.

300
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,590
Could Li Tingjiang

301
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,610
have Sun Wei's email?

302
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,160
And she even lost her life.

303
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,790
What does he want exactly?

304
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,750
Got it.

305
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,160
You can leave now.

306
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,790
Okay.

307
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,600
Yu, you're here.

308
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,950
Dad, what's up?

309
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,480
Li Tingjiang gave me a report on the resort.

310
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,560
All the projects are going well.

311
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,720
Grandpa cared about the resort very much when he was alive.

312
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,320
Of course I'm trying my best.

313
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,270
By the way,

314
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,970
my birthday is in two days.

315
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,890
I didn't

316
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,600
plan to celebrate

317
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,370
because your grandpa passed away.

318
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,170
But this group of my old friends…

319
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,750
Dad,

320
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,790
your birthday should be celebrated well.

321
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,490
That's not necessary.

322
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,380
Let's do something simple.

323
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,570
We can just invite some friends and relatives to dinner.

324
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,480
It would be

325
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,550
convenient for me

326
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,150
to talk about some family matters.

327
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,080
Family matters?

328
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,470
What family matters?

329
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,210
I've thought about it.

330
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,060
It's exhausting for me

331
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,800
to handle a big business endeavor alone.

332
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,430
How about

333
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,590
I give it to you sooner?

334
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,920
Anyway,

335
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,400
it was a false alarm.

336
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,630
So now it seems

337
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,470
that Zhou Yu

338
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,190
is really awesome.

339
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,830
Yes, pretty much.

340
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,370
Well,

341
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,210
did you ask me to come here just to gossip?

342
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,350
Of course not.

343
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,460
Are you

344
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,830
still taking orders?

345
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,420
Didn't I tell you

346
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,380
I was going to study architecture?

347
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,640
The jerk detector is retired for good.

348
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,080
Please say no for me.

349
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,280
This really is a big order.

350
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,800
I wouldn't accept it for you otherwise.

351
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,610
Besides...

352
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,430
I already took the deposit.

353
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,870
Give me the phone.

354
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,130
I'll reject it myself.

355
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,070
It's too late.

356
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,710
You can talk to the client yourself.

357
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,980
You are

358
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,990
Jiang Lai?

359
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,670
Yes.

360
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,510
What's your name?

361
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,110
You can call me Fiona.

362
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,310
Ms. Fiona,

363
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,150
I'll be straightforward.

364
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,350
I'm sorry

365
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,920
I won't take your order.

366
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,970
Because

367
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm not going to work

368
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,000
as a jerk detector anymore.

369
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,300
Why?

370
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,310
Do you think this job is not good?

371
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,330
Not really.

372
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,870
It's just

373
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,570
I've found what I wanted to do.

374
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,880
But

375
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,540
I really need you.

376
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,630
Thank you for your recognition.

377
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,830
But I think you can find someone more suitable for the job.

378
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,230
I've got something to do.
I have to go now.

379
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,690
I'll ask Qi Wei to return your deposit to you.

380
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,310
I haven't told you my Chinese name, have I?

381
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,530
Hello, Jiang Lai.

382
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,980
My name is Zhang Kexin.

383
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,910
Alright, auntie.

384
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,400
Stop joking with her.

385
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,000
Say hi to my aunt.

386
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,350
Hi, auntie.

387
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,660
Can we continue to talk about

388
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,610
my order now?

389
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,920
It’s about Zhou Mingde.

390
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,030
Then this is my specialty.

391
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,080
Zhou Mingde is very hard to read.

392
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,050
[Happy birthday, Mr. Zhou Mingde]

393
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,510
It’s hard to find his weak spot.

394
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,370
But it might be easier

395
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,660
if someone he knows well goes to bait him.

396
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,710
I'll do that.

397
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,140
It feels better if you can punish the scumbag personally.

398
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,340
Best wishes, Mr. Zhou.

399
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,020
Alright.

400
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,950
Thanks. Thanks.

401
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,710
Thank you.

402
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,230
Thank you.

403
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,630
Here.

404
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,270
Great.

405
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,680
Dad,

406
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,030
it's your birthday today.

407
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,660
I wish you…

408
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,830
Boundless happiness

409
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,970
and a long life.

410
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,920
I'll skip the formalities.

411
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,770
After all,

412
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,230
I used to say those words to my dad many times.

413
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,770
And obviously,

414
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,480
my wishes didn't come true.

415
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,240
Who is this?

416
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,280
I don't know.

417
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,630
Kexin.

418
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,310
Why are you back?

419
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,660
That's very thoughtful of you.

420
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,860
You came back to visit me on my birthday.

421
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,350
Here.

422
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,850
This is my ex-wife.

423
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,030
Zhang Kexin.

424
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,870
Here.

425
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,650
Someone doesn't have manners at all.

426
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,380
His father-in-law just died.

427
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,620
And he is having a birthday party right after that.

428
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,410
As his own daughter,

429
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,470
I must follow the lial piety.

430
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,660
I must come here to offer incense to my dad.

431
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,860
Then you came to the wrong place.

432
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,740
This is not where your father's tombstone is.

433
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
I know.

434
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,980
And I won't stay long.

435
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,470
It's okay, everyone.

436
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,330
Let's carry on.

437
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,870
I'm sorry.

438
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,630
It was just an interruption.

439
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,300
Here.

440
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,270
Let's continue.

441
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,590
Dig in.

442
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,270
Let's eat.

443
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,590
Here.

444
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,440
Dig in.

445
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:29,770
Dad.

446
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,110
Let's find out what the surprise is.

447
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,260
[From Zhang Ran]

448
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,030
Good evening, Sir.

449
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,020
Did Zhang Kexin come here?

450
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,710
Zhang...

451
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,860
Ms. Zhang...

452
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,760
She...

453
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,310
Zhang Kexin.

454
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,220
Zhang Kexin.

455
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,940
Who let you change the photoes?

456
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,780
This photos are supposed to be here.

457
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,630
I just put them back where they belong.

458
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,150
The ownership of this house is still under my father's name.

459
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,610
This is the Zhang family's ancestral house.

460
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,430
You erased all the traces of my dad,

461
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,100
my brother, my sister-in-law, and Zhang Ran.

462
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,230
How can they find their way home?

463
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,210
For a jerk who pretends to be a serious,

464
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,450
married entrepreneur with a great imagine,

465
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,160
accusations of violence are fatal to him.

466
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,950
But if we understand this,

467
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,230
he does too.

468
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,180
Let me tell you something.

469
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,380
The surname of this family is Zhou.

470
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,730
Aunt Liu.

471
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,860
Take the child away.

472
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,790
So we need to challenge

473
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,320
his principles many times.

474
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,500
But it's risky to do so.

475
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,710
How about we find a chance to stage a photo shoot?

476
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,970
That's not necessary.

477
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,830
Facts are most convincing.

478
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,860
Wait a second.

479
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,580
This toy is so fun.

480
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,990
Who bought it for you?

481
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,310
Zhang Ran gave it to me.

482
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,670
Hurry up.

483
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,270
Okay.

484
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,810
Zhang Ran.

485
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,060
That name sounds nice.

486
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,900
Eventually,

487
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,530
he becomes so paranoid

488
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,990
that even a little stimulation

489
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,260
will make him break down

490
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,870
and lose his mind.

491
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,870

Chairman.

496
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,020
Who came to my office before?

497
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,760
No one has been here.

498
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,950
No one? What is this?

499
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,270
Sorry, Chairman.

500
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,190
I didn't do a good job.

501
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,350
I failed.

502
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,970
You failed again?

503
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,930
Why do I even pay you guys salaries?

504
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,150
But...

505
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,750
What?

506
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,320
Talk now.

Ms. Zhang

509
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,210
came to the group today.

510
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,159
Where is she?

511
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,070
She asked the receptionist where the promo video was being filmed.

512
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,130
She could be there.

513
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,469
Hello, everyone.

516
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,580
I've had my hair and makeup done.

517
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,380
Do I look good?

518
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,110
Yiyi,

519
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,650
the scene is ready for you.

520
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,429
They are asking for me now.

521
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,560
I gotta go.

522
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,590
Coming. Right away.

523
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,389
Which way?

524
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,350
You're perfect for directing this kind of scene.

525
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,350
You're too kind.

526
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,700
You're very competent.

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,150
It's really you.

529
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,190
You're back.

530
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,990
Yiyi.

531
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,350
I miss you a lot.

532
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,490
Look at her.

533
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,330
Yiyi has been so pretty since she was very young.

534
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,420
She's born to be a star.

535
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,950
What do you think?

536
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,550
Do I look nice today?

537
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,290
Yes.

538
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,780
You look good in anything.

539
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,930
They've grown up.

540
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,070
No wonder we are getting old.

541
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,590
I don't think so.

542
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,350
I haven't seen you for years,

543
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,110
but you

544
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,720
still look the same as when we studied abroad.

545
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,320
You even laugh the same way.

546
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,800
That's right.

547
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,590
Aunt Kexin,

548
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,430
you're the most elegant person

549
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,750
I've ever seen.

550
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,670
I have a good taste

551
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,110
because I've learned from you since I was little.

552
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,450
You're so sweet.

553
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,480
Every time I see her,

554
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,470
I think of my poor nephew, Zhang Ran.

555
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,230

Excuse me.

561
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,980

562
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,770
Let go of me!

563
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,400

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,350
You...

565
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,510
What are you doing?

566
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,840
I want to ask what are you doing?

567
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,110
Why did you come back this time really?

568
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,010
I came back to my family's company.

569
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,340
I can do whatever I want.

570
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,630
Zhou Mingde, don’t forget back then,

571
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,910
you married into the Zhang family.

572
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,850
If things didn't happen to my brother's whole family,

573
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,710
you wouldn't become the chairman of Zhang's Group.

574
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,470
Later, you forced me to give up my shares and leave with nothing.

575
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,710
Otherwise you wouldn't let me take Yu with me.

576
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,650
What are you looking at?

577
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,180
Otherwise, you wouldn't be who you are today.

578
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,340
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

579
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,890
What are you doing?

580
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,900
Let go of me!

581
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,530
You shameless woman.

582
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,690
All these years,

583
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,330
your family has always looked down on me.

584
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,550
Let me tell you something,

585
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,000
Zhou’s Group is completely built by me.

586
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,580
Now it only belongs to me.

587
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,570
Do you understand?

588
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,520
Chairman,

589
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
it was streaming.

590
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,370
I turned it off.

591
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,590
Let go of me!

592
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,190
You shameless woman.

593
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,080
Let me tell you something,

594
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,950
Zhou’s Group is completely built by me.

595
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,990
There was an accident.

596
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,530
Chen Yiyi's live stream was on,

597
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,930
so Zhou Mingde will suffer because of that.

598
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,590
Thank you.

599
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,140
All we need to do now is enjoying the show.
