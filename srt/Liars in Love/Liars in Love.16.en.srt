Hello, where is my grandpa?

Aren't you supposed to nurse him 24 hours a day?

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,400
How could you let this happen?

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,770
Mr. Zhang said he was hungry,

10
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,310
so I went to get lunch for him.

11
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,130
I didn't expect him to disappear

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,200
So you mortgaged the home she cherished the most

194
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,510
to someone else, right?

195
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,170
No,no.

196
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,220
It's not like that.

197
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,360
I told them

198
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,300
it was just a temporary mortgage.

199
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,210
When I have money,

200
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,510
I'll pay them back.

201
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,090
I will get it back.

202
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,110
How much money do you need?

203
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,370
The car is nearby.

204
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,810
Where is he?

205
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,500
One million yuan.

206
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,890
I think I can pay it back in about 10 years.

207
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,900
Don't worry,

208
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,020
my debt

209
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,110
will never affect you and Lai.

210
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,890
I won’t

211
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,800
tell Lai about this either.

212
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,470
You're Jiang Lai's father,

213
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,620
and Snapdragon Farm is the home she values the most.

214
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,370
You can't hide this from her.

215
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,900
What are you hiding from me?

216
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,350
L-

217
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,160
Lai?

218
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,260
What are you two discussing behind my back?

219
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,770
We were discussing the details of the wedding.

220
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,570
He wanted to give you a surprise.

221
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,720
Yes.

222
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,190
Zhou Yu,

223
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,010
she's my only daughter,

224
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,930
so you must put in some effort.

225
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,020
Dad, don't worry about it.

226
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,780
Zhou Yu and I have our own plans.

227
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,990
How could you say that?

228
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,520
How can I not worry about it?

229
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,290
Does Zhou have other options?

230
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,760
-No.
-I will marry Lai.

231
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,250
I only want to marry her.

232
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,730
It seems that Zhou Yu

233
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,900
really likes Lai.

234
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,170
Okay then.

235
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,600
I won't get involved

236
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,020
between you young couple.

237
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,350
I'll go to the bathroom.

238
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,150
You'll say anything

239
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,790
to fool my dad, won't you?

240
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,660
I was telling the truth.

241
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,770
Don't worry,

242
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,320
I will fix the problem of Su Qing.

243
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,190
Don't worry.

244
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,200
Ms. Sun?

245
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,340
What a coincidence, Qing.

246
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,670
Are you on a date with Yu?

247
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,710
Yes.

248
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,270
Yu's finally got time.

249
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,740
You two are quite close

250
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,610
to each other.

251
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,900
Ms. Sun, are you here for coffee alone?

252
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,140
I had an appointment with a friend,

253
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,140
but her child suddenly fell sick,

254
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,340
so she couldn't come.

255
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,140
Actually,

256
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,870
I can have a cup of coffee with you.

257
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,780
Okay.

258
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,610
You guys talk.

259
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,960
I'll go to the bathroom.

260
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,300
Ms. Sun, your bag is so beautiful.

261
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,010
It's a limited edition, right?

262
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,970
It's hard to get.

263
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,490
Yes.

264
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,290
Do you like it?

265
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,870
It's so pretty.

266
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,400
I'll give you one next time.

267
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,400
Shall we go shopping now?

268
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,850
It takes time,

269
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,690
right?

270
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,420
I've mortgaged my farm to you.

271
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,950
What are you worried about?

272
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,450
I can definitely get

273
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,220
one million yuan for investment.

274
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,620
I still have time, right?

275
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,370
Don't worry.

276
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,850
Give me a few more days,

277
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,510
and I won't let you down.

278
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,680
Where is Lai?

279
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,860
She went out for something.

280
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,160
Well,

281
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,450
let’s continue the topic.

282
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,360
Before Lai came here,

283
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,370
what were you trying to tell me?

284
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,810
Ten years is too long.

285
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,580
Since I'm going to marry Jiang Lai,

286
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,370
I have to consider

287
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,230
the risk if she finds out about it.

288
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,160
I don't want her to be upset.

289
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,350
Then I'll do a few more part-time jobs

290
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,050
so that...

291
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,330
That’s not what I meant.

292
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,780
You're Jiang Lai’s father.

293
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,580
How can I sit back and do nothing?

294
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,840
Then...

295
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,520
You mean...

296
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
I can help you pay the money back.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,600
That's...

298
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,690
so generous of you.

299
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,280
But it will be a loan.

300
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,390
A loan?

301
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,050
Yes.

302
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,520
Don't worry,

303
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,420
I don't want your money.

304
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,050
But you must transfer the ownership of Snapdragon Farm

305
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:50,940
to Jiang Lai

306
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,170
after you get it back.

307
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,120
It’s okay.

308
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,030
You can take your time.

309
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,190
Come to me if you've made up your mind.

310
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,320
It's getting late.

311
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,140
I'm leaving.

312
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,390
Suit yourself.

313
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,350
If I give it to Jiang Lai,

314
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,390
it will be hard to utilize it again.

315
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,860
There must be another way.

316
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,070
Where is Sun Wei?

317
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,770
She's finally gone.

318
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,070
Where's my dad?

319
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,060
He said he went to move the goods.

320
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,650
What are we going to do now?

321
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,010
Didn't you say I was finally free?

322
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,140
Shall we go on a date?

323
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,910
I will marry Lai.

324
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,820
I only want to marry her.

325
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,790
You can decide the place.

326
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,440
Okay.

327
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,730
You said that.

328
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,280
Let's go.

329
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,500
I told you to choose a place for dating,

330
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,650
and you decided to come here?

331
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,450
Yes.

332
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,390
What's wrong?

333
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,520
Are you afraid you'll lose in the game?

334
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,369
Just don't cry later.

335
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,210
♫Running in the field with wind chimes ringing♫

336
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,140

Hongbao.

348
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,090
Hongbao.

349
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,590
I knew you had come back for a bad reason.

350
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,220
Where's my real estate license?

351
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,790
Yuqin,

352
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,120
listen to me.

353
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,600
You can't leave until you explain everything.

354
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,120
Yuqin,

355
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:37,730
Yuqin!

356
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,330
Lai!

357
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,730
How dare you run!

358
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,450
Look at your aunt!

359
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:40,980
Lai.

360
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,400
Lai!

361
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,340
Lai, move.

362
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,770
In case you get blood splashed on you.

363
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,900
What's wrong, Aunt?

364
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,770
My property ownership certificate in the drawer is missing.

365
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,500
Jiang Yushu!

366
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,930
Where is my property ownership certificate in the drawer!

367
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,390
Where is the certificate?

368
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,500
You know, Lai,

369
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
my previous investment failed.

370
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,280
They're forcing me to pay the debt every day.

371
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,810
So I...

372
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,670
I had no choice but to mortgage the property ownership certificate.

373
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,350
What!

374
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,730
You mortgaged it!

375
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,240
You old bastard!

376
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:04,810
No.

377
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,050
-You sold my farm?
-I just mortgaged it.

378
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,880
I didn't sell it.

379
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,830
Just mortgaged it.

380
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,210
I'll kill you, Jiang Yushu!

381
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,810
Yuqin!

382
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,380
Yuqin!

383
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,930
Listen to me.

384
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,660
Listen to me.

385
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:12,770
I've almost paid off the money.

386
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,610
Almost.

387
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,650
We can get the certificate back once I fully repay them.

388
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,420
I still need

389
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,610
one million yuan.

390
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,240
What?

391
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,390
One million yuan?

392
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,850
If you don't get my property ownership certificate back,

393
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,050
I'll kill you dead!

394
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,260
Don't worry.

395
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,930
I'll get it back.

396
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,190
They will give it back to us if I pay them back.

397
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,300
I'll kill you!

398
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,500
Listen to me.

399
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:28,910
Don't...

400
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,880
Stop chasing me!

401
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,580
Yuqin!

402
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,860
It's my farm!

403
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,370
I was wrong, Yuqin!

404
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,410
Baby,

405
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,520
are you asleep?

406
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,750
I know

407
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,340
that I let you down

408
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,080
with a lot of things I did.

409
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,280
But I came back this time

410
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,590
to accompany you

411
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,560
and run

412
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,450
our farm well.

413
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,180
I know I was wrong.

414
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,520
I will turn over a new leaf.

415
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,390
Lai.

416
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,340
Lai!

417
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,590
Lai!

418
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,890
Don't worry.

419
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,110
I will prove it to you.

420
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,170
Aunt.

421
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,330
Have you seen my dad?

422
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,250
Lai.

423
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,100
Who knows where he went?

424
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,640
I haven't seen him since last night.

425
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,970
Are you looking for him?

426
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,570
Where did you go to end up looking like this?

427
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,260
I went to beg them

428
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,770
to give the property ownership certificate back to us.

429
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,880
They refused.

430
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,100
Why didn't you call the police when they beat you up?

431
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,050
What police?

432
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,850
I started it.

433
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,580
Besides,

434
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,260
I owe them...

435
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,590
I owe them so much money.

436
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,130
I'm in the wrong.

437
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,270
Be gentle.

438
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,600
Are you stupid?

439
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,130
All you know is to play hero.

440
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,780
Although we didn't get the certificate,

441
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,970
at least I made it clear

442
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,610
that I

443
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,970
couldn't be bullied.

444
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
Bastards.

445
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,990
What about the money you owe them?

446
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,810
Don't worry.

447
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,660
I'll

448
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,180
take on a few more jobs

449
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,750
and run this farm well.

450
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,550
It won't take long,

451
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,260
and I will pay back the debt.

452
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,970
Hello, an Americano.

453
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,330
Okay.

454
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,730
Please wait for a moment.

455
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,560
Tingjiang?

456
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,040
Xia.

457
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,700
What are you doing here

458
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,570
at this hour?

459
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,070
I'm meeting a client here.

460
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,770
By the way,

461
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,310
have you talked to Jiang Lai recently?

462
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes.

463
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,140
But not much.

464
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,250
What's wrong?

465
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,970
Sir, your Americano is ready.

466
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,370
Okay.

467
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,020
Thank you.

468
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,220
Well...

469
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,510
Jiang Lai seems to owe money.

470
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,530
She contacted me this morning

471
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,750
and borrowed 50,000 yuan from me.

472
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,920
Wait for a while.

473
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:55,670
It's okay.

474
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,100
Leave it.

475
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,360
I'll clean it up later.

476
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,800
With that burned hand of yours?

477
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,480
Put it on for a while.

478
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,840
If you need anything, tell me.

479
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,620
I can help you.

480
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,650
No.

481
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,810
Everything is fine.

482
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,510
Then why did you borrow 50,000 yuan from Xia?

483
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,410
[Emergency Exit]

484
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,150
How much do you need?

485
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,870
Xia told you everything?

486
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,170
She was already worried that you were being scammed.

487
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,340
Nothing.

488
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,240
I just want to buy something expensive,

489
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,610
but I've put all my money in a fixed-term deposit at the bank.

490
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,540
So, how much more do you still need?

491
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,500
Stop borrowing money from others.

492
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,900
Tell me how much you need.

493
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,320
I'll give it to you.

494
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,410
I really don't need it.

495
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,340
I've got enough.

496
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,370
Don't lie to me.

497
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,630
Tingjiang.

498
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,670
Thank you.

499
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,940
Tell me if you need anything.

500
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,030
Although we are...

501
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,680
We still went to the same college.

502
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,420
Hello.

503
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,440
I can understand that you rejected Li Tingjiang's help,

504
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,330
but why didn't you

505
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,810
come to Zhou Yu for help?

506
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,570
Your dad's debt

507
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,790
means nothing to him.

508
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,930
Because it's nothing,

509
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,260
I don't ask him for help.

510
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,110
Because he would help me.

511
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,820
What's going on between you and Zhou Yu?

512
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,430
From my observation,

513
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,180
he seems to really like you.

514
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,780
So what?

515
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,410
As you said,

516
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,170
I'm the fake Su Qing,

517
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,470
but he is the real Zhou Yu.

518
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,930
When the contract is over,

519
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,230
everything will go back to the way it was.

520
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,460
So,

521
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,150
you have feelings for him, too, right?

522
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,810
Yes.

523
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,420
You see, how many scumbags have we exposed?

524
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,890
Even someone like Tingjiang is easygoing and casual

525
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,090
when it comes to love.

526
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,180
Who knows if Zhou Yu's feelings for me are just temporary?

527
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,730
What I wanted to say just now

528
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,610
is not to ask you to give Zhou Yu a chance,

529
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,520
but to give yourself a chance.

530
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,080
You deserve to be loved.

531
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,260
I know.

532
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,030
I don't need you to tell me that.

533
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,300
Tell me.

534
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,390
How much do you owe?

535
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,610
I've borrowed money from everyone I could think of,

536
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,410
but it's still not quite enough.

537
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,850
If only

538
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,980
there were a way to make money quickly.

539
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,120
Got it.

540
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,350
We can resume our old profession.

541
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,480
Old profession?

542
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,500
You mean testing scumbags?

543
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,010
Yes.

544
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,010
Yes, there is a case.

545
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,060
But

546
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,610
it's risky.

547
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,230
The target this time

548
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,330
lives in the same complex as Zhou Yu.

549
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,190
Have you eaten?

550
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,130
Yes, he is.

551
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,570
Gong Fan

552
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,030
Come on.

553
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,100
has a quirky personality

554
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,140
and likes pets.

555
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,700
He doesn't like strangers.

556
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,130
He has a routine

557
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,610
of walking his dog at 5:30 p.m. every day.

558
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,740
You need to use your charm

559
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,450
to catch his attention.

560
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,180
I wouldn't be so unlucky as to run into Zhou Yu.

561
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Guaiguai.

562
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,700
Guaiguai.

563
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,210
Guaiguai. Let's go.

564
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,580
Guaiguai.

565
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,740
Let's go. Guaiguai.

566
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,720
Let's go. Guaiguai.

567
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,370
Let's go to the park.

568
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,210
This way.

569
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,150
Here.

570
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,840
Let's go. Guaiguai.

571
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,400
Come on.

572
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,260
I'm sorry.

573
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,740
Let me clean it for you.

574
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,800
No need.

575
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,110
Let's go. Guaiguai.

576
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,570
Come on.

577
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,740
No way.

578
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,050
Your dog is so cute.

579
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,090
May I pet him?

580
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,840
No.

581
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,150
Let's go.

582
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:49,980
Guaiguai.

583
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,780
Let's go home.

584
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,050
He looks very much like my Wangwang, who passed away three years ago.

585
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,760
Look.

586
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,580
This is the last photo he left before he died.

587
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,170
How did your Wangwang pass away?

588
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,260
Died at a ripe old age.

589
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,300
You could say

590
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,050
he had a full life.

591
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,280
But

592
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,620
the puppy in your photo looks only two years old.

593
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,220
Let's go. Guaiguai.

594
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,750
Let's go.

595
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,580
This is indeed a photo of him at 2.

596
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,110
I showed the wrong picture.

597
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,990
Guaiguai. Here.

598
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,750
Jiang Lai!

599
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,130
Why are you here?

600
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:33,930
I...

601
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,330
I'm afraid you might be bored,

602
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,390
so I came here early to accompany you.

603
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,820
You...

604
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,410
Change of style.

605
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,490
What's wrong?

606
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,810
You seem distracted.

607
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,450
Let me ask you.

608
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,840
If you meet someone at work

609
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,770
whom you find difficult to handle,

610
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,230
how can you make them let down their guard?

611
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,060
Of course,

612
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,190
it's to cater to his preferences

613
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,990
and delve deeper into his heart.

614
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,630
Cater to his preferences.

615
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,020
I see.

616
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,790
I gotta go.

617
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,270
Let's go.

618
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,810
Let me rub your belly.

619
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,630
Hello.

620
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,230
Can we be friends?

621
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,440
Nailed it.

622
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,700
Sure.

623
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,550
Jiang Lai?

624
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,260
Mimi?

625
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,070
Come here.

626
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,660
Let's go.

627
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,590
I made cakes for the pets.

628
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,200
Thank you.

629
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,590
Hurry.

630
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,520
Say "thank you."

631
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,570
You're welcome, Guaiguai.

632
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,670
You're so quiet, Guaiguai.

633
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,120
Good boy, Guaiguai.

634
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,940
Such a good boy.

635
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,890
Let me wash your neck.

636
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,620
Wash your dog.

637
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,940
Don't wash me.

638
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:41,850
Right?

639
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,610
Look at her.

640
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,980
I think something is off.

641
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,410
Mr. Zhou, you finally sense that something is off.

642
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,640
Where is Jiang Lai?

643
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,510
Don’t get started.

644
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,810
Five o'clock on the dot,

645
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,470
and she is at the office door, ready to leave.

646
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,850
She won't stay a second longer.

647
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,050
I don't know who she's in a hurry to meet.

648
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,810
It takes 15 minutes to get home from the company.

649
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,310
It's exactly 5:30 p.m.

650
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,840
She must be hiding something from me.

651
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,489
No.

652
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,590
Boss, where are you going?

653
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,969
Mr. Zhou, are you going to the 15th floor to see Special Assistant Li?

654
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,090
Why should I?

655
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm going home.

656
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,679
Could Jiang Lai be so bold

657
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,750
as to meet Special Assistant Li at Mr. Zhou's house?

658
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,560
Mr. Zhou,

659
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,989
no matter what happens,

660
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,190
I'll be there for you.

661
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,679
Thank you.

662
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,010
But please lose your weird taste.

663
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,940
That's what would help me the most.

664
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,699
But I did all of this for you.
