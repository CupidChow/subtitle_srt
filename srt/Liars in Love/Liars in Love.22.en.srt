00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,630
Yu,

5
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,050
you had such a serious car accident abroad.

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,870
Why didn't I know

7
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,270
such an important thing?

8
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,729
Vice President Sun, do you remember?

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,300
My dad called me once at that time.

10
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,430
I think he did.

11
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,410
After that,

12
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,160
I went to the hospital for a scar removal surgery.

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,169
No wonder.

14
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,540
You didn't have a plastic surgery on you face, did you?

15
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,570
Do you think I need to adjust my face?

16
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,410
I'm just kidding.

17
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm praising you for being much more handsome than before.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,530
Here's the soup.

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,140
Why aren't you eating?

20
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,050
We're waiting for you,

21
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,180
the farm owner, to give instructions.

22
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,829
Let's eat.

23
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,560
Eat more.

24
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,400
Hurry up.

25
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,100
Let's eat.

26
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,070
You should eat more.

27
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,930
Help yourself.

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,750
Chen Jun,

29
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,600
thanks for your hard work.

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,320
Eat more.

31
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,900
Thank you, boss.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,640
I want that too.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Don't eat too much of this.

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,670
It's too salty.

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,070
It’s bad for your health.

36
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,620
Sister Jiang Lai's cooking

37
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
is much better than the meal at home.

38
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,860
Isn't Auntie Liu's cooking good?

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,590
Her cooking

40
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,940
is not delicious at all.

41
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,910
It's too bland.

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,280
Chengzhen, if you like it,

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,550
you can eat more.

44
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,340
Let's leave here, okay?

45
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,730
Let's take Zhen

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,990
to America.

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,329
We can start over.

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,250
I'm still dealing with Song Biao's kidnapping of Su Qing.

49
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,250
I need more time.

50
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,160
It's your favorite.

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,430
I don't like it.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,180
I like it.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
Then you should eat more.

54
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,770
Chen Jun,

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,840
eat more.

56
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,200
Give it to me.

57
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,190
Thank you, boss.

58
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,330
Could you put away my dishes?

59
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,330
My pleasure.

60
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,480
I've tidied up the room for you and Chengzhen.

61
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,810
You can take him to rest.

62
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,260
Thank you.

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,210
You’re welcome.

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,670
Jiang Lai.

65
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,990
Thank you.

66
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,060
You already said that.

67
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,330
Jiang Lai.

68
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,950
Zhou Yu took the initiative

69
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,610
to clean the dishes this time.

70
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,200
It was really an eye-opener.

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,310
Since I knew him a long time ago,

72
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,170
I've never seen him do housework.

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,150
It means

74
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,870
love can change a person.

75
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,030
Did I change you?

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,409
Of course...

77
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,280
not.

78
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,560
Chen Jun!

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,890
Say that again.

80
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,490
I...

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,840
I'll beat you to death!

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Come back!

83
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,240
Say that again!

84
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,090
I'm sorry, boss.

85
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,560
Wait and see.

86
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,659
It's getting late.

87
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,860
Let's go to bed early.

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,020
Why are we going to bed so early?

89
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,170
Let’s play a little longer.

90
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,230
Jiang Lai is tired.

91
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,210
OK.

92
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,200
Jiang Lai,

93
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,620
I want to sleep with you.

94
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,170
Please,

95
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,990
sleep with me,

96
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,820
OK?

97
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,540
Jiang Lai,

98
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,540
are you asleep?

99
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,330
I was about to fall asleep.

100
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,650
What exactly happened between you and Zhou Yu?

101
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,130
Tell me.

102
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,810
You should talk about love on the table.

103
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,500
Don't keep it to yourself.

104
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,470
You're so boring.

105
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,720
I proposed to Zhou Yu,

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
but he rejected me.

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,710
What?

108
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,080
You...

109
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,290
He...

110
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Why?

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,110
Is it because of Su Qing?

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
No.

113
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,680
From what I know about him,

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,550
he's not the type to sacrifice love for career.

115
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,630
He's even less likely to give in to Uncle Zhou

116
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,630
because of Su Qing's family background.

117
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,440
He said he couldn't get married

118
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,620
because something needed to be solved.

119
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,340
What needed to be solved?

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,740
What would be in conflict with marriage?

121
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,620
I don't know.

122
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,430
In my opinion,

123
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,909
you two should learn from the frogs outside.

124
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,480
Frogs?

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,400
Frogs are not mute.

126
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,560
They say it out loud.

127
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,070
Croak.

128
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,500
Croak.

129
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,000
Croak.

130
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,220
I didn't expect there would be

131
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,620
such a beautiful starry sky after the rain.

132
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,330
Do you like to step in the puddles?

133
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,430
When I was a kid, every time it rained...

134
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,000
Zhou Yu.

135
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,810
I don't want an explanation,

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
but an answer.

137
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,950
Is the secret on your shoulder

138
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,440
related to what you're going to do?

139
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,070
Yes.

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,950
What is it?

141
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,810
Can't you tell me and let us face it together?

142
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,180
I don't even know what my future is like.

143
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,150
I don't want you to take the risk with me.

144
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,540
But I want to.

145
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,420
When we were watching the fireflies,

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,310
you promised me

147
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,260
no matter what happened,

148
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,710
we would face it together,

149
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,440
and you would always be with me.

150
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,770
Why are you leaving me behind this time?

151
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
I know the answer.

152
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,570
By the way,

153
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,420
There's something else I want to tell you.

154
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,280
It seems the kidnapping of Su Qing

155
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,990
has something to do with a man named Song Biao.

156
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,880
And Li Tingjiang knows where he is.

157
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,810
Miss Su,

158
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,550
do you have an appointment with Mr. Zhou?

159
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,380
No.

160
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
I need to talk to him.

161
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,790
Mr. Zhou's meeting will end in about 5 minutes.

162
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,230
OK.

163
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
I'll wait for him.

164
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,990
What's this?

165
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,660
This is from the pottery shop.

166
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,070
It's for Mr. Zhou.

167
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,150
I'll get back to work.

168
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,060
Okay.

169
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,810
What are you doing?

170
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,280
Chen Jun brought it here.

171
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,650
It looked pretty,

172
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,520
so I just wanted to touch it.

173
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,190
Is this snapdragon?

174
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,280
Yes.

175
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,870
How was the National Resort Seminar?

176
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,740
Do you want the truth?

177
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,020
This kind of meeting is better for Uncle Zhou.

178
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,300
He looked energetic every day.

179
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,870
He could sit there all day.

180
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,670
But my bones were about to break.

181
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,060
Luckily, it was you who went with my dad this time.

182
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,990
If it were me,

183
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,160
I wouldn't be able to stand it.

184
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,870
What's wrong?

185
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,070
What brings you here?

186
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,690
The business trip

187
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,620
has brought me something after all.

188
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,180
This reminds me of you.

189
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,920
It's for you.

190
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,980
You didn't have to do that.

191
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
I appreciate your good will.

192
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,560
I selected it carefully.

193
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,570
Just accept it.

194
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,350
OK.

195
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,360
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

196
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,390
What's wrong?

197
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,250
Anything else?

198
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,200
There wasn't.

199
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,640
But now there is.

200
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,570
I'm going back to England.

201
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,440
So sudden?

202
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,240
The design of the resort has been completed.

203
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,470
I plan to go back

204
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,310
to finish the detailed work

205
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,440
with my colleagues in the studio.

206
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,170
I don't think

207
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,760
our designer has to work on it herself, right?

208
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,510
No.

209
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,040
But you were the only reason

210
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,780
I stayed here in the first place, right?

211
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,390
We'll be best partners.

212
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,450
Jiang Lai has a good taste for men.

213
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,330
Hope we can work well together.

214
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,400
Looking forward to working with you.

215
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,600
[It turns out that he changed his name abroad to hide his identity]

216
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,600
[Mr. Lee, I had a hard time finding out about Zhou Yu]

217
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,580
[Do you need to continue to find out the truth?]

218
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,580
[But the record seems to have been tampered with, and someone seems to be trying to cover something up]

219
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,580
[And I have found the surgical record of the car accident you need, but there is nothing out of the ordinary]

220
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,430
[Of course, if you can find out the truth, I will pay you double]

221
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,910
This one.

222
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,610
And this one.

223
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,140
Mr. Zhou doesn't like them.

224
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,030
Okay, I got it.

225
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,730
Special Assistant Li.

226
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,780
Give me another version.

227
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,800
I'm going out.

228
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,150
Always saying no.

229
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,430
I'll beat you to death.

230
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,470
[I've sent someone to pick up Chengzhen. See you at the airport at 3 p.m.]

231
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,390
Is that person willing to take you away?

232
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,859
I want to leave you.

233
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,510
I gave you everything.

234
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,900
If you leave me,

235
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,380
you'll have nothing.

236
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,170
I have nothing

237
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,590
when I'm with you!

238
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,550
I admit

239
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,830
that I was really vulgar

240
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,960
and materialistic.

241
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,520
I only cared about money and fame.

242
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,820
I thought as long as I was with you

243
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,550
and worked for you,

244
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,270
I could get everything.

245
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,760
But I forgot

246
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,810
that if I lose myself,

247
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,990
all this

248
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,400
will just be a shell.

249
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,900
It can't fill my heart.

250
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,280
Ridiculous!

251
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,070
Only successful career,

252
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,530
fancy food and clothes,

253
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,770
and prestigious status

254
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,020
can be seen.

255
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,310
Who cares about a person's heart?

256
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,840
Someone will.

257
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,640
Someone cares about me.

258
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,990
So I've had enough of the hypocritical days

259
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,020
with you!

260
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,640
You and I are on the same boat.

261
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,910
Do you think I'll let you go?

262
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,800
All the things I've done for you over the years

263
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,060
have been sent through email to the person I trust the most.

264
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,650
If I can't get out of this door today,

265
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,800
you'll go to hell with me.

266
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,680
Don't you dare!

267
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,170
You can waste time on me.

268
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,350
Let's wait and see

269
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,330
what the result will be.

270
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,590
Farewell.

271
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,370
Go to the airport.

272
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay.

273
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,720
[Day off approved, rest well]

274
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,250
Time to eat, piggy.

275
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,160
Time to eat.

276
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,310
My pigs.

277
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,700
I've never seen

278
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,940
someone watering flowers like this.

279
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,910
Su Qing?

280
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,140
Why are you here?

281
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,280
Have some water.

282
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,670
Thank you.

283
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,270
I'm here to say goodbye.

284
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,710
I went to see Zhou Yu this morning

285
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,640
and gave him a gift.

286
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,160
It's the gift I've put the most thoughts into

287
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,690
since I was a kid.

288
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,410
But he accepted it without opening it.

289
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,800
Su Qing.

290
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,340
On the contrary,

291
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,120
he cherished

292
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,340
a snapdragon pottery gift.

293
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,030
I think it's for you.

294
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,110
You like snapdragon, don't you?

295
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,790
The snapdragon made of pottery will never wither.

296
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,920
That way, it can always be by your side.

297
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,130
Does Zhou Yu know you're leaving?

298
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,670
I told him.

299
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,610
This place is really healing.

300
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,270
No wonder you and Zhou Yu

301
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,790
want to keep the farm.

302
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,620
I saw your design.

303
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,990
The farm will be renovated in a way that preserves its original appearance.

304
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,630
Thank you.

305
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,370
You didn't know?

306
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,470
Preserving its original appearance

307
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,050
is Zhou Yu's only mandatory requirement

308
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,940
of my design.

309
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,280
It seems you really don't know it.

310
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,190
It's enviable to see Zhou Yu so in love.

311
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,650
I thought I quit loving him.

312
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,950
But now I realize that I wasn't involved at all.

313
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,270
Su Qing,

314
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,230
I think you're really excellent.

315
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,190
I've seen many strengths in you

316
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,210
and things I can learn from you.

317
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,450
I've decided

318
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,610
to study architecture later

319
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,040
and renovate the farm myself.

320
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,870
Well, I wish you

321
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,730
success.

322
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,900
Will you ever come back?

323
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,790
Jiang Lai,

324
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,800
are you sad to see me go?

325
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,350
Anyway,

326
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,130
Jiang Lai, nice to meet you.

327
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,830
Nice to meet you too, Su Qing.

328
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,940
All the things I've done for you over the years

329
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,210
have been sent through email to the person I trust the most.

330
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,760
If I can't get out of this door today,

331
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,070
you'll go to hell with me.

332
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,300
[Zhao]

333
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,980
Chairman, we've found him.

334
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,650
Yu?

335
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,390
Why are you here?

336
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,020
Dad, he's the person

337
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,810
you're looking for, right?

338
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,950
Do you still remember

339
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,680
the car accident

340
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,630
three years ago?

341
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,410
What do you mean?

342
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,480
Zhang Ran,

343
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,730
your nephew who went abroad with me.

344
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,350
Three years ago,

345
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,890
he was so close to coming back.

346
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,050
But exactly at that point,

347
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,050
he had an car accident before going to the airport.

348
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,080
Don't you think this car accident

349
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,650
is quite suspicious?

350
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,120
I only remember

351
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,090
you were in the car too.

352
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,060
Thank goodness.

353
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,710
I'm so glad you were OK.

354
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,310
Did Zhang Ran deserve to die?

355
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,290
Fine.

356
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,920
Since you don't know anything,

357
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,380
let's reveal the truth

358
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,570
while everyone is here.

359
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,550
Tell me.

360
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,220
Who was behind

361
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,710
the car accident 3 years ago?

362
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,680
Tell me.

363
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,610
Back then,

364
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,010
I caused a car accident

365
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,710
and killed Zhang Ran.

366
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,440
And the mastermind behind all this

367
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,630
was Sun Wei.

368
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,880
Who?

369
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,150
It was Sun Wei.

370
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,830
Was there no one else except Sun Wei?

371
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,600
Think about it carefully.

372
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,170
No one else.

373
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,430
I kidnapped Su Qing

374
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,240
and caused a car accident

375
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,630
because Sun Wei

376
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,740
ordered me to do it.

377
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,940
[Jun, are you there? I just got the news that Vice President Sun died in a car accident]

378
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,460
Boss, Sun Wei is dead.

379
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,810
[Sun Wei, the wife of Zhou's Group's Chairman, died in a car accident]

380
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,760
[Bro, I've put the cash in Sun Wei's house in America into your domestic account]

381
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,200
[Sucheng Bank: Your account ending in 9966 has received RMB 50,000,000]

382
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,320
Chairman.

383
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,970
Did you do it?

384
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,390
Do you mean

385
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,950
to help you get rid of Vice President Sun

386
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,650
or to prevent Song Biao

387
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,470
from revealing that you were

388
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,610
behind the car accident?

389
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,010
You...

390
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,420
Just to remind you,

391
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,030
Vice President Sun is not the only person with a different surname

392
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,970
who poses a threat to you.

393
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:16,460
[He told me Zhou Yu had passed away 3 years ago]

394
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:16,460
[I found the doctor who participated in the rescue operation of that car accident]

395
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,670
Zhou Yu is dead?

396
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,460
Then the present Zhou Yu...

397
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,440
[Zhou Yu Zhang Ran]

398
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,210
Hongbao.

399
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,200
Why are you barking?

400
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,370
What's wrong?

401
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,780
I'll check it out.

402
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,190
It's alright.

403
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,250
Let me check it out.

404
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,340
Who is it?

405
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,120
Li Tingjiang?

406
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,440
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

407
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,820
Lai,

408
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,550
come with me.

409
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,810
Let's go abroad

410
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,050
and get out of here.

411
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,400
What are you talking about?

412
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,240
When I was a student,

413
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,650
I could only focus on study and life.

414
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,270
So I had to give up

415
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,870
on our relationship.

416
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,720
But now,

417
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,770
I have enough energy and ability to take care of you

418
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,160
and manage our lives.

419
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,980
Let's start over, okay?

420
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,590
We can't start over,

421
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,750
just like a broken mirror can't go back to the way it was.

422
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,350
Even kids know that.

423
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,630
Don't you know that?

424
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
What if I didn't choose to go abroad?

425
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,750
Our relationship

426
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,470
wouldn’t be like this, right?

427
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:28,970
Lai,

428
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,700
please give me another chance.

429
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,270
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life

430
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,870
making up for these regrets.

431
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,710
I heard your conversation with Sun Wei.

432
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,810
You were right about one thing.

433
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,410
I should've stopped loving you

434
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,940
when you chose to go abroad.

435
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,430
In that case,

436
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,890
at least you would still be

437
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,280
an excellent,

438
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,830
sincere,

439
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,250
and honest person in my heart,

440
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,710
instead of the person you are now,

441
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,040
a person who would do whatever it takes to achieve your goal.

442
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,540
Are you really going to describe me as doing whatever it takes?

443
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,990
What about Zhou Yu?

444
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,580
What if this Zhou Yu is not real?

445
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,230
So you never really know this Zhou Yu, right?

446
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,040
Did Sun Wei really know you?

447
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,160
She just passed away.

448
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,530
And you're already telling me all this.

449
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,080
She even died on her way to the airport.

450
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,460
Li Tingjiang,

451
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,900
who do you really want to take away?

452
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,350
Lai.

453
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,590
Since the beginning,

454
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,630
you've been the only one in my heart.

455
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,750
Let me make it clear again.

456
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,239
I like Zhou Yu.

457
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,940
Even if I don't know him,

458
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,000
even if we're apart now,

459
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,139
I won't choose you,

460
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,560
let alone going with you.

461
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,199
Please leave.

462
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,520
Zhou Yu.

463
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,590
I will show everyone who you really are.

464
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,370
Are you really going to describe me as doing whatever it takes?

465
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,429
What about Zhou Yu?

466
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,920
What if this Zhou Yu is not real?

467
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,460
So you never really know this Zhou Yu, right?

468
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,500
What did he mean?

469
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,030
If this Zhou Yu is not the real Zhou Yu,

470
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,560
then who is he?

471
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,440
Morning.

472
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,110
Jiang Lai, you’re finally back.

473
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,850
I thought you resigned like architect Su.

474
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,620
No way.

475
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,550
I just took two days off to spend the weekend.

476
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,750
Don't be so dramatic.

477
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,440
It wasn't that serious.

478
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,590
But,

479
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,610
while you were away,

480
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,770
I've got so many documents to finish.

481
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,970
I'm literally

482
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,610
dying.

483
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,470
Don't worry.

484
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,500
I'm back now, right?

485
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,310
I'll help you.

486
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,320
Great!

487
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,620
Thank you.

488
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,270
Dad.

489
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,720
Dad,

490
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,130
I'm here to visit you.

491
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,320
How have you been lately?

492
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,280
Get out!

493
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,230
Dad.

494
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,330
You're not young anymore.

495
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,650
Why are you still so grumpy?

496
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,000
Calm down.

497
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,200
Being angry

498
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,490
is bad for your health.

499
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,150
Come on.

500
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,380
I'll play with you.

501
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,870
Dad.

502
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,360
Do you remember Sun Wei?

503
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,500
Sun Wei is the person

504
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,740
who made Xin get angry and go abroad.

505
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,980
She's dead.

506
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,990
Guess

507
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,760
how she died?

508
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,860
She died in a car accident

509
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,110
just like Zhang Ran.

510
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,240
Do you think

511
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
it was an accident

512
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,110
or a murder?

513
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,980
I knew it was you who killed my Ran.

514
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
I didn't kill Ran.

515
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,440
I ordered Sun Wei

516
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,540
to cause a car accident.

517
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,530
You heartless bastard!

518
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,360
Xin was really blind

519
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,960
to be with you!

520
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Calm down.

521
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,690
Calm down.

522
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,490
I've taken care of everyone

523
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,600
who knew the truth back then.

524
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,250
Now that you've known the truth,

525
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,410
it's time for you to go.

526
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,730
Doctor!

527
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,840
Doctor, come here!

528
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,530
Doctor!

529
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,760
Hurry!

530
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,300
Hurry!

531
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,090
Doctor!

532
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,280
Please make way.

533
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,950
Dad.

534
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,880
Dad.

535
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,520
Dad.

536
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,000
How is he now?

537
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,670
The patient needs surgery now.

538
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,830
Are you Mr. Zhou Yu, his emergency contact?

539
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,620
I'm Zhou Yu's father.

540
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,270
He's on a business trip.

541
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,000
I can sign it.

542
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,330
Okay.

543
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,180
Come to my office now.

544
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,580
Okay.

545
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,890
Everyone,

546
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,650
I'm off work.

547
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,690
Goodbye.

548
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,750
Bye.

549
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,590
Bye.

550
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,290
I'm leaving too.

551
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,960
Bye.

552
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,400
Tingting.

553
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,550
I still haven't finished it.

554
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,610
Why don't you go home first?

555
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,630
You've been busy for days.

556
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,630
Just leave it to me.

557
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,490
You really don't need my company?

558
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,770
Fine.

559
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,140
If you need anything,

560
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,170
you can contact me at any time.

561
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,680
Okay.

562
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,520
I'm leaving.

563
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,120
Bye.

564
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,070
Bye.

565
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,730
[Li Tingjiang left the company]

566
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,380
Li Tingjiang said so confidently

567
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,950
that this Zhou Yu was not the real Zhou Yu.

568
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,680
