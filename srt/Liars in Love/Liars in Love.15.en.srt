00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,940
was to buy two cones

195
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,270
and fold them together.

196
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,660
Really?

197
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:34,860
Then...

198
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,640
Enjoy it.

199
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,070
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

200
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,590
It's all on your mouth.

201
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,410
I'll grant you any wish in the future.

202
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,140
Let's eat together.

203
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,130
Here.

204
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,710
Eat it.

205
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:06,930
It's delicious.

206
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,530
I'm full.

207
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,910
Are you done?

208
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,850
Do you want another dessert?

209
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,060
No need.

210
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,880
Let's go.

211
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,520
Go!

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,150
I think the dishes just now...

213
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,680
Zhang Ming!

214
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,770
They were not that good.

215
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,360
Zhang Ming!

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,890
However,

217
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,090
they were in...

218
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,210
Zhang Ming.

219
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,700
I'm sorry

220
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,780
for taking a few minutes of your time.

221
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,370
Sorry.

222
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,770
You got the wrong person.

223
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,700
To be honest,

224
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,770
your disguise was a success.

225
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,410
You and your partner came in
with your guitar bags.

226
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,070
I don't know much about music.

227
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,420
But I could hear

228
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,570
that you've been exchanging

229
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,570
some musical terms during the meal.

230
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,740
Your nails are almost to your fingertips.

231
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,210
It's not only in line with
the need of Zhang Ming,

232
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,970
who is obsessed with cooking
and doesn't keep long nails,

233
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,590
but also in line with
the folk guitarist's habit

234
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,320
of plucking the strings with his fingertips

235
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,610
in order to pursue a better resonance
of the tone.

236
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,470
These are all

237
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,230
about fitting the character as well as you could.

238
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,300
But the point is

239
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,000
that you looked satisfied

240
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,650
when the waitress warned you

241
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,340
that you had ordered too much.

242
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,420
But you insisted on ordering

243
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,250
more than enough for two people.

244
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,510
You dropped your chopsticks on purpose

245
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,640
to see if the waitress could handle it.

246
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,840
Sorry, sir.

247
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,010
I'll change a pair of new chopsticks for you.

248
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,760
But you didn't give your guitar a look

249
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,270
throughout the process.

250
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,410
A legal person who is obsessed with his dishes

251
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,740
can visit each of his stores without tire.

252
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,290
So how could a music lover

253
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,250
not care at all about his instrument

254
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,010
during the meal?

255
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,770
Hello.

256
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,810
I'm Zhang Ming.

257
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,810
Hello.

258
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,820
I'm Zhou Yu.

259
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,570
So you tried so hard to find me

260
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,710
to renew the contract with our group, right?

261
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,570
Yes.

262
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,820
Sorry.

263
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,260
I can't decide that.

264
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,410
Mr. Zhang.

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,010
Your company has been cooperating

266
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,670
with our group for a long time.

267
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,660
If it's about the rent,

268
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,330
we can discuss it.

269
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,870
It has nothing to do with this.

270
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,320
Take this store as an example.

271
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,850
It's closing soon.

272
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,070
The rent discount can't make up for the deficit.

273
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,110
How could it happen?

274
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,870
Isn't this store doing well?

275
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,270
It's just an illusion.

276
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,820
There are many customers.

277
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,780
But the inventory of seafood

278
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,500
can't satisfy their needs.

279
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,250
You're right.

280
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,090
The amount of seafood outside is really small.

281
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,370
It's strange.

282
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,990
Our restaurant pursues high quality.

283
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,650
All seafood was delivered by air
and freshly killed and sold.

284
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,850
But strangely,

285
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,570
if the seafood stayed in the fish tank for one night,

286
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,500
it would die of anoxia the next day.

287
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,490
There was too much material loss.

288
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,750
We couldn't handle it.

289
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,850
We have to leave this place as soon as possible.

290
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,730
How could this happen?

291
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,820
Could it be

292
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,850
something wrong with the oxygen generator?

293
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,690
No.

294
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,150
We've checked many times.

295
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,970
The water quality and oxygen generator
were fine.

296
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,430
We also checked the monitors in the store.

297
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,710
No one came at night.

298
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,610
But

299
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,410
the seafood died for no reason.

300
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,310
That's weird.

301
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,010
Who dares to renew the rent?

302
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,210
Could it be that

303
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,530
he made up a ghost story to fool us?

304
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,580
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

305
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,330
If I don't want to renew the contract,

306
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,620
I can reject it directly.

307
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,480
I don't need to play with you here.

308
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,370
Mr. Zhang.

309
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,370
If we catch this ghost,

310
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,820
can you reconsider

311
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,170
the renewal of the contract?

312
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,090
Of course.

313
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,210
I'd love to.

314
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,220
I'd like to see

315
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,840
how you can catch that ghost.

316
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,370
Are we really going to catch the ghost here?

317
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,810
Are you scared?

318
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,530
No.

319
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,180
Well.

320
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,650
I grew up in the farm.

321
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,650
I'm not afraid of anything.

322
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,050
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

323
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,810
There are only the two of us here.

324
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,810
Is there really a ghost?

325
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,130
There are no ghosts in this world.

326
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,930
Even if there is,

327
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,330
it should catch me first.

328
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
But these fish are fine now.

329
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,210
Someone must be behind this.

330
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,150
There will be a good show tonight.

331
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,260
It's 1 o'clock.

332
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Don't alert them.

333
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,010
Do you think Mr. Zhang

334
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,819
has fooled us?

335
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,540
I've asked the group.

336
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,650
They did report something similar.

337
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,730
Besides,

338
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,670
he didn't have to lie to us.

339
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,260
But these fish,

340
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:35,620
shrimps

341
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,010
and crabs

342
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,410
are still alive and well.

343
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,290
Look.

344
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,570
It's dancing.

345
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,780
Someone is here.

346
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,310
Why is he so brazen?

347
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,290
This is not my home.

348
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,630
I was wondering why the key

349
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,330
couldn't open the door.

350
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,110
Go home.

351
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,210
Go home.

352
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,150
He must be drunk.

353
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,140
It looks like it.

354
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,730
Be gentle.

355
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,820
It hurts.

356
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,770
You want to run?

357
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,880
Who are you?

358
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,810
I didn't expect

359
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,460
you really caught the ghost.

360
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,860
Thank you.

361
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,190
Of course.

362
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,690
Zhou Yu

363
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,390
is invincible.

364
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,860
Boss.

365
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,730
Who is he?

366
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,570
Why did he break into your store?

367
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,800
Don't mention it.

368
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,700
The owner of the barbecue restaurant next door

369
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,650
had a conflict with me a few days ago.

370
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,290
I guess

371
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,130
he was holding a grudge.

372
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,410
In order to avoid the monitors,

373
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,890
he sneaked into the store

374
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,300
from the small window of the kitchen at night.

375
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,490
He turned off the switch.

376
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,950
Before we opened the door,

377
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,360
he turned on the switch.

378
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,830
You're so crafty.

379
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,300
He is a business genius.

380
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,890
Boss.

381
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,330
The deal we had...

382
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,610
Don't worry.

383
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,050
I won't break my promise.

384
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,410
However,

385
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,570
my restaurant group

386
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,330
is now under my sister's control.

387
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:43,740
You should

388
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,970
persuade her.

389
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,690
No way, boss.

390
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,280
We've helped you.

391
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,170
It's late at night.

392
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,830
Is that all you have to tell us?

393
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,290
Just kidding.

394
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,080
Don't worry.

395
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,250
I'll help you make an appointment with my sister.

396
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,660
I'll tell you a special secret later.

397
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,420
It will definitely help you.

398
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,240
Okay.

399
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,050
Well.

400
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,450
I'll deal with this first.

401
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,800
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

402
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,400
By the way,

403
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,110
bring two big crabs before you leave.

404
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,190
You're welcome.

405
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,260
I want one.

406
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,680
One is enough.

407
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,680
There were King Crabs

408
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,550
and Autumn Leaf Crabs.

409
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,410
But you asked me to bring this one.

410
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,270
That's good enough.

411
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,220
Don't try to take advantage of others.

412
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,890
If you want to eat,

413
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,020
I'll buy one for you.

414
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,310
Okay.

415
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,020
Steam it first.

416
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,160
Little crab.

417
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,780
Mr. Zhou.

418
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,580
Here's the information of Zhang Yan

419
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,300
from Zhang's Restaurant.

420
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,340
[Zhang's Restaurant]

421
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,530
You won't make a mistake this time, will you?

422
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,370
It's weird.

423
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,710
I printed Zhang Yan's profile last time.

424
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,270
Many people in the group
don't want me to go back.

425
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,810
But Mr. Zhou, you're really amazing.

426
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,770
You've managed to handle
the most mysterious man in this field, Zhang Ming.

427
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,030
He was much harder to find than Zhang Yan.

428
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,330
Fortunately, we have achieved something.

429
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,410
But the place where Zhang Yan asked us to meet

430
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,410
is a club.

431
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,770
A club?

432
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,340
What are you talking about secretly?

433
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,190
Nothing.

434
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,740
Zhang Yan?

435
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,420
Are you going to meet Zhang Yan?

436
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,550
I want to go with you.

437
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,650
No need.

438
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,010
This appointment

439
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,560
is boring.

440
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,770
Chen Jun is with me.

441
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,220
Rest well during the holiday.

442
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,790
Bye.

443
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,170
So unusual.

444
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,510
There must be something wrong.

445
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,790
Do you have a reservation?

446
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,090
Hello, we have an appointment with Ms. Zhang

447
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,130
at Room 520.

448
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,060
Ms. Zhang?

449
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,210
Follow me.

450
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,770
Okay.

451
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,460
Men.

452
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,370
Hurry up.

453
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,960
Hurry up.

454
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,460
Okay. Okay.

455
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,720
Ms. Zhang.

456
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,490
Ms. Zhang.

457
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,450
Hello.

458
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,810
I'm Zhou Yu.

459
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,660
This is my assistant, Chen Jun.

460
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,290
Good evening, Ms. Zhang.

461
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,530
Mr. Zhou, nice to meet you.

462
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,370
I didn't expect that you're not only young,

463
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,570
but also so handsome.

464
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,640
Come here, please.

465
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,090
Ms. Zhang.

466
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,780
Look.

467
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,010
You've been partners
with Zhou's Group for five years.

468
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,690
This time,

469
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,320
the renewal of the contract...

470
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,090
Mr. Zhou.

471
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,210
You are already here.

472
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,850
How can we talk about work?

473
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,880
It will affect our relationship.

474
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,410
Don't talk about work.

475
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,140
Let's drink.

476
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,890
Okay.

477
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,180
Let's drink.

478
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,570
You're late today.

479
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,940
How about we drink the cross-cupped wine?

480
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,650
Ms. Zhang, don’t make fun of me.

481
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,800
Come on.

482
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,340
I'll drink up.

483
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,750
A toast to you.

484
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,970
Look how scared your assistant is.

485
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,410
Little assistant.

486
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,600
Come to visit me more often.

487
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,370
A newcomer?

488
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,370
Let's go.

489
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,700
Go to Room 520. Hurry up.

490
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,320
I'll arrange a special show for you.

491
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,440
What special show?

492
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,210
Ms. Zhang.

493
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,340
This is...

494
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,690
Ms. Zhang, do you still need more?

495
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,180
No.

496
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,630
Mr. Zhou.

497
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,210
Do you still need more?

498
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,970
No.

499
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,370
I don't need that.

500
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,970
It's okay.

501
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,300
We have something else.

502
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,650
Look how scared you are.

503
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,060
Come closer to me.

504
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,820
Little assistant.

505
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,890
Tell me if you like any girl.

506
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,220
I'll help you.

507
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,620
Have fun tonight.

508
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,250
You can't go back
if you haven't had a good time.

509
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,780
I...

510
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
I don't need that.

511
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,410
No one can leave without having fun.

512
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,450
Here, Mr. Zhou.

513
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,510
Is there anyone you like?

514
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,060
No.

515
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,540
I don't like anyone.

516
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,740
I usually

517
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,500
like to drink alone.

518
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,750
Drink alone.

519
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,410
You are shy?

520
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,850
Well.

521
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,930
I'll help you.

522
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,980
Those pretty girls.

523
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,700
Come here.

524
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,290
Stay here.

525
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,950
Take good care
of these two handsome guys for me.

526
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,350
Ms. Zhang.

527
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,090
I just...

528
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,210
I just need her.

529
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,320
Thank you.

530
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,300
Go.

531
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,180
Thank you.

532
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,570
You're welcome.

533
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,650
You can stay with my assistant.

534
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,420
Thank you.

535
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,520
How old are you?

536
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,320
Can you drink?

537
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,250
Can you drink?

538
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,770
-Come on.
-I'm not good at it.

539
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,370
Give him a drink.

540
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:52,650
Give him a drink.

541
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,380
You can do it.

542
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,670
Have a drink.

543
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,850
Why are you here?

544
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,070
Let's drink.

545
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,950
You're a good drinker.

546
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,610
Let's have a drink.

547
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,090
Shake the dice.

548
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,310
Teach him to shake it.

549
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,200
Don't go.

550
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,390
Don't go.

551
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,640
Sit down.

552
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,560
Don't go.

553
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,010
Teach him how to play dice.

554
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,410
Let's play dice.

555
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,010
Teach him how to play dice.

556
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,070
What's that sound?

557
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,690
Come and play.

558
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,370
Come on.

559
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:22,640
Let's play dice.

560
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,900
Stay there.

561
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,830
Don't move.

562
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,360
Let's play dice.

563
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,420
Let's drink.

564
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,090
No.

565
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,010
What's wrong?

566
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,250
I need to use the bathroom.

567
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,050
What's wrong?

568
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,890
Handsome boy, are you angry?

569
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,970
Here, have a watermelon.

570
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,540
What about the Hami melon?

571
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,500
It's very sweet.

572
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,720
Mr. Zhou.

573
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,700
You are…

574
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,030
Sorry, Ms. Zhang.

575
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,780
I forgot to introduce her.

576
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,020
This is my fiancée.

577
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,280
She came here with me.

578
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,570
I'm sorry for today.

579
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,180
What a mess.

580
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,600
Ladies.

581
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,150
You can leave now.

582
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,050
Why don't she answer?

583
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,620
Ms. Zhang.

584
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,010
Besides renewing the contract,

585
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,940
I want to discuss

586
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,160
another thing with you.

587
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,210
I know your company

588
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,450
also plans to enter in

589
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,860
the clothing industry.

590
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,600
It's good

591
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,460
that our group

592
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,320
has raw materials manufacturers

593
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,010
and an entertainment company.

594
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,310
It's very important for a clothing brand

595
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,030
to choose a spokesperson.

596
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,050
Look.

597
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,800
Your ex-husband's company

598
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,410
hired the right spokesperson.

599
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,010
That's why

600
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,620
it can sell so well now.

601
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,020
What artists do you have?

602
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,740
Depends on what you need.

603
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,910
Chen Jun!

604
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,810
Where is Chen Jun?

605
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,820
She is...

606
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,650
Where is Chen Jun?

607
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,570
He went to the bathroom.

608
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,810
She is the spokesperson of our mall, Chen Yiyi.

609
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,090
Chen Yiyi?

610
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:51,850
Great.

611
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,430
This girl

612
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,290
is very suitable for our brand.

613
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,260
Where is the bathroom?

614
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,040
Over there.

615
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,010
Lili!

616
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:11,900
Lili.

617
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,330
What are you doing?

618
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,160
Don’t you remember me?

619
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,860
Lili.

620
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,690
Let go!

621
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,120
It's been a few months since I've seen you.

622
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,020
You've become more attractive.

623
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,290
Let go!

624
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,520
Let go of me!

625
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,530
Don't you remember me?

626
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,750
What are you doing?

627
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,330
Sorry.

628
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,020
I mistook her for someone else.

629
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,740
You.

630
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,970
Apologize to her.

631
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,540
Otherwise, you can't leave here tonight.

632
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,230
Okay.

633
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,090
I'm sorry.

634
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

635
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Thank you for coming with me today.

636
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,730
Tell me when you have a new game next time.

637
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,690
I will.

638
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,330
Okay.

639
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,770
Okay.

640
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,720
Thank you.

641
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,410
Please send me

642
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,010
the renewal contract later.

643
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,600
Okay.

644
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,530
Chen Yiyi.

645
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,010
She must be

646
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,210
my spokesperson.

647
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,270
No problem.

648
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,000
Don't worry.

649
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,300
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

650
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,170
See you.

651
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,980
See you.

652
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,610
Is Mr. Zhou coming back today

653
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,670
to sit in the vice president's office?

654
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,570
Vice President Sun indeed won unjustly.

655
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,840
Mr. Zhou should be the winner.

656
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,640
You're right.

657
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,810
Mr. Zhou has returned in triumph.

658
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,040
He's coming.

659
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,060
Let's warmly welcome our vice president.

660
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,390
Hello, Vice President.

661
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,300
Hello, Vice President.

662
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,470
Congratulations.

663
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,150
[Zhou Yu, Vice President]
