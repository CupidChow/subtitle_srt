00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,540
Hello, Sir.

193
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,870
My name is Li Tingjiang.

194
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,100
I was Lai's senior in college.

195
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,070
A senior in college.

196
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you worried something might happen to our farm?

197
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,250
No.

198
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,470
I came here

199
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,470
to ask you

200
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,120
something about Jiang Lai.

[Vegan meat investigation report]

202
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,520
Mr. Zhou,

203
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,110
according to my investigation,

204
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,680
Li Zhuo does own

205
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,950
a vegan meat technology company.

206
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,150
But the information we have shows that

207
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,590
this company has only been registered for less than a month.

208
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,830
But the promotions of their brand is excessive.

209
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,910
They've got endorsement

210
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,350
from many celebrities and bloggers.

211
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,910
They say

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,200
their products are high in protein and low-fat.

213
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,710
They claim that their products

214
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,440
are about a healthy lifestyle.

215
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,790
It's the common promotion

216
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,660
for product to attract hype online.

217
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,320
Obviously,

218
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,000
they're trying to trick

219
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,720
investors who are having a pipe dream.

220
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,340
No wonder Miss Jiang's dad took the bait.

Have you been to the company?

222
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,750
Yes.

223
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,250
This company's signboard is misleading.

224
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,270
And there are people in uniforms working.

225
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,920
But I don't know what's going on inside.

Try to get in there.

227
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,120
If we're going to get the farm back,

228
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,650
we'll need solid evidence.

229
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,950
But Mr. Zhou,

230
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,910
are we really not going to tell Miss Jiang about this?

231
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,710
No.

232
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,490
I can handle it myself.

Nothing.

Everything is going well.

239

Mr. Zhou, look.

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
It'll be some big news if it gets out.

383
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,590
You set me up.

384
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,590
Don't forget

385
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,320
I still have

386
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,260
the property rights of the farm.

387
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,520
The property rights?

388
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,550

389
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,090

390
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,630
Jiang Yushu doesn't have any money to give you.

391
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,040
Your partner lied to you.

392
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,550
But

393
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,810
you have another choice.

394
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,650
Transfer the property rights of the farm to me.

395
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,380
I will purchase it according to the market value.

396
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,030
If you do that,

397
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,210
I'll give you a chance to turn yourself in.

Dad, I need to ask you something.

401
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,550
What is it?

402
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
What’s going on, Lai?

403
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,440
Sit, please.

404
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,330
Have a seat.

405
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,450
Lai,

406
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,150
you can tell me anything.

407
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,320
I'll take care of it for you.

408
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,780
Zhou Yu knew

409
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,070
that you mortgaged the Snapdragon Farm.

410
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,000
He said he was going to find that person

411
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,060
and buy back the property with money.

412
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,700
What?

413
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
How can that work?

414
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,260
No. No.

415
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,630
Lai.

416
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,350
I…

417
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,010
I mean

418
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,820
I'm the one who owes money.

419
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,760
I'll work hard to pay off my debt.

420
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,730
How can you let him do that?

421
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,130
If you let him,

422
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,120
do you think you will still

423
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,720
be respected in the Zhou family

424
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,180
after you two get married?

425
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,990
They will bad-mouth you.

426
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,410
What should we do then?

427
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,110
One million is a lot.

428
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,550
I asked all of my friends

429
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,550
but still haven't borrowed enough.

430
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,720
No.

431
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,770
If the farm is bought back by Zhou Yu,

432
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,550
my shares will be gone.

433
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,360
They'll get all of the profit

434
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,250
even though I've been working hard.

435
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,580
That will be a huge loss.

436
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,530
No. No.

437
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,920
Absolutely…

438
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,910
Absolutely not.

439
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,100
Dad.

440
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,440
I won't…

441
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,990
I won't allow it.

442
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,880
Why?

443
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,010
Because...

444
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,020
I already told you

445
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm the one who owes money,

446
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,770
so I should pay it back.

447
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,650
How can I let you and your future husband carry that burden for me?

448
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,320
Right?

449
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,980
What kind of person am I?

450
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,790
I need to think about your happiness in future.

451
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,770
Right?

452
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,310
Is that really the reason?

453
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,520
Or you're afraid that if Zhou Yu pays back the money to him,

454
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,450
your scheme with Li Zhuo will fail?

455

The thing I brought up last time...

488
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,590
Li Zhuo's company closed down.

490
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,780
You couldn't honor the agreement,

491
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,290
so he transferred the possession of the farm to me.

492
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,350
As a matter of fact,

493
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,930
you've lost your farm.

494
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,470
That's impossible.

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:14,840
♫You're standing behind me, splendidly♫

568
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,650
♫You hold my hand♫

569
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,920
♫I'm not afraid because we have a future♫

570
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,550
♫Every season, every year♫

571
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,180
Jiang Lai,

572
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,330
no matter what happens,

573
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,880
♫You said you would never leave♫

574
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
I won't leave you.

575
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,220
♫Maybe there will be more challenges♫

576
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,990
I will always be with you.

577
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,710
♫But the story has already ended♫

578
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,350
♫We are together♫

579
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,760
I not only want to be with you,

580
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,240
♫Until the end of time♫

581
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,820
but also I will.

582
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,830
♫I used to have doubts♫

583
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,750
♫But the love and determination in your eyes♫

584
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:02,810
♫Tell me to stop looking for excuses♫

585
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,510
♫I want to hold your hand♫

586
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,850
♫Go through the darkness and greet the daylight♫

587
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
♫When you hold me♫

588
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,770
♫The sunshine is here♫

589
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,390
♫In the clear sky♫

590
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,480
♫There is a rainbow♫

591
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,680
♫I don't need any excuses♫

592
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,170
♫I just want to love you♫

593
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,410
♫With all my heart♫

594
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,990
What's going on with you?

595
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,630
Nothing.

596
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,010
You haven't contacted me for a while.

597
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,170
I thought you didn't need me anymore.

598
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,910
I've been busy lately.

599
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,590
And you know that.

600
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,540
Can you

601
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,910
stay here a little longer tonight?

602
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,390
Weren't you busy

603
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,250
preparing for Zhou Yu's wedding?

604
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,930
Why there's nothing going on recently?

605
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,230
Well, I wish there was nothing going on.

606
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,890
So maybe I can

607
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,270
get my resort back.

608
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,550
Have you ever thought

609
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,880
that Zhou Yu and Su Qing's wedding

610
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,150
has been postponed

611
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,770
because her family

612
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,390
doesn't approve of it?

613
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,310
Don't think about it anymore.

614
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,370
It's getting late.

615
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,450
You should go back.

616
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,810
Don't let him get suspicious.

617
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,540
Alright.

618
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,780
I'm taking off.

619
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,210
Jiang Lai,

620
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,770
I'm definitely going to make you come back to me.

621
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,560
Why are you sitting in the dark?

622
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,200
Why are you back so late?

623
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,920
Where did you go?

624
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,580
Don't you care about the kids?

625
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,960
No.

626
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,950
I went shopping with Mrs. Wang

627
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,850
after Zhen fell asleep.

628
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,780
Look.

629
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,990
I bought you a tie.

630
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,290
Try it on.

631
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,170
Aunt Liu said you've been going out often recently.

632
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,090
What did you do?

633
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,820
It's about Yu.

634
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,990
He is getting married soon.

635
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,370
I don't have much experience as a wedding planner.

636
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,740
So I asked Mrs. Wang to go shopping

637
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,400
and come up with some ideas with me.

638
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,910
I just want to do my best for this wedding.

639
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,570
By the way,

640
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,390
do Qing's parents have

641
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,310
some requirements for the wedding?

642
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,420
It's appropriate for us

643
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,760
to ask since we're the parents, right?

644
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,810
This reminded me

645
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,970
that I haven't been able to contact Mr. Su lately.

646
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,400
The wedding plan should be completed as soon as possible.

647
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,720
I’m calling him again.

648
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,250
It should be morning over there.

649
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,070
Su,

650
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,650
well, I think

651
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,360
those two have been getting along well lately.

652
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,150
Should we

653
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,650
plan for the wedding soon?

654
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,760
What?

655
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,080
Has Qing go back?
