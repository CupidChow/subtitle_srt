00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,110
Zhou Yu.

5
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,550
Listen.

6
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,370
Do you hear it?

7
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,720
The wind.

8
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,750
Where are you?

9
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,030
I...

10
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,020
This place is so beautiful.

11
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,990
Goodbye.

12
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,390
Yu.

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,590
If you miss me in the future,

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,710
you can come and listen to the wind.

15
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,130
Chen Yiyi.

16
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,210
What happened?

17
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,710
She seems drunk.

18
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,810
I need to find her.

19
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,030
I'll go with you.

20
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,980
Your foot...

21
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,190
I'm fine.

22
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,710
I feel better after applying the ointment.

23
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,990
It's more important to find her.

24
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,520
Let's go.

25
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,570
Chen Yiyi.

26
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,950
How about this?

27
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,910
I'll go over there.

28
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,510
You go there.

29
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,030
Okay.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Chen Yiyi.

31
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,829
Chen Yiyi.

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,870
Yu.

33
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,430
I knew you would find me.

34
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,670
Let's leave.

35
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,150
I...

36
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,470
I won't leave.

37
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,990
Unless you promise

38
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,040
to be with me.

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,829
You're drunk.

40
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,420
Let's talk when you're sober.

41
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,590
I'm very sober.

42
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,770
You must give me an answer today.

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,829
Either you become my boyfriend

44
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,360
or I'll make you never forget me.

45
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,270
Then go.

46
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,790
It's ridiculous

47
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,230
to force someone to be with you by doing this.

48
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,350
People who don't care about you

49
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,230
still won't care about you

50
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,360
even if you're dead.

51
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,570
You... I...

52
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,670
So dirty!

53
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,880
You...

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,370
You don't have to laugh at me
even if you don't like me.

55
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,310
Aren't you going to jump into the lake?

56
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,350
Your hair

57
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,870
and face

58
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,310
will be soaked in water.

59
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,790
And your face will swell and become deformed

60
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,070
after a long time.

61
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,170
It's awful.

62
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,070
Come on.

63
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,030
Get up.

64
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,520
No.

65
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:43,990
You first...

66
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,710
I'm not leaving.

67
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,350
Get up.

68
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,670
You haven't promised me.

69
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,350
Get up.

70
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm not leaving.

71
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,550
Then go down.

72
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,570
What are you doing?

73
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,750
Come up.

74
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,700
Come up.

75
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,600
Go.

76
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,870
Look over there.

77
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,430
It's pretty.

78
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,390
Take a photo.

79
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,990
Jiang Lai.

80
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
Are you Jiang Lai, right?

81
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,110
Look.

82
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,750
I told you that girl looks like Jiang Lai.

83
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,950
You don’t believe me.

84
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,830
What a coincidence.

85
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,470
You're all here.

86
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,030
Xia.

87
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,510
Didn't you say you were busy

88
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,910
so you couldn't come to the alumni reunion?

89
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,940
So you're

90
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,590
on a date with your boyfriend secretly.

91
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,470
Why didn't you introduce him to us?

92
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,430
Are you trying to keep your relationship a secret?

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,140
Right.

94
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,030
He looks handsome.

95
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,909
He has no other good qualities except being handsome.

96
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,909
I felt embarrassed to bring him out.

97
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,030
You mean

98
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,590
you found a boy toy?

99
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,120
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,710
Anyway,

101
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,970
as long as he can make me happy, it's good.

102
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,920
You're right.

103
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,990
You guys are having a good chat.

104
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,260
I can hear you laughing from afar.

105
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,100
I've booked the karaoke room.

106
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,900
Let's go back.

107
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,070
Yes.

108
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,750
Let’s

109
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,110
not disturb

110
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,270
her date.

111
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,310
Let's go.

112
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,310
Have fun.

113
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,000
See you next time.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,030
OK. Bye.

115
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,950
Bye, bye.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,520
[I found Chen Yiyi]

117
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,000
[Okay, I'll go back to the hotel now]

118
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,480
Why don't you keep walking?

119
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,430
Yu.

120
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,430
You have sobered up, right?

121
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,830
You can walk by yourself.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,030
I'm not sober.

123
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,370
I can't walk by myself.

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Carry me.

125
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Yu.

126
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,500
Where are you going?

127
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,190
Are you going to find Su Qing?

128
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,350
Look at the state I'm in now.

129
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,230
Why are you still looking for her?

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Yiyi.

131
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,160
I really treat you as my sister.

132
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,670
I don't want to be your sister.

133
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,330
I want to be your girlfriend.

134
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,790
Your girlfriend.

135
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,720
Mr. Zhou, what's happened to Yiyi?

136
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,640
I'll leave the rest to you.

137
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,270
Here.

138
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,190
Be good.

139
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,270
No.

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,880
I can't be good.

141
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,510
Chen Jun will accompany you.

142
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,140
Fine.

143
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,710
Well...

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,540
Hello.

145
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,270
Please change room 312's suite to another standard room.

146
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,150
Were you the guest who stayed in room 312 before?

147
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,960
Yes.

148
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,510
Here's the thing.

149
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,310
The lakeside dinner

150
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,290
is ready.

151
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,310
Lakeside dinner?

152
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,310
Did Zhou Yu arrange it?

153
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,990
June 18th.

154
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,310
Today is his birthday.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
Miss Jiang, I'll leave you be then.

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,030
Wait.

157
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,310
Can I cook in your kitchen?

158
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,200
Hello.

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,640
Are you Mr. Zhou Yu from room 312?

160
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,270
Here's the thing.

161
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,350
A lady

162
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,670
booked a lakeside dinner for you.

163
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,680
Could it be Su Qing?

164
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,870
Here.

165
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,010
Try it.

166
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,710
I made boiled glutinous rice balls in fermented glutinous rice
for you in the kitchen.

167
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,670
In my hometown,

168
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,300
we eat this on our birthdays.

169
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,420
You'll be one year older

170
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,110
after eating these boiled glutinous rice balls in fermented glutinous rice.

171
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,710
But today is not my birthday.

172
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Did you even remember my birthday wrongly?

173
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,950
No.

174
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,350
I saw this date

175
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,680
in your grandpa's room.

176
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,280
It's not your birthday?

177
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,070
No.

178
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:11,630
Fine.

179
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,660
Don't eat it.

180
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,920
You don't appreciate what you've got.

181
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,290
I want more.

182
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,570
Let's go home now.

183
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,720
You'll catch a cold.

184
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,670
No.

185
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,690
Catch a cold?

186
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,960
If I catch a cold,

187
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,480
Yu will come to see me.

188
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,290
I'm not going home.

189
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,750
I'm not going home.

190
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,350
I'm not going home.

191
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,110
I think this is wrong.

192
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,040
You shouldn't be like this when you love someone.

193
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,410
Love

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,490

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,720
I don't think Qi Wei has taken care of my room.

385
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,940
What are you doing?

386
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,170
How dare you say that?

387
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,190
I thought

388
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,230
we would have a date today.

389
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,570
But you brought me to such a terrible place.

390
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,920
It's not romantic at all.

391
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,120
I was looking forward to it all morning.

392
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,410
Really?

393
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,610
I can't stay here anymore.

394
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,350
Aren't you leaving?

395
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,090
Let's check somewhere else.

396
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,920
What else do you want to see?

397
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,000
What's the rush?

398
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,720
The farm will be demolished soon.

399
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,790
All the residents here will be dismissed.

400
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,640
All the houses will be demolished.

401
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,280
These chickens, ducks,

402
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,270
cows, pigs,

403
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,770
horses and sheep

404
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,620
will be sold in the market.

405
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,490
By the way,

406
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,510
don't you like peacocks?

407
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,440
There are 2 peacocks.

408
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,550
I'll pluck the peacocks

409
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,680
one by one

410
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,090
and put them at home as decorations, okay?

411
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,170
Who are you?

412
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,540
Hello.

413
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,370
We are here...

414
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,020
Did you come to steal eggs?

415
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,740
No.

416
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,300
I really didn't come to steal eggs.

417
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,460
I think you came to do this.

418
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,370
You're sneaking around.

419
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,070
Let me explain.

420
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,950
We didn't come here to steal eggs.

421
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,950
Steal my eggs?

422
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,880
I'll beat you.

423
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
I've taken care of the room and the photo.

424
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,520
How is it?

425
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,530
Is it fast?

426
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,830
Stop showing off.

427
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,880
Zhou Yu has gone crazy.

428
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,540
He wants to demolish the farm.

429
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,070
Right.

430
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,780
His car is outside.

431
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,270
The contract is in the car.

432
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,600
Find a hammer to smash the window

433
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,950
and steal the contract.

434
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,950
Go.

435
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,610
What are you waiting for?

436
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,080
Hurry.

437
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,190
Just say it.

438
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,190
Why did you hit me?

439
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,230
This car is so impressive.

440
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Auntie!

441
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,720
Sister. Sister.

442
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,780
Who is your Auntie?

443
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,410
Wait.

444
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,980
I'm from Zhou's Group.

445
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,860
I'm not a thief.

446
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,150
You're from Zhou's Group.

447
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,230
Then you deserve to be beaten even more.

448
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,590
Why?

449
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,390
Just because you had a few bucks,

450
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,550
you were showing off.

451
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,050
I'll beat you down.

452
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,160
How dare you steal my eggs?

453
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,580
I won't steal eggs.

454
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:05,900
No.

455
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,710
You have money,
but you still want to steal my eggs.

456
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,150
I didn't steal eggs.

457
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,110
I really didn't come to steal eggs.

458
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,310
What's wrong?

459
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,260
Nothing.

460
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,110
[What's up with you? Dropping the ball at a critical moment]

461
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,880
[It's not that I didn't want to do it. If I did, we can't afford to compensate]

462
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,570
Fasten your seatbelt.

463
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,760
Here comes the milk.

464
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,850
Look at your face.

465
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,750
You look down at the documents every day.

466
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,630
I can see the wrinkles on your forehead.

467
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,230
You won't look handsome if you keep doing this.

468
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,090
Drink the milk.

469
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,780
Go back to your room and sleep.

470
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,150
Are you happy?

471
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,730
After a day of work,

472
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,510
now I'm giving you a wonderful massage.

473
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,860
Can you do it harder?

474
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,340
You didn't eat dinner?

475
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,350
Maybe a little bit left.

476
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,190
No.

477
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,540
Back the other way a bit.

478
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,920
Yes, yes.

479
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,350
Are you exhausted?

480
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,670
Faster.

481
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,280
Done.

482
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,070
Thank you.

483
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,790
I'm going to bed.

484
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,010
Have a good sleep.

485
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,080
After drinking my milk,

486
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,020
even if the door is blown up,

487
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,060
you won't wake up.

488
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,610
My hands are trembling

489
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,670
after I gave him a massage for so long.

490
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,710
Zhou Yu.

491
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,800
What's wrong?

492
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,020
Come in and help me.

493
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,640
I fell down.

494
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,480
I can't move.

495
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,550
Get me a towel.

496
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,590
Here.

497
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,990
You don't take off your clothes
when taking a shower?

498
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,580
My...

499
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,880
My shower head is broken.

500
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,110
I want to fix it.

501
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,910
Good for you.

502
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,930
Where are you hurt?

503
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,790
My waist.

504
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,070
What are you doing?

505
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,440
Look at me, you don't...

506
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,560
Pervert.

507
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,510
How about

508
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,770
I change into dry clothes first?

509
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,350
Comfortable.

510
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,130
Master Zhou, you have great skills.

511
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,970
A bit lower.

512
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,590
Left.

513
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,260
Yes, yes.

514
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,330
Harder.

515
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,710
Yes, yes.

516
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,250
Harder.

517
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,190
Here.

518
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,080
Comfortable.

519
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,470
Why do you stop?

520
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,310
So soon.

521
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm tired.

522
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,790
I've given you a massage for an hour.

523
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,390
I didn't even say I was tired.

524
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,200
Was it tiring to massage my shoulder?

525
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,680
Of course.

526
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,300
But because...

527
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

528
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,750
You'll only make me think you're hypocritical.

529
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,900
It's not that serious.

530
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,900
I hate it when people lie to me.

531
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,980
I would never lie to you.

532
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,300
You've never lied to me,

533
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,230
even once?

534
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,199
Oh no.

535
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
Did he know?

536
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,460
I'll give you another chance.

537
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,760
No matter what lies you've told me,

538
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,770
if you admit it now,

539
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,810
I will forgive you.

540
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,389
I'm your fiancée.

541
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,600
Of course I'm honest with you.

542
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,270
♫The bitterness lingers in my heart♫

543
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,040
♫The hidden wound♫

544
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,310
♫The emotions are slipping away♫

♫Don't talk about clearing the fog♫

547

Get some rest.

548

♫Love is just a fiction♫

549
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:23,800
♫Like a moth flying into the flame with knowing the trap♫

550
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,590
Sorry.

551
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,260
Zhou Yu.

552
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,620
When I find my dad,

553
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,880
♫Don't look back♫

554
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,920
I'll explain it to you.

555
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,800
♫But my steps linger♫

556
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,750
♫It's me♫

♫Reluctant to let the stars go♫

559

No matter what lies you've told me,

565
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,030
if you admit it now,

566
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,960
I will forgive you.

567
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,790
I'm really sorry.

568
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,900
But I have to do this for the farm.

569
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,840
Su Qing.

570
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,020
Or maybe I should call you

571
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,100
Jiang Lai.
