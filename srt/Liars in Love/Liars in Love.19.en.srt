No.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,390
It's just that my dad likes it,

40

so I can have some from time to time.

41
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,960
White Tea is good for sleep,

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,890

I sometimes forget about the real world.

Then why did you choose to be a scumbag tester?

108
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,290
When I was in college,

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,520
one of my roommates

110
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,880
was fooled by her first love.

but he still kept it from her.

113

Not only did he cheat her out of her scholarship,

114
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,150
but he also asked her to borrow money from the online loan platform for him.

115
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,360
We had no choice

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
but to set up a trap

117
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,600
to reveal his true nature.

118
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,040
So,

119
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,030
you decided to become a scumbag tester later?

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,720
Actually, people are good at lying to themselves.

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Especially when something goes wrong

122
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,180
with their heartfelt relationship.

123
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,050
Instinctively,

124
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,520
they choose to escape from our true feelings.

125
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
So at this time,

126
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,510
they need to break the lie.

127

I know my job is shady.

128
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,950
But I think

129
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,460
that there is always someone who needs someone like me.

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
If I ever lose my job,

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,780
our company is more inclined to

194
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,480
establish a green eco-community

195
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,800
rather than

196
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
just a picturesque spot for photos.

197
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,790
Of course.

198
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,390
Dream City Resort

199
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,720
should have its own unique characteristics.

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,380
We can't just follow the flow.

201
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,640
Thank you for coming.

202
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,910
Our company will conduct a detailed evaluation.

203
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,370
We'll inform you about the results shortly.

204
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,930
-Thank you.
-Okay.

205
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,350
Mr. Zhou.

206
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,090
What do you think of him?

207
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,000
He has a good resume.

208
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,540
But his idea of the resort

209
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
is too different from ours.

210
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,020
He's not suitable enough.

211
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
Is there anyone else?

212
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,370
He is the last one.

213
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
What's in your hand?

214
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,600
This was just sent here this morning.

215
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,160
She may not be appropriate.

216
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,470
This spreadsheet is printed very clearly.

217
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,530
It's finally done.

218
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,940
What are you doing?

219
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,910
Why is she here?

220
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,110
This should be interesting.

221
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,150
Look at Jiang Lai.

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Oh no.

223
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,390
Should I call the police or an ambulance?

224
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,600
Nothing will do.

225
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,540
-No need to call any of them.
-Let’s get back to work.

226
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Miss Su,

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,760
would you like something to drink?

228
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,370
No.

229
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you.

230
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,260
Here's the thing.

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Mr. Zhou has reviewed your resume

232
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
and believed that you are highly qualified

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,950
for the position of resort architect at our company.

234
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,880
That's why I invited you here.

235
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,550
I thought

236
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,810
that Mr. Zhou would eliminate my resume.

237
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
No way.

238
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:35,960
Miss Su,

239
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,420
a talent like you, is what our company needs.

240
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,460
I'd like to talk to Miss Su alone.

241
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,360
Okay.

242
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,150
She and Mr. Zhou are just talking about work.

243
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,100
I promise,

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,250
nothing personal is going on in there.

245
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,640
What job?

246
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,780
Did she just come here

247
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,160
to replace Mr. Zhou?

248
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,920
No.

249
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Of course not.

250
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,000
The architect for the resort

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
hasn't been decided yet.

252
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
Su Qing happens to be an architect.

253
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,560
Her resume

254
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
is very impressive.

255
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,380
Su Qing is taking part in the resort project?

256
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,710
It's not decided yet.

257
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,130
I think

258
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,000
that she's too young

259
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,030
to undertake the resort project.

260
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,810
Mr. Zhou may not choose her.

261
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
About Jiang Lai...

262
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,480
Mr. Zhou.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,660
We're here to talk about work.

264
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,880
Okay.

265
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,910
Architecture major at Cambridge University.

266
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,680
Internal awards: the International Hospitality Design Landscape of the Year Award

267
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,280
and the European Eco-Resort of the Year Award.

268
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,060
Your resume

269
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,490
is really hard to ignore.

270
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,560
I'm just curious

271
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,350
why you want to work in Zhou's Group.

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,460
Because I want to help you.

273
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,680
Just kidding.

274
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,560
Though I do think so.

275
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,110
Here's the thing.

276
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,150
I believe I'm the perfect candidate

277
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,080
for the Dream City Resort project.

278
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,060
You're looking to build an eco-resort complex.

279
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,760
I have my own opinion on this.

280
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
First...

281
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,600
In my opinion,

282
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,190
the architect of this resort is in her pocket.

283
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,240
Why?

284
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,680
Look at her resume.

285
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,980
[Su Qing]

286
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
She received a lot of awards

287
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,920
abroad.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,790
Let me see.

289
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,960
What do you know?

290
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,960
The foreign awards are useless.

291
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,940
Maybe she's not accustomed to the environment in China.

292
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,720
I don't think so.

293
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,520
She is...

294
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,080
Why not?

295
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,600
Stop it.

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
No chitchat at work!

297
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,400
Yes.

298
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,730
Let's get down to business.

299
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,840
Mr. Zhou.

300
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
Contract?

301
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
What contract?

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,360
They're going to sign the labor contract now?

303
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,890
No way.

304
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,910
That fast!

305
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,570
The speed of lightning.

306
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,220
Actually, your father came to me yesterday.

307
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,250
He gave me a letter of appointment

308
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,800
and designated me as the architect of the resort.

309
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,660
I guess

310
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,190
you didn't agree.

311
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,550
How did you know?

312
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,860
With your resume,

313
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,000
why give the initiative to others?

314
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,750
I made the right choice.

315
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
When can we start working?

316
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,600
Anytime.

317
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,560
Let's do it now.

318
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Introduce your employees to me.

319
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,040
Okay.

320
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,850
This is called scraping, you know?

321
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,640
It can relax your meridians.

322
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,350
Mr. Zhou.

323
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
Mr. Zhou.

324
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,870
Let me introduce.

325
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,730
This is Ma Shan.

326
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,160
It's me.

327
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,130
This is Ye Tingting.

328
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,060
-Hello.
-Hello.

329
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,160
And this one.

330
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,099
This is Jiang Lai,

331
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,020
also part of the secretariat.

332
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:18,960
Hello.

333
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,020
Let me formally introduce myself.

334
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,859
I'm Su Qing.

335
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,990
Hello.

336
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,150
My name is Jiang Lai.

337
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,500
[Hotel]

338
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,160
How is it?

339
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Haven’t you figured out what to say?

340
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,040
What business dealings do you have

341
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,640
with Zhou Mingde and Sun Wei?

342
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,300
Your men

343
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,380
have been arrested for over 24 hours.

344
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,490
The police are also looking for you all over the city.

345
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,760
Call me when you come around.

346
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,290
If it takes too long,

347
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,470
I may not be able to cover you either.

348
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,420
Everyone,

349
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,360
any questions?

350
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,810
Okay.

351
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,660
It's settled then.

352
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,840
Dismiss.

353
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,990
Wait for me a moment.

354
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,410
Chen Jun.

355
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,660
What do we have for lunch?

356
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,530
The pickled vegetables and fish downstairs?

357
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,670
A construction truck was crushed in Wanlongxi yesterday.

358
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,600
The shop's fish are all from there.

359
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,890
Then what should we eat?

360
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,570
Order takeout from Grandma's Home?

361
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,310
How is it?

362
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,060
Not bad.

363
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
Don’t order the one in Hengyu Square.

364
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,070
They have a fire inspection today.

365
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,130
It'll be very slow.

366
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,200
Then order from the restaurant on Hongshan Road.

367
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,840
That should be fine.

368
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,580
Let me see.

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,560
Jun.

370
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,230
Do you want to order takeout together?

371
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,150
No.

372
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,040
I have a date with my girlfriend at Lushan Braise.

373
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,400
Are you going to that restaurant again?

374
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,160
At this hour,

375
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
the Lingshan Tunnel should be jammed.

376
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,280
Take a detour.

377
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,300
Take Beishan Street.

378
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,830
Is it the one on Huanxi Road?

379
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,480
Yes.

380
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,310
Mr. Zhou, are you free

381
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,800
to have lunch with me?

382
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,160
I have a date with my girlfriend.

384
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,850
I have something to say.

385
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,540
How about

386
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,760
after the lunch break, okay?

387
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,070
It concerns everyone.

388
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,190
I think it's better to talk here.

389
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,640
Okay.

390
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,360
Go ahead.

391
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Here's the thing.

392
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,590
My friends in the studio

393
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,260
will help me finish the design drawings

394
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,360
for the resort in England.

395
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,810
But I need to do the field surveys

396
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,270
in China.

397
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,360
So,

398
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,050
I need to apply for a colleague within the company

399
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,980
as my assistant,

400
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,320
someone who is familiar

401
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,600
with this project.

402
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,250
It seems you have found a suitable candidate.

403
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,840
I want Jiang Lai.

404
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,640
Jiang Lai?

405
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,400
Jiang Lai, I...

406
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,120
I can do it.

407
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
That's it.

408
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,720
Time is running out.

409
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,390
Mr. Zhou,

410
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,750
let me borrow your girlfriend for a while.

411
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,080
Didn't we have a lunch date?

412
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,160
Mr. Zhou.

413
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,040
What?

414
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,240
Move over, please.

415
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,170
I'm in a hurry.

416
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,660
[Well, I'll go first. Hurry up]

417
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,390
Let's go.

418
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,120
Go.

419
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,860
Mr. Zhou.

420
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm busy catching the subway.

421
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,170
It's rush hour.

422
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,570
We're all busy.

423
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,660
[Meeting Room]

424
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,150
Are you nervous?

425
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,160
Yes.

426
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,440
You suddenly chose me, the least experienced,

427
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
to be your assistant.

428
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,040
Plus, we had unusual interactions before.

429
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,910
So I'm a little nervous.

430
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,560
You are quite interesting.

431
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,690
Then why did you agree to be my assistant?

432
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,170
Because I need this chance more than anyone else.

433
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,870
And I've read your resume before.

434
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,720
You're excellent and professional.

435
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,040
I always believe in leaving professional matters to the professionals.

436
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,000
So, at least,

437
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,280
you chose me

438
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,730
because it's related to your work needs.

439
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,830
I chose you for only one reason.

440
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,850
I am impressed by your ability.

441
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,560
When we were in the meeting room,

442
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,120
you could tell the exact food source,

443
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,360
urban road planning,

444
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,900
and even the current news of the mall.

445
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I think you must know this city well.

446
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,820
Indeed.

447
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
I grew up here.

448
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,410
Plus, my previous job

449
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,760
makes me know this place better than others.

450
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
If I want to design the construction plan,

451
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
I need to know the city's orientation,

452
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,240
the surrounding environment,

453
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,650
and even local customs and practices.

454
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,690
So, you need me to be your tour guide?

455
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,240
Yes.

456
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Now you need this job,

457
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,310
and I need your ability.

458
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,680
We're kind of like a community with shared interests.

459
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,440
So, next...

460
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,400

Who sent the email?

516
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,920
That email address is

the printing store owner's private account.

518
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,310
After we contacted him,

519
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,350
he said

520
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,200
that when the email was sent,

521
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,680
he went to the toilet.

522
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,700
It so happened that the surveillance cameras in his shop are broken these days.

523

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,600

532
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,920
saying that a man named Song Biao planned the kidnapping.

533
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,700
But his men only know

534
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
that he kidnapped Su Qing for money,

535
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,590
and they don't know

536
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,550
who he turned to.

537
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,300
Song Biao didn't contact you.

538
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,180
Then he must have contacted the person who sent the email.

539
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,660
As long as we can find Song Biao...

540
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,580

565
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,150
Not exactly.

566
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,670

because of the resort project.

568
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,910

569
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,610
we went through something else together.

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,230
It seems

571
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,960
that I came back too late.

572
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,450
I like Zhou Yu.

573
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,700
I want to compete with you fairly for him.

574
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,180
I know

575
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,440
that Zhou Yu only has eyes for you.

576
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,600
But I won't give up.

577
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,840
At least I won't have any regrets

578
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,500
after fighting hard for the man I love.

579
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,060
I believe in our relationship.

580
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,950
And I also believe in myself.

581
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,350
The sun is setting.

582
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,440
Let’s go back.

583
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,910
Jiang Lai.

584
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,540
Why are you going downhill so slowly?

585
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,000
Wait for me.

586
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,880
Su Qing!

587
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,090
Jiang Lai!

588
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,050
Su Qing!

589
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,640
Su Qing!

590
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,560
Su Qing!

591
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,990
I'm here.

592
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,160
Are you okay?

593
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,360
I'm fine.

594
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,510
What's wrong?

595
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,440
I think I sprained my ankle.

596
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
I should have listened to you

597
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,250
and walked slowly.

598
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,600
It's okay.

599
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,520
I'll come down and help you.

600
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,100
Okay.

601
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,030
Be careful.

602
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,560
No.

603
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,690
It's too dangerous.

604
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,520
My phone is missing.

605
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,080
You call for help.

606
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,400
My phone is dead.

607
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,470
How about this?

608
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,160
You wait for me here.

609
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,880
I'll go down to recharge

610
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,440
and make a call.

611
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,400
I'll be right back.

612
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,110
Wait for me here.

613
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,830
Okay.

614
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,210
Be careful.

615
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,480
Su Qing!

616
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,000
Jiang Lai!

617
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,590
Jiang Lai!

618
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Su Qing!

619
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,760
Jiang Lai!

620
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,060
Su Qing!

621
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,610
I'm here!

622
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,480
Zhou Yu.

623
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,050
You saved me again.

624
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,410
What do you like to eat?

625
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,070
You're seriously injured,

626
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,600
yet you still care about what I like to eat?

627
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,760
We don't have much time to be alone.

628
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,490
Of course, I have to cherish it.

629
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,020
So what do you like to eat?

630
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,120
I already have a girlfriend.

631
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,880
Do you have any hobbies?

632
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm still injured.

633
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Slow down.

634
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,970
Slow down!

635
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,560
Zhou Yu!

636
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,400
Su Qing, are you okay?

637
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,070
I'm fine.

638
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,640
I'm sorry.

639
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,100
You got hurt because of me.

640
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,460
This is a blessing in disguise.

641
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,000
Help me open the door.

642
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,030
Zhou Yu...

643
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,040
No matter how familiar you are with this place,

644
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
you can't climb the mountain at this hour.

645
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Do you know how worried I was

646
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,160
when I only saw Su Qing?

647
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,670
Don't be mad.

648
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,440
I promise I won't do it again.

649
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,530
Don't be mad at me.

650
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,520
Are you okay?

651
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,020
Come in.

652
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,730
Chairman.

653
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,510
These are the performance reports

654
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,760
of all our branches for the past two weeks.

655
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,820
Please take a look.

656
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,600
How is the resort project?

657
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,000
Mr. Zhou is going through the terms of the contract with Jujiang Capital.

658
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,810
Miss Su's resort design plan

659
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,170
has also been approved.

660
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,280
I asked you to investigate Snapdragon Farm last time.

661
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,200
How come you didn't find out

662
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,020
that Jiang Lai is from that farm?

663
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,130
You're not doing a good job.

664
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,960
Chairman.

665
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm sorry.

666
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I...

667
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,620
I was careless at work.

668
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,710
The resort project is my main concern.

669
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,860
You know what to do, right?

670
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,960
I know.

671
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,280
I will report everything to you

672
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,719
that happens after that.

673
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,210
Alright.

674
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,500
I bought you a tie.

675
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,380
Try it on later.

676
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,179
Nice tie.

677
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,940
This one...

678
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,199
It was on sale.

679
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,320
From a friend.

680
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,699
Go back to work.

681
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,280
Check Sun Wei's expense record for the month.

682
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,160
For the 40th-anniversary celebration

683
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,810
of the company's foundation,

684
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,660
[Announcement of the Administrative Department]

685
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,800
the Dream Resort project team

686
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,750
will need to present a stage result report

687
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,350
as the key project for the anniversary.

688
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,860
We have just formed a team of designers,

689
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,880
and now they want to see our results?

690
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,000
I must have done many evil things in my previous life,

691
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,860
so I have to work with Mr. Zhou for the rest of my life!

692
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,670
Mr. Zhou.

693
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,690
You caught a cold?

694
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:36,920
Mr. Zhou.

695
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,190
There was a document yesterday...

696
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,120
You're all here!

697
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,700
Special Assistant Li.

698
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,450
You must have seen

699
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
the latest group announcement, right?

700
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,310
Yes.

701
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,010
The anniversary is approaching.

702
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,940
So, the Chairman has specifically assigned me

703
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,260
to join your project team

704
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,660
to assist with your work.

705
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,610
Mr. Zhou.

706
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,520
I look forward to working with you.
