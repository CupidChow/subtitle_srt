197
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,640
Okay.

198
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,150
Miss Su.

199
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,170
This way, please.

200
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,720
Is this how you treat your fiancée?

201
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,150
I said

202
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,860
I don't agree with this marriage.

203
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,260
Who wants you to be his fiancée?
Go find him.

204
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,750
Yu.

205
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,550
What about me?

206
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,310
Ma Shan.

207
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,750
Mr. Zhou.

208
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,670
Send Miss Chen out.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,030
I'll leave

210
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,290
after I say a few words.

211
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,330
You really won't marry Su Qing,

212
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,910
right?

213
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,910
No.

214
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,350
I knew it.

215
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,030
I'm going on a business trip soon.

216
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,030
Wait for me.

217
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,270
Bye.

218
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,030
Bye.

219
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,950
By the way,

220
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,750
if Su Qing comes to the company again,

221
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,040
kick her out immediately.

222
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,730
Yes.

223
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, superstar.

224
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,130
What

225
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,400
are you going to do about the video?

226
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,960
True blue will never stain.

227
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,250
People only believe what they see.

228
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,510
You were set up as soon as you came back.

229
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,950
How

230
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,280
can you compete with Sun Wei?

231
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,260
A partner of the resort project
withdrew his investment.

232
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,150
I want Su's Group to be our next partner.

233
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,660
But they want to
break off the engagement with you.

234
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
Su Qing came back.

235
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,480
Be wise and take advantage.

236
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,890
So you plan to

237
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,270
sell your son for money?

238
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,150
Do you think you're worth it?

239
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,260
Do they want you?

240
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,160
I almost forgot.

241
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,230
Chairman Zhou owns Zhou's Group

242
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,930
because of your wife's dad.

243
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,400
I have to say

244
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,080
Chairman Zhou is really scheming.

245
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,650
Don’t worry.

246
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,440
The maliciously edited video

247
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,460
and the fake pregnant woman.

248
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,490
I'll handle them.

249
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,330
If there's nothing else,

250
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,060
I’m leaving.

251
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,300
Enjoy your tea.

252
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,530
How can you compete with Sun Wei
without the Su Family?

253
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,810
Besides,

254
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,230
you're not my only son.

255
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,000
As long as you marry Su Qing,

256
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,800
you'll be in charge of the resort project.

257
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,640
Have dinner with Su Qing this weekend.

258
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,360
Yes.

259
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,430
What?

260
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,510
Okay.

261
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,640
I'll be right there.

262
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,430
Where is Zhou Yu going in such a hurry?

263
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,470
Sir, follow the white car ahead.

264
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,340
Catch the adulterer.

265
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,130
OK.

266
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,190
Have you found my grandpa?

267
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,670
No.

268
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,750
Grandpa Zhang usually
takes a nap in the afternoon.

269
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,290
I went out after he fell asleep.

270
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,090
He disappeared when I came back.

271
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,700
I just checked the surveillance video.

272
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,560
Grandpa Zhang went out on his own.

273
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,650
You followed me?

274
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,690
What a coincidence.

275
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,110
No.

276
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,350
You were in a hurry to leave.

277
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,410
I was wondering if you need some help.

278
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,520
As long as you marry Su Qing,

279
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,360
you'll be in charge of the resort project.

280
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,630
How did my grandpa leave?

281
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,930
I'm not sure.

282
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,970
Please call the police for us.

283
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,390
I'll go to his room to see
if there are any other clues.

284
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,870
Okay.

285
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,610
[Lu]

286
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,400
Does Zhou Yu have any brothers?

287
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,770
He looks like him.

288
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,770
What day is May 5th?

289
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,240
May 5th.

290
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,370
It seems to be my grandma's birthday.

291
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,170
What's wrong?

292
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,470
Grandma.

293
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,470
Is there any place

294
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,870
that your grandma liked to go on birthdays?

295
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,790
Or where did your grandparents

296
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,110
use to go?

297
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,480
I don't remember much.

298
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,870
My grandma passed away a long time ago.

299
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,510
[Documenting for my dearest wife in Huahuo Ballroom]

300
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Huahuo Ballroom.

301
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,680
Dearest wife.

302
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,090
Where can we find a ballroom

303
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,250
that opened in 1987?

304
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,230
I found it.

305
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,640
Is it here?

306
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,120
This is the original address
of the Huahuo Ballroom.

307
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,320
Manager.

308
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,200
The grandpa just wouldn't leave.

309
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,030
Now he's dancing by himself.

310
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,090
I can't do anything about him.

311
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,910
How about we call the police?

312
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,190
Hello.

313
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,710
Hello.

314
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,030
Is he

315
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,140
the grandpa you mentioned?

316
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,580
Yes.

317
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,270
It's him.

318
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,430
He's inside.

319
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,350
When I went to work this morning,

320
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,640
this grandpa was at the door.

321
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,300
I asked for his family's number.

322
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
He didn't tell me.

323
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,970
So I asked him to come in first.

324
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,140
Right there.

325
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Look.

326
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,360
Thank you.

327
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,080
I'll pay for the loss.

328

Here.

329
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:56,990
Okay.

330
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,090
Make yourself comfortable.

331
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,730
Okay.

332
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,720
Your grandparents' love is really wonderful.

333
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,069
You're here.

334
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,300
I've been waiting for you.

335
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,500
Happy birthday.

336
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,470
Happy birthday?

337
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,200
Thank you for remembering my birthday.

338
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Let's go home.

339
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,940
What are you doing?

340
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,170
Are you okay?

341
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,330
I'm fine.

342
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,060
Be careful.

343
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,590
Slow down.

344
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Why are you following us?

Who are you?

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,400
He's our grandson.

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,530

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,740

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,370
Our grandson's so grown up.

OK.

356
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,650
Thank you for accompanying my grandpa today.

357
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,980
Isn't it too insincere just to say thanks?

358
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,380
What do you want?

359
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,070
I want to work in the Zhou's Group

as your secretary.

361
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,710
She really likes me.

362
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,160
If I can get in there,

363
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,820
I can get the contract easily.

364
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,500
Did you hear the cat meowing?

365
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,220

374
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,490
The cat doesn't want to come out.

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,930
Why is there cat food?

376
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,860
Do you have a cat?

377
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,350
No.

378
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,240
It's out.

379
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,750
So little.

380
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,480
Do you like cats?

381
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,930
Not really.

Why else would you

384
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,470
have cat food in the car?

385
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,030
Such a little cat

386
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,780
can't live long outside.

387
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,570
Why don't you take it back?

388
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,930
It responds.

389
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,680
It must like you a lot.

390
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,530
Kitty.

391
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,620
You know you should find yourself
a rich dad, right?

392
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,950
Alright.

393
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,020
You'll be in charge of its cat food.

394
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm leaving.

395
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,730
Bye.

396
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,050
Let me give you a ride.

397
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,640
No need.

398
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,270
It wasn't just on your way home.

399
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,400
See you at the office

400
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,870
at 9:30 tomorrow morning.

401
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,680
Don't be late.

402
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,870
See you tomorrow.

403
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,170
What's the cat's name?

404
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,990
Just call it Mimi.

405
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,090
How long will you leave it here?

406
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,890
Three months.

407
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,450
No.

408
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,960
It'll stay here forever.

409
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,760
Forever?

410
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,770
Aren't you going to take it back?

411
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,300
I don't keep animals.

412
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,910
This is our luxurious room.

413
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,920
It costs 200 yuan per day.

414
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,140
It's not cost-effective to live here for so long.

415
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,200
It doesn't matter.

416
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
I'll pay the rent for 3 months.

417
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,080
Just arrange

418
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,720
the best for it

419
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,790
in every aspect.

420
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,170
How about this?

421
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,040
If it's not convenient for you,

422
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,370
we'll find a home for it.

423
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,530
Okay.

424
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,170
Please contact me

425
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,290
if you find the right person.

426
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:57,730
Okay.

427
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,330
Thank you.

428
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,260
You're welcome.

429
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,320
Mimi.

430
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,420
He said I'm not pretty.

431
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,630
But he's obedient now.

432
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,780
Get the contract in Zhou's Group tomorrow.

433
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,400
Done.

434
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,300
Everyone,

435
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,590
this is Miss Su.

436
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,510
Miss Su will work in the Secretariat.

437
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,530
Tingting, please tell her about her work later.

438
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,910
Hello.

439
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,030
I'm Su Qing.

440
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,110
Hello, Miss Su.

441
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,830
My name is Ye Tingting.

442
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,190
Just call me Tingting.

443
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,630
Hello, Miss Su.

444
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,910
I'm Ma Shan.

445
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,830
You can call me Shan.

446
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,790
By the way.

447
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,440
Here.

448
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
This is your desk.

449
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,790
The desk

450
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,370
and the chair.

451
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,530
I brushed them 3 times with alcohol.

452
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,230
Thank you.

453
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,230
Thank you so much.

454
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,900
Is Mr. Zhou here?

455
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,790
He's inside.

456
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,840
Yes, inside.

457
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,180
I'll go in.

458
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,680
Okay.

459
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,990
What's going on?

460
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,440
Why does Mr. Zhou's fiancée work here?

461
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,630
To catch the adulterer.

462
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,160
What are you talking about?

463
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,040
But

464
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,990
she didn't even get the paperwork done.

465
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,350
What is she doing here?

466
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,090
Yeah.

467
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,800
Maybe she's here to date with Mr. Zhou.

468
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,870
I made the breakfast for you.

469
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,300
I've eaten.

470
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,070
Thank you.

471
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,740
Eat more.

472
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,630
You're too thin.

473
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,630
You work too hard.

474
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,440
Just leave it there.

475
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,970
I'll eat it when I'm hungry.

476
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,350
I want to watch you eat.

477
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,840
As long as you marry Su Qing,

478
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,560
you'll be in charge of the resort project.

479
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,660
By the way,

480
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,140
I just came to work.

481
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,370
I'm not familiar with many businesses.

482
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,150
Can I go to your Legal Information Room

483
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,080
to study?

484
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,790
No.

485
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,950
Only the general manager and above

486
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,810
can enter here.

487
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,730
Your position is not high enough.

488
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,530
OK.

489
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,300
Wait.

490
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,670
Phone.

491
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,750
I have many numbers.

492
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,730
Let me think about your remark.

493
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,870
Little baby.

494
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,800
When they get off work, I'll steal Zhou Yu's card.

495
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,430
[Is that unborn baby really Mr. Zhou's?]

496
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,030
[Of course. Otherwise, why did a pregnant woman come to the cafe downstairs to find him?]

497
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,050
[Any news from Mr. Zhou? Have you seen the general manager's future wife?]

498
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,510
[Yes, I did]

499
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,170
[How is she? Is she pretty?]

500
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,500
[How's her belly? Is she going to give birth?]

501
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,540
[Why are you so quiet?]

502
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,860
[I saw another fiancée. The only daughter of Su’s Group. She is in the office now]

503
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,640
[Marriage between wealthy families vs pregnancy trap]

504
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,210
[She's in the office? I want to see her]

505
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,800
[Wait for me]

506
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,200
They want to see me?

507
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,990
Marriage between wealthy families.

508
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,310
Pregnancy trap.

509
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,690
Hi.

510
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,930
Who is the one pregnant?

511
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,610
Haven't Zhou Yu been in Africa before?

512
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,100
She came back with him?

513
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,750
I heard about it.

514
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,430
It should be fake.

515
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,430
It can't be groundless.

516
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,480
Zhou Yu acted like a jerk towards her.

517
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,160
Scumbag!

518
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,370
You are too cruel to me.

519
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,870
Is this Mr. Zhou?

520
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,580
Well,

521
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,070
he's wearing sunglasses.

522
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,590
Zhang Ming is the advertising director of Zhou's Group.

523
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,750
Our client is pregnant,

524
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,820
but he pretends to be single in the company.

525
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,330
The client wants to ruin his reputation

526
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,240
and let him be punished.

527
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,320
He goes to the cafe downstairs

528
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,610
with his colleagues on his lunch break every day.

529
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,260
This is a good place to ruin his reputation.

530
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,670
Zhang Ming.

531
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,820
It's you.

532
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,220
You have a nice face.

533
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm sorry.

534
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,030
I shouldn't have come here.

535
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,770
But our baby is due next month.

536
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,760
You got the wrong person.

537
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,980
Why are you pretending not to know me?

538
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,630
You're so cruel to me.

539
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,170
What's wrong with this man?

540
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,850
His girlfriend came here to find him.

541
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,130
Is he from our company?

542
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,350
So irresponsible.

543
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,660
Our baby is due next month.

544
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,460
What are you doing?

545
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,380
Let me see our baby.

546
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,580
Our baby

547
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,640
is cotton linen.

548
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,050
It's a fake stomach.

549
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,970
Liar.

550
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,210
I don't think this man is a good guy.

551
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,500
No.

552
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,400
He is our baby.

553
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,190
He's gone...

554
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,700
You pushed me last month, so it caused the miscarriage.

555
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,250
He's gone.

556
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,140
He's our baby.

557
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,310
My baby.

558
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,400
My baby.

559
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,770
What are you doing?

560
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,700
Call the police.

561
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,510
I'll help you find your husband.

562
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,430
Why are you still pretending not to know me?

563
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,190
Have you never loved me?

564
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,480
You are so cruel.

565
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,870
So cruel.

566
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,260
How could you do this to me?

567
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,870
You're so bad.

568
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,160
I'm sorry.

569
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,910
I mistook you for someone else.

570
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,580
Mr. Zhou.

571
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,080
Miss Su,

572
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,350
I'll go eat now.

573
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,170
You guys talk.

574
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,270
Don't move.

575
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,920
It's really him.

576
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,380
What's wrong?

577
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,220
Don't move.

578
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,520
Put on more lipstick.

579
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,920
Try not to be recognized.

580
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,830
What?

581
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,170
What do you want?

582
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,990
Nothing.

583
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,390
I'm going to have lunch.

584
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:00,990
Together?

585
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,360
What's wrong?
