00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,550
Go...

193
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,850
On...

194
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,290
And play.

195
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,470
What would you like?

196
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,470
One latte, please.

197
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,600
One iced Americano.

198
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,910
Are you going to pay together?

199
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,510
-Yes.
-No.

200
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,600
The farm.

201
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,040
Yes.

202
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay.

203
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,710
Scan this.

204
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,440
Evil capitalist.

205
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,150
Tingting.

206
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,570
Come here.

207
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,880
Let me tell you something.

208
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,740
What happened?

209
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,490
At the cafe,

210
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:35,960
I saw

211
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,930
Miss Su and Mr. Zhou having coffee.

212
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,430
Miss Su paid for it.

213
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,540
What?

214
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,160
Mr. Zhou spent Miss Su's money?

215
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,560
Of course.

216
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,030
It's probably

217
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,610
because Mr. Zhou came back from abroad.

218
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,630
He likes going Dutch.

219
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,490
Miss Su paid for the coffee today.

220
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,270
Maybe next time,

221
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,310
Mr. Zhou will pay.

222
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,210
Just a cup of coffee.

223
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,490
He's so stingy.

224
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,630
I think so too.

225
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,740
But

226
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,990
I'm just telling you what I saw.

227
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,950
You can't

228
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,830
tell others.

229
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,230
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,260
Who am I?

231
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,980
That's good.

232
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
You know what?

233
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,570
[Work Communication Group]

234
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,750
Mr. Zhou asked Miss Su to pay for the coffee.

235
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,350
You know what?

236
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,630
Mr. Zhou doesn't spend money when he's dating.

237
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,490
How do you know?

238
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,930
Tingting said it in the chat group.

239
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,060
How could it be fake?

240
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,200
I didn't realize

241
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,640
he was like that.

242
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,310
Say it again.

243
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,510
Mr. Zhou

244
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,940
likes women to spend money on him.

245
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,580
That's all about the sales

246
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,100
of Dream City last month.

247
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,710
Do you think it's enough as long as
your performance reaches the standard?

248
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,710
I don't have other projects now.

249
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,880
How many times have I told you?

250
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,650
I don't care what you do abroad.

251
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,830
But as for Su Qing,

252
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,560
not only did you not please her,

253
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
you even made her pay.

254
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,050
Did you do it on purpose?

255
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,490
Are you against me?

256
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,470
Are you trying to ruin this marriage?

257
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,530
Who said I wanted to break up with her?

258
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,250
The rumor has spread in the company

259
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,640
that

260
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,470
you're a stingy and petty man.

261
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,800
You didn't even pay for the coffee.

262
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,980
Hearing it made me blush.

263
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,240
I felt ashamed for you.

264
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,110
Listen.

265
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,620
Make her happy right now.

266
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,300
Otherwise, you know the consequences.

267
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,360
Don't let me hear these rumors again.

268
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,070
Okay.

269
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,810
I'll take care of it.

270
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,140
Many colleagues saw

271
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,570
what happened at the cafe.

272
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,510
Su Qing and Mr. Zhou

273
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,910
are at loggerheads now.

274
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,490
They're about to break up.

275
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,630
I knew

276
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,210
they can't get along well.

277
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,370
But it's hard to tell with

278
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,910
these young people's relationships.

279
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,090
Even if two people have a big quarrel today,

280
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,790
they'll behave

281
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,790
as if nothing happened the next day.

282
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:08,910
Well.

283
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,430
Keep following them.

284
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,670
If something happens,

285
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,130
report to me immediately.

286
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:13,869
Yes.

287
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,329
Without the Su Family’s support,

288
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,630
no matter how capable Zhou Yu is,

289
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,240
he won't make much progress.

290
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,890
This is the report of this month.

291
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,090
There is some latest information in it.

292
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:30,770
This one.

293
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,750
And...

294
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,470
What are you doing?

295
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,390
Does acting as a couple mean I should
endure your sexual harassment?

296
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,050
Don't move.

297
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,910
Someone is watching us.

298
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,530
Are we filming a spy movie?

299
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,260
You know the rumors

300
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,740
going around the company.

301
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,120
Be cooperative.

302
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,780
Make them think

303
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,400
we are a loving couple.

304
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,450
You have to pay for this separately.

305
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,350
You scared me.

306
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,230
What are you doing?

307
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,180
Why are you here?

308
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,910
This is

309
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,050
Mr. Zhou's office.

310
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,070
I'm his assistant.

311
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,640
If I'm not here,

312
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,570
where would I be?

313
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,550
As for you,

314
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,510
why aren't you at Vice President Sun's office?

315
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,440
Why are you here?

316
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,720
I...

317
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,330
It's because of the girls in our office.

318
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,230
When they heard the gossip,

319
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,760
they asked me to take a look.

320
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,880
These young people

321
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,410
are full of curiosity.

322
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,150
What about now?

323
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,210
Are you satisfied?

324
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,650
Yes.

325
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,100
You can't know

326
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,270
if a melon is sweet until you eat it.

327
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,510
Well...

328
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,550
This is the latest news.

329
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,000
I must share it with them right away.

330
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,930
I'm leaving now.

331
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,270
Mr. Zhou, you're right.

332
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,650
Sun Wei really sent someone here.

333
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,950
You guys talk.

334
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm leaving.

335
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,030
But will Jiang Lai always

336
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,830
cooperate with you?

337
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,300
Even if she doesn't cooperate,

338
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,340
she'll have to.

339
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
Even if you want to tell the world,

340
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
you don't have to do it so dramatically.

341
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,060
We've been together for so long.

342
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,800
-You haven't come to my mall yet.
-Hello, General Manager.

343
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,570
Take a look.

344
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,870
Today.

345
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,430
Hello, General Manager.

346
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,760
You'll inspect with me.

347
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,990
Hello, General Manager.

348
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,280
If Sun Wei takes the resort,

349
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
what about your farm?

350
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,010
Thank you, darling.

351
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
General Manager.

352
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,390
Here.

353
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,160
Take a look.

354
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,360
Which one do you like?

355
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,330
It's hard to choose.

356
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,380
I like them all.

357
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,590
You like them all?

358
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,230
Come here.

359
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,180
Pack

360
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,270
all these up for me.

361
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,720
Oh my god.

362
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,790
Baby, you're so nice.

363
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,460
They seem to make up again.

364
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,020
They look very close.

365
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,620
Keep following them.

366
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,970
Don't relax for a moment.

367
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,550
Okay.

368
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,860
Someone is behind.

369
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,820
What are you doing?

370
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,100
We're just acting.

371
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,180
Don't be reckless.

372
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,750
What?

373
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,350
Are you shy?

374
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,100
She's gone.

375
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,710
Xu Linlin

376
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,630
is so scary.

377
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,690
She's like a ghost.

378
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,880
What are you doing?

379
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,660
You're not the only one whose mouth hurts.

380
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,670
Take it. I'm fine.

381
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,950
Lai.

382
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,820
Are you free tomorrow night?

383
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,610
I want to ask you out for dinner.

384
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,400
Sure.

385
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,980
What's wrong?

386
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,700
Do you think I'm so pretty?

387
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,030
Just so so.

388
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,980
Just so so?

389
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,210
But you didn't even blink.

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,510
No more talking.

391
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,420
I'm going to work.

392
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,620
Let me give you a ride.

393
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,000
Aren't you going out for a meeting today?

394
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,600
I don't think it's on the way.

395
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,300
I need to go to the office first.

396
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,990
Let's go.

397
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,510
Mr. Zhou.

398
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,380
Here's the sales of the pop-up store this month.

399
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,040
It's better than we expected.

400
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,620
This is just a short-term data.

401
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,400
I heard that

402
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,050
many Internet celebrities

403
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,110
are willing to go to our pop-up store.

404
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,930
If it can be a trend,

405
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,520
the data will get better.

406
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,940
Keep up with the publicity.

407
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,450
Okay.

408
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,980
But I can take the data

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,810
to the meeting.

410
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,080
Why did you come to the company?

411
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,470
I'm on my way.

412
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,470
It's time for the meeting.

413
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,110
Let's go.

414
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,750
After we conducted
the project of the pop-up store,

415
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,910
the sales of Dream City

416
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,750
has greatly improved.

417
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,090
It is mainly reflected in the sales

418
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,360
of high luxury brands
and various clothing brands.

419
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,960
However,

420
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,250
we should proceed with the development

421
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,250
of other industries as well.

422
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,990
After our internal assessment,

423
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,280
[Note: The resort is built on the historical
and cultural experience of the Grand Canal.]

424
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,610
restaurants and theaters are the ones

425
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,290
that need to be further promoted.

426
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,770
I invited you here

427
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,640
to seek a win-win way of cooperation.

428
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,310
Mr. Zhou.

429
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,620
This is the most famous western restaurant
in this city.

430
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,230
Not only the chefs are

431
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,590
from France,

432
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,330
but

433
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,380
the ingredients are also transported
by air every day.

434
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
They're so fresh.

435
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,740
Most

436
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,750
importantly,

437
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,200
if you have dinner here,

438
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,570
you'll not only enjoy the fresh food,

439
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,420
but also make the night
become more romantic and Western-style.

440
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,560
Have you been there?

441
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,250
No.

442
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
I can't afford it.

443
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,890
Make a reservation.

444
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,450
Okay, Mr. Zhou.

445
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm at your service.

446
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,290
Contact Jiang Lai.

447
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,030
Ask her to send some documents.

448
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,000
The meeting is over.

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,080
What documents do you need?

450
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,610
It's none of your business.

451
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,150
Anything is fine.

452
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,670
Got it.

453
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,280
We need to act well.

454
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,350
There's no exception at other places,

455
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,010
right?

456
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,700
You can take some photos in the restaurant.

457
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,730
Mr. Zhou is really thoughtful.

458
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,440
Sir, can you hurry up?

459
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,410
I'm in a hurry.

460
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,640
I want to.

461
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,040
But the condition doesn't allow it.

462
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,830
Even if I want to drive at 180 mph,

463
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,100
when I meet such a condition,

464
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,360
I can only hold it back.

465
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,400
I have to work off the clock.

466
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,000
Ruthless Zhou.

467
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,270
[Lai, what would you like for dinner?]

468
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,480
[Let's choose the restaurant in V Hotel.]

469
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,480
[I'll make a reservation.]

470
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,760
He's also at V Hotel?

471
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,080
Forget it.

472
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,120
I won't be late.

473
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,130
The car is not moving at all.

474
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,840
Mr. Zhou.

475
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,490
The documents.

476
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,750
You're late.

477
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,310
The meeting is almost over.

478
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,890
It's too much traffic in the evening rush hour.

479
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,950
I've tried my best.

480
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,740
I'm leaving.

481
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,810
Wait.

482
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,750
What's going on?

483
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,440
Thank you for sending the documents.

484
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,910
Let's have dinner together tonight.

485
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,500
No.

486
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,550
I have an appointment with my friend tonight.

487
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,010
I'm leaving.

488
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,450
Bye.

489
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,800
Thank you.

490
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
You've become prettier.

491
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,420
You've become sweet-talking, Senior.

492
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,870
Thank you.

493
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,260
The steak of this restaurant is good.

494
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,300
I remember you liked the fried beef
in the canteen

495
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,460
when you were at school, didn't you?

496
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,060
You remembered.

497
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,830
The fried beef in the canteen
was really delicious.

498
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,350
Yes, I went back to eat it.

499
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,000
Let's order the steak.

500
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,570
Okay.

501
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,870
Wait.

502
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,130
This position is not right.

503
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,710
A little bit...

504
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,110
A little bit towards you.

505
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,490
More.

506
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,640
Go back a little.

507
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,280
In this direction.

508
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,770
A little bit.

509
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,030
Okay, more.

510
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,360
Okay, let me have a look.

511
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,080
Okay.

512
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,830
The height is just right.

513
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,670
It won't block.

514
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,420
Can you

515
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,320
dim the lights here?

516
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,690
We need to create some vibes.

517
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,520
Can you adjust them?

518
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,150
Okay.

519
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,370
As for the food,

520
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,010
you should prepare it
at the highest level of your restaurant.

521
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,820
Three servings.

522
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,420
One of them should be packed.

523
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,920
And give me the best wine.

524
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,330
Open two bottles first.

525
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,470
Okay, sir.

526
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,020
Well,

527
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
there should be nothing wrong here.

528
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:54,200
[What are you doing?
Are you with Zhou Yu?
How dare you ignore my message?]

529
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:54,200
[Chen Yiyi]

530
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,790
[I was in a meeting with Mr. Zhou.
My phone was muted.]

531
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,950
[Where are you now?
Tell me the address.]

532
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,160
[It's not appropriate.]

533
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,810
[I just want to know Zhou Yu's eating preferences.
I can't just go there.]

534
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:19,220
[Don't tell me you won't satisfy me
with this little request, Brother Chen Jun?]

535
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,860
Brother Chen Jun?

536
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,100
It's been a long time since I went to school.

537
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,550
I still remember

538
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,790
we used to go to the barbecue stall

539
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,850
at the school gate.

540
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,890
Let's go back

541
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,160
this Sunday.

542
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,760
Okay.

543
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,210
What's wrong?

544
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,870
Something is in my eyes.

545
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,720
Let me blow on it for you.

546
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,330
Are you feeling better?

547
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,120
Much better.

548
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
Thank you.

549
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,400
I need to use the bathroom.

550
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,970
Okay.

551
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,280
Mr. Zhou, why are you here alone?

552
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,060
She's busy. She's not coming.

553
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,560
Mr. Zhou.

554
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,040
Since

555
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,990
you're here,

556
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,560
don't be so serious.

557
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:32,960
Well,

558
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,300
the high-end food

559
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,850
should be enjoyed in a pleasant mood.

560
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,680
Though Jiang Lai doesn't come,

561
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm here with you.

562
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,490
Okay.

563
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:45,890
Zhou Yu.

564
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,330
I was in a hurry to leave the house.

565
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,720
The windows are still open.

566
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,840
Go back and take a look.

567
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,580
It'll be bad if the cat jumps out.

568
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:51,840
Okay.

569
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
I'll go back now.

570
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:58,840
Mr. Zhou.

571
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,880
You haven't eaten yet.

572
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,540
I won't eat.

573
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,040
Well...

574
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,480
Can I stay and eat?

575
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,720
It's useless for you to follow me.

576
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,980
Stay and have the meal.

577
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,290
Well.

578
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,400
Why don't you have some?

579
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,950
You mean

580
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,640
Zhou Yu was called away by Su Qing?

581
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,930
Probably.

582
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,090
Did he really fall in love with Su Qing?

583
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,040
Mr. Zhou did like Miss Su before.

584
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,420
But Miss Su is a fake.

585
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,450
I don't think Mr. Zhou still likes her now.

586
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,010
No.

587
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,640
Something is wrong.

588
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,790
He must have been deceived.

589
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,160
Tell me.

590
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,410
Who is prettier, me or Su Qing?

591
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,840
Of course you are.

592
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,280
Looks like you had a good meal

593
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,610
with your friend today.

594
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,750
You don't know how miserable my friend was.

595
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,679
Her fiance was so bad.

596
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,350
He was with her maid.

597
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,480
And he hit my friend with a car

598
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,010
to make her lose her memory.

599
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,760
And then?

600
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,230
Then...

601
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,469
Then,

602
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,300
my friend came back for revenge.

603
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,400
She sent her ex-husband and the maid to prison.

604
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,020
So she came to celebrate with me.

605
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,940
We had a drink.

606
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,080
Why didn't I know

607
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,880
Li Tingjiang had an ex-husband?

608
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,330
It's really delicious.

609
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,190
Yes.

610
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,889
At that time,

611
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,350
we couldn't afford these.

612
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,199
To our school.

613
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Okay.

614
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,430
Tell me.

615
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,750
Why did you eat with Li Tingjiang?

616
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
He's my senior.

617
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,670
Senior?

618
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,200
You two are more than

619
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,600
just a senior and a junior.

620
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,610
This is my personal matter.

621
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,510
We did sign the contract.

622
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,490
But I have the right to keep my social freedom.

623
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,370
Social freedom?

624
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,450
It's a critical time.

625
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,770
Your words and actions are affecting me.

626
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,400
If you think you did nothing wrong today,

627
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,840
why did you lie to me?

628
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,790
Fine.

629
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
I'm going back to school

630
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,630
with my senior this weekend.

631
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,430
I've reported to you in advance.

632
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,480
Jiang Lai.

633
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,000
What?

634
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,900
Do I have to report to you
even when I go to the toilet,

635
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,750
my fiance?
