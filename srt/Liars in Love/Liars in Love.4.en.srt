[Episode 4]

4
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,170
As long as you're willing to marry Su Qing,

5
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,980
the resort project will be yours.

6
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,580
From now on, we'll be family.

7
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,810
If you like it,

8
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,990
I'll give it to you as a wedding gift.

9
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,890
I want to tell you something important.

10
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,680
What's this?

11
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,150
Let's get married.

12
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,630
No.

13
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,060
No?

14
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,410
Why not?

15
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,380
Because I don't like you.

16
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,040
I've got the access card,

17
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,200
so I won't waste time playing with you.

18
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,050
You don't like me?

19
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,070
But you said you wanted to marry me.

20
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,480
It's in the past.

21
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,680
I've thought about it

22
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,810
and found out that you were not my type.

23
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,540
Which part of me is not your type?

24
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,110
Your eyes,

26

and mouth.

27
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,040
None of them are my type.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,710
I have something to do.

29
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,310
Let's stop talking.

30
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,840
Goodbye.

31
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,670
Wait.

32
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,560
Wait!

33
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,890
We won't see each other anymore.

34
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,520
Sir, Sir.

35
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,900
Sir,

36
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,190
you haven't paid the balance payment.

37
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,150
What balance payment?

38
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,790
Sir,

39
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,950
you failed to make a proposal,

40
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,310
and we feel sorry for you,

41
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,640
but you still need to pay

42
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,870
the balance payment

43
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,960
of the musicians, flowers

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,020
and lights.

45
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
What happened?

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
Who are you?

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,850
I was the one who ordered this proposal ceremony.

48
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,310
I just got here,

49
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:02,730
but...

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,910
you've scattered the flowers.

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,020
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,790
I'll pay for today's expenses.

53
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,990
Do you know how long

54
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,320
I've prepared for this?

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,420
It's okay, baby.

56
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,430
I'll marry you.

57
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,830
Really?

58
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,830
Zhou Yu, I'm sorry.

59
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,800
I know I shouldn't lie to you,

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
but I had no other choice.

61
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,010
Qing,

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,020
you left your fiancee there already?

63
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,280
My voice changer is nice, isn't it?

64
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,110
What happened?

65
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,430
Why did the car suddenly break down?

66
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,520
I have no idea.

67
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,900
I definitely checked it when I went out.

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,040
I've contacted the group,

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,270
and they'll send a premier car here right away.

70
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,940
Therefore,

71
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,760
I got the chance to get close to Zhou Mingde.

72
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,750
The car has arrived.

73
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,800
Chairman,

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
please get in.

75
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,230
When he got in the car,

76
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,790
Chairman, be careful.

77
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,050
I got his phone

78
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,510
and changed Su Qing's father's phone number to mine.

79
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,930
[Moon Shadow]

80
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,260
Chairman.

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Chairman,

82
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,340
is this your phone?

83
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,350
Thank you.

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
You're so clever.

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,390
So, did you trigger the alarm too?

86
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,570
I wouldn't dare.

87
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,800
That was just an accident.

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,420
Fortunately, it was just a near miss.

89
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,140
It was more than that.

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,400
Look what this is.

91
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,470
What is this?

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,990
Zhou Mingde’s access card.

93
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,350
Really?

94
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,590
You're impressive.

95
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,850
Stop it. Let's go.

96
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,010
Enough talk,

97
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,670
let's go to Zhou's Group directly.

98
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,590
When we get the contract, I'll be able to find my dad.

99
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,470
No problem.

100
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
I've been worried about you,

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
but it turns out you're impressive.

102
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,190
It seems that Zhou Yu

103
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,920
is totally under your control.

104
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,070
Su Qing is the one who he really wants to marry,

105
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,930
instead of me.

106
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,590
It was fine to deal with one person.

107
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,400
If there were many people, I would've had an heart attack.

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,940
Let's go now!

109
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,820
What are you waiting for?

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,170
Okay.

111
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,600
Stealing a phone is illegal,

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,610
so how do you plan to solve that?

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,880
I forgot everything because I was too anxious.

114
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,260
How could you forget that?

115
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,620
I just didn't realize it.

116
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,159
I'll change the name back tomorrow.

117
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,810
When this is over,

118
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,880
I'll turn myself in to the police

119
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,490
and try to seek leniency.

120
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,580
I've thought about it

121
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,560
and found out that you were not my type.

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
Your eyes,

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,910
nose

124
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,820
and mouth.

125
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,310
None of them are my type.

126
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,090
Without the Su family's support,

127
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,580
I can also get the resort project.

128
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,030
Chen Jun,

129
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,120
where is the resort project's contract?

130
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,710
It should be in the information room.

131
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,810
What's wrong, Mr. Zhou?

132
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,340
Why are you working so late?

133
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,790
I was too angry to go to sleep because of someone.

134
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,790
Okay, I got it.

135
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,360
Go ahead.

136
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,030
The contract is in the Legal Information Room on the 17th floor.

137
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,730
Keep an eye on it

138
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,860
and wait for me here.

139
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,630
Don't you trust me on this?

140
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,990
Who would come here at this hour?

141
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,990
I can play a mobile game

142
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,850
and wait for her to come and have barbecue together.

143
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,580
No one can stop me now.

144
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,210
That was so close.

145
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,340
I almost got caught.

146
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,620
What did you say?

147
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,150
Zhou Yu came to the company.

148
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,680
Let me handle it.

149
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,070
Okay.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,380
I can't go straight to the 17th floor.

151
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,410
Who would be here

152
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,140
at this hour?

153
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,900
The 23rd floor.

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,170
Isn't the 23rd floor under repair?

155
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,990
It seems Zhou Yu is coming to your floor.

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,720
He's so troublesome.

157
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,270
I'll go down by stairs.

158
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,350
Okay.

159
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,230
I'll stall him.

160
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,000
I made a mistake.

161
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,790
Stop!

162
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,570
Stop!

163
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,400
Who are you?

164
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,660
What are you doing here?

165
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,320
What are you doing here?

166
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,600
Re-Repair

167
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,470
the lights.

168
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,520
Don't be sneaky for no reason.

169
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,560
I didn't.

170
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Got it.

171
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,020
Why is it empty?

172
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,770
I got caught.

173
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,460
He's coming. Get out of there!

174
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,050
Stop.

175
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,430
Su Qing?

176
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,110
What a coincidence.

177
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,240
Why are you here too?

178
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,300
I should be asking you that, right?

179
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,820
Is he holding the contract I'm looking for?

180
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,240
Why are you here?

181
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm looking for my earrings.

182
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,030
They're missing, you know?

183
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,790
Earrings?

184
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,970
Are you really here for the earrings?

185
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,750
What else?

186
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,410
They're my favorite.

187
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,360
If I can't find them, I can't sleep.

188
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,270
By the way,

189
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,390
had you seen my earrings

190
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,910
before I went to the restaurant?

191
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,480
Do you think I would notice if you were wearing earrings or not?

192
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,270
Of course.

193
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,590
If you loved me, you would noticed that.

194
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,870
I guess you don't love that much.

195
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,520
Of course.

196
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,320
You're making me sad.

197
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,190
You're so funny.

198
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,200
You just rejected my proposal,

199
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,520
and now you're complaining that I don't love you.

200
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,050
I didn't expect myself to eat my words so soon.

201
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,390
This floor is for Design Department

202
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,990
and Legal Information Room.

203
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,880
Did you came here today?

204
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,750
No wonder I couldn't find the office.

205
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,030
I'm night-blind,

206
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,760
so I can't see clearly at night.

207
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,150
What are you here for?

208
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,690
None of your business.

209
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,670
It's too dark.

210
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,450
Wait for me.

211
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,610
I'll go upstairs with you to look for them.

212
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,070
They must be in the office.

213
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Oh, so it's on the 19th floor, right?

214
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,350
I forgot it.

215
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,800
What if I can't find them?

216
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,750
You can always buy new ones to replace the old ones.

217
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,140
What?

218
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,670
As my fiancee,

219
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,600
aren't you supposed to comfort me?

220
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,970
Fiancee?

221
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,240
You've rejected my proposal, haven't you?

222
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,690
But I'm willing to marry you now,

223
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,710
very much.

224
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,430
I'm not willing.

225
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,670
Cheapskate.

226
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,990
Wait for me.

227
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,610
I couldn't find them outside.

228
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,150
Is it possible that I left them in your office?

229
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,310
You didn't come to my office today.

230
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,550
Really?

231
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,280
Why are you still working at this hour?

232
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
If you can't find them, just go home.

233
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,550
After all, I just rejected him,

234
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,610
so he must be angry.

235
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,920
I need to be patient.

236
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,600
Okay.

237
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,020
Then, I'll leave you alone.

238
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,350
If I had known the contract was not in the legal information room,

239
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,950
I wouldn't have been so arrogant to reject him.

240
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,390
It's almost 12 a.m.

241
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,860
[File Pocket]

242
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,280
It's hard to get a taxi this late.

243
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
Do you need a ride?

244
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:38,910
No, thank you.

245
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,470
Are you sure you don't need it?

246
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,470
No need, I've...

247
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:41,870
Okay.

248
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,330
Well...

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,350
It's unlucky for anyone to marry you,

250
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,240
nerd.

251
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,930
Let's go.

252
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,670
Let's have a midnight snack.

253
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,130
What would you like to eat?

254
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,349
Roasted goose.

255
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,030
Relax your body and mind

256
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,390
and get rid of distractions.

257
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,290
I am

258
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,060
Zhou Yu's girlfriend.

259
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,510
Let's get married.

260
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,810
No.

261
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,740
Why not?

262
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,790
Because I don't like you.

263
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,150
I'm willing to marry you now,

264
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,390
very much.

265
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,770
It's hard to get a taxi this late.

266
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,770
Do you need a ride?

267
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,670
No, thank you.

268
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,660
I saw it in the real-time video that it was listless.

269
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,960
Why is it so lively now?

270
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,470
It's kind of needy.

271
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,700
It gets upset when no one is around,

272
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,270
so we'd better find it an adopter.

273
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,510
Mr. Zhou,

274
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,720
are you sure

275
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,580
you want the adopter to fill in all the information?

276
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,150
What's wrong?

277
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,190
Including the adopter's university,

278
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,670
high school,

279
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,840
middle school

280
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,180
and primary school?

281
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,350
From the adopter's education background,

282
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,610
we can figure out his family education and background

283
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,930
as well as his personal quality.

284
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,400
What about this?

285
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,740
A adopter must own a place of residence bought by himself

286
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,820
with an area of over 150 square meters.

287
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,830
Relocation will cause stress for the cat.

288
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,200
Besides, it can't go out.

289
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,190
If that's the case,

290
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,470
we have to ensure that the space is big enough for it to exercise.

291
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,730
Then, what about this?

292
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,370
The adopter must run 100 meters in 12 seconds,

293
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,600
and the eyesight must be over 5.0.

294
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,430
With fast speed and clear eyesight,

295
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,950
the adopter can detect the cat's movement immediately,

296
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,420
and if there's an emergency, the adopter can also react quickly.

297
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,480
Is there a problem?

298
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,230
The requirement is more difficult than that of the chairman's special assistant.

299
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,360
So what?

300
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,890
Do you mean my cat doesn't deserve it?

301
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,460
Of course it deserves it.

302
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,250
Then I'll abide by your standard.

303
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,380
I'll make sure the adopter meets all your requirements.

304
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,590
Chen Jun,

305
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,830
I've realized that you've always been

306
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,760
a thoughtful, professional and passionate person.

307
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm flattered.

308
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,210
It's my honor to assist you, Mr. Zhou.

309
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,180
You'll be the cat's adopter.

310
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,670
No, no, no.

311
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,700
I don't deserve it.

312
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,080
My house is very small,

313
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,210
and it's rented.

314
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,630
I run very slowly.

315
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,290
Most importantly, I have poor eyesight,

316
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,220
so I wear contact lenses every day.

317
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,410
You really don't deserve it.

318
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,530
No, not at all.

319
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,810
However,

320
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,790
I think

321
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,070
you can actually ask one of your friends who likes cats to be the adopter.

322
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,620
In this way, you not only know this person well

323
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,860
but also can play with the cat every now and then.

324
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,320
Isn't that killing two birds with one stone?

325
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,620
Oh, it occurs to me

326
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,750
that you don't actually have friends.

327
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,390
Does Su Qing like cats?

328
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,350
That's right!

329
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,670
If you give the cat to Miss Su,

330
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,270
you'll be able to

331
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,830
send a cat climbing frame one day

332
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,360
and cat canned food on another day, right?

333
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,160
If it continues, eventually...

334
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,130
That's enough.

335
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,670
She...

336
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,540
I've clearly rejected her.

337
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,490
Stop thinking about it.

338
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,310
Mr. Zhou,

339
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,070
Miss Su is a beautiful girl

340
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,270
from a rich family,

341
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,690
and she likes you so much.

342
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,650
So stop putting on airs.

343
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,670
Does she like me?

344
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,790
Of course.

345
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,000
Otherwise, why would she work as a secretary here?

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
What else could she want?

347
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,780
She is the only heir of Su's Group.

348
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,430
Even you are not the only heir of Zhou's Group.

349
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,140
Chen Jun,

350
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,360
let me ask you a question.

351
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,350
I...

352
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,370
My friend...

353
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,910
It's really about my friend.

354
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,560
Okay,

355
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,350
you suddenly have a friend.

356
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,900
My friend

357
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,160
was suddenly kissed by a girl,

358
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,410
but the girl rejected him after he confessed his feelings for her.

359
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,160
A while later, she flirted with him again,

360
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,750
and he said he wanted to send her home at night

361
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,080
but was rejected again.

362
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,660
Why?

363
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,400
Mr. Zhou,

364
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,870
you've been controlled by Miss Su so...

365
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,640
I told you.

366
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,540
It was about my friend.

367
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,630
Fine, I'm sorry.

368
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,230
That was a slip of the tongue.

369
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,060
I think this girl

370
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,290
was playing hard to get.

371
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,640
Playing hard to get?

372
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,430
Yes.

373
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,570
Do you always think about her,

374
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,450
why she kissed you,

375
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,340
and why she rejected you?

376
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,840
Exactly.

377
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,920
She's trying to tantalize you.

378
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,270
Then what should I do?

379
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,030
You're asking the right person.

380
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
In a relationship,

381
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,430
pushing and pulling are very important.

382
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,190
With continuous pushing and pulling,

383
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,000
one will fall deeper and deeper in love.

384
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,950
This is people's vulnerability when they're in love.

385
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,590
We just need to find the vulnerability

386
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,240
and

387
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,500
target it.

388
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,970
Pushing and pulling?

389
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,990
Yes.

390
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,150
Zhou Yu is angry now.

391
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,140
What should I do?

392
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,070
Sun Wei is in charge of the resort project now,

393
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,490
so she might have the contract.

394
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,630
Why isn't it here?

395
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,700
Hello, Ms. Sun.

396
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,750
You've taken the photo of Liu Li, right?

397
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,550
No hurry.

398
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,060
Send it out on the 20th May

399
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,780
as a surprising gift for Zhou Yu.

400
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,190
Liu Li?

401
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,950
Why is this name so familiar?

402
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,830
Thank you.

403
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,090
You're welcome.

404
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,330
Liu Li?

405
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,900
The 20th May?

406
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,350
What exactly is Sun Wei up to?

407
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,750
Tingting.

408
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,670
Miss Su.

409
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,270
Tingting, try this.

410
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,950
Thank you.

411
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,670
By the way, Tingting,

412
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,240
do you know

413
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,590
what happened between Zhou Yu and Sun Wei?

414
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,720
I swear I never told anyone.

415
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,000
Don't be nervous.

416
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,860
That's not what I meant.

417
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,830
I was just curious.

418
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,570
Just asking.

419
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,270
They don't seem to get along well so far.

420
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,070
As soon as Mr. Zhou came back,

421
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,130
he made a bet with Vice President Sun.

422
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,040
A bet?

423
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,950
What bet?

424
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,830
Didn't Mr. Zhou tell you?

425
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,630
Well, I just came back,

426
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,420
and Zhou Yu didn't want me to worry about him,

427
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,820
so there are many things he haven't told me.

428
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,000
So, what was the bet?

429
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,950
Mr. Zhou made a bet with Vice President Sun

430
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,430
that he would increase

431
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,290
Dream City's turnover by 30%

432
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,680
in 3 month.

433
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,570
Otherwise, he will resign.

434
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,910
30%?

435
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,150
You also think it's impossible,

436
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,670
right?

437
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,550
Then why would Zhou Yu make this bet?

438
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,790
Mr. Zhou wanted to be in charge of the resort project.

439
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,630
This project

440
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,110
is our group's most important project

441
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,240
in the next 10 years.

442
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,850
Vice President Sun has been managing the project,

443
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,090
but Mr. Zhou was very interested in it

444
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,870
and even asked us to collect information for him.

445
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,980
Tingting,

446
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,620
do you know Zhou Yu's plan for the 20th May?

447
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,570
Are you going on a date with him?

448
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,030
But I don't think he'll have time.

449
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,830
Our department store will hold an event on that day.

450
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,630
What event?

451
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,910
Recently,

452
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,200
we contacted a very famous artist

453
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,280
called Liu Li

454
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,720
and asked him to set a photo spot in Dream City

455
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,210
to attract customers.

456
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,930
Liu Li?

457
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,450
It's not simply about pushing and pulling.

458
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,340
Most importantly, you must pull while pushing,

459
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,000
and vise versa.

460
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,400
Do you understand?

461
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,470
Pushing while pulling,

462
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,700
and vise versa?

463
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,970
Yes.

464
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,830
Miss Su!

465
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,260
I'll let you talk with each other.

466
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,140
What's the matter?

467
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,080
I know what I said yesterday

468
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,310
was kind of too harsh.

469
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,620
Therefore, I'll tell you a secret

470
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,860
as an apology.

471
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,470
I like you.

472
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,050
The secret is

473
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,090
that Liu Li can't be the curator of the event on the 20th May.

474
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,780
Why not?

475
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,240
I heard that he had dirty secrets.

476
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,730
Do you have evidence?

477
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,830
Well, I can't say

478
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,260
I heard it when I was stealing the file from Sun Wei's office, right?

479
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,990
No evidence.

480
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,230
Close the door when you leave.

481
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,590
You'll see.

482
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,990
I will find the evidence.

483
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,210
Ask someone to investigate Liu Li.

484
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,690
Liu Li

485
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,880
is complicated.

486
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,460
He's not just a common scumbag.

487
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,840
There was a post saying that he drugged others,

488
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,950
but it disappeared very soon.

489
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
I sneaked into their group chat,

490
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,510
and the chat history

491
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,070
was so nasty.

492
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,230
The art of hitting on girls.

493
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,450
The secret of flirting with girls.

494
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,310
Moreover, they also traded drugs privately.

495
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,520
I used another account

496
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,780
to add Liu Li's WeChat.

497
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,970
You can check the end of the chat history.

498
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,870
The evidence is solid.

499
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,330
If you show this to Zhou Yu,

500
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,840
he will be convinced.

501
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,570
No,

502
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,900
I can't show it to him.

503
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,800
I’m Su Qing,

504
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,670
not Jiang Lai.

505
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,480
How could I get the information?

506
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,740
Then what should we do?

507
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,510
Ask Liu Li out for me.

508
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,080
Pushing and pulling?

509
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,550
I'll wait for you at Mio Bar on Wutong West Road.

510
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,340
Now, you're Lily,

511
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,180
a 20-year-old

512
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,160
college student.

513
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,190
I asked Liu Li out with this identity.

514
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,910
From his perspective, you are like sheep to the slaughter.

515
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,220
Are you Lily?

516
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,200
Mr. Liu.

517
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,240
Come here.

518
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:21,810
Have a seat.

519
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,740
So nasty.

520
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,370
Well,

521
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,800
I ordered their specialty for you in advance.

522
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,960
Come on, cheers.

523
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,150
Mr. Liu,

524
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,830
I'm allergic to alcohol.

525
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,630
I can't drink.

526
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,410
It's okay.

527
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,150
I ordered a Coke too.

528
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,850
Here you are.

529
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:37,920
Fill it.

530
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,310
Have some Coke.

531
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,370
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

532
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,250
Mr. Liu sounds like a stranger to you.

533
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,740
Call me Li.

534
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,220
But I'm shy.

535
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,420
I want to hear it.

536
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,020
Pervert!

537
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,450
Li.

538
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,830
That's more like it.

539
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,310
Your hair smells so good.

540
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,770
What shampoo did you use?

541
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,480
And it also feels smooth.

542
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,470
Mr. Liu,

543
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,410
I like your works so much.

544
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,830
I'm so happy to finally meet you in person today.

545
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,510
Do you only like my works?

546
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,580
What about me?

547
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,590
Cheers.

548
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,370
Okay.

549
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,820
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,790
Are you okay?

551
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,590
-Do you need to go to the bathroom to clean it up?
-It’s okay.

552
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,990
Fine,

553
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,040
I'll clean it up.

554
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,010
I'm so sorry.

555
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:15,970
Where is he?

556
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,080
Who did this?

557
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,180
Who?

558
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,310
Where have you been?

559
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,730
I can't stand Liu Li anymore.

560
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,970
Liu Li is a pervert.

561
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,160
Did you ask me out just for this?

562
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,180
It was consensual,

563
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,650
so it can't prove that he has a problem.

564
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,690
The Coke he gave me

565
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,050
must have been drugged.

566
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,380
What are you doing?

567
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,440
You can't drink it.

568
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,460
You can't drink things given by strangers.

569
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,860
Boys need to protect themselves too.

570
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,360
He would break the law if he did it.

571
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,690
And given his position,

572
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,450
why would he do this?

573
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,889
A pervert will always be a pervert,

574
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,320
no matter what his position is

575
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,739
or whether he's rich or not.

576
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,870
If you don't believe it, just drink it.

577
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,260
For real?

578
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,219
It's impossible.

579
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,400
Look at me.

580
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,469
What are you doing?

581
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
Do you feel dizzy?

582
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,150
No.

583
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,400
What about your hand?

584
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,600
Do you have strength?

585
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,740
You tell me.

586
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,020
Enough,

587
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,660
I'm leaving.

588
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,200
Wait.

589
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,590
Sit back,

590
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,670
and I'll try again.

591
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Go, go, go.

592
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,900
I'm really sorry.

593
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,450
It's okay.

594
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,510
I've cleaned it up.

595
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,380
You look so cute when you're nervous.

596
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,740
Have you ever been a model?

597
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,090
Model?

598
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,310
No.

599
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,500
Do you want to be my model?

600
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,370
You'll become my artwork.

601
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,650
Can I?

602
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:01,860
Of course.

603
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,380
Of course you can.

604
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,420
Cheers to our artwork.

605
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,540
Did he put drug into this?

606
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,540
Let's go.

607
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,860
Get in the car.

608
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,220
What's wrong?

609
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,060
Are you okay?

610
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,200
Come on.

611
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,510
You haven't been to the gallery at night, have you?

612
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,710
We'll be there alone.

613
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,600
Why isn't Zhou Yu here yet?
