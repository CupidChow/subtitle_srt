Kaiwen.

6
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,700
How did they find him so soon?

7
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,789
You

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,570
know this man, right?

9
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,150
He's the director of a beauty center.
I often go there.

10
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,280
Mrs. Wang and I invested a little in it.

11
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,979
We need to go there a lot.

12
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,240
It's more convenient.

13
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,120
What did he do?

14
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,610
Did he upset you?

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,730
How dare you hide it?

16
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,060
He wrote the report letter.

17
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,720
It has something to do with you.

18
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,440
It's okay

19
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,470
to play dirty sometimes

20
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,730
to win against Zhou Yu.

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,070
But you dared to

22
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,820
harm the company's interests.

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,440
You reported Huang Yonghua.

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,680
Do you know

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,590
how much economic loss
it brought to the company?

26
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,980
The company's reputation was damaged.

27
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,910
All projects came to a standstill.

28
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,340
What were you thinking?

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,020
It was done by my subordinates.

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,680
Mingde.

31
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,590
Mingde, trust me.

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,790
I really don’t know.

33
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,150
We've been together for so many years.

34
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,250
Trust me.

35
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,430
Your subordinates did it?

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,060
Yes.

37
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,410
Did they know Huang Yonghua?

38
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,580
Did they know?

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,340
The cooked books issue

40
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,540
will be exposed soon.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,820
You

42
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,829
go to jail instead of Huang Yonghua.

43
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,530
Mingde.

44
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,300
Mingde, I'm begging you.

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,100
I was wrong.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm begging you.

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,500
Please give me another chance.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,800
I've done so many things for you.

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,010
Have you forgotten?

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,060
The car accident.

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,920
Do you remember the car accident?

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,680

53
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,800
Mingde, the car accident...

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,730
What did you say?

55
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,870
Are you threatening me?

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,680
Fine.

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,410
From now on,

58
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,990
don't get involved in the company matters.

59
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,300
Go home.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,050
Mingde.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,720
Chairman.

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,990
Next, we're going to...

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,829
Cancel it for me.

64
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm going somewhere by myself.

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
No need to follow.

66
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,200
You're here too?

67
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,170
How did you know about this place?

68
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,890
This place overlooks the entire resort.

69
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,890
It's a good place.

70
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,000
After I came back from abroad,

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I often come here.

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,020
I chose to go to Africa back then.

73
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,130
Because I liked

74
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,950
turning a barren land

75
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,730
into an oasis with my efforts.

76
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,530
That's why

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,710
you wanted to keep that farm.

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,970
Such a good farm.

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,700
It's a pity to destroy it.

80
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,770
It seems you already have an idea.

81
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,630
I've already had my idea

82
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,440
at the beginning of the bet.

83
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,630
This land

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,150
is not suitable for commercial development.

85
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,470
It should be

86
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,470
developed into a green eco-resort cluster.

87
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,200
It's a long-term development.

88
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,470
I proposed to your grandpa

89
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,220
to develop this land back then.

90
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,680
Unfortunately,

91
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,880
my words carried little weight

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,530
in the Zhang family at that time.

93
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,930
They didn't listen to me.

94
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,909
You're the chairman of Zhou's Group now.

95
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,130
You can do

96
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,700
what you want to do.

97
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,280
You haven't come home for dinner
for a long time.

98
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
This weekend,

99
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,570
come home for dinner

100
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,900

101
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,950
The resort project needs to move forward.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,320
Yu, you're here.

103
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,110
Auntie.

104
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,390
Come in.

105
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,560
You've been exposed.

106
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,420
Surrender now.

107
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,600
Cheng.

108
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,909
Stop fooling around.

109
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,930
Say hello.

110
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,690
Miss Su, this is my son, Chengzhen.

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
He's so naughty.

112
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,190
He was spoiled by his dad.

113
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,060
Don't mind him.

114
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,840
It's okay.

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,659
What's wrong with you?

116
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,460
Dad.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,900
Look.

118
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,700
I caught the spy.

119
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,380
It's her.

120
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,770
You are naughty.

121
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,230
Hurry.

122
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,160
Call her Sister.

123
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,760
Hello, Uncle Zhou.

124
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,730
Hello.

125
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm Su Qing.

126
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,070
You don't look good.

127
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,960
What are you talking about?

128
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,630
Don't stand here.

129
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,250
Come in.

130
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,980
I'll take you in.

131
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,900
Snapdragon Farm.

132
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,270
What is this place?

133
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't know what you like,

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,330
so I prepared some more dishes.

135
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,100
Eat more.

136
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,880
Thank you.

137
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,830
It's quite a feast.

138
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,159
Here.

139
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,390
Welcome to our home.

140
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,440
Welcome.

141
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,390
Thank you.

142
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,760
Yu.

143
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,980
I remember you loved

144
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,250
Kung Pao chicken when you were little.

145
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,230
So I asked the maid to make it for you.

146
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,270
Come on, try it.

147
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,460
Try this.

148
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,880
Slipped.

149
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,370
How's the taste?

150
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,770
Good.

151
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,920
How is it?

152
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,790
Delicious.

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Thank you.

154
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:34,610
Zhou Chengzhen!

155
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,870
Your cockroach again.

156
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,200
What's wrong with you?

157
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,770
How many times have I told you?

158
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,000
It wasn't me.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
Don't throw this thing.

160
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,730
Stop making excuses.

161
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,270
Why are you so disobedient?

162
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,630
It wasn't me.

163
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,110
Forget it.

164
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,710
He's still young.

165
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,640
Don't mind him.

166
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,720
It's okay.

167
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,530
You're too naughty.

168
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,630
You never listen to me.

169
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,270
Right?

170
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,230
It wasn't me.

171
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,540
Still making excuses.

172
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,850
Enough.

173
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,220
Liu.

174
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,630
Take him to eat in another room.

175
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,530
Okay.

176
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,010
I don't want to eat in another room.

177
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,830
Be good.

178
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,450
Chengzhen.

179
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,130
Go.

180
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,300
This kid.

181
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,830
Sorry.

182
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,550
It's embarrassing.

183
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,370
It's okay.

184
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,890
The tofu is good.

185
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
Eat more.

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,500
Yu.

187
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,550
You've been together for so long.

188
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,550
Do you have any plans for the future?

189
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,020
We get along well.

190
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,840
We plan to take our time.

191
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,780
Right, Zhou Yu?

192
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,300
Yes.

193
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,480
Su Qing and I have our own plans.

194
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,380
We want to follow our own pace.

195
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,620
I hope you can get married soon.

Qing, what do you think?

199
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,740
Marriage is a big deal.

200
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,010
We have to listen to my dad's opinion.

201
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,680
Before you came,

202
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,610
I've already called your dad.

203

But

204
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,790
I couldn't get through.

205
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,560
I guess

206
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,070
he will get back to me soon.

207
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,540

Something happened to grandpa.

212
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,870
Okay, I'll be right there.

213
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,370
Wait.

214
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,990
I'll go with you.

What's the situation now?

221
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,540
He fell while walking.

222
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
For now, he has passed the critical stage.

223
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,800
But considering his age,

224
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,400
you should still be fully prepared.

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,870

What’s wrong?

309
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,080
Does Qing have any concerns？

310
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,320
No.

311
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,320
I think it's better

312
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,200
if I talk to my parents about this.

313
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,960
Okay.

314
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,990
Hurry up.

389
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,320
It's really Chen Yiyi.

390
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,820
Where are you going?

391
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,900
We're going to see Chen Yiyi.

392
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,630
I haven't seen a superstar yet.

393
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,020
The superstar Chen Yiyi is here.

394
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,820
Weren't you close to her before?

395
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,270
Why?

396
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,030
Aren't you going to take a look?

397
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,100
Not familiar.

398
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,830
I was just working with her.

399
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:32,300
[I found a new restaurant. Let's go together. I'll pick you up]

400
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:32,300
[What are you doing? When are you getting off work? Let's eat dinner together. I'm free today]

401
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,420
[No]

402
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,580
I got one.

403
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,510
Me too.

404
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,690
Thank you.

405
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,020
Thank you.

406
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,010
Thank you.

407
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,710
Thank you.

408
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,710
This way, please.

409
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,860
Why do you close the door?

410
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,920
Someone will come.

411
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,700
Yiyi, you have work to do this afternoon.

412
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,830
We really should go.

413
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,920
Wait a little longer.

414
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,710
I've made a big move.

415
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,140
He will definitely come.

416
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,350
The person you're waiting for

417
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,140
won't come.

418
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,220
I knew

419
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,020
he would come.

420
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,650
I thought you would never see me again.

421
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,970
You blocked my WeChat and Alipay.

422
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,810
I can only come here to see you.

423
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,940
I have an audition this afternoon.

424
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,980
Practice with me.

425
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,040
If you do well,

426
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,100
I'll unblock you.

427
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,800
Okay.

428
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,820
Fine.

429
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,000
You're back.

430
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,020
Yes.

431
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,620
You've changed a lot.

432
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,710
T-This is not in the script.

433
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,140
A good actor needs to improvise.

434
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,070
Focus.

435
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,850
Say it.

436
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,180
You're doing well without me.

437
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,130
I'm not.

438
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,210
Do you know

439
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,090
how I get it through without you?

440
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,050
Chen Jun.

441
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,490
I like you.

442
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,020
Sun Wei has scheduled
the wedding dress fitting

443
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,150
and wedding photos.

444
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,540
Why the rush to try on the wedding dress?

445
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,660
Trying on the wedding dress?

446
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,320
-Choose what you like.
-Lai is getting married.

447
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,110
Lai.

448
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,720
You're on the phone.

449
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,140
With whom?

450
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,610
No one.

451
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,690
Who are you talking to?

452
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,660
My dad.

453
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,870
He suddenly came back.

454
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,180
I'll talk to you later.

455
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,050
See you tomorrow.

456
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,770
Why did you come in without knocking?

457
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,510
Well...

458
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,420
Why are you still here?

459
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,460
Well.

460
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,780
Lai.

461
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,110
I heard you’re getting married.

462
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,180
It's none of your business.

463
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,670
Lai,

464
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,590
come out with me.

465
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,900
Let me show you something.

466
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,390
Come on.

467
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,380
Hurry up.

468
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,870
You rented a car?

469
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,480
What are you talking about?

470
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm so vain

471
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,950
in your eyes?

472
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,670
Come on.

473
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,340
Take a look.

474
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,510
I know

475
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,110
I owe you

476
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,470
so much all these years.

477
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,830
These are birthday gifts

478
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,230
I owe you for these years.

479
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
This bear

480
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,080
is the gift you wanted when you were five.

481
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,580
And this princess crystal ball.

482
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,960
You wanted it when you were six.

483
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,640
I couldn't buy it for you.

484
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,760
Look how beautiful it is.

485
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,850
I know

486
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,610
you can't forgive me

487
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,640
in a short time.

488
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,700
But it's okay.

489
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,180
We still have time.

490
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,220
I'll always be with you.

491
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,860
I'm not

492
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,310
going anywhere then.

493
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,060
And this

494
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,660
is a present for your 25th birthday.

495
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,220
Although my taste is not good,

496
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,740
you will look very beautiful

497
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,510
in this white dress.

498
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,630
I owe you too much.

499
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,760
I only hope you can find someone
who truly loves you.

500
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,300
He will protect you forever,

501
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,430
and never leave you.

502
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,750
No need.

503
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,020
Some things have been missed.

504
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,350
And there's no point in having them again.

505
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,480
Dad.

506
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,710
I've picked all the peaches on that tree.

507
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,620
Look.

508
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,960
It's rotten again.

509
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,010
Aren't you tricking me?

510
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,330
The orchard is full of rotten peaches.

511
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,730
Is there something wrong with the species?

512
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,990
I need to support my family.

513
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,740
What is your solution?

514
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,870
My child needs to go to school.

515
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,590
This won't work.

516
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,790
Lai.

517
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,130
Lai.

518
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,610
You are here.

519
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,090
I've been looking for you.

520
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,380
Back then, Aunt and I

521
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,000
ended up eating all those rotten peaches.

522
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,940
Lai,

523
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,920
I’ve been struggling to start businesses

524
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
for so many years.

525
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,220
Isn't it all for you to have a better life?

526
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,100
Don't blame me.

527
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,620
You have been
trying to start businesses everywhere

528
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,900
and owed a lot of debts.

529
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,460
You even rented out the Snapdragon Farm.

530
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,650
I'm really sorry.

531
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,240
But I've done so many wrong things

532
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,520
to

533
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,570
earn more money for your dowry.

534
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,300
Then your wedding

535
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,610
can be grand.

536
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,900
So you won’t be bullied

537
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,190
or looked down upon.

538
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,660
I didn't expect

539
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,980
that I'm not the first one

540
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,310
to know the news of my daughter's wedding.

541
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,250
I know

542
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,120
I don't have the right to take care of this.

543
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,830
I don’t even have the right to
be involved in your marriage.

544
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,350
I just want to
see my daughter’s wedding in person.

545
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,210
That's enough.

546
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,170
Can you promise me this?

547
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,610
Don’t you think it’s too late to say this?

548
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,990
It is late.

549
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,790
But I want to make it up to you.

550
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,580
Lai,

551
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,170
give me one last chance.

552
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,170
After all,

553
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,640
I’m still your dad.

554
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,450
Lai,

555
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,250
I feel my health is not as good as before

556
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,850
after coming back this time.

557
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,580
I wanted to

558
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,100
see my daughter

559
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,260
get married.

560
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,700
Don't end up like her father.

561
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,540
Now I'm...

562
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,510
What's going on with your health?

563
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,270
I'm old.

564
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,350
Various illnesses start to appear.

565
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,160
I'll let you know
when the wedding date is set.

566
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,050
Although my taste is not good,

567
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,580
you will look very beautiful

568
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,500
in this white dress.

569
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,550
I owe you too much.

570
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,600
I only hope you can find someone
who truly loves you.

571
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,330
He will protect you forever

572
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,470
and never leave you.

573
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,700
Come on.

574
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,630
Eat more.

575
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,610
Eat more.

576
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,100
Hello.

577
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,930
Excuse me.

578
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Is Jiang Lai here?

579
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,340
Who are you?

580
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,590
I'm her senior in college.

581
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,580
Miss Su.

582
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,310
Here

583
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,840
we have our satin wedding dresses
that are in season.

584
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
This mermaid-style dress

585
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,320
and these two with trains

586
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,180
are all high-end custom designs.

587
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,860
I wonder

588
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,300
which one you prefer?

589
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,620
Auntie.

590
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,310
What do you think?

591
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,750
I trust your taste.

592
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,500
From this one.

593
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,420
Okay.

594
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,840
To the last one.

595
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,430
Try them all.

596
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,540
Okay.

597
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,850
This one is too plain.

598
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,630
Nothing special.

599
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,890
Change to another one.

600
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,440
The neckline is too low.

601
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,770
It looks too revealing.

602
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,130
The texture doesn’t feel right.

603
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,740
Change it.

604
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,280
Auntie, how about this one?

605
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,940
I like it very much.

606
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,870
I think this one is quite suitable.

607
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,060
This one

608
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,220
isn't magnificent enough.

609
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,750
I'll change to another one.

610
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,740
Sorry.

611
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,470
Are you okay?

612
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,220
Do you have tissues?

613
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,090
She's going to get it.

614
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,810
No need.

615
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,840
I want this one.

616
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,520
Okay.

617
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,070
I'll get your wedding veil.

618
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,130
Thank you.

619
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,080
It's my duty.

620
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,130
I'm exhausted.

621
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,230
I'm done with this.

622
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,260
Hello, is anyone there?

623
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,060
Can you help me with the buttons?

624
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,870
Hello.

625
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,110
Hello...

626
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,640
Senior.

627
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,950
Why are you here?

628
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,060
Jiang Lai.

629
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,880
You’re not Su Qing.

630
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,530
Don't make more mistakes.

631
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,270
This is my own business.

632
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,960
It has nothing to do with you.

633
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,890
You shouldn't have come here.

634
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,550
My hair.

635
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,530
My hair is caught.

636
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,790
Mr. Zhou, you are here.

637
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,150
Miss Su is inside.

638
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,860
This is her matching wedding veil.

639
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,550
Come in first.

640
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,220
Please follow me.

641
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,760
Okay.

642
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,790
Miss Su picked a wedding veil
that suits her very well.

643
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,740
Would you like to take a look?

644
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,940
Miss Su.

645
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,110
Mr. Zhou is here.

646
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,700
Miss Su.

647
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,000
Su Qing.

648
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,300
Su Qing, what's wrong?

649
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
Are you okay?

650
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,510
Are you done?

651
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,310
I'm coming in.

652
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,940
Zhou Yu.

653
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,740
It's lively in here.

654
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,330
How did you fall down?

655
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,020
Are you okay?

656
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,660
I'm fine.

657
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
I was careless.

658
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,610
I was just tired.

659
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,990
How many dresses did she try on?

660
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,870
Miss Su tried...

661
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,160
I have something to do.

662
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,750
How about

663
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,650
you two keep doing this?

664
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,530
I’ll leave now.

665
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,550
Since Vice President Sun is so busy,

666
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,500
we’ll take care of

667
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,320
the wedding details ourselves.

668
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,470
No way.

669
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,910
It’s what your dad asked me to do.
It’s okay.

670
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,710
I’ll handle things with my dad.

671
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
What do you think?

672
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,870
That would be great.

673
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,710
Are you sure your dad will be okay with it?

674
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,480
Yes.

675
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,890
Let me put it on you.

676
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,450
What's wrong?

677
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,640
Doesn't it look good?

678
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,070
Yes.

679
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,280
Very beautiful.

680
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,480
I...

681
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,950
Lai.

682
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,490
Lai.

683
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,770
Why don’t you always answer my phone?

684
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,050
[Sun Wei]

685
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,020
My phone is in my bag.

686
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,180
Young man.

687
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,790
Nice to meet you.

688
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,200
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,310
I didn't tell you in advance.

690
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,110
It's okay.

691
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,930
I understand.

692
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,710
My daughter's wedding dress

693
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,640
is so beautiful.

694
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,720
Can you take a photo with me?

695
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,200
Young man.

696
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,600
Take a photo of my daughter and me.

697
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,310
Okay.

698
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:34,990
Let me do it.

699
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,680
The wedding dress is so beautiful.

700
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,830
Lai.

701
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,830
I’m really sorry.

702
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,070
Since you were little,

703
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,060
I haven't been able to accompany you

704
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,530
and give you a good life.

705
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,020
Seeing you in your wedding dress today

706
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,620
and find your own happiness,

707
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,300
I'm really touched.

708
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,570
You've suffered a lot

709
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,840
and put up with a lot of grievances

710
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,100
because of me.

711
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,260
I know that.

712
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,020
Don't worry.

713
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,520
I will

714
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,550
work hard.

715
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,980
Alright, Dad.

716
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
Let's not talk about this.

717
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,690
Let's take a photo.

718
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,179
Okay.

719
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:22,820
Young man.

720
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:23,870
Come.

721
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,420
Three, two, one.

722
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,159
One more.

723
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,170
[Dad, I'm trying on the wedding dress today]

724
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,900
Hello.

725
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,030
I’m looking for Jiang Lai.

726
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,739
She’s here trying on the wedding dress today.

727
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,510
Jiang Lai?

728
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,590
I’m sorry.

729
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,860
Miss Su booked the whole place today.

730
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:00,960
Miss Su?

731
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,720
Who do you mean?

732
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,880
Su Qing.

733
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,990
Jiang Lai.

734
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,330
Su Qing.

735
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,970
You're indeed my good daughter.
