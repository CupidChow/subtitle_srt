4
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,990
Didn't find him?

5
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,420
No.

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,640
You didn't find him either?

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,110
No.

8
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,660
Search!

9
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,350
Search carefully.

10
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,030
Behind the car.

11
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,660
Under the car.

12
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,350
Go look!

13
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,800
Well.

14
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,300
Take the phone. I'll go distract them.

15
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,360
The company accounts are important.

16
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,210
I won't trade your safety for anything.

17
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,470
Then do you have any ideas?

18
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,590
They're coming for me.

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,160
I'll go out first.

20
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,110
You go hide

21
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,329
and wait for Chen Jun.

22
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,680
Here.

23
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,360
I told you to leave.

24
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,480
How can I leave you here?

25
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,420
Here's the information you asked for.

26
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,250
You...

27
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,540
Go pick up the phone.

28
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,970
You can't come and go

29
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,090
as you wish.

30
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Hit him.

31
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,270

Leave this to me.

36
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,360

I'll go after them.

40
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,650
I won't let them run away.

I… I'll do it myself.

56
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,290
Don't move.

57
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,180
Sorry, it's going to hurt.

58
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,110
I only have this.

59
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,890
It will be done soon.

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Now you know you can get hurt.

61
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,420
Who asked you to be the hero?

62
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,940
I did it to help you.

63
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,110
I don't need you to.

64
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,440
Next time when I say leave, you just leave.

65
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,070
Stop talking back.

66
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,370
I helped you.

67
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,570
Just say thank you.

68
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,940
Thank you.

69
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880
Well,

70
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,820
how's your injury?

71
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,940
It's fine.

72
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,030
Didn't you get hit many times?

73
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,950
Let me see.

74
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,890
I'm fine.

75
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,400
I'll use some medical spray later.

76
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,210
Don't worry.

77
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,470
Why are you being shy?

78
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,470
Don't be shy, man.

79
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,960
Let me see.

80
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,110
Don't move.

81
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,510
I'll do it myself.

82
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,660
Does it hurt?

83
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm being very gentle right now.

84
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,180
It doesn't hurt.

85
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,920
I lost my phone.

86
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
It'll be even harder to get in again.

87
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,980
I have an idea.

88
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:40,650
Done.

89
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,280
Cloud backup.

90
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,450
I'll get it.

91
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,590
Your foot.

92
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,140
I'm fine.

93
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Be careful.

94
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,740
Tingjiang.

95
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,980
Where's your injury?

96
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
Let me take you to the hospital.

97
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,670
That's not necessary.

98
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm fine.

99
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,710
What are you doing here?

100
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,710
I heard from the security team that you were attacked.

101
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
I've applied medicine on her wood.

102
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,700
You can go now, Special Assistant Li.

103
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,720
Do you think

104
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,150
he is a little nosy

105
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
as your senior?

106
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
Do you think you're a little nosy

107
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,240
as my contract boyfriend?

108
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,520
I just want to remind you

109
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
of our contract.

110
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,890
You don't need to.

111
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,690
I remember it.

112
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,410
Chen Jun.

113
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,840
So you like Chen Yiyi.

114
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,200
No, I don't.

115
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,240
I'm just going over our spokesperson's new material

116
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
and see if there's any problem.

117
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,200
This is my job.

118
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
Young man,

119
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,400
don't be an overachiever.

120
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
Besides, Mr.Zhou's bet

121
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,290
will become due soon.

122
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,160
Who knows which one will be sitting

123
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,460
in that room.

124
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,320
The issues of Dream City's accounts have been solved, right?

125
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Ask him.

126
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,510
The evidence has been submitted,

127
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,290
but we're still waiting for the result.

128
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,880
So the funds of Dream City

129
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,470
are still frozen.

130
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,140
All projects that need investment

131
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
have to stop.

132
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm used to

133
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,780
Mr. Zhou's work intensity.

134
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,110
We don't know what kind of boss the new person is.

135
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,150
Tingting,

136
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,470
listen to me.

137
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Remember,

138
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,910
We are here to earn a salary.

139
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,130
not to risk our lives.

140
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,630
Look.

141
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,200
Things are so nice right now.

142
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,390
We punch in

143
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,350
slack off,

144
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,500
and we get paid.

145
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,730
It's comfortable, isn't it?

146
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,380
In that case,

147
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,730
how about you taking a long vacation?

148
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,560
How many times have I told you

149
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,620
that we can't take it easy especially

150
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,880
when it's critical time for our company?

151
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
We must unite

152
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,470
at this moment.

153
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,410
We fight together

154
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,520
and overcome the challenges.

155
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,440
Mr. Zhou, you're here.

156
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
Any instructions?

157
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,230
He's old but definitely smooth.

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,220
He can get down on his knees at any time.

159
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,780
I admire that.

160
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,730
Chen Jun,

161
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
how much more revenue

162
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,640
do we need?

163
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,270
Eight percent.

164
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,150
If our accounts are good,

165
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,300
we should be able to complete the task.

166
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,640
Got it.

167
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,280
You should film videos with Chen Yiyi.

168
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,310
I refuse.

169
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,460
Chen Yiyi has 6 million fans on her platform.

170
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,860
And every video of hers has gone viral.

171
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,130
Every shop she went to has become internet famous.

172
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,660
Aren't you intrigued by the massive traffic?

173
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,960
You really want me to mark my debut, aren't you?

174
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,550
You're a little old for that.

175
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,480
Well,

176
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,190
we only half a month before the bet become due.

177
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,460
If you film videos with Chen Yiyi,

178
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,180
you can showcase the plus side of Dream City,

179
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,730
and use her popularity

180
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,480
to quickly generate traffic.

181
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,140
Let me think about it.

182
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,240
I know

183
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,930
you're not used to appear in front of the camera.

184
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,590
But could you

185
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,520
think of it as a small sacrifice

186
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,080
for the farm and the resort?

187
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,880
This is the only free promotion we can get.

188
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
Go plan it.

189
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,620
Really? You agreed?

190
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,530
Trust me.

191
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,210
This will be the best decision you've ever made.

192
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm going to bed.

193
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,220
Good night, Mr. Zhou.

194
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,520
Come and put on some music.

195
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,230
Again?

196
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,030
Okay. Okay.

197
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,730
Right away.

198
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,340
Mr. Zhou.

199
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,640
We've set up everything with Chen Yiyi's team.

200
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,470
This is the information of the shops

201
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,260
that you'll visit during filming.

202
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,320
Please have a look.

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,410
Mr. Zhou,

204
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,130
I think you've changed.

205
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,540
Why?

206
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,710
In the past,

207
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,890
you say yes without hesitation

208
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,770
to anything that benefits your work.

209
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,490
It took you a while to decide this time.

210
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,020
Do you worry that Miss Jiang will misunderstand the situation?

211
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,700
Well,

212
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,820
Jiang Lai’s identity

213
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,410
is still a time bomb.

214
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,250
Please don't get more involved.

215
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,900
Mr. Zhou.

216
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,860
The shops you chose are not unique enough.

217
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,190
Work overtime tonight and make a new plan.

218
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,720
Seriously?

219
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,340
Get out.

220
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,590
So vindictive.

221
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,800
Could you think of it as a small sacrifice

222
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,350
for the farm and the resort?

223
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,200
This is the only free promotion we can get.

224
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,310
Yu.

225
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,150
Yu.

226
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,710
Hello, everyone.

227
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm here today

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,080
to check out the biggest mall in out city, Dream City.

229
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,240
Standing next to me

230
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,990
is the CEO of Dream City.

231
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,260
He is also my childhood sweetheart.

232
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,400
Yu.

233
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,750
Say hello to everyone.

234
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,050
I'm Zhou Yu.

235
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,380
Yu, come here.

236
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,120
This wall of wishes

237
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,770
is the signature spot of Dream City

238
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,030
which has attracted many people.

239
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,890
I heard you can wish for love here.

240
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,870
Look.

241
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,040
Yu.

242
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,920
Let's put it on the wall together.

243
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,570
Wait.

244
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,940
The wall of wishes

245
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,840
is not on the programme I received.

246
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,100
What are you doing now?

247
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,360
The programme I gave you is not real.

248
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,560
Actually, the theme of today's filming is going on a date,

249
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,690
to present Dream City

250
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,140
as the perfect place for couples.

251
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,160
Who allowed you to make the decision?

252
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,890
For your company,

253
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,920
put up with it.

254
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,360
I'll choose the following activities.

255
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,350
Please, please.

256
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,530
Yu.

257
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,910
Yu.

258
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,030
I want to try yours.

259
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,470
Very delicious.

260
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,800
Yu.

261
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,010
Is there anything

262
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,930
weird on my mouth?

263
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,880
Cut.

264
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,280
Great.

265
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,960
Yu.

266
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,110
Where are you going?

267
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,820
Yu.

268
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,580
It's pre-production day today.

269
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,790
You haven't finished the programme.

270
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,920
Where are you going?

271
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
Move!

272
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,350
No.

273
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,130
Unless you go back with me.

274
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,320
Do you really want to hand me over to Chen Yiyi?

275
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,390
You're working now.

276
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,990
I'm not interested.

277
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,140
You've never been in a relationship, have you?

278
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
No wonder you're so stiff.

279
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,270
It's okay.

280
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,140
Let me find you the feeling of love.

281
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,500
Allow me.

282
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,510
Is it good?

283
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,270
Yes.

284
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
So you bring me here to find the feeling?

285
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,020
Yes.

286
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,820
The skating rink is a great place for couples

287
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,550
that has stood the test of time.

288
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,660
Let's go.

289
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,470
Why?

290
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,960
You don't know how to skate, do you?

291
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,350
Don't worry.

292
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,470
When you're with an expert like me,

293
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,240
you'll be able to skate soon.

294
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,800
Let's go.

295
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,680
Give it a try.

296
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,140
Listen to me.

297
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,090
The first step to learning skating

298
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,850
is…

299
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,160
to fall often.

300
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,970
I didn't say I can't skate.

301
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,660
Okay.

302
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,820
Then you can do a good job

303
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,240
with Chen Yiyi tomorrow.

304
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,140
How to do a good job?

305
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,390
Like this?

306
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,090
Do whatever you like.

307
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,220
My legs are killing me.

308
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,310
Why is skating so exhausting?

309
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:55,990
Here.

310
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,230
Have some water.

311
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,330
Thank you.

312
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,170
I'm going to bed.

313
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,940
Why are you running away?

314
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,620
I didn't.

315
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm going back to my room.

316
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,860
You're not having dinner?

317
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,830
No.

318
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,750
Try to keep your balance.

319
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,630
Lean forward.

320
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,030
Miss Su,

321
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,110
Mr. Zhou acts like a coach.

322
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,980
If this video is put online,

323
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,930
it won't be popular at all.

324
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,230
Am I right, Miss Su?

325
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,620
Do you really want to hand me over to Chen Yiyi?

326
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,500
Like this?

327
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,960
Why are you running away?

328
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,730
Right.

329
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,030
Why did I run away?

330
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,910
Miss Su.

331
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,170
So

332
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,880
we have to figure something out.

333
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,380
Yu.

334
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,330
I'm tired.

335
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,550
Let's take a break.

336
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,430
No.

337
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,330
I promised that I would teach you how to skate today.

338
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,950
So pretty.

339
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,350
Ding，

340
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,700
how does it look? Do we have the vibe?

341
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,220
Isn't it romantic?

342
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,020
Yes, it is.

343
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,230
They make a great couple.

344
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,470
Really?

345
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,330
Are you okay?

346
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm done.

347
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,480
-Chen Yi.
-Yiyi.

348
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,000
I like you.

349
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,140
We're not filming now.

350
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,960
You don’t have to say the lines.

351
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,570
Jiang Lai,

352
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,430
I like you.

353
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,460
I have someone special in my life.

354
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,640
Where is Zhou Yu?

355
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,650
Mr. Zhou knows you haven't eaten.

356
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,370
He asked me to bring you something to eat.

357
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,690
Don't lie to me. He...

358
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,370
He is not so thoughtful.

359
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,250
What did you bring?

360
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,200
Yulan Cake, wonton,

361
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
and steamed buns.

362
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,080
They look delicious.

363
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,340
Yiyi.

364
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,550
I found a lawn over there

365
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,130
on my way here.

366
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,550
How about we go eat there?

367
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,230
Okay.

368
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,310
Yiyi.

369
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,700
Don't follow me.

370
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,040
What's wrong?

371
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,460
It's not good?

372
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,290
Am I not pretty?

373
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,370
No way.

374
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,540
You are a star.

375
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,800
Then why did Zhou Yu treat me like that?

376
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,430
Actually,

377
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,120
Mr. Zhou is not good with words.

378
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,130
Don't make excuses for him.

379
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,730
I see clearly now.

380
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,700
He doesn't care about me at all.

381
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,670
Well, then

382
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,270
are you upset?

383
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,700
I'm angry.

384
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,510
But I'm very pretty.

385
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,210
This one is not good for me,

386
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,760
then I'll move on to the next.

387
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,560
Exactly.

388
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,890
Everyone likes you.

389
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,840
Who wouldn't?

390
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,900
This is really delicious.

391
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,630
Right?

392
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,950
It tastes good, isn't it?

393
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,260
Also, try this.

394
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,870
Yiyi,

395
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,020
you've gained 0.5 jin when you weighted this morning.

396
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,350
It was hydroncus.

397
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,650
It's not a good idea to eat here.

398
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,810
If someone takes pictures of you,

399
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,950
there will be some gossip.

400
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,170
I'm just having a meal.

401
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,090
Don't I deserve a little freedom?

402
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,320
Don't be upset.

403
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,150
I have an idea.

404
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,030
Dig in.

405
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,890
Do I look good?

406
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,710
Yes.

407
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,030
I look so rustic.

408
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,460
No one will recognize you.

409
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,870
I'm going to eat.

410
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,410
Is it good?

411
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,150
Yes.

412
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,270
Is it delicious?

413
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,310
So delicious.

414
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,260
Jiang Lai,

415
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,090
I like you.

416
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,790
I have someone special in my life.

417
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
Is her special person

418
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,950
Li Tingjiang?

419
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,830
Zhou Yu.

420
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,860
Are you serious?

421
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,880
What did he mean?

422
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,370
I went to work

423
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,220
Remember to have breakfast.

424
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,730
Don't overthink it.

425
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,020
We need to win the best first,

426
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,950
which is the most important thing.

427
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,460
I'll go take some picutres of the mall first.

428
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,910
How to win someone over after being rejected.

429
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,130
Mr. Zhou, have you read it?

430
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,940
No, I didn't.

431
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,350
Everything has two sides.

432
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,380
Although you two lack chemistry,

433
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,870
but the numbers look great.

434
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,530
Take a look.

435
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,740
Our video was released at 10 a.m.

436
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,860
Now it has made the top 3 in the entertainment section.

437
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,940
[Trending searches]

438
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,610
And even the Zhou's Group is in the top 10 trending searches.

439
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,870
The numbers are still going up right now.

440
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,600
Why are the comments all about me?

441
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,270
None of them is about the Dream City.

442
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,430
Because the theme this time

443
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,990
is about dating.

444
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,290
Most of the viewers are women.

445
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,490
So they pay more attention to the male lead.

446
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,580
This is not a regular straight man.

447
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,240
This is an extra straight man.

448
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,350
He has a face that would cause trouble,

449
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,150
and a mouth that is reassuringly

450
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,450
dumb.

451
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,660
Keep me updated.

452
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,710
Write a review of the whole promotion,

453
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,450
including how many shares and discussions

454
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,230
and send it to me before getting off work.

455
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,680
Okay.

456
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,620
Are we still carrying out our previous plan?

457
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,480
Yes, of course.

458
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,590
It's not easy to have a great outcome.

459
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,870
We need to strike

460
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,310
while the iron is hot.

461
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,860
Go.

462
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,660
I just want to say

463
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,930
that I'm not leaving because I'm embarrassed.

464
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,010
I'm going to that...

465
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,800
Front...

466
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,590
Fine, I'm a little embarrassed.

467
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,120
The bet will become due very soon.

468
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,210
Should we work a litte harder

469
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,650
together for the resort?

470
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,890
Okay.

471
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,100
♫Running in the field with wind chimes ringing♫

472
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,030

♫I'm standing on the land of my hometown♫

499

I said it's my treat.

500
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,060
And you pick the ramen?

501
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,989
If this gets out,

502
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,850
people will say I'm cheap again.

503
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,909
What do they know?

504
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,350
Ramen noodles are the necessity when working overtime.

505
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,890
I want this one.

506
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,230
Yes.

507
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,730
Ramen tastes better when working overtime.

508
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,060
By the way,

509
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,280
according to our current working progress,

510
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,210
can we win the bet

511
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,720
without the funds?

512
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,540
We'll think of something.

513
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,660
Do you have an emergency fund

514
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,210
for this kind of situation?

515
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,750
You mean

516
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,180
I buy the 30 percent of…

517
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,920
No.

518
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,140
I'm not asking you to purchase anything.

519
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,020
I mean promotion.

520
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,510
Whether it's publicity

521
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,830
or using my own money to boost the sales,

522
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,630
do you think Sun Wei'll buy it?

523
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,200
You're right.

524
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,530
Let's eat.

525
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,950
And go back to work later.

526
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,500
Do you really have that much money?

527
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,160
Buying 30 percent costs a lot.

528
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,760
Enjoy your noodles.

529
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,020
I bought breakfast.

530
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:35,870
You worked hard.

531
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,730
Let's have some breakfast first.

532
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,880
Let's eat.

533
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,850
Thank you, Miss Su.

534
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,530
I'm exhausted from working overtime.

535
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,380
My dark circles look creazy.

536
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,370
Oh my gosh!

537
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,290
Oh my gosh!

538
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,830
The weather is so nice.

539
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,300
Young people like us

540
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,230
should go out

541
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,940
and enjoy the beautiful views.

542
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,540
You're not that young.

543
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,650
Can we have fun together?

544
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,440
Let's go out tomorrow.

545
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,710
I'm in.

546
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,320
Let's do team building tomorrow.

547
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,450
Have a good time together.
