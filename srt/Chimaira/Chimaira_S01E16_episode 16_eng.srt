1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060


2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,270
 Chimera 

3
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,190
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality. 

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,680
 Last Episode 

5
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,170
Should I kill

6
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,350
the one person you love?

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,220
I'm talking about your son, Cha Jae Hwan.

8
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,120
I... only have a daughter.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,170
It looks like you have the wrong person.

10
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,800
I'm sorry. I must have mistaken you for someone else.

11
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm a reporter.

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,700
You know UBS broadcasting station, right?

13
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,160
To be honest, I came here to ask you something.

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,920
I read Han Ju Seok's notes.

15
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,610
But, no matter how I look at it, there is something I don't understand.

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,790
Why that person was Chimera's last target.

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,850
Why didn't you end it then?

18
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,140
35 years ago.

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,660
To complete Chimera's revenge he should have been killed.

20
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,010
but why did you stop at the last second?

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,400
You couldn't possibly have forgiven him, right?

22
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,900
There must have been another reason.

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,650
A simple change of heart? Did you just get tired of it all?

24
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,920
If not, was there another reason?

25
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,670
Tell me.

26
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,640
What were you thinking in that last moment.

27
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,800
Your answer might even be able to stop me.

28
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,380
Why didn't you say something?

29
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,920
Did you keep telling me to go back because of her?

30
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,940
You know how I lived!

31
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,560
You know what family means to me!

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,620
Hyo Gyeong is my daughter.

33
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,070
Your mother Yeong Sin gave birth to her but she is my daughter.

34
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,730
You think I'm selfish right?

35
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,290
But what parent is not selfish when it comes to the issue of their own child?

36
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,900
Even so, you should have told me.

37
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,700
If I knew earlier that she was aliveâ€”

38
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,030
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,800
Where is she?

40
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,430
Where are you going with your body in that condition?

41
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,960
I have to stop Kim Hyo Gyeong.

42
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,050
Do you want to know

43
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,260
why I stopped?

44
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,850
It isn't that I stopped.

45
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Someone else

46
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,420
stopped me.

47
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,920
Is there someone who can stop you?

48
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,950
Don't go through life like an island.

49
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,270
That's no way to live.

50
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm going to see Seo Hyeon Tae.

51
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,570
To conduct my last interview.

52
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't you have something to say to him?

53
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,200
If you happen to meet the Chimera, convey this.

54
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,080
I understand and pity you.

55
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,910
Mom!

56
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,210
Are you okay mom?

57
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,450
 UBS 
 Reporter/Investigative Reporting Team Kim Hyo Gyeong 

58
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,180
Mom. Did this person come here?

59
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,740
What did you talk about?

60
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,550
Mom. Mom. You have to remember.

61
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,260
Mom.

62
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,310
My goodness, there is a serious problem!

63
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,420
A reporter came saying that she was looking for you.

64
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,910
What if she learns about our relationship?

65
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
Geon Young, listen to me carefully and pass the message along to the team leader.

66
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,560
Look into Kim Hyo Gyeong from UBS.

67
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,380
Find her whereabouts from her program production company because I am trying to track her.

68
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,660
Do you not have an appetite?

69
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,280
I heard that you cancelled everything on your scheduled for the day. You must be in pretty bad shape.

70
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,530
Honey,

71
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,510
for the time being

72
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,960
I think you'll have to go to Yun Jin.

73
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,910
In New York?

74
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,410
At a time like this, the owner should be away from his position now?

75
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,550
It's because I want to rest.

76
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,360
Then go to the hospital and stay for several days.

77
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,390
I got a prescription for nutritional supplements from Dr. Jang.

78
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,750
Don't make a big fuss for nothing.

79
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,990
Anyone looking at you would think you've committed a  crime and are escaping.

80
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,410
You ... why are you pretending not to know?

81
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,410
Didn't you hear what I told Min Gi?

82
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm the one who killed him.

83
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,620
Never mind.  I don't even want to listen.

84
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,150
Is it because you don't know the position I'm in right now?

85
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,600
The Chimera will be here soon.  But ...

86
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,700
But... should we just sit back and put our hands up and wait like this?

87
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,000
Then run away?

88
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,680
What will people say?

89
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,450
Now... Does that matter now?

90
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,880
What people will say?

91
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,600
Your husband might die soon.

92
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,690
I'd rather you die.

93
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
What?

94
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,460
Rather than running away and dying like a dog, fight like a bear and die.

95
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,990
How...

96
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,540
How can you say that when my life is at stake?

97
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,660
Even a stranger cannot talk like that.

98
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,190
In order to marry you,

99
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,720
I bit my own hand and wrote a bloody pledge in front of your father.

100
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,820
Your father said he despises and hates me and his eyes never met mine while we ate at the same table.

101
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,080
He was so vehement in discouraging me.

102
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,170
At a time like this, you look exactly the same as your father, you know?

103
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,180
Why did you write a bloody pledge back then?

104
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,620
Do you love me?

105
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,700
This isn't love.

106
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,230
It must have been greed.

107
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,990
You then, in the mud pit

108
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,420
were like a beast struggling to get out.

109
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,770
Then why did you want to embrace me so much?

110
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,110
I'll call the hospital.

111
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,370
Hey, I'm in a hurry, man, quickly look it up.

112
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,220
Hey, did he give his number?  What did he say?

113
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,860
He hasn't come out yet.

114
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,350
Why hasn't it come out yet?  Hurry and find out.

115
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,160
Is there anything special which came out?

116
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,090
I contacted a girls' middle school. Kim Hyo Gyeong was a track and field athlete in middle school.

117
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,010
An athlete?

118
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,840
What was her major earlier?

119
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,640
She was a chemistry major.  She joined UBS as a science reporter.

120
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,090
Hey, was she an athlete who was smart too?

121
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,910
This is tough.

122
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,180
- Ask Investigator Eugene to come quickly. 
 - Yes sir.

123
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,230
Team Leader, about Hanter Production.

124
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,200
I checked the contact information of the CEO because I couldn't connect to him.

125
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,460
He emigrated to Australia in 2012.

126
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Emigrated?  Then who is running it now?

127
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,700
 Last time it was 1984. 

128
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,300
 I've talked about Mr. Lee who died while being investigated after a false accusation in the Chimera Case. 

129
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,690
 Yes. You also talked about the possibility of death from torture. 

130
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,620
 Thirty-five years later, the very people involved in Mr. Lee's death 

131
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,350
 were killed one after the other. 

132
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,570
 This is the Chimera case which is ongoing. 

133
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,450
 From a reporter to detectives on the investigation team 

134
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,960
 all the victims were involved in Lee's death 35 years ago. 

135
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,740
 Oh, then is the police chief "B", 

136
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,600
 who had an accident recently, connected to the case? 

137
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,540
 Chief "B" may be the key figure. 

138
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,050
 He was the detective in charge of the investigation 35 years ago. 

139
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,490
 We learned he was on duty the very day of Mr. Lee's death. 

140
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,440
- He came out.  He came out.  
 - He's coming.

141
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,180
Assemblyman, you were in charge of the investigation in the chimera case 35 years ago, weren't you?

142
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,600
Hey, hey, get out of the way.

143
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,570
There is a claim that the suicide of Lee Sang Wu was fabricated. Will you comment on that?

144
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,350
Is it true he was tortured to death during the investigation?

145
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,080
That's groundless.

146
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,000
Were you involved in the fabrication?

147
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,210
You people!

148
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,890
- Let us pass by, huh? 
 - Do you agree?

149
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,050
 Muni Channel   
 Valkyrie 
 Like and Subscribe 

150
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,870
Who are you?

151
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,240
I am a police officer.  Where is Miss Kim Hyo Gyeong?

152
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,400
She's not here right now. What's going on?

153
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,030
Is this a live Valkyrie broadcast?

154
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,450
When is it going to air?

155
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,110
Today will be a recorded broadcast.

156
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,260
- Recorded? 
 - Yes.

157
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,080
Hyo Gyeong said she would be busy, so we recorded the broadcast yesterday.

158
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,850
Did she say where she was going?

159
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,650
I don't know.

160
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,500
Yes, I see.

161
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,570
You're the CEO of Hanter Production, right?

162
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,650
 Yes, a long time ago. 

163
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,710
 I created it with my college club hoobae* (*juniors). 

164
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,670
 When our contract with the Ministry of Defense expired, there was no profit. 

165
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,190
 It was dissolved in 2013 before I moved here. 

166
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,530
It is dissolved?

167
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,480
It still appears to be in business.

168
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,640
It's been paying corporate taxes regularly.

169
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,820
 No way.  I am here.  Who would pay for that? 

170
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,680
Did you do the dissolution yourself?

171
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,530
I left if up to a trustworthy hoobae.

172
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,170
Who is that hoobae?

173
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,350
 Kim Hyo Gyeong is the hoobae. 

174
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,330
I think she is a reporter for a broadcasting company.

175
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,120
Was there anything unique about Kim Hyo Gyeong when you worked with her?

176
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,230
 I can't say. She was so smart and quick. 

177
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,270
 She was good-hearted.  Very much so. 

178
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,870
 Government Employee 
Cha Jae Hwn 
National Police Agency 

179
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,450
Has something happened to Kim Hyo Gyeong?

180
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,120
Yes.  There is something urgent for which I am looking for her.

181
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,750
She submitted a letter of resignation.

182
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,670
A letter of resignation?  When?

183
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,270
Two days ago.  She was upset that her news item was deleted.

184
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,850
Did she perhaps say anything special or say where she was going?

185
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,450
I can't say.

186
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,450
- Oh, Yun Seok. 
 - Yes.

187
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,240
Didn't you hear that Hyo Gyeong was going somewhere?

188
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,030
I didn't.

189
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,510
Ah, well, she did ask me to look into something.

190
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,060
What is it?

191
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,770
Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae's unofficial schedule.

192
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,370
Unofficial schedule?

193
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,570
Not his official business schedule but his personal one.

194
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,490
Where he eats, whom he meets.

195
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,140
Why would she be looking into that?

196
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,960
I guess she was trying to get an interview when she would be doing an online broadcast.

197
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:27,110
 The chimera incident begins with the development of a substance called TH-5. 

198
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,560
 In the murder case  TH5's developers were murdered one after the other. 

199
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,280
 This is the very Chimera Case from 35 years ago. 

200
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,340
 So how is Seo Hyeon Tae, Chairman of Seoryun Group, connected to the case? 

201
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,890
 Seo Hyeon Tae led the development of TH-5. 

202
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,080
 The project's success was a major factor in his becoming the head of the current chaebol group. 

203
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,740
 Were there no problems at the time of development? 

204
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,990
 The process of obtaining the patent for TH-5 was not transparent. 

205
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,540
 The patent application was for industrial use but it secretly was approved for household use. 

206
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,910
 During this process, Seo Hyeon Tae, 

207
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,770
 at the time the Director of Taesam Chemical, is rumored to have used his influence. 

208
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,900
Is Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae in the VIP suite at Seoryun Hospital?

209
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,870
Just who is security there for?

210
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,840
It's urgent right now.  It's an urgent situation!

211
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,810
What have you come here for?

212
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm Kim Hyo Gyeong of the UBS News Bureau.

213
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,790
I've come to see the chairman.

214
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,780
You can't visit without a prior appointment.

215
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,420
If you leave your business card, I'll give it to him.

216
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,320
Please tell him this.

217
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,990
I have something to tell him about Ryu Seong Hui.

218
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,860
 UBS 
 Investigative News Team Reporter
 Kim Hyo Gyeong. 

219
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,400
Who?

220
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,420
She says she is here to talk about Ryu Seong Hui.

221
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,930
Should I send her away?

222
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,580
No.

223
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,510
Let her in.

224
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,560
You can go on in.

225
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,590
Hello, Chairman.

226
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,400
I hope you get well. I heard you're feeling under the weather.

227
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,360
How did you know I was here?

228
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,760
This is a present.

229
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,810
I've made multiple requests to interview you.

230
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,520
I finally get to meet you today.

231
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,340
What was the urgent matter you wanted to talk about?

232
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,210
You have no idea how lucky you've been all this time, do you?

233
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,100
Do you know that the Chimera's final target from 35 years ago was you?

234
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,820
I wonder why the Chimera hated you so much.

235
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,700
I can't live trying to understand,

236
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,210
all the stories of those who hold a grudge against me.

237
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,110
Chimera... you know who it is, don't you?

238
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,680
Chimera was arrested 35 years ago and died.

239
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,130
Oh, is that so?

240
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,560
Is that what you believe?

241
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,650
Are you sure?

242
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,300
You're a feisty young lady.

243
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,460
You're Lawyer Kim Hyeong Guk's daughter, right?

244
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,900
I heard that you were very interested in the Chimera case.

245
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,990
I've met a lot people like you.

246
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,060
What was it? Did you want to catch my attention?

247
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,030
Your efforts are admirable but you've crossed a line.

248
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,450
I think you've misunderstood something, so I'll introduce myself again.

249
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm not Kim Hyeong Guk's biological daughter.

250
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,020
I was adopted.

251
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,890
My father is someone that you know very well too, Chairman.

252
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,780
He is Lee... Sang... Wu...

253
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,610
- Jung Yeop?
- Yes.

254
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,450
Oh, gosh.

255
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,640
Help me, Eugene.

256
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,800
Not as a detective, but as a friend.

257
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,690
I've interviewed many people regarding Lee Sang Wu's death.

258
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,990
Son Wan Gi... Han Ju Seok... Ham Yong Bok...

259
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,640
and Bae Seung Gwan.

260
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,270
This balloon isn't filled with helium.

261
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,300
It was widely used at school sports days in the past.

262
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,250
It's lighter than air and easy to obtain.

263
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,770
But it was banned because it was highly explosive.

264
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,970
Hydrogen?

265
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,140
You know very well.

266
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,680
Thanks to your key role in developing TH-5.

267
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,460
You...

268
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,650
you're Chimera?

269
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,050
Are you disappointed?

270
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,620
What is it that you want?

271
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,130
A very simple answer.

272
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,890
Look here, young lady.

273
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,360
I know nothing about your father!

274
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,170
I thought you would be a little different.

275
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,700
How is everyone exactly the same?

276
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,430
Even right before their death?

277
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,380
"I don't know anything."

278
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,370
He was an employee at your factory.

279
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,640
You're saying you don't know anything when he was stabbed by your public security office and got arrested?

280
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,500
I'm just an informant.

281
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,220
I'm telling you I don't know anything regarding your father's death.

282
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,690
Bae Seung Gwan was on duty that day.

283
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:24,060
Bae Seung Gwan accidentally killed him and conspired with the other police officers to cover it up!

284
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,100
I r-really didn't know until recently!

285
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,470
If you didn't know...

286
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,390
Why did you try to kill Lee Jung Yeop?

287
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,250
It seemed like you went out of your way, Chairman.

288
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,310
You even bribed the prosecution investigation officers.

289
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,350
What was the reason?

290
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,610
What were you so afraid of?

291
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,780
You were afraid of Lee Jung Yeop.

292
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,860
Because you thought he was the Chimera.

293
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,190
You thought he'd come for you to avenge his father... Why?

294
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,700
It's because you have a connection to Lee Sang Wu's death.

295
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,720
Did you do it?

296
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,480
Lee Sang Wu's murder... was it your doing?

297
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,980
  Night-duty Room  

298
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,340
I'm sorry.

299
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,040
 Lawyer Kim Hyeong Guk 

300
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,700
 Lawyer Kim Hyeong Guk 

301
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,900
August 8, 1984. The night that Lee Sang Wu died!

302
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,870
What did you do?

303
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,840
Did you kill him?

304
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,130
It was Kim Hyeong Guk, wasn't it?

305
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,090
That bastard told you, didn't he?

306
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,300
Fine.

307
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,210
You think you can kill me?

308
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,240
Give it a go.

309
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,670
If this is hydrogen,

310
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,130
what are you going to do about it?

311
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,990
Do as you wish!

312
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,170
You little...

313
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,700
The power of analog that got me through the detector.

314
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,650
Hey!

315
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,420
Don't... Don't do it! You crazy bitch!

316
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,620
Now... make a choice...

317
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,680
for your fate.

318
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,560
- What brings you here? 
- Where's Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae?

319
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,420
He's inside.

320
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,190
Move over.

321
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,000
- Chairman - 
- It's d-dangerous!

322
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,910
Chimera came by.

323
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,540
She said she'll remotely set the bomb off if I talk too much or move.

324
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,820
That woman... the reporter. She's Chimera.

325
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,550
It's a hydrogen balloon.

326
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,900
I-it may explode... be careful.

327
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,500
Be careful.

328
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,500
- Be careful.
- Just stay still.

329
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,340
Explosive gas is safe if there's no ignition system.

330
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,130
There's no fuse. It's safe.

331
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,080
- Where did she go?
- She just left.

332
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,360
- Hey, hurry, hurry!
- Hurry up!

333
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,980
Block the entrances. All of them, including the annex and parking lot.

334
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,820
Detective Lee, go to the security room and check the CCTV.

335
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,870
- Yes, sir. 
- Let's go.

336
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,350
You two, watch the front. Hurry in.

337
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,210
What happened?

338
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,010
They said she just left, so she couldn't have gone far.

339
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,350
I'll check the hospital rooms again.

340
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,470
Yes, Geon Yeong?

341
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,040
At the new annex...

342
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,610
around the roof? Okay.

343
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,150
 Staircase 5 

344
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,170
Kim Hyo Gyeong!

345
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,030
It's all over.

346
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,470
Your base at Hanter Productions

347
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,030
is all exposed now.

348
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,950
It's over.

349
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,200
Have you seen the devil before?

350
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,240
I've met the devil before.

351
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,420
Five of them.

352
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,870
Guess what the devil said.

353
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,660
The devil thinks it's a person.

354
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,960
If even one person had told the truth...

355
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,700
if I had received at least one apology...

356
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,150
I would've happily stopped then.

357
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,680
Kim Hyo Gyeong...

358
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,400
Don't move!

359
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:09,250
The truth from 35 years ago is in here.

360
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,240
I came all the way here for this.

361
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,040
Achieving your goal...

362
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,350
means your goal disappears.

363
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,060
Now...

364
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,040
what should I do?

365
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,410
Hyo Gyeong.

366
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,720
Can you take this over for me?

367
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,840
I will.

368
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,760
I will do that,

369
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,050
so let's go down together.

370
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,810
Wait, wait! Wait.

371
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,590
Hyo Gyeong.

372
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,590
That's enough now.

373
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,110
Let's go down together.

374
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,880
You have to meet your brother too.

375
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,550
Can you promise me one thing?

376
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:08,580
That you'll make sure to find the person who shot my brother.

377
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,130
Promise me!

378
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,210
I promise.

379
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,280
I'll make sure to catch the person.

380
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,020
 Yes. 

381
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,050
 They're at the annex? 

382
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,860
You said there was someone who pitied me.

383
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,730
What you said...

384
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,520
can I believe that?

385
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,770
All right... come over here.

386
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:32,110
 A mythical being with a lion's face, goat's body, 

387
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,700
 and a snake's tail. 

388
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,410
 A monster that kills people by breathing fire. 

389
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,270
 Chimera. 

390
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,080
 The monster Chimera who tormented humans, 

391
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,420
 dies in the hands of a hero. 

392
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,230
 Killed by Bellerophon... 

393
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,950
 a beautiful young man who came riding on Pegasus. 

394
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,170
   

395
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,090
Team Leader.

396
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,050
It's a copy of the recording file from Hyo Gyeong's phone.

397
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,760
The truth you were trying so hard to look for is in here.

398
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,640
Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae confessed.

399
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:28,580
The night of August 8, 1984 at Macheon Police Station.

400
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:35,090
That he was the person who murdered your father, Lee Sang Wu.

401
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,020
I think this was what Hyo Gyeong was trying to unveil until the very end.

402
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,630
We can't let this get out but I'll take responsibility for it.

403
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,120
The statute of limitations is over.

404
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:08,680
His crime can't be substantiated with just a confession, so it'll be difficult for it to be punishable by law.

405
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,710
Do as you wish.

406
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,150
 TN: Because of the history of the misuse of coerced confessions in modern Korea, 

407
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,200
 T.N. there cannot be any criminal conviction if the only evidence is a confession. 

408
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,220
Also this...

409
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,790
was found at Hyo Gyeong's hideout.

410
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,940
 Lee Jung Yeop 

411
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,760
 My fear that you may suffer from the decision I made 

412
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
 is painful to me. 

413
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,590
 Don't be sad, Cerberus. 

414
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,050
 I'm not proud of what I did. 

415
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,860
 But I don't regret it either. 

416
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,930
 So, you should walk a path you won't regret too. 

417
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:36,380
 Goodbye, Oppa. 

418
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,240
What brings you here?

419
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,210
Here. Let's have a drink.

420
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,230
What's with the mood?

421
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,540
We did a good job solving the case.

422
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,850
You're all going to go for round two of fun, yes?

423
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,030
Noraebang bar. How's that sound, Detective Im?

424
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,580
I feel a little under the weather.

425
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,430
It's my youngest's birthday. I'm sorry.

426
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,960
I have a date today too.

427
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,830
I need to get back.

428
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:05,080
I need to analyze the CCTV footage from Lee Jung Yeop's shooting.

429
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,770
Everyone's busy it seems.

430
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,800
Then shall just the two of us...

431
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,110
You said you didn't find anything from the CCTV though.

432
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,000
This is from the building across the street. I secured it today.

433
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,270
I'll do it. Leave it on my desk, then you can go home.

434
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,910
Can I do that?

435
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:41,410
Then I'll leave the CCTV footage on your desk and go home.

436
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,410
 Jungsan Police Station 

437
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,920
Are you looking for something?

438
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,990
What? Oh, well...

439
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,980
I just...

440
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:06,470
An avid drinker like you, didn't drink a drop of alcohol after Ha Na mentioned the CCTV footage.

441
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,460
Looking for it is of no use to you.

442
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,100
There was no such thing as a CCTV from the building across.

443
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,950
Hey, J-Jae...

444
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,780
J-Jae Hwan.

445
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:33,020
 Gunshot residue analysis result. 

446
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:39,660
We weren't able to find the gun, but there was gunshot residue found on the clothes.

447
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,120
Where did he get the gun from?

448
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,280
I think he stole the item we seized from Chinatown last year.

449
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:55,060
So you want to imprison a conglomerate Chairman for abetting a murder?

450
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,140
That's unheard of...

451
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,580
Are you scared?

452
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,220
What?

453
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,880
Well if you still have the desire to climb up the ladder, we can't do the investigation.

454
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,140
What will you do?

455
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,010
The lawyer you requested for will arrive soon.

456
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,800
Let me know if you need anything.

457
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,070
The judge who issued the warrant was Choi Sang Seob, right?

458
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:08,750
That guy did have a little bad blood with Seoryun.

459
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,750
The warrant wasn't issued because you guys did a good job.

460
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,250
Don't try too hard.

461
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:23,180
Everything in the world has already been decided anyway.

462
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,710
Chief Bae believed that he killed Lee Sang Wu.

463
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,970
Even until his death.

464
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,040
Did you think you could hide it forever?

465
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:47,050
For people like us... a crime isn't a crime.

466
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:49,240
It's a mistake.

467
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:02,840
Have you met the devil before?

468
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,180
They say the devil thinks it's a person.

469
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,190
I don't consider putting handcuffs on you as the end.

470
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:17,410
I'm going to make it so that you'll be charged for instigating Lee Jung Yeop's murder.

471
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:22,630
The recording file that Kim Hyo Gyeong left behind... it'll be revealed one day.

472
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,780
I'm curious.

473
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:33,330
If that'll be considered a mistake then.

474
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,950
Detective Cha.

475
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,260
How is your mother doing? You said she's unwell.

476
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,720
You've been very curious about my mom since before.

477
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,350
Is there something you want to say to me?

478
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,260
I don't.

479
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,240
Did you reconcile with the owner of that painting?

480
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,910
President Lee Hwa Jeong?

481
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:14,430
We didn't necessarily 'reconcile', but she gave me a ticket to the London Christmas concert as a farewell gift.

482
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,510
But she's still confiscating that painting of course.

483
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,700
She's really something too.

484
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,520
Her husband, Seo Hyeon Tae is in prison and it's because of you too.

485
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,640
I think she's just that kind of character.

486
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,190
A business woman through and through.

487
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,510
What about you, Eugene? When do you leave?

488
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,510
After Christmas.

489
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:52,630
Are you not going to see Detective Cha before you leave?

490
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:13,630
The fact that Ryu Seong Hui was Chimera... Kim Hyo Hyeong and I... we knew about everything.

491
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,790
I thought that Kim Hyo Gyeong was going to reveal all that...

492
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:23,510
But nowhere, not even on the internet, did they talk about Ryu Seong Hui.

493
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,720
Why did she do that?

494
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:38,840
You know... I didn't like Hyo Gyeong.

495
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,590
I thought she was someone that could justify her means by her goal.

496
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,880
But I don't know anymore now.

497
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,970
If Kim Hyo Gyeong's actions were simply violent crimes...

498
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,700
or if it was an effort to reveal the truth.

499
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:08,380
Also, if Han Ju Seok was true love or just another sinful act to cover up Ryu Seong Hui's crimes.

500
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,340
And Ryu Seong Hui the Chimera from 35 years ago...

501
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,510
if it was fair revenge as a mother who lost her child.

502
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,880
The answer is clear as a profiler.

503
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,190
But as a human... I don't think it is.

504
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,110
It's strange.

505
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:38,220
The more you try to understand humans... the more you can't.

506
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,520
Humans can never understand humans.

507
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,970
They say that's the first step in understanding humans.

508
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,410
I found the truth,

509
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,900
and saw the end too. But I don't know how to live from now.

510
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:07,300
By drinking beer at Cambridge like this and meeting your family and friends.

511
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,790
That's how you should spend your time.

512
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:18,010
Could you also remember us sometimes too?

513
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,260
I heard you were leaving today.

514
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,050
I'll give you a ride.

515
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,490
No, I called a taxi.

516
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,180
I heard Seo Hyeon Tae has been handed over to the prosecutors?

517
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,780
It was the last promise I made to Hyo Gyeong... to catch the culprit.

518
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:57,370
Don't you have something to say to me before you leave?

519
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,950
I'm not worried about you, Detective Cha.

520
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:09,170
You're someone who will make the right decision no matter what situation comes your way.

521
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,830
I'm sorry.

522
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,240
Nobody has apologized to you yet, did they?

523
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,960
I'm really sorry.

524
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,040
It's not your fault though, Detective Cha.

525
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,140
We said we were going to grab a drink, but I'm leaving without being able to keep that promise.

526
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,970
A day will probably come where you'll keep that promise.

527
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,160
Some day.

528
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,170
Take care.

529
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,790
 Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae of Seoryun, who was in trial early this morning on inciting murder charges,
  

530
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:34,520
 has been released. 

531
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,890
 The court has ruled him not guilty for the series of charges due to lack of evidence. 

532
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,850
 It's been reported that the prosecution has decided to not appeal, 

533
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,870
 which has lead to some people voicing criticism. 

534
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:48,780
So when did my wife say she's returning?

535
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:54,810
Present Lee said she'll be staying in New York for about a month after helping with your daughter's move.

536
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,680
This household is a mess.

537
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,250
She decides to go away the day her husband gets released.

538
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,580
What about Assemblyman Lee? Why has he been locked up at home?

539
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,950
Apparently he's not feeling too well after withdrawing from the party.

540
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:11,240
Withdrawing, my foot. He was ousted.

541
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:16,780
With the pride he has... he must be suffering quite a bit.

542
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,290
You received a present and message.

543
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,570
I've marked out the thank-you calls you have to make by today.

544
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,530
Get some rest and check the list please.

545
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:41,760
- I'm going to go wash up. Leave it in the audio room.
- Yes, sir.

546
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,000
 Wishing you great health, Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.
 Seoryun Group Presidents' Board 

547
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,280
 To: Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae 

548
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,900
 To: Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae. Always be healthy and we hope many good things will come your way. From: Seoryun Group Presidential Board 

549
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,220
 Prime Minister 

550
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,410
 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, 

551
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,520
in which the heavens will disappear with a roar;

552
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,180
 the elements will be destroyed by fire, 

553
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,590
 and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. 

554
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,560


555
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,720
 Thank you to Channel Manager kirara_chan 

556
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,590
 Thank you to segmenters: pilar_velasquez, kitty100, hana_860, and enayssac 

557
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:37,510

558
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,640

559
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,700

560
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,020
 Around 11A.M. this morning, 

561
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:55,610
 The head of Seoryun Group, Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae, passed away from an unknown explosion at his home. 

562
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:59,370
 Chairman Seo was arrested last year October for murder charges, 

563
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:03,190
 but was released 117 days later after being ruled 'not guilty'. 

564
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,020
 Some are saying, 

565
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:10,460
 this may be an extension of the Chimera case that has been ongoing since last August due to similar methods. 

566
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,520
 Speculations like this are cautiously arising. 

567
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,990
 The Chimera case, where there were four victims, 

568
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:21,350
 came to an end when the prime suspect Kim died right before her arrest. 

569
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,760
 Did Chimera, who has been reported dead, come back to life? 

570
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,080
 The public's attention is focused. 

571
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:40,600
 Hello, Eugene. Have you been well? 

572
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,920
 I received the book you sent me. 

573
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,090
 Tracing Chimera 

574
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,560
 My mother is doing well. 

575
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,700
 Although she can't recognize people very well anymore. 

576
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,900
It's still chilly.

577
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,880
Shall we make dumpling soup for dinner today?

578
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,310
 The book's preface was very memorable. 

579
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:12,080
 "The present is a shadow of the past and we all cannot be free from the past." 

580
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,880
I'm anxious...

581
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,170
because I'm so happy.

582
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:28,340
I wish the time would stop right now.

583
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:33,380
It feels like everything may disappear by tomorrow.

584
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:39,010
 "But instead of running away and denying it, if you find the courage to face it, 

585
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:44,000
 that's when we will finally gain freedom." This paragraph... 

586
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,910
I keep having a scary dream.

587
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:57,330
A dream where you turn cold, people die,

588
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:00,140
and the world burns.

589
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,260
Nothing will happen.

590
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,240
I guess so, President Seo.

591
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,160
Our baby...

592
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,510
I think he's a son.

593
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:37,610
You know...

594
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,250
I just get a feeling.

595
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:56,520
 Spring is here, but the wind is still biting. 

596
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:00,430
 It seems like if I want to welcome warmer days, 

597
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:04,680
 I'll have to endure longer and fight. 

598
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:27,360
â™«  Someone in that dark wave  â™«

599
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:35,070
â™«  is calling for dead-tired memories.  â™«

600
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:42,460
â™«  Has the truth somewhere  â™«

601
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:49,480
â™«  become the sun which lost its light?  â™«

602
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:55,150
â™«  Some people want to live  â™«

603
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:58,940
â™«  But turn their back on me  â™«

604
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:04,030
â™«  The time I lived as myself, not me  â™«

605
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,670
â™«  Some people say to me  â™«

606
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,130
â™«  Don't go.  â™«

607
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:13,770
â™«  She said don't go  â™«

608
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,700
â™«  Stay don't go tonight  â™«

609
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,700
 Chimera
