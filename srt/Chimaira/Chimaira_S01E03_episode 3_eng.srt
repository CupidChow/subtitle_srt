00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,280
 Chimera 

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,150
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality. 

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,500
 Han Myeong University 

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,600
Gosh, you came bright and  early.

6
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,550
Yes, there's a lot of work to be done today.

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,210
 June 9, 1984, Macheon City 

8
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,600
 ~ Episode 3 ~ 

9
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,060
Don't come, don't come!

10
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,490
Don't come! Please!

11
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,300
It's the water.

12
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,930
What?

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,760
It's the water!

14
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,300
Did you hear the story? They say the MO* of the crime was Chimera.   (*MO= method of committing a crime) 

15
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,850
Then, someone was burnt alive?

16
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,890
What is "chimera"?

17
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,090
There was a series of explosions in Macheon in Gyeonggi Province thirty years ago.

18
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,790
Do you know?

19
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,080
Because of that, lots of people were fired.

20
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,800
That's worse than I thought.

21
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,160
So did Chief Bae step in crap? Right before his promotion?

22
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,630
Jeez. 
   (TV news) From what we know so far, 

23
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,410
- He's here! 
  whether it was arson or murder 

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,420
 is not certain, but police are focusing on both possibilities 

25
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,980
 and we know they are investigating both. 

26
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,380
 Meanwhile, the whereabouts of Detective Cha, the first witness, 

27
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,260
- Turn that off! 
 is still unknown. 

28
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,830
 An official at Jungsan Police Station ... 

29
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,770
My gracious.

30
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,480
Who is Han Ju Seok?  He has 35 years of field experience.

31
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,650
Hey.  An incumbent detective and a superior police officer on top of that.  Does this make sense?

32
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,000
What were you all doing while things were going on like this?

33
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,550
Umm.  Because the impact on the public is so great,

34
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,960
for now, let's make an announcement about the incident ...

35
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
But reporters are not naive.  Talk about the chimera started immediately.

36
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,930
What do you mean chimera?  Who said that?

37
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,350
Yes, well, ... I think the word was mentioned because the pattern is similar.

38
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,660
It is the reporters' specialty to take pictures and attach labels to them.

39
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,800
No.  When did that case happen?

40
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,460
Why did you bring that up?  It's been a while since the culprit died.

41
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,970
Umm.  It's hard to say he was the culprit ...

42
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,000
The man died while being interrogated without even standing trial. So, well ...

43
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,360
No, he was the culprit. Yes. That's right.

44
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,300
An incumbent detective died.  And just two weeks before his retirement.

45
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,500
The culprit will be arrested within two weeks.

46
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,850
Set up an investigation headquarters immediately and mobilize all available personnel and resources.

47
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,530
Arrest everyone who has used a similar MO.

48
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,320
Until the bastard is apprehended,

49
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,090
don't even dream about sneaking home and changing your underwear! Understand?!

50
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,210
Stop.  Light.

51
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,250
Tweezer.

52
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,290
Who is he?

53
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,740
Go Gwang Su from the intelligence investigation team at headquarters.

54
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,040
He's exceptionally smart. He's both strong and fast.

55
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,340
Why hasn't he been promoted?

56
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,170
He's one of the stubborn ones.  He's not liked by his superiors and is indecisive.

57
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,100
 Police Officer Personnel Card 

58
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,330
 Go Gwang Su.  Graduated 1997 Silla High School. National Police University. 

59
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,540
- Are you from Silla High? 
 - Yes, I am.

60
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,640
- What class? 
 - The 48th.

61
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,850
If it's 48, ...

62
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,110
hey, we are twenty years apart.

63
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,260
It's 23 years because you are in the 25th class.

64
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,190
My, my, you are my hoobae  (junior) . Nice to meet you.

65
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,230
Sit, sit. Relax, relax.

66
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,860
Let's see.

67
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,140
Was your father a civil servant in Nam-do?

68
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,500
Yes.  He was in the Jeonnam provincial office.

69
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,780
Did he pass away already?

70
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,630
Yes, liver cirrhosis.

71
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,990
- Your family lives in the provinces and you're the only one that left home to study?  In Seoul? 
 - Yes.

72
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,690
Yes.  It doesn't matter where you're from. School is what's important.

73
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,690
I was in the Kendo club.  In Silla.

74
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,590
- Do you know it? 
 - Yes, I do.

75
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,110
- Were you at investigation headquarters from the start? 
 - No, I wasn't.

76
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,130
I was on a detective team during the Seonambu case.

77
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,560
Then, you've had a taste of it.

78
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,130
Yes.

79
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,670
I'm talking to my hoobae in front of me, but I feel like I'm dying.

80
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,440
What the hell is happening?

81
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Do you know who is handling human relations for cops nowadays? It's the murderers.

82
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,200
A long time ago, there was a guy who broke out of prison.

83
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,500
Every time a top official encountered the case, he had to take off his uniform  (resign),  one after the other.

84
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,060
This case is especially generating a lot of talk.

85
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,620
It's a major crisis that a police officer was abducted and murdered.

86
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,480
The media keeps trying to connect it to a different case. They are trying to create a story.

87
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,030
So is this something we should prolong or not?

88
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,700
I will take care of it promptly.

89
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,900
Okay, Gwang Su.

90
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,500
Hoobaenim! You're the only one I can rely on in this situation.

91
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,830
Let's work together and get a good outcome.

92
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,490
You should also make a big hit, huh?

93
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,870
Yes.

94
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,900
- Put it there. 
 - Yes.

95
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,500
I'll take this too.

96
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,220
What is it, all of this?

97
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,930
Starting now, Violent Crime Team 2's data will all belong to the headquarters' special investigation team.

98
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,830
Please organize and transfer all the rest of the data on your personal computers by the end of today.

99
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,870
Yes.

100
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,180
Who are you?

101
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,010
The team leader of the investigation team. He's from the main office.

102
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,740
- What are you doing?  Introduce yourself. 
 - Violent Crimes Team 2.

103
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,590
- Yes. 
- Yes.

104
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,380
As of today, you are all transferred.

105
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,020
You will work for the headquarters investigation team and provide support to the investigation.

106
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,840
Drop all the other cases you are working on, and direct leakage of the shared data will not be permitted.

107
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,250
That's it.  Do you have any questions?

108
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,320
According to whom?

109
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,240
- Seonbaenim. 
 - Detective Cha Jae Hwan?

110
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,610
Who said you can take the case as you want?

111
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,580
I heard you were at the scene at the time of the incident.

112
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,710
Write your statement about why you were at the scene with Han Ju Seok and the sequence of events after.

113
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,860
Describe everything you saw, heard, and know.

114
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,540
During the first meeting, do an official briefing without leaving out a single detail.

115
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,020
Shut up.  I won't turn over the case.

116
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,720
What?

117
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm going to catch the bastard. I won't let him win.

118
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,790
Seonbae.

119
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,120
Cha Jae Hwan. Can you stop peeing and pooping?

120
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,970
They are here to clean up the mess you guys made!

121
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,150
So put everything down and go.

122
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,790
Hey, Cha Jae Hwan, don't overstep your boundary.

123
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,780
This bastard.  What are you glaring at?  Damn. What are you intending?

124
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Detective Cha Jae Hwan.  You want to catch the culprit? Why?

125
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,360
Because it's agonizing?

126
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,480
Good.  I like that attitude.

127
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,420
You would have to feel guilty if you're a human.

128
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,840
Well.  Although it won't help with the investigation.

129
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,090
Get organized quickly. We don't have a lof time.

130
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,780
Why aren't you answering your calls? You made me come all the way here.

131
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,970
It was in the inside pocket.

132
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,930
I don't think it was Team Leader Han's. It seems like someone put it there.

133
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,780
It's up to you from here. This is all I can do.

134
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,300
Doctor.

135
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,110
I think the deceased old man was hiding something from me.

136
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,380
What the hell is this Chimera? What does he want...

137
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,640
Isn't there at least anything you know?

138
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,340
You knew him for 30 years.

139
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,200
I don't know.

140
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,160
It's true that I knew him for a long time.

141
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,240
What my wife said was right.

142
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,880
You don't even know the inside of the person with whom you live or have sexual relations.

143
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:26,080
When people are opened up, their internal organs are all the same. Isn't that right?

144
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,810
The only place where Buddha and the devil can live together

145
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,340
is inside the human stomach.

146
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,020
So, like I said, there was something you didn't know.

147
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,890
You didn't do anything wrong.

148
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,250
He's leaving us on a day when the weather is nice.

149
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,930
 Rest in Peace Han Ju Seok 

150
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,080
Move the case files to the data room.

151
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,450
 Rest in Peace Han Ju Seok 

152
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,210
Gun forward!

153
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,440
Fire one shot!

154
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,540
 Fire one shot!   

155
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,400
 Fire one shot!   

156
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,030
Water spilled, but it caught on fire?

157
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,820
So did the water burn?

158
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,900
From the sprinkler...

159
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,950
how many times do I have to say it?

160
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,200
It was probably not water. Maybe gasoline.

161
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,390
It was water.

162
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,950
Has that guy gone crazy?

163
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,300
He should say something that makes sense.

164
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,100
I don't think it's nonsense.

165
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,890
How do you know, man?

166
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,500
We worked together for so many years.

167
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,370
Seonbae, you should know this too!

168
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,130
Our Hyeong Jae Hwan is not  someone who would say something that didn't make sense.

169
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,990
It's always "our" Jae Hwan.

170
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,180
Are you in his fan club?

171
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,460
What did you say to the investigator?

172
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,360
- It's water. 
- What?

173
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,170
I don't know about anything else, but only H2O,  the component of water was found in the pipe connected to the sprinkler.

174
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,950
Then why was there a fire?

175
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,010
I don't know. We've never had a fire like this before.

176
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,840
Isn't it only flammable materials such as gas that can cause a fire?

177
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
I heard it was oxygen in the last incident.

178
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,840
This time, it's a little different.

179
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,290
Gas and oxygen are heavier than air and will fall on the ground.

180
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,820
Then the soot spreads rapidly radially from the ignition point.

181
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,320
That's why a drop of ink on top of water in a dish spreads.

182
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,630
 But this time it seems it rose straight up from the floor to the top. 

183
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,480
  Do not enter Police Line.   
  Investigation in progress      

184
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,690
  DIES IRAE    

185
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,710
Dies Irae.

186
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,630
What does that mean?

187
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,760
It means the day of wrath in Latin.

188
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,980
It's the first verse of the chant about the final judgment.

189
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,860
It's used in the mass for the dead.

190
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,520
Judgment day?

191
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,730
Judgment day in the Bible has two meanings.

192
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,610
Resurrection for those who believe and death for those who don't.

193
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,680
That's crazy.

194
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,030
So monsters and the Bible. Just what does he want to say?

195
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,620
When judgment day comes, Archangel Michael appears.

196
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,350
He puts the human souls on scales and picks out the sinners, and drops them into the fire of hell.

197
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:27,300
If the culprit is a judge, just what sin is he talking about?

198
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,790
Do you have any ideas?

199
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
Are you okay?

200
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,590
About what?

201
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,160
Have you been sleeping well these days?

202
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,670
Of course.

203
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,450
Why? Are you worried?

204
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,130
No.

205
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,490
Yes. A little.

206
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,110
There is nothing bothering me.

207
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,960
Really?

208
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,850
So there's nothing wrong with you.

209
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,400
Thank you for what you did today.

210
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,600
If that's all, shall we head back?

211
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,540
It's pretty obvious when someone hasn't been sleeping well.

212
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,940
Even if it's not to me,

213
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,770
you should talk to someone about what is bothering you.

214
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,220
Who said anything was bothering me?

215
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,690
Don't treat me like a patient. Don't pretend you're a doctor.

216
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,030
Being a profiler doesn't mean you know everything about a person.

217
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,710
Even people who have lived together as a family their whole lives don't know everything about each other.

218
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,940
I've said everything I didn't want to talk about. But the other side hasn't done anything at all.

219
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,370
That's what people are like.

220
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,870
Not even knowing anything.

221
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,910
Much better.

222
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,770
You said that the team leader was the detective in charge of the Chimera case?

223
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,840
He never said anything like that to me.

224
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Why did he hide it?

225
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,900
That silent old man.

226
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:57,260
What was there that he couldn't tell me? Even after 35 years, he couldn't trust me?

227
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,260
Isn't it just that he wanted to protect you?

228
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,680
You or someone else?

229
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:19,440
Protection. I couldn't do anything.

230
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,470
Investigator, I am...

231
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:34,410
Angry. I'm so angry I could go crazy.

232
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,040
If only I had been more careful,

233
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,290
if only I hadn't taken that one step. Or if I'd just called for backup at that moment.

234
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:52,190
It would have been enough for me to just stay still and make one phone call.

235
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,370
Why. Why, like an idiot couldn't I think of that...

236
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,790
 Psychology and Crime

Repeat offender?

246
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,770
What. So, is this a serial killer?

247
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,350
A vehicle explosion occurred in Shinil-dong on the 13th. The victim was Son Wan Gi.

248
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,000
On the 18th, the Shinil-dong perpetrator's hideout exploded.

249
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,500
And on the 23rd, the incident in Macheon City occurred. The victim

250
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,620
was Han Ju Seok. These three cases have the same pattern.

251
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,570
But that criminal's methods are different.

252
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,210
The criminal left a signature at the crime scene.

253
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,930
What signature?

254
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,550
This is the lighter that was in Son Wan Gi's car.

255
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,460
And this.

256
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,190
What?

257
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,550
- It's the same 
 - The lighter was released in  Lumière, France in 1983.

258
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:32,670
It's otherwise known as the Chimera. Since it is a custom-made item, there are only a few people in Korea who own one.

259
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,110
Is it a designer item? Something expensive?

260
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,160
If it's real, it could even be worth one million.

261
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,410
What? This would be worth one million won?

262
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,320
Of course.

263
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,680
Where was the second one found?

264
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,930
It came from the pocket of the team leader who died in Macheon City.

265
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,890
Wait.

266
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,890
So this is from inside Son Wan Gi's car?

267
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,530
Then why isn't it on the inventory list?

268
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,240
I found it in Team Leader Han's house.

269
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,340
- What? 
 - About that...

270
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,560
It looks like he accidentally took it home.

271
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,940
But I'm certain that it came from the scene.

272
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,090
Evidence with a compromised chain of custody has no value. You can't take this to court. 
  Chain of custody: continuity of evidence management. 

273
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,420
Are you just learning this now?

274
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,350
Can't you still take note of it for the investigation?

275
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,300
- What note? 
 - That this is the criminal's signature.

276
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,030
But what is this design?

277
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,780
The chimera.

278
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,090
The fire-breathing monster from Greek mythology.

279
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,280
In 1984, explosions with an unknown cause killed three people in a single month.

280
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,300
This is the so-called Chimera incident.

281
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,530
At that time, it was so brutal that it spawned ghost stories.

282
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,300
First, this is a picture of the scene where Son Wan Gi was murdered.

283
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,970
Look closely.

284
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:21,860
And second, this is a picture of the explosion at the criminal's hideout that was discovered while we were investigating Son Wan Gi's case.

285
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,540
Look closely.

286
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,400
And last. This is the third scene.

287
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,050
Not only this. But the victims, Son Wan Gi and Han Ju Seok were directly connected to the incident thirty-five years ago.

288
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,270
Connected?

289
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:02,150
The reporter for the Chimera case 35 years ago was Son Wan Gi.

290
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,010
And the lead investigator for the case was Han Ju Seok.

291
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,650
Check the message history for the messages that Team Leader Han received on the 18th.

  However, the day of God's reckoning will appear like a thief.  On that day, the sky will echo with deafening sounds and substances will be engulfed in flames.  

294
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,510
416 Shinil-dong,  Room 405   
 - Where are you? Why aren't you picking up? 
 - Independent action is prohibited. 

295
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,060
Was that a setup to lure Team Leader Han?

296
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,460
Yes.

297
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,580
Because that failed, they went on to the third kidnapping operation.

298
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:40,410
So are you saying that the Chimera criminal from 35 years ago has reappeared?

299
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,540
So why kill a reporter and detective?

300
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,860
It's a grudge relationship.

301
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,900
Was the criminal arrested for the case 35 years ago released?

302
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,940
He died.

303
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,970
- Why? 
 - When?

304
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,300
He died by suicide. Thirty-five years ago.

305
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,440
- Really? 
 - Of course.

306
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,620
So are you saying that the criminal is a ghost?

307
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,410
- Really? 
 - Let's stop this here.

308
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,100
Don't be mistaken.

309
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:18,300
The case we are trying to solve right now happened a few days ago. We aren't trying to solve something from 35 years ago.

310
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:24,120
Right now, a police officer has been killed. It's a really sensitive matter. But you want to talk about Chimera right now?

311
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,050
How do you think this will turn out?

312
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,750
- Are you trying to protect yourself? 
 - What?

313
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,780
Do you get in trouble when things get bigger for you because you're tied to the past? Yes, I understand how it goes.

314
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,650
But Team Leader Han is a police officer and

315
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,680
we're family. We're family, but you're worried about the issue getting bigger?

316
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,780
Hey Jae Hwan, that's not what we're talking about right now!

317
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,950
Then what are we talking about!

318
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,180
This jerk is really!

319
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,970
We're not even hoping for your support.

320
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,050
We just want you to allow us to investigate this ourselves.

321
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,600
These fools must be crazy. Watch how you speak to us!

322
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,150
There is a suspect.

323
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,750
 Clamp.   

324
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,000
 Dissect.   

325
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,980
Hold it.

326
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,250
Hold it. Won't you get a hold of yourself?

327
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,420
Suction.

328
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,480
 Jerome Edwards 

329
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,720
- Is that all? 
 Please just take the search and seizure warrant.

330
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,670
At least, have the vehicle driving record released or let me get the phone records.

331
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,370
I have this now.

332
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,310
If you were the prosecutor, is this convincing?

333
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,560
He went to the same gambling house as Son Wan Gi.  Is that the only evidence?

334
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,490
Something will definitely come out if you investigate further.

335
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,890
What was your point of contact with Team Leader Han Ju Seok?

336
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,900
Aside from any grudge, was there any circumstance showing the two of them were even acquainted?

337
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,700
He kept saying he didn't know Son Wan Gi, which was a lie.

338
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,540
If he wasn't the culprit, why did he lie?

339
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,000
Witnesses lie too!

340
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:44,150
Fine.  Let's say this case is a repeat of the Chimera Case.

341
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,530
Then it makes even less sense.

342
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,850
Chimera is a 35-year-old case. So 35 years ago,

343
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,430
how old would your suspect, Lee Jung Yeop, have been?

344
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,030
An elementary school student at best.

345
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:08,760
Hey Cha Jae Hwan.  Stop obsessing over the Chimera case and think after subtracting it.

346
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,730
Be objective and take a step back.  Is it reasonable to connect Son Wan Gi and Han Ju Seok?

347
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:21,190
Connection?  There is none.  It's impossible to prove the MO from thirty-five years ago.

348
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,130
Team Leader Han was in his 35th year in the Violent Crimes Division.

349
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:29,580
There isn't even something to have  a grudge over.  Do you know there are dozens of suspects?

350
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,710
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

351
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,870
 Police 

352
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,400
  Excuse me, but what is the matter?   

353
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,530
  I have something to ask Detective Cha.    

354
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,550
Oh, Seonbae Jae Hwan? He left earl–

355
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,790
Detective Cha

356
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,770
- Well then, I'm off to work outside the office. 
- Alright.

357
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,820
I didn't say anything.

358
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,460
Detective Cha. I was worried, you didn't even take your calls.

359
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,240
What are you doing?

360
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,570
I told you already. I came because I was worried.

361
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,230
You're not hurt?

362
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,220
What is it?  What will you eat after opening me up?

363
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,280
It's a feast for you

364
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,330
but we are in mourning right now.  This is a house of mourning.

365
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,830
Don't people like you have the bare minimum of manners?

366
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,360
Today I'm—

367
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,130
I'm not here as a reporter today, though.

368
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,360
What a great car. When will we ever drive something like this?

369
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,120
Stop talking about useless things and just look at this.

370
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,180
Hyeongnim, please straighten your face, okay?

371
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,050
People are going to mistake you for a car thief.

372
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,940
Hey, are you saying that because you're truly thinking about me?

373
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:44,000
Hey, then is anything because of me?  Yes?  I used to be the handsome one in Eulwang-ri. The handsome one. So don't talk about my face.

374
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,630
Yes, yes.  Please look at the angle.  Jeez.

375
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:54,660
Okay. The angle's good. Take out the card.

376
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,570
Thank you for your cooperation  We'll take the memory card for now...

377
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,430
 DIES IRAE    

378
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,490
Go slowly.

379
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,520
Why are you scared? You've been here before.

380
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,170
Try coming a hundred times to the scene where someone died.

381
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,970
Can you get used to this?

382
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,140
Seonbae, here. Should we start filming here?

383
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,960
No, the front might be better.

384
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,210
 DIES IRAE. 

385
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,420
Hyo Gyeong, didn't you hear a sound?

386
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,570
- What sound? 
 - I heard a sound.

387
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,890
- What sound are you saying you heard 
 - I really heard it.

388
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,560
Hey, shine the light over there.

389
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,230
You get scared so easily!

390
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,220
Why did you bring us to a place like this? Can we even use this footage?

391
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,400
Authorization after we gather the news.  Leave matters like that to me.

392
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,100
Seonbaenim please start filming from there, okay?

393
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,660
Seonbae. Here's the light.  Let's go, let's go.

394
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,480
Looks like you're coming back from somewhere

395
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,950
What is it?

396
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,350
You left work in the afternoon though.

397
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,240
Are you doing a background check on me now?

398
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,870
What can I do for you?

399
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,690
I was wondering

400
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,020
how you have been?

401
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,920
Please leave.

402
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,320
Seems like an invasion of privacy.

403
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,500
You must have been somewhere in the mountains.

404
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,240
Be careful.

405
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,560
Korea is smaller than you think.

406
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,130
You've got paint on you.

407
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,630
You should take it to the dry cleaners.

408
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,830
 Here. It might be better here. 

409
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,870
 No. 

410
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,910
 Exit 

411
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,150
Gasoline?

412
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,350
The reason for the fire at Team Leader Han's crime scene is gasoline?

413
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:40,430
It's true that water poured from the sprinklers, but that has nothing to do with the cause of the fire.

414
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,530
If you take a look at the chromatogram here, do you see the flames?

415
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,720
This is the component of gasoline. It appeared to be the highest.

416
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,020
Gasoline?

417
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,820
Yes. They said that gasoline caused the fire.

418
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,140
I couldn't smell anything similar to gas at the scene though.

419
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,060
Then what came out of the sprinklers? You said that was water.

420
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,870
They said the water pouring was a coincidence.

421
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,000
Does that make sense?

422
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:11,560
I saw it with my own eyes. The fire came from the water,

423
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,600
but no one believes me.

424
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,230
Even I, who saw it think it's absurd, so who will believe me?

425
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,800
Me.

426
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,540
I'm saying, I believe in chemistry.

427
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
 Silver Nitrate. Magnesium. 

428
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,770
This is FBI Profiler Eugene Hathaway.

429
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:01,390
She is an expert in explosive terrorism and is now dispatched to the Central Office.

430
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,640
So? Just what do you want to investigate that you even brought a terrorism expert?

431
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,310
The cause of the fire that occurred in Macheon city on the 23rd,

432
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,820
is this.

433
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,720
 Silver Nitrate, Magnesium    

434
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,450
 Take a look at the chromatogram. 

435
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,580
 Gas. Water. Magnesium. Silver. 

436
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,120
That examination has already been completed. The conclusion was that it was gasoline.

437
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,420
It was not gasoline. The samples were contaminated.

438
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,280
Contaminated?

439
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,550
That means it was mixed with something else. Are you saying the Crime Scene Forensic unit are fools?

440
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:36,310
The error occurred due to the distinctive factor of the scene being a construction site.

441
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,750
When crude oil extracts, such as paint or synthetic resin burn,

442
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,550
it appears similar to a flammable substance like gasoline.

443
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,280
The real cause is the rest of the ingredients.

444
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,090
Can you see the magnesium oxide here?

445
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,890
So you're saying the magnesium burnt, right?

446
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,280
To be exact, it combined with oxygen.

447
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,460
Some metals explode in response to water.

448
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,240
Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium

449
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,490
Among these, magnesium belongs to a highly explosive metal group.

450
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,670
Magnesium is highly explosive and is quite dangerous.

451
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,320
There is a risk of explosion even if subjected to shock or an increase in humidity.

452
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,330
So, another substance is mixed in to stabilize it.

453
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:35,080
And that is silver nitrate.

454
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,140
Silver nitrate is highly toxic, so you have to be careful when handling it

455
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,370
so that it doesn't touch your skin.

456
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,330
Now I'm going to drop in some water.

457
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,040
When ions of silver nitrate are dissolved in water, nitric acid and magnesium bind to each other,

458
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,720
then it becomes magnesium nitrate.

459
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,340
Magnesium nitrate made like this reacts with water and explodes.

460
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,460
This is the magic of setting water on fire that Detective Cha witnessed.

461
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,740
Stop with that, my gosh.

462
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,400
But can this be used as evidence?

463
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,860
Isn't that all sold at industrial complexes?

464
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,220
Customs clearance is prohibited for ignitable substances such as magnesium.

465
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,080
The culprit obtained this in large quantities?

466
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,340
Is that possible?

467
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,750
Magnesium powder is a medicine

468
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:49,280
Silver nitrate is diluted and used as a disinfectant.

469
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,440
Obtaining them is possible

470
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,680
if the culprit is a doctor.

471
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,190
That is just circumstantial.

472
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,230
What?

473
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:06,210
A statement showing the culprit personally purchased those goods or video evidence.

474
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,780
We need those more right now. Isn't that so?

475
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,170
The black box video in front of Team Leader Han's house is out.

476
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,500
 Hemorrhagic cerebral infarction 

477
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,660
Team one, go to the office. Team two, go to the parking lot.

478
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,510
- Yes. 
 - Run.

479
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,250
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop.

480
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,350
Yes?

481
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,630
You are under arrest without a warrant for the two murders of Son Wan Gi and Han Ju Seok.

482
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,000
You have the right to remain silent and to an attorney.

483
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,210
You'll have to wait.

484
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:22,370
I have a patient in his 60s who takes care of his two granddaughters. Let me save him.

485
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,720
He has a hemorrhagic cerebral infarction.

486
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,790
It took an hour for him to be found, an hour to get to the hospital, and in three hours I won't be able to do anything.

487
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,800
What would you like to do?

488
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,400
 Melatonin 

489
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,900
 Goodnight. Non-habitual sleep inducer. 

490
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,200
 Restful Sleep. Melatonin. 

491
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,840
We looked around everywhere

492
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,000
but we can't find anything.

493
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,030
What do you mean there's nothing?

494
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,260
Bloodstains, chemicals,

495
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:19,500
well, at least the things we're looking for aren't in this house.

496
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,960
Did you find anything?

497
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,070
There was no rice but only medicine.

498
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,580
Medicine? What kind of medicines are these?

499
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,820
Sleep inducers.

500
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,590
This house doesn't seem like a place where someone is living.

501
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,670
- Why? 
 - There's no junk.

502
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,330
There's no sense of a lifestyle or preference.

503
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:46,500
It feels like a hotel room.

504
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,950
Seonbae, should we also take this?

505
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,780
What is that?

506
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,360
It looks like it's a painting.

507
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,300
Just leave it.

508
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,070
What's the matter?

509
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,570
It's nothing.

510
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,980
I said it's nothing.

511
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,040
What is it?

512
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,060
It's just a painting.

513
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:04,230


514
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:08,080
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

515
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,790
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

516
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:17,410
♫  The time I lived with me  ♫

517
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,540
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

518
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,490
 Chimera 

519
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,360
 Investigator, what's your strategy? 

520
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,820
 My strategy is to pressure him until he breaks. 

521
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,610
 I am ncredibly good at finding things that are strange. 

522
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,580
 If there's something you want to know, ask a proper question. 

523
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,710
 Why did you kill him? Why?! 

524
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,000
 There are two cases in a row with the same MO. 

525
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,970
 Lee Jung Yeop, you are more of a coward than I thought. 

526
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,550
 Even if the mutt I was taking care of died, I wouldn't do this! 

527
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,740
 Who is the culprit? 

528
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,370
 No, who's next?
