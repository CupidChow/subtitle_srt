1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,970


2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,230
 Chimera 

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,240
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality. 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,960
 Episode 11 

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,520
Mom.

6
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,080
- Mom.   
 - Huh?

7
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,740
This is the chairman of Seoryun Group, Seo Hyeon Tae.

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,470
Who did you say this is?

9
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,240
She is my mother.

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,420
Chairman, you need to get going.

11
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,190
All right.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,990
Then, I'll see you later.

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,490
Yes.

14
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,030
Mom.

15
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,830
Mom, it's okay.  Why are you so nervous?

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,120
Let's go.  It's okay, it's okay.

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,050
You just need to have a few tests done and then get treated.

18
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,190
What's the matter?

19
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,960
Mom.  Mom.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,620
Mom.

21
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,950
It's a big problem.  You keep getting dizzy, Mom.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,740
Drink this.

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,220
Mom, here.

24
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,620
I'm fine.

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,830
Thank you.   (TN: She's speaking formally to her son.) 

26
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,660
Pineapple.

27
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,420
That is ...

28
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,820
Take your time.

29
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,690
- I am sorry. 
 - No problem.

30
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,460
Everyone is like that.  If you're asked something suddenly, you can't answer something that you know.

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,450
Have you had anything particularly worrisome happen recently?

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,020
Sometimes something weird will appear.

33
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,220
Is that usually what is going to cause the symptom?

34
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,500
What kind of thing appears?

35
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,990
It's a fire.

36
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,570
A fire?

37
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,960
It is not like a dream.

38
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,290
It's so vivid.

39
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,130
Can you tell me in detail?

40
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,010
It's a house, an old-fashioned house.

41
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,250
The TV is even black and white.

42
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,260
I'm changing the channel like this.

43
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,040
Even the windows are old-fashioned glass.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,560
There's a big radio and an oil-burning stove.

45
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,850
It's rather specific.

46
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,260
I think there's a fire in that house.

47
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,490
In the other room, there is a child.

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,790
A very young child.

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,720
I was on my way to save her.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,740
I couldn't move my body.

51
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,840
Then, at that point, I wake up.

52
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,700
That's it.

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,540
I see you've had a lot of stress all this time.

54
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
Team Leader Moon. About Detective Cha Jae Hwan.

55
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,590
You need to find out about him. Don't go through other people.

56
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,900
I think he is from the Jungsan Police Station.

57
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,170
Wouldn't it be faster to do it through Chief Bae?

58
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,370
Chief Bae doesn't need to know about it.

59
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,690
Focus especially on family relationships.

60
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,700
I heard he lives with a single mother.

61
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,400
Where she lives, what she does, and how she lives.

62
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,770
All of it.

63
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,400
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:50,530
She only did it briefly but she spoke formally to me, as though we were meeting for the first time.

65
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,630
Why is she doing that?

66
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,450
Is she gradually getting worse?

67
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,430
I think in your mother's case

68
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,630
she is perceiving the illusion not only through images but also through physical sensations.

69
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,400
She is being reminded of old memories and is being confused with her current memory.

70
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,880
There are rare cases like that.

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,720
If it's old memories, could they be before the accident?

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,760
I guess she has no memories before the accident at all.

73
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,690
None at all.

74
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,900
Is that possible?  It was 35 years ago.

75
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,360
The accident was 35 years ago?

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,520
Yes, 1984.

77
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,200
Take a look at this.

78
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,200
Seung Gwan said Lee Jung Yeop has been seeing all sorts of people.

79
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,700
From a UBS reporter to an investigation team detective.

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,410
He seems to have won over the opposing side.

81
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,350
Why is this detective meeting with Lee Jung Yeop?

82
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,130
I heard they are digging into the 35-year-old Chimera incident.

83
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,200
Look at this. Do you know who this person is?

84
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,660
Kim Hyeong Guk.

85
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,080
The attorney for Lee Sang Wu during the chimera incident.

86
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,480
Do you know who his daughter is?

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,550
She is a UBS news reporter.

88
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:46,160
Could they be ...  preparing a special on Chimera?

89
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,980
Do you know?

90
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,430
I hear they are poking around and trying to lump Chimera and Evergreen together.

91
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,850
I've sent the Planning and Coordination Office to handle it.

92
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,160
Look at them.

93
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,660
We left it alone and it's returned right under our noses.

94
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,010
- Min Gi. 
 - Yes.

95
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,100
- About Seong Hui. 
 - Who?

96
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,610
Ryu Seong Hui.

97
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,390
The Ryu Seong Hui from back then? What about her?

98
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
If ...

99
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,030
If she is alive, then what will happen?

100
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,190
What are you talking about?

101
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,790
She died so long ago.

102
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,250
Don't feel guilty, there's no need.

103
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,560
Is it your fault that she died?

104
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,040
It was an accident. An accident.

105
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,600
 Here's the notice. I finally got positive feedback from Washington about our new team. 

106
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
Oh, the team that you mentioned.

107
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
 And, I'm sure that I can get confirmation soon. 

108
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,250
That's great.  I'm happy for you.

109
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,000
 Honey, it's your team too. 

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,850
 As you know, I strongly recommended you to be one of our members. 

111
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,160
 So, what do you think? 

112
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Count me in.

113
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,420
 Okay. Then, when will you come back? 

114
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
 Hello? 

115
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,910
Well, you know I've been working on a book.

116
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,570
  Your book? Seriously? 

117
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,150
I was hoping I could finish it.

118
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,190
You've been waiting for your chance to prove yourself for ages.

119
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,710
 Now, finally, a once in a lifetime chance is knocking at your door. 

120
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,260
 I know you need time to wrap things up. 

121
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,900
 Remember. I can't wait for you forever. 

122
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
Yeah.

123
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,230
I mean, that guy is Lee Sang Wu's son,

124
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,020
but why are we worried about him? Does that make any sense?

125
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,110
I'll take care of that punk!

126
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,780
Who will you send to make another mistake?

127
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,660
Hyeongsunim (Sister-in-law), why are you saying that?

128
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,620
He's going to say that his father died while being questioned by the police.

129
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
How are you going to handle it?

130
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,240
This is a data analysis sent from the Strategic Planning Office. 
 Main Effects on Subsidiaries When TH-5 Information Is Released 

131
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,120
If Lee Jung Yeop discusses TH-5, regardless of whether it's true or not,

132
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,990
the moment it becomes a controversy,

133
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,780
the company's image will inevitably fall.

134
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,860
This will be more fatal overseas.

135
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,360
If the major businesses in the industry fail because of the investments being blocked,

136
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,370
then the problem will soon cross the oceans to the market there.

137
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,390
If that happens, then we will lose our rank in the business world instantly.

138
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,030
If Lee Jung Yeop opens the floodgates, the Evergreen victims will rise up too.

139
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,320
And if the media also blindly follows along, what will be the next consequence?

140
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,970
The prosecutor's office will probably intervene.

141
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,560
Let's nip it in the bud.

142
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,740
It's best to block the issue before it explodes.

143
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,560
What do you want to do?

144
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,690
He's your employee.

145
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,140
Let's send him away.

146
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,720
Send him abroad?

147
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,430
Just deport him? No way. He's a murderer.

148
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,660
It'll be sad just hearing the story

149
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,830
of a young and handsome doctor from England,

150
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,380
an adoptee with an unfortunate family history.

151
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,610
If someone like that points blame at the police, prosecutors, and conglomerates,

152
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,570
the public will probably go crazy.

153
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,540
If that is so, why did you tell me to release him?

154
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,660
You told me to release him, even as I was embracing the dying Yong Bok–

155
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,540
Seung Gwan.

156
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,360
That's enough!

157
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,750
Oppa.

158
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,970
Please use your influence at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

159
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,920
So that there are no rumors, make it a top priority.

160
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,390
Will he leave nicely if he's told to do so?

161
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,310
We need to isolate him.

162
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,120
Cover his eyes and mouth and cut off his arms and legs.

163
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,150
Within 24 hours, as soon as possible.

164
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,970
What do you mean the team is being disbanded? Why?

165
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,820
The investigation is over.

166
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,350
As soon as Kang Sang Gu completes his statement,  it's officially disbanded.

167
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,290
Just-Just like that?

168
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,810
Does it end just like that, huh?

169
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,430
Just take a look.  Please! Team Leader!

170
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,580
Don't go overboard.

171
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,800
He's very sorry.

172
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,460
What do you mean by that?

173
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,390
Sunbae, I heard you've been recommended for a one-rank promotion to team leader.

174
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,290
- Congratulations. 
 - What?

175
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,140
Hey, we all worked hard together but someone else does very well for himself.

176
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,760
Why? Seonbae Cha played the team leader role so many times.  Who captured Kang Sang Gu?

177
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,310
Of course, our Jae Hwan played many roles.

178
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,860
But at important moments, he's always out by himself.

179
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,620
I don't know what he does when he goes out.

180
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,400
Hey, you need to fix things like that.

181
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,610
I know you want to stand out by yourself,

182
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,570
but let's share information. Why are we a team?

183
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,850
In any case, Jae Hwan is so talented.

184
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm dying of jealousy.

185
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,590
Hey ...

186
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,010
What do you mean re-edited?

187
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,280
The broadcast is tomorrow!

188
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,080
How dare you raise your voice?

189
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,660
What about the interviews with the bereaved families of the Evergreen incident victims?

190
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,400
If we leave out all the documents about TH-5, it's just a Kang Sang Gu special.

191
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,560
If it's not relevant to the topic, you need to know how to kick it out boldly.

192
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,870
But if it's done as you say, won't you be excluding a crime?

193
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,700
Your focus is wrong. Bomb! Bang!

194
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,260
How did an ordinary university employee make it by himself at home? That's the focus.

195
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,220
There are so many sensational spots.

196
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,540
Let's say we're not talking about Seoryun.

197
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,110
Why is everything about the Chimera omitted?

198
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,320
What do you mean omitted?  Kang Sang Gu called and said, "I am Chimera."

199
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,850
- It's all coming out. 
 - What about talking about 35 years ago?

200
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,860
No substance. No criticism. No revelation.

201
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,790
What's the point if we're not really going to talk about current affairs?

202
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,420
If it's like that, I won't attach my name to this.

203
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,470
You don't want to do it? Don't.

204
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,890
Did I tell you in advance? Or didn't I?

205
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,180
If you had set the right direction at the start,

206
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,360
would you have had such a hard time editing it?

207
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,150
You also have to know how to listen to people.

208
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,680
You're not the only one living in this world.

209
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,910
If I'm not alone,

210
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,120
who am I going to kiss up to?

211
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,040
Kim Hyo Gyeong.

212
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,170
You...

213
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,330
are full of it nowadays.

214
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,520
Kang Sang Gu is not Chimera.

215
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,800
Go ahead and say on the broadcast that he is Chimera.

216
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,520
And after saying that, when the real one shows up,

217
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,290
then how are you going to fix it?

218
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,590
Welcome.

219
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,770
It's been a long time, Lawyer Kim Hyeong Guk.

220
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,090
How have you been doing?

221
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,520
The lawyer's associations didn't know anything about you.

222
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,190
Your face looks good. I guess life has been easy.

223
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,290
I've been giving many people a chance to choose.

224
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,700
When I meet someone, I always ask this question.

225
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,220
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

226
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,770
With the life you chose yourself?

227
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,080
 35 years ago 

228
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,790
A petition.

229
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,000
A complaint.

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,020
Lee Sang Wu didn't commit suicide?

231
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,860
You want to reveal the results of the investigation?

232
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,940
There are statements from people at investigation headquarters and the doctor who examined the body.

233
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,860
- The people who were on duty the day Lee Sang Wu died– 
 - You bastard!

234
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,560
Hey, Kim Hyeong Guk, you're a lawyer, not a prosecutor.

235
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,620
Who are you to investigate? Huh?

236
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,430
Spreading rumors is promoting social instability.

237
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,890
You say you are Lee Sang Wu's friend.  Are you a red commie too?

238
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,960
Your elder sister is a teacher

239
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,580
and your younger brother is a soldier.

240
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,960
Should a red come out of a model family?

241
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,850
Burn it.

242
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,830
Burn it with your own hands.

243
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,190
Why have you come to see me?

244
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,740
You know Lee Jung Yeop, don't you?

245
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,640
I heard you met him often since his return to Korea.

246
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, he is the son of your dead friend so you would want to treat him well.

247
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,610
I know you've encouraged him.

248
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,420
While you said "Your father died unfairly," and such, he must've blown up.

249
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,780
What do you mean by that?

250
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,930
You knew, right?

251
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,870
He's doing exactly what his father did.

252
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,350
No, Tae Yeong is—

253
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,760
He is not the child.

254
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,520
Getting divorced

255
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,280
and raising a young daughter by yourself must have been hard.

256
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,430
I heard she is a reporter. She looks smart, unlike her parents.

257
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,660
I've seen a lot of people fail at making a living as a reporter.

258
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,800
When they are fired as a reporter for writing a false report,

259
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,020
it's hard to get another job. They don't want to be pulling a handcart.

260
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,330
They are trapped at home, hanging around in a corner of a room.

261
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,570
Many die before 40 from cancer.

262
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,940
The wives sell cosmetics and deliver yogurt to send the kids to school.

263
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,490
What a life they lead.

264
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,030
When they were out shouting nonsense,

265
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,890
they probably thought they were heroes.

266
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,070
Your daughter's image is good.

267
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,480
She should do well.

268
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,330
She might become an anchor later.

269
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,000
Don't mess

270
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,440
with that child.

271
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,190
If you mess with my child,

272
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,660
I'll kill you all.

273
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,860
Look at that.

274
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,830
That's why I believe in fear more than in conscience.

275
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,270
Fear makes you hide more.

276
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,700
It's what makes humans human, which may lead to the right choice.

277
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,610
Think carefully...

278
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,220
on what the right choice is.

279
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,340
Dad!

280
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,950
No, no. Leave it. Leave it.

281
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,350
 Case Analysis of TH-5 Casualties 
 Lee Jung Yeop 

282
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,520
What were you doing when you fell?

283
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,920
I think the fluorescent light is dying.

284
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,240
Her name is Cha Eun Su. She was born in Gaepo City in 1959.

285
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,480
She was an unregistered person who obtained her resident registration number in 1984.

286
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,710
1984?

287
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,260
What about before?

288
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,840
There's no record of her.

289
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,570
She registered during the reporting period for unregistered citizens.

290
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,190
Is that possible?

291
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,960
In the past, there were lots of cases in which there were errors or omissions.

292
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,160
If there were no problem with the identity confirmation by the police, it would have been processed.

293
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,520
Could she have laundered her identity?

294
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,050
If it was the 80's, the fingerprints were not all computerized.

295
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,780
So it would have been possible with help from someone inside the police force.

296
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,280
A person who helped.

297
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,760
- Her marriage?  I heard her husband died.

298
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,660
There's no record of any spouse. She's a single mother.

299
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,590
- There is no spouse? 
 - No.

300
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,590
She has only herself and her son on her family relationship certificate.

301
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,790
There are no other relatives.

302
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,490
Hello, Reporter Kim.

303
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,990
Why did you come to see me?

304
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,270
We're going to play badeuk together. I suddenly have some free time.

305
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,520
Excuse me?

306
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,380
You know that I am preparing a broadcast about the Chimera, right?

307
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,550
The show is right around the corner but there's been some external pressure.

308
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,230
I'm supposed to exclude any talk about the 1984 Chimera or TH-5.

309
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,730
You didn't go to the badeuk club that day but you went somewhere else, right?

310
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
It was Lawyer Kim Hyeong Guk's office.

311
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,800
How do you know each other?

312
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,620
Why did you visit the office of the lawyer

313
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,750
of the prime suspect of the 35-year-old Chimera Case?

314
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,620
Just what is your relationship?

315
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,230
It's just a personal relationship.

316
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,190
Lee Jung Yeop. I didn't come today as a reporter.

317
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,990
I came here as Kim Hyeong Guk's daughter.

318
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,250
Dau-daughter?

319
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,720
I guess my Dad didn't talk about me at all.

320
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,100
Well, he didn't talk about family—

321
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,420
He didn't tell me about you either.

322
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,570
He has many secrets.

323
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,380
The fact that he was the lawyer in the Chimera case 35 years ago,

324
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,140
he still is hiding from me.

325
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,730
Why does the person who has been avoiding his past

326
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,550
come now to see the lawyer of the suspect in the Chimera Case?

327
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,110
And why are they working together on an analysis of the data on casualties of TH-5.

328
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,110
That's strange, isn't it?

329
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,690
Who are you?

330
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,360
Reporter Kim, why are you so obsessed with the Chimera Case?

331
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,250
Because I want to restore the reputation of a failed lawyer.

332
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,780
Restoring your father's reputation is an excuse.  Isn't the real reason your own ambition?

333
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,690
Don't talk so easily as a third party in this.

334
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm not. And I'm not a third party.

335
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,510
What do you mean?

336
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,240
Sorry. I've got a call.

337
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,470
Who are you?

338
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,940
What's your identity?

339
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,780
See you again.

340
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,410
 He was only seven at the time (In English) 

341
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,270
 We all live in the past. (In English) 

342
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,690
 Our memories define us. (In English) 

343
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,150
 The past is what makes us who we are. (In English) 

344
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,900
 Hello. 

345
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,570
 Hello. 

346
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,700
 Hello, Miss Eugene. Have you been well? 

347
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,070
 I have a favor to ask of you. 

348
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,770
 Go ahead. 

349
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,100
 Can I quote what you said about the past? 

350
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,160
 It will go into my book. 

351
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,370
 What did I say? 

352
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,350
 "It's memories that make us human 

353
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,180
 because everything that is happening now is a result of the past." 

354
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,890
 You can use it if you need to. 

355
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,520
 Let's have a meal in exchange. 

356
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,930
 Yes, let's do that. 

357
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,090
 Thank you. 

358
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,530
 How about dinner tonight? 

359
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,490
Every time I look at this, I think of the Sword of Damocles.

360
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,840
One day the king invited his servant Damocles, who had no respect for the king

361
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,240
to a banquet and placed him in the seat of power.

362
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,040
Using one hair of a horse's tail,

363
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,640
the king hung a sharp sword over Damocles' head.

364
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,720
Feel the sensation of sitting on the throne looking at a sword

365
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,130
that you don't know when will fall.

366
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,280
What did Damocles feel?

367
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,120
The evening flight to London.

368
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,340
I'm sad our relationship is ending this way.

369
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,020
Don't misunderstand.

370
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,540
I don't bear a grudge against you personally.

371
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,510
Stay here until it's time to leave.

372
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,600
I'll send you the rest of your things.

373
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,700
This painting is being given to you as a consolation award.

374
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,900
No thanks.

375
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,680
Relax your face. Are we enemies?

376
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,240
Come to think of it, I don't even know your real name.

377
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,040
Lee Sang Wu's son.

378
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,050
Is that your response?

379
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,510
My father died an innocent man.

380
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,380
What do you have to lose?

381
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,930
Is it so hard to admit a mistake?

382
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,640
I just wanted to know the truth.

383
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,690
You just wanted to know the truth?

384
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,180
Is that really all?

385
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,280
Is this the action of someone who just wants to know the truth?

386
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,470
You've been diligently researching TH-5.

387
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,040
Someone might think that you are a person preparing to go to war against Seoryun Group.

388
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,960
Didn't I tell you to bet your flesh and blood if you're going to threaten someone?

389
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,350
Why are you so selfish?

390
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:41,260
It's all right to leave, but you should think of the rest of us here.

391
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,170
I heard you're close to Kim Hyeong Guk.

392
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,300
He was struggling so much to make a living

393
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,100
after his wife divorced him

394
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,580
that he couldn't even hang his lawyer shingle until the end of the 20th century.

395
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:19,050
He worked so hard so that his daughter would not starve. Didn't you know?

396
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,390
If you don't oppose Seoryun in the future,

397
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm sure everything will be fine and dandy for both Kim Hyeong Guk and his reporter daughter.

398
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,820
 Business Class Ticket 21:05 
 United Kingdom Passport 

399
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,490
Please let me answer.

400
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,790
 Lee Jung Yeop 

401
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:52,470
 Calling Lee Jung Yeop 

402
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,790
Don't hurt your hands.

403
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,110
Those hands are worth a million dollars.

404
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,560
Bastard.

405
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,080
Don't move.

406
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,410
What I just put into your arteries will kill you in five minutes.

407
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,840
Don't lift your hands and stay still.

408
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,370
Let me borrow your car.

409
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,630
Ah, welcome.

410
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,870
Yes. Have a seat.

411
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,430
There, shall we have a drink?

412
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,530
Yes, how is your mother?

413
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,640
It seemed she was not feeling well when you escorted her to the hospital.

414
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,540
She has symptoms of cognitive impairment.

415
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,390
If there is cognitive impairment, is it dementia?

416
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,170
How old is she?

417
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,320
Her 60th birthday is this year.

418
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,240
- Is she 59? 
 - Yes.

419
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,790
She's not that old. How did she end up like that?

420
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,310
She's had a hard time recently.

421
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:00,190
Long ago she had a big accident.

422
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,100
Accident?

423
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,520
Tell me about it. We can't pretend I don't know because I saw her at the hospital.

424
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,400
I'll introduce you to an expert physician.

425
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:32,070
She injured her head in the traffic accident before I was born.

426
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,820
Whether it's a fortune or misfortune, she has no memory of it.

427
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,590
No memory?

428
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,720
She doesn't remember anything before the accident.

429
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,450
For how long?

430
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,560
Until when is she unable to remember?

431
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,110
Did I ask something too personal?  I'm sorry.

432
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,070
Not at all.

433
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:12,610
My mother had Parkinson's Disease.

434
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:20,780
My father ran a factory but he was spread too thin. It upset my mother a lot.

435
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,220
Well, even if she had a son, she was left alone.

436
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,480
You're a pretty good drinker.

437
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,320
My mom can't drink a drop.  I must have taken after my father.

438
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,030
I, too, where ever I go, I've never lost at drinking.

439
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,320
If you and I drank together you would get dead drunk.

440
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,950
And you're older than me, too.

441
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,240
Gosh.  Hey, bomb expert.

442
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,050
Do you want to see my real bomb today?

443
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,130
Kwang Soo, hey punk.

444
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,550
Do well.

445
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,250
Do you know your special one-rank promotion is all due to your seonbaes (seniors).

446
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,400
I know it.

447
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,750
When you go to headquarters, the road ahead will ...

448
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,920
So, to the seonbaes,

449
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,170
no, those bastards, no matter how much they ignore you or act like jerks, endure it.

450
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,490
Umm, Seonbaenim. I'm curious about something.

451
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,740
What?

452
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,100
I heard you were on the Chimera investigation team 35 years ago.

453
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,690
Which punks are talking about that?

454
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,090
The sunbae investigators at headquarters.

455
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:19,240
Anyhow, they enjoy talking about someone else's business.

456
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,370
What else do you have to say?

457
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,280
Say it.

458
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,610
I heard you were close to the dead Ham Yong Bok.

459
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:32,730
Hey.  Don't recklessly bring that up.

460
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,770
I'm sorry.

461
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:40,610
During the white phosphorus incident, I noticed you two were particularly interested.

462
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,150
Particularly.

463
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,360
Everything is useless after you die.

464
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,640
Yong Bok was such a loyal guy.

465
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,140
There's no one like that now.

466
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,090
You must know as you too are on a team and have seen it.

467
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:05,960
Nowadays everyone's busy making a living. Who takes on someone else's blunder?

468
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,950
Blunder?

469
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,470
Stop spouting nonsense and just drink.

470
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,910
Come in.

471
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,380
- Take a seat. 
 - Sure.

472
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,460
The investigation headquarters has been disbanded and Team Leader received a special one-rank promotion.

473
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,250
They are muffling him.

474
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,500
Did you hear about reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong?

475
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,410
What about her?

476
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,940
She was told to remove all the parts about Chimera from the program.

477
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,700
They're deporting you. They are acting rapidly.

478
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,900
They are hunting rabbits. We don't have a chance to respond.

479
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,510
What are you going to do now?

480
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:01,630
When the Seoryun staff starts to move, there's almost nothing we can do.

481
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,680
What is it?

482
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,370
But you said "we."

483
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,750
I was surprised you suddenly contacted me.  Well, I wonder if something bad had happened.

484
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,990
No.  It's actually the opposite.

485
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:28,450
I got a call from the US saying I'm receiving a great opportunity.

486
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,700
Good for you.

487
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,850
It's probably good, right?

488
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,430
Will you be leaving now?

489
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,730
Do you want to stay here longer?

490
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,070
It's nothing of the kind.

491
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,150
When my mother died she was in the late part of pregnancy.

492
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:02,010
If that child were born, she would have been about your age.

493
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,920
If you were my real younger sister, I would tell you to leave immediately.

494
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,650
Do what you want to do and be as happy as you want. Don't look back.

495
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,620
I'm the one who said I am leaving but why does it sound like you are the one leaving?

496
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,170
Do I?

497
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,450
It's late. Get some rest.

498
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,760
Eugene.

499
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,630
Could I ask you about something?

500
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,040
Do you still think I am a murderer?

501
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,690
You haven't answered yet.  Why are you always avoiding me?

502
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:05,200
I've never heard of a profiler who allows

503
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,670
a murderer to sleep in her own home.

504
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,330
Thank you.

505
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,040
But why did you ask again?

506
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,370
No. It's just because. I wonder about what you will write about me in the book.

507
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:38,440
Suspect?  Hunter?

508
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,030
Or if not ...

509
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,940
just a foreign invader?

510
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,900
- Be careful putting that up. 
 - Yeah, yeah.

511
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,280
 Special Commendation of Merit and Promotion Ceremony 

512
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,580
Make it higher.

513
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,370
Mic test. Mic Test. One two three.

514
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,080
 Jungsan Station. 

515
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,950
Thanks.

516
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,610
My head!

517
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,550
You can't be a chaebol.  My head!

518
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,900
How did you know about this place too?

519
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,410
Congratulations.

520
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,530
It's not something to be congratulated about.  Congratulations for what?

521
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:26,800
I hear a lot of rumors that Detective Cha is close to a chaebol now.

522
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,680
How's the program?  There are so many rumors.  When will the radio show be broadcast?

523
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,760
The pro has taken her hands off of it.

524
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,730
Pardon?  Why?

525
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,380
What have you been doing lately that you don't hear the rumors?

526
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,070
They told me to get rid of all discussions of Chimera and TH-5.

527
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,500
What the heck!  Spit! Spit! Spit!.  I walked out.

528
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,870
Was it the higher-ups?

529
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,530
But did you quit your job?  As a reporter?

530
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,200
Who would quit their job?

531
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,220
I got mad and took a vacation.

532
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,400
I'm just thinking of stuff like "Should I go on a trip somewhere to a hot spring with my dad?"

533
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,860
When did you ever drink water with people?  Let's have a drink.

534
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,000
What about Miss Eugene?

535
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,510
Would I contact her when there's nothing to celebrate?

536
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,430
Please take care of that eonni (older sister).

537
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:26,140
You are always asking her to do things and you're so slow.

538
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,690
What do you mean?

539
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,210
But why would a woman take such an active part to help a man with what he's doing

540
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,550
and it not be her business?

541
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,050
She is doing this because she finds it interesting.

542
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,580
The spirit of a professional with responsibility.

543
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,250
Some people are so slow-witted.

544
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,550
How did you catch the culprit when you are so slow-witted?

545
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,850
Wait a sec.

546
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,370
Yes, Madame Cha.

547
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:04,480
What do you mean?  Why did that man quit?

548
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,010
Ask once more.

549
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:09,750
No.  Give the phone  to the receptionist, Mom.

550
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,810
Yes.   It's about an appointment with Doctor Lee Jung Seop.

551
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,360
He quit?

552
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,850
Why out of the blue?

553
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,000
Yes.  I understand.

554
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:37,470
It's Lee Jung Yeop?  Why?

555
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:45,030
Something suddenly happened at his home so he left to return to the UK.

556
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,730
Strange.

557
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,920
There's no way he would have left without contacting me.

558
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,180
He can't go missing like this.

559
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,980
I'm sure something has happened.

560
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,090
Wait a moment.

561
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,050
Who is that person?

562
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,630
The son.

563
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,200
Pardon?

564
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,210
He is Lee Tae Yeong,  the son of Lee Sang Wu who died 35 years ago.

565
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,500
The efforts of the detectives

566
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,030
doing work in the field finally led to a major achievement

567
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,330
in  the arrest of a villain terroist.

568
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:06,600
Villain and terrorist are similar so how about using just one?

569
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,610
The arrest of the terrorist was a great achievement.

570
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,650
Everyone's blood, sweat and hard work greatly contributed to protecting the public.

571
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,030
You used "greatly" twice.

572
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,950
I'll change it to important.

573
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,260
Read it back to me.

574
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:41,350
In the future also, by actively discovering

575
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,770
and rewarding police officers in the field,

576
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,650
who are quietly discharging their duties,

577
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:47,530
What's this?

578
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,910
we will boost their morale.

579
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,710
Chief?

580
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,410
Look at this. Look at this.

581
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,120
What is this?

582
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,760
Excuse me?

583
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,090
Th-th-this

584
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,770
 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will disappear with a roar; 

585
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,700
Is this...

586
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,640
What is it?

587
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,900
 Auditorium   
 -  Team Leader! Yes, thank you.

588
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,750
Lee Jung Yeop disappeared.

589
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,700
What do you mean?

590
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,620
He suddenly resigned at the hospital and left the country.

591
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,660
I asked the immigration office.

592
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,570
His flight reservation was for last night. He was a no-show.

593
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:17,380
Then, where did he disappear?

594
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,400
Team Leader and Seonbae Cha.  Big problem.

595
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:27,260
There was a text message on the chief's cellphone.

596
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,210
What kind of message?

597
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,580
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will disappear with a roar;

598
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,710
The Bible's Second Epistle of Peter

599
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,260
That is the Chimera's message, right?

600
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,940
 Honorable Special Promotion. Congratulations to the Jungsan Station on its award. 

601
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,670
 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, 

602
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,130
 in which the heavens will disappear with a roar; 

603
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,200
 the elements will be destroyed by fire, 

604
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:23,230
 and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. 

605
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,190
 Greek and Roman Myths 

606
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,120
Hyo Gyeong.

607
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,830
Why didn't you tell me?

608
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,100
What?

609
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,180
He's alive.

610
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,610
Who?

611
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:36,010
What does that mean?

612
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,250
Seoryun Hospital's ace,

613
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:44,070
the prime Chimera suspect, Lee Jung Yeop,

614
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,210
is that person Lee Tae Yeong?

615
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,390
Tell me.

616
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:59,740
Is that person Lee Sang Wu's son Tae Yeong?

617
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,480
He was dead.

618
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,180
Lee Tae Yeong died 35 years ago!

619
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:16,330
He started moving again.

620
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,060
Chimera.

621
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,990
Yes, I'm Cha Jae Hwan from Jungsan Station's Special Investigation Headquarters.

622
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,810
Lee Jung Yeop?

623
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,320
This.

624
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,360
What are you talking about?

625
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:54,460
How can someone who died 35 years ago be alive?

626
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,980
Hyo Gyeong.

627
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,050
Tell me.

628
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:06,950
Is that person my brother?

629
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,440
Lee Jung Yeop.

630
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:18,630
I asked if that person is my brother!

631
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:23,710
 Civil Affairs Office·Public Service Division  
 -  Let's meet and talk.

632
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,530
Where are you now?

633
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,390
I'm in the lobby of the police station.

634
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,350
What did you say?

635
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:40,150
I'm here to turn myself in.

636
01:04:53,190 --> 01:05:00,200


637
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:05,390
♫   Some people want to live.  ♫

638
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:09,090
♫  But turn their backs on me.  ♫

639
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:14,570
♫  The time I was not myself  ♫

640
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,500
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

641
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,450
 Chimera  
♫  Don't go  ♫

642
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,220
 Are you really trying to get killed? 

643
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,500
 You need to be careful with who it is you're negotiating with when you negotiate. This guy. 

644
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,140
 Isn't this the safest place? 

645
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,960
 I did the right thing. 

646
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,400
 So, did you kill him? 

647
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,840
  It means remember the deaths of those who have gone before you. It will happen to you, too, 

648
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,770
 So don't be arrogant. 

649
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,550
 I don't think TH-5 is the only problem. 

650
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,120
 What is Seoryun really afraid of? 

651
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,400
 Who ordered it?
