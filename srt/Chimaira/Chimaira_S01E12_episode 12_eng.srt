00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,250
 Chimera 

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,220
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.  

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,550
 Episode 12  

5
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,810
What– ?

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,210
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,280
How can a person who died 35 years ago be alive?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,900
Hyo Gyeong.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,030
Tell me.

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,890
Is that person my brother?

11
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,560
Lee Jung Yeop,

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,350
is that person my brother?

13
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,280
The Chimera has started to be on the move again.

14
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,160
Yes, this is Cha Jae Hwan from the Jungsan Police Station special investigation headquarters.

15
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,910
Lee Jung Yeop?

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,540
Yes.

17
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,050
What happened? Huh?

18
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,070
  Civil Affairs Office·Public Service Division    
 Let's meet and talk. 

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,020
- Where are you right now? 
 - I'm in the police station lobby now.

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,860
What did you say?

21
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,660
I'm here to turn myself in.

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,570
What are you doing right now?

23
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,150
If I'm a suspect for assault and injury, how long do you think I can be here?

24
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,930
How much do you know?

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,850
About being adopted?

26
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,290
Or that am I Lee Sang Woo's daughter?

27
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,580
Or if is it not that either

28
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,090
About how I stayed alive in my dead mother's womb for hours without suffocating?

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,490
My mother's relatives were talking behind my back saying that I was a daughter of a murderer.

30
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,990
I pretended like I didn't hear.

31
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,770
I pretended to not know anything

32
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,400
In order to win the favor of my mother who openly hated me.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I studied to the bone, never complained. I acted like a good person.

34
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,890
Still, she never loved me.

35
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,490
Even if I were reincarnated, I would never receive her love.

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,700
I realized that and gave up when I was in middle school.

37
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,690
What else, from when to when, shall I tell you about?

38
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,730
Why- Why didn't you say anything? Why?

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,220
Because, Dad, you spent your entire life struggling to please Mom.

40
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,230
Because you brought home the daughter of the woman you loved

41
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,630
home without asking your wife's permission.

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
You should have pretended not to know me. Why did you bring me?

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,330
You should have just sent me far away like my brother!!!

44
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,520
I didn't send him away.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,940
I lost him.

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,840
Confess? Confess what?

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,440
There was nothing that came up after last night's incident.

48
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,590
I know. There were no other victims.

49
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,560
Wow. Such crazy people.

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,900
What do we do in these types of situations?

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not sure.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,200
We're always looking for the perpetrators and never for the victim.

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,990
What do we do with him...

54
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,260
I tried to make it so that you would never find out.

55
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,990
You should've left the decision to me as to whose daughter I would live as.

56
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,240
You are smart and pretty.

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,790
And you were too good to be in my care.

58
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,700
Still, this is Korea.

59
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,250
No matter how great you are,

60
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,400
here, you'd still be asked the name of your parents first.

61
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,320
Imagine if you lived as the child of a murderer.

62
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,230
That would be a great obstacle to overcome.

63
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,220
Were you not ever going to tell him about me?

64
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,500
Let him not know.

65
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,880
I don't want you to meet your brother.

66
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,010
Dad!

67
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,430
You live here, and when he leaves that'll be the end of it.

68
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,810
Furthermore, you're a woman so your circumstance is different.

69
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,100
Don't worry about him. He will be better off over there.

70
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,000
How would you know, Dad?

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,600
How would you know that he's doing well over there?

72
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,220
Did he look like he had a good life until now?

73
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,700
Why would someone living well come back after 35 years to find something?

74
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,740
Why did he come here?

75
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,960
You know don't you, Dad?

76
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,560
Hyo Gyeong. To me, only you're important.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,000
I feel sorry for him,

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,990
but I'm going to only think of you from this point forward.

79
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,500
So, please...

80
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,690
just count it as everything being my fault...

81
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,650
and pretend you don't know him.

82
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,150
How can I? I already found out!

83
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,710
Please, stop saying sorry.

85
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,920
You and I both are victims.

86
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,850
Why are the victims saying sorry?

87
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,200
When we're the ones who need an apology!

88
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,650
The Seoryun people?

89
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,630
How? How much?

90
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,910
They won't have any issues in day to day life.

91
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,740
A bit of scarring and fractures.

92
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,170
Good going.

93
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,270
What're you going to do if they file criminal charges?

94
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,620
In Korea, you can settle.

95
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,290
So is that why you're at the station?

96
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,260
- Do you think this is a hotel? 
 - Isn't here the safest place?

97
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,690
Are you looking for a safe place after you beat people up?

98
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,780
I'm an illegal alien right now. My visa's been canceled.

99
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,630
- Cancelled? 
 - It's deportation.

100
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,650
Why all of a sudden?

101
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,340
No way. Did Seoryun find out

102
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,790
we were trying to track down the whistleblower of TH-5?

103
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,920
I told them.

104
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,000
What?

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,540
I proposed the following.

106
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,050
I'll ignore TH-5. So reveal the truth of my father's mysterious death.

107
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,960
You're driving me crazy.

108
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,790
- To whom? 
 - To the owner of Seoryun. Chairwoman Lee Hwa Jeong.

109
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,080
Why did...you– Are you seriously determined to die?

110
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,510
You need to be careful with whom it is you're negotiating with when you negotiate.

111
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,200
You're driving me mad.

112
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,930
Seonbae, the event is about to start.

113
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,290
All right, let's go.

114
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,600
Until the event is over, stay here and don't do anything.

115
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,270
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop.

116
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,880
Just stay right there. Don't go anywhere.

117
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,730
What? Lee Jung Yeop?

118
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,280
Why would he come here?

119
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,360
They say he came to confess. But I keep thinking he's here to mess with the police.

120
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,890
That bastard! Where does he think he is!

121
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,060
Chief, you...your blood pressure.

122
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,240
Should I detain him for obstruction of duty?

123
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,790
Chief, the event is about to begin.

124
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,430
Should I..delay a bit?

125
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,240
Why delay?

126
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,970
Go ahead.

127
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,890
- What is that? 
 - These are congratulatory gifts.

128
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,870
This is from Jung-gu Hometown Association, this is from Daesang Union, these are from Alumni Association and  Graceful Church.

129
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,700
Whatever. Just put it anywhere.

130
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,300
Yes, sir.

131
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,160
Wait.

132
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,400
Where was the last place?

133
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,420
It was sent from Graceful Church.

134
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,090
A church?

135
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,690
I'm a Buddhist.

136
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,960
- Hey! Call the EOD unit! 
 - What?

137
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,910
- Now! 
 - Yes, sir.

138
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,530
Just a second. Please head in first.

139
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,820
Turn your cellphone off. We're about to start.

140
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,260
- Hurry on in. 
 - Okay.

141
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,160
Yes, Investigator.

142
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,840
Don't worry. Lee Jung Yeop is here right now.

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,220
 Lee Jung Yeop has provoked Seoryun about the TH-5. 

144
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,770
 He even needlessly met with the chairman's wife. 

145
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,090
 He's a fool— 

146
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,870
 He makes things even more difficult. 

147
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,330
But isn't it strange?

148
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,430
Why is Seoryun so aggressive?

149
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,240
That... that's because Taesam Chemical's chairman from back then is now the chairman of Seoryun.

150
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,650
The Evergreen situation is serious these days.

151
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,850
Do you think that's all?

152
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,340
It seemed quite serious last night.

153
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,660
Lee Jung Yeop isn't one to say much. It looked like something really bad could've happened.

154
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,530
Last night?

155
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,390
Just a moment.

156
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,300
There's something going on. Hurry out.

157
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,860
Just a moment.

158
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,820
What is it?

159
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,850
 Your attention, please. An emergency fire inspection is underway. 

160
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,670
 All workers and visitors should exit the building.  

161
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,120
  Again, your attention, please. 

162
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,470
 Employees and visitors should exit the building in an orderly fashion. 

163
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,250
Hey, hey! Get out of the way!

164
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,760
Chief, be careful.

165
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,660
Damn it!

166
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,460
It's connected.

167
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,070
It's detecting the switch, wire, power, and device.

168
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,160
What should we do?

169
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,880
Hold on.

170
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,290
What is this?

171
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,860
It looks like a motor.

172
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,350
Motor?

173
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Lee Jung Yeop.  You bastard!

174
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,800
Chief, how should... should we go by car?

175
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,060
Hey! Hey! Arrest that bastard!

176
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,760
 EOD 

177
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,540
That bastard's the bomber, arrest him!

178
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,960
Hurry and arrest him!

179
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,090
Did you hear?

180
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,360
A bomb exploded in Jungsan Police Station.

181
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,420
What nonsense are you saying... a bomb at a police station.

182
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,820
It exploded.

183
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,420
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

184
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,610
Wow, then that's amazing—

185
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,710
Hey, shouldn't we go then? Hm?

186
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,260
- Did they say who did it? 
 - The Chimera.

187
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,510
They said that Chimera went in there with a bomb?

188
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,580
What?

189
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,020
But the Chimera has already been caught.

190
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,690
I thought so too, but I guess he wasn't.

191
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,510
Really? Is that true?

192
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,860
It's a glitter bomb.

193
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,320
What bomb?

194
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,630
A crazy engineer at NASA made it.

195
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,130
They posted it on the internet and got millions of views!

196
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,060
It was designed as bait for parcel thieves.

197
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,260
There were many thieves stealing parcels left at front doors,

198
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,060
so the glitter explodes from it and gets all over them.

199
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,800
Originally, it had a camera and fart gas as well.

200
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,230
- Fart gas? 
 - Yes.

201
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,920
It's a stinky propellant spray.

202
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,200
It even leaves a smell on them.

203
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,670
The original setup is more complicated. This is a nutshell of how it was made.

204
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,960
So you're saying it's not a bomb?

205
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,350
It's a joke but the design and principle are similar to a bomb.

206
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:14,210
If the glitter were replaced with an explosive substance, well, then it would become real.

207
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,860
Kids are scary nowadays.

208
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,460
Team Leader, this was in the box.

209
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,660
What is it?

210
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,530
It looks like a message from the culprit.

211
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,420
What? Give it to me.

212
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,030
 Memento Mori 

213
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,460
 Memento Mori 

214
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,490
What is this?

215
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,460
That...

216
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,900
Tell me! What does it mean?

217
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,400
It's Latin.

218
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,460
It means, "Remember that you must die."

219
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,890
Remember what?

220
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,630
To put it bluntly, it means remember the deaths of those who have gone before you.

221
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,100
It will happen to you too, so don't be arrogant.

222
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
That's what it means.

223
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,760
 Memento Mori 

224
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,760
That bastard!

225
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,500
There's a saying in Korea that when a raven flies, a boat sinks*. Do you know it?

226
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,400
 TN: A coincidence, implying wrong place, wrong time. 

227
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,590
It's definitely the Chimera, but the bomb is fake.

228
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,560
Isn't that strange?

229
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,770
Do you not have any ideas?

230
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,900
- It is a warning. 
 - A warning

231
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,780
Chimera always warns you before killing you.

232
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,170
It's to give you a chance to either atone or tremble in fear.

233
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,560
What would you do if you were Chimera?

234
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,730
Well,

235
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,560
if it were me—

236
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,860
Chief.

237
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,730
Get out.

238
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,530
- Chief— 
 - All of you out!

239
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,300
Turn off the cameras and don't allow anyone in.

240
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,830
Let's go.

241
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,870
I can't even secretly record it.

242
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,230
It's illegal to record without consent.

243
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,690
It couldn't be used as evidence.

244
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,070
Evidence?

245
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,990
Do you know what the chief is going to say in there?

246
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,650
What would it be, Team Leader?

247
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,570
Team Leader.

248
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,300
Long time, no see.

249
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,090
I'm late in introducing myself.

250
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,370
I'm Lee Tae Yeong.

251
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,400
Lee Sang Wu, who died thirty-five years ago as a suspect in the Chimera case—I'm his son.

252
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,510
Right. Long time, no see.

253
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,590
Do you remember me?

254
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,200
The first time we met thirty-five years ago,

255
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,710
I still remember it vividly.

256
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,780
I apologize for not recognizing you.

257
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,230
You were a kid back then.

258
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,210
I remember being nice to you.

259
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:45,860
The kid who came to me every day begging to see his dad.

260
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,160
The one who was tenacious like his father.

261
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:56,230
I see the commie's son who was always dirty became successful.

262
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,860
If you'd stayed in Korea, you would know your place.

263
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,560
While working under others, right?

264
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,640
Like your father.

265
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,140
   

266
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,380
The deceased Ham Yong Bok was chief's henchman.

267
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,250
The sunbaes at the headquarters had a lot to say about him.

268
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,000
Ham Yong Bok's dismissal after the disciplinary action

269
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,610
was in place of the chief. He took the bullet for him.

270
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,110
So I floated the idea to the chief while we were out for a drink,

271
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,820
and he said something strange.

272
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,540
That Ham Yong Bok took the blame for someone else.

273
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,170
The blame...

274
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,650
if it's blame...

275
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,980
It could mean that the person who should've been disciplined and dismissed was switched.

276
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,150
Would you like to hear something interesting?

277
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,490
The night of August 8, 1984...

278
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,530
was a particularly hot day.

279
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,040
You arrested the suspect for the Chimera case, but

280
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,710
he wouldn't confess no matter how much you beat him and threatened him.

281
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,830
The detectives on duty were furious, I'm sure.

282
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,220
The legal detention period was up when the morning came, so you had to let him go.

283
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,830
I'm sure the prosecutor in charge of the investigation was applying pressure.

284
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,280
Lee Min Gi, who was a district attorney at the time...

285
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,430
wanted to be rid of his fragile image of a young master from a chaebol family.

286
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,110
The night of August 8th

287
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,560
a detective on duty drags that suspect out of his cell.

288
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,760
And that suspect is discovered in the night-duty room after a few hours.

289
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,750
Isn't that strange?

290
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,460
The suspect who supposedly committed suicide was found in the night-duty room, not in the cell.

291
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,210
The night-duty room is where the detectives on duty sleep and rest.

292
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,010
What happens after that is even more strange.

293
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,120
They said he killed himself using a belt, but that belt was never discovered.

294
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,690
Where did that belt go?

295
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,510
This is my speculation.

296
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,500
The suicide is bulls***

297
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,150
and someone killed Lee Sang Wu that night.

298
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
Then the person who was on nightshift was...

299
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,640
I think it was the chief.

300
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,020
If something that shouldn't have happened

301
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,470
occurred that night, the chief must've done it.

302
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,250
That bastard deserved to die!

303
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,470
A serial killer who killed several people viciously!

304
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,610
Are you sure about that?

305
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,690
Are you sure that the man you killed is the real killer?

306
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,230
If he's not the real killer...

307
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,780
If such a malicious guy wasn't the Chimera, who could it be?

308
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,250
Your father was a murderer.

309
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,560
He was going to get the death penalty anyway!

310
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,310
Since he was supposed to get the death penalty anyway, did you kill him?

311
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,820
Do you think it was my first time dealing with a guy like your father?

312
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,960
A guy like that could spend a hundred years in prison. He'll never reform!

313
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,280
So brazen after committing his crime...

314
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,490
How dare he walk around with his eyes wide open!

315
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,530
Is that human?

316
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,430
So... did you kill him?

317
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,760
I did the right thing.

318
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,330
I did something that's tough to do and others ignore!

319
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,690
That's why the young ones live comfortably right now!

320
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,780
Do you know that?

321
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,420
I asked, did you kill him?

322
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,000
The likes of you...

323
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,750
will never understand...

324
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,020
I came here with full knowledge! What's wrong with you?

325
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,440
Lee Jung Yeop is here, right?

326
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,330
He's under investigation right now as he was apprehended while committing a crime.

327
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,800
Apprehended while committing a crime? What's the proof?

328
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,770
I can't tell you the specifics.

329
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,140
Then I can visit with him, right?

330
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,420
Pardon?

331
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,550
I should be able to talk to the suspect.

332
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,120
I told you already that he's under investigation right now.

333
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,060
When is that investigation going to finish then?

334
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,660
You're not his attorney nor family, right?

335
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,200
If you want to interview him, wait until he's officially permitted to conduct interviews.

336
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
Look at everyone over there.

337
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,140
Don't frown.

338
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,250
The bomb was fake, too. You'll be released and not detained at this rate.

339
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,980
I think the Chief got pissed off and is holding you in custody. He should let you go if things check out.

340
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,510
The law is there for a reason.

341
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,320
What did you talk about with the Chief?

342
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,030
Chief is the one, isn't he?

343
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,350
Did he admit it?

344
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,490
If he admitted it...

345
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,700
What would you do if Bae Seung Gwan confessed?

346
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,630
Would you be able to reveal that fact to the entire world?

347
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:05,540
It wouldn't end at simply being criticized. It would be a flaw for the entire police organization.

348
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,980
Do you think you could still reveal that fact?

349
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,120
Let's say you've got a flaw. A lethal one at that.

350
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,360
And only one person in the world, your enemy, knows your flaw.

351
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,640
Would you live the rest of your life bowing your head to your enemy because of that flaw?

352
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,970
Or would you reveal it to the world and live with your head held up high despite being criticized?

353
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,960
I'd choose the latter.

354
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,990
I'm not the type to hold it all inside.

355
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,850
Rather than live richly, it's better to live in peace. Isn't it?

356
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,110
If one committed a crime, one should pay for it.

357
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,060
Whoever it may be.

358
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,550
Why are you laughing?

359
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,410
What? Was I cool?

360
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,780
How is your mother doing?

361
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:24,260
Are you worried about my mom right now?

362
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,610
Wow, you're as compassionate as Dr. Heo Jun.*
(A brilliant doctor from 16th century Korea)

363
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,060
Be good to your mom.

364
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,630
I wonder how I would be now if I had any family remaining.

365
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,200
I'll catch Chimera. You will get relief from the injustice done to your father.

366
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,640
After all of this is over, let's have a drink together.

367
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,920
Well, would you like a cup of breakfast tea or something?

368
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,060
Never mind that.

369
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,320
I left something in the conference room. Would you please get that for me?

370
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,280
What is it?

371
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,520
A Bible.

372
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,160
 Bible 

373
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,110
I don't think he was just joking.

374
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,870
The text that the Chief received right before the bomb was delivered...

375
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,600
The Latin phrase in the warning letter and even the drawing of Chimera.

376
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,230
These are details that only the investigation team and the culprit know about.

377
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,060
I guess Chimera could be making his move once again.

378
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,070
If that's the case, it means there could be another murder.

379
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,370
How is Lee Jung Yeop doing?

380
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,450
I think he's extremely drained.

381
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,920
He's been driven into a corner.

382
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,800
But still, staying here should be safe for him, right?

383
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,350
Inside the jail cell is the best place for now.

384
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,710
This is my district.

385
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,110
As long as he's here, I'll be responsible for him.

386
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,240
He has no family and no one else to rely on.

387
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,790
I think

388
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,340
that everyone who lives here now

389
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,230
is slightly indebted to him.

390
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,810
In any case, Lee Jung Yeop will be deported even if he's released. What should we do?

391
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,710
We should maximize the use of the press.

392
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,820
How about meeting with that Reporter Kim?

393
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,690
She may be overly ambitious, but I think she could be of some help.

394
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,630
I don't think she'd be much help once Seoryun starts to apply pressure.

395
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,870
Censor the press from talking about Chimera, and deport Lee Jung Yeop...

396
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,420
I don't think TH-5 is the only problem.

397
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,120
What do you think Seoryun really fears?

398
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,380
What did I tell you?

399
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,900
Since we're being easy on him, that Lee Jung Yeop is showing his true colors.

400
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,730
Do you know what that bastard wrote on the bomb message?

401
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,130
In Latin, what was it...

402
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,150
Something that says, you'll die soon, so remember...

403
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,880
- Memento Mori? 
 - Yes!

404
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,270
Yes, that!

405
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,400
That bastard is making a fool out of us!

406
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,990
What are we going to do now? This isn't going to end with only me going down.

407
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,820
Who do you think is next? Huh? Hyungnim!

408
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,110
- How can you say that? 
 - Well...

409
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,430
Am I wrong?

410
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,890
So what do you want us to do about it?

411
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,670
He's sitting in the police station.

412
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,230
Well...

413
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,040
we have the answer.

414
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,510
What else could we do?

415
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,600
You should take care of him since you've got him.

416
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Why are you trying to get our permission? You're not a kid.

417
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,460
I ...

418
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,110
I don't know if my stomach is going to be okay.

419
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,010
Thank you for this food.

420
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,770
All I ever ate was jjajangmyeon ( Black bean sauce noodles )

421
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,840
Do you have something to tell me?

422
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,500
Just throw it out there. It's between us.

423
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,680
I'm returning.

424
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,970
Returning ... to where?

425
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,220
To America?

426
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,000
A new team has formed there. So I'm going.

427
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,820
There aren't many opportunities to work with these other experts and I think I'll learn a lot.

428
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,280
Good for you!

429
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,310
That's really great!

430
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,190
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart.

431
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,790
Thank you.

432
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,340
I thought we'd finish this case together.

433
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,170
That we'd get to confirm the culprit's face,

434
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:41,600
I'd put handcuffs on him, and you'd interrogate him.

435
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,100
Didn't you ever imagine that?

436
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,740
Was I the only one?

437
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,190
But still...

438
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,950
I'm glad to hear that you're leaving on a good note.

439
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,800
I'm very nervous...

440
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,410
Do you think we should leave it to Seung Gwan?

441
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:38,370
What if he slips with that hot temper of his?

442
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,760
We're up against Chimera.

443
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:47,950
If something happens to Seung Gwan, we're next.

444
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,590
Not "we." You.

445
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,360
Seung Gwan may have a bad temper, but he's not stupid.

446
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,420
I'm sure he'll take care of it.

447
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:10,730
Lee Jung Yeop's eyes are burning with eagerness to finish off avenging his father's death.

448
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:15,450
Seung Gwan is already crazy trying to avenge Ham Yong Bok.

449
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,140
It will probably end if one of the two dies.

450
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,940
That's too cruel.

451
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,300
That's what Seung Gwan wanted.

452
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,560
It sounds like you're saying we should abandon Bae Seung Gwan if things go wrong.

453
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,380
He used to follow you around ever since high school.

454
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,020
He's been so loyal.

455
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,420
One person has to be accountable.

456
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,650
If it's revealed that Lee Sang Wu didn't commit suicide, you and I are both dead.

457
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,200
Let's say that's the case for me...

458
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,200
but why would you die?

459
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,530
I mean...

460
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,370
you and I aren't strangers.

461
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,640
We're from the Prosecutors' Office.

462
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,600
We'll take over the suspect Lee Jung Yeop for the killing of Son Wan Gi, Han Ju Seok, and Ham Yong Bok.

463
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,730
What?

464
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,600
Are you taking over the Chimera case?

465
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,380
Lee Jung Yeop is under suspicion of planting a fake bomb.

466
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,960
You're investigating the Chimera case suspect Kang Sang Gu.

467
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,200
That guy changed his statement.

468
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,580
He said he didn't kill those three.

469
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,980
The Chimera case is back to the drawing board. We're starting all over!

470
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,340
What did you do exactly for the last few months?

471
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,770
You couldn't even find one piece of evidence. Always one step behind.

472
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,890
Even still, you can't do this without giving us any advance notice. This isn't right.

473
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:12,020
By chance, are you doing this because of the assault on the Seoryun secretary's office people?

474
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,220
Who ordered you to do this?

475
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,570
Who is the prosecutor in charge?

476
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,710
You punk...

477
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,540
Cha Jae Hwan!

478
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,780
You stay put.

479
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,790
It's only been a day since we arrested Lee Jung Yeop.

480
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:42,000
Even if we only have the right to the initial investigation, you should abide by our minimum timeframe. Right?

481
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,640
We gave you time up until now.

482
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,880
So, you should've done a good job.

483
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,040
If they even got into the chief's office...

484
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,190
didn't they step all over the police's pride, too?

485
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,150
- What? 
 - Hey!

486
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,000
If you came here to do your job, just do your job and leave.

487
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,650
Don't be mouthing off.

488
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,810
S***, it's not like I was wrong...

489
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:21,180
You sit at your desks, looking at pieces of paper. What, do an investigation?

490
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,190
Would you like to feel what a real crime scene is like?

491
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,900
Lee Jung Yeop, please come out.

492
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,210
Do it according to the law, all right, Lee Jung Yeop?

493
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,960
Please don't cause trouble either.

494
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,290
 The Bible 

495
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,970
I mean, why is the prosecution coming here all of the sudden?

496
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,280
It's weird, right? They should have asked for the case files first.

497
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,960
Why are they only taking Lee Jung Yeop?

498
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,590
Are they just going to let him go after pretending to investigate like the last time?

499
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,600
Things seemed too intense for that to happen.

500
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,740
Could it be that the prosecution received some decisive intelligence

501
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,330
that Lee Jung Yeop is really the Chimera?

502
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,220
Do you really think so?

503
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,030
Keep your eyes down, you bastard.

504
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,420
What's going on with the prosecutors?

505
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,380
They suddenly called us and said they're taking over the case. Those jerks.

506
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,010
It's entirely up to the prosecution to investigate, so we had no way to hold him back.

507
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,440
I'm nervous about this...

508
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,970
The prosecutor in charge of the case is a Seoryun scholar.

509
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:03,600
We're trying to find out who he is.

510
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,070
We're not heading downtown.

511
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,290
Where are we going?

512
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,280
You don't need to know.

513
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,840
Can I have some water?

514
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,580
Come out.

515
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,260
Walk.

516
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,070
Walk.

517
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,790
The person in charge is Prosecutor Choi Jong Ho?

518
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,160
He's from Busan?

519
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,920
All of a sudden?

520
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,320
Give me a call if you find out anything else.

521
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,780
A prosecutor from Busan District Prosecutors' Office came by?

522
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,350
Yes, they said he came here from Busan out of the blue.

523
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:37,170
I need to find out what this has to do with Seoryun.

524
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,480
Prosecutor Choi Jong Ho?

525
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,640
   

526
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,510
   

527
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,900
That's Lee Jung Yeop's.

528
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:03,020
He must feel distressed, too. He was reading it all through the night in the cell.

529
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,370
What's wrong?

530
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,240
What are you looking at? Keep walking.

531
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,720
What is this?

532
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,730
All right, stop.

533
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,530
Get on your knees.

534
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,450
This isn't the way.

535
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,450
Go when I tell you to damn it.

536
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,890
Let's hurry up before the sun goes down.

537
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:15,430
If it's sealed and stored in this, it means that it prevents contact with humidity and air.

538
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:23,020
The fact that it oxidizes quickly in contact with the air, and that it can be spread thinly and made into a plate...

539
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,540
By chance, do you have Vaseline?

540
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,110
What?

541
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,870
Step back.

542
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,330
More.

543
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,290
Aren't you prosecutors?

544
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,040
You're about to kill an innocent person right now.

545
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,920
Innocent? You've got to be kidding me.

546
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,970
You killed many people.

547
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:51,870
You murdering bastard. You deserve much worse than to die this way.

548
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,920
Got it?

549
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,030
Who ordered this?

550
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,610
You don't need to know.

551
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,500
Chief Bae?

552
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,280
Chairwoman Lee Hwa Jeong?

553
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,820
It'll also be a liability for you to kill me.

554
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,770
We're not going to kill you.

555
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:20,230
- You're going to kill yourself. 
 - I see.

556
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,450
Isn't it a bit cliche? Falling down while on the run?

557
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,620
This bastard talks a lot.

558
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,780
Help him out.

559
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,070
Hold on.

560
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,470
Let me have a sip of water.

561
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,020
Don't try to pull something.

562
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,910
You know you're not going to use that gun.

563
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,060
Since it needs to look like I committed suicide.

564
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,390
Let me ask for a favor.

565
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,200
It's okay if I drink some water before I die, right?

566
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,500
Give it to him.

567
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,620
 White Vaseline 

568
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,440
Is this substance that dangerous?

569
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,700
It's an alkaline metal that's easily oxidized and sensitive to the humidity in the air.

570
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,110
It's lighter than lead so it spreads thinly.

571
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:48,660
Also it's really unstable so you have to put it in Vaseline like this or seal it.

572
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:53,870
If it's an alkaline metal, then it's explosive, right?

573
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,190
Damn it, that scared me.

574
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,550
What was that? Was that a wild boar?

575
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,830
Don't say nonsense.

576
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,810
Where is he getting something like this?

577
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,270
You have it and so do I.

578
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,690
Everyone probably carries it with them these days.

579
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,440
People are carrying around explosives?

580
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,880
I don't have anything like that...

581
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,930
Perhaps..

582
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,360
are you talking about this?

583
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:21,180
Lithium. It's an alkali metal that ignites

584
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,820
when it reacts with water.

585
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,740
You guys have it too.

586
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,850
Take out your cell phones.

587
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,470
Throw them over here.

588
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,940
Who ordered you to kill me?

589
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,270
Who ordered it?

590
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,800
Hold-hold on.

591
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:36,800
We... We really don't know anything.

592
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:43,080
We were only given instructions by phone.

593
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,350
Call them.

594
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,790
Sir, please.

595
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,590
Call them.

596
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:22,370
The response to the SL-3 was pretty good.

597
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,700
We negotiated some more.

598
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,710
How did it go?

599
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,940
Anyway, I'm waiting for good results.

600
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,690
Hello?

601
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,130
- Good answer. 
 - Yes, you can count on us.

602
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,650
Hello?

603
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,450
Who is this?

604
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,370
Well then, let's go eat now.

605
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:55,060
- Would you like to join us for lunch? 
 - Sure.

606
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:14,800


607
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,090
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

608
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,910
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

609
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:31,370
♫  The time I lived as myself, not me  ♫

610
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,430
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

611
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,400
 Chimera 

612
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,340
 This case... doesn't it seem like it was made to look like an accident? 

613
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,030
 What does he get by running away? 

614
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,650
 Why would he do something so irrational without a motive or purpose? 

615
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:49,010
 The fact that they're coming out like this means that I'm getting closer to the truth. 

616
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,950
 What's so important about the past? 

617
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,500
 If I die, who do you think would be next? 

618
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,010
 What are you going to do if something happens to him? 

619
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,680
 It's different from 35 years ago. 

620
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,100
 A doctor who was framed and chased.  
 

621
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,020
 Did you plan on making me feel weak from the start? 

622
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,190
 I said shoot!
