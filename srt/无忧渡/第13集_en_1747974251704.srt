1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
And find the switches

2
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm going to make a

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,540
little bit of a

4
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,460
little bit of a

5
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,180
little bit of a

6
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,260
toward to

7
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,660
께

8
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,160
oh

9
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,900
call it

10
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,620
to

11
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,020
grandmother

12
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,180
hello

13
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,180
Episode 16

14
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,580
I checked the book of the inn.

15
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,580
It was written that

16
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,180
Gao Shan had been to this inn before.

17
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,580
He stayed there for four days.

18
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,980
But the inn's owner and his men told me

19
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,180
that they had never seen him.

20
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,580
This inn is indeed strange.

21
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,780
The cat demon that led us here

22
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,180
appeared again last night.

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,380
When we went to Xingzi Garden,

24
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,580
we found

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,580
Banxia's brother there.

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,580
Banxia's brother?

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,180
Yes.

28
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,780
He seems to know something,

29
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,380
but he doesn't want to tell me.

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,580
Then, is the demon

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,980
the one who committed the crime or the man?

32
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,780
Feng Tian said that

33
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,380
he was once a soldier at the border.

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,580
He was alone for 20 years.

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,780
Would such a person kill someone?

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,580
That's not necessarily true.

37
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
Maybe he lied to you.

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,780
What about the cat demon?

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,980
What about the cat demon?

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
I don't know what he's up to yet.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,580
But I think

42
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,580
besides the cat demon and Feng Tian,

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
there are other things

44
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
hidden in this inn.

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,580
We just haven't found them yet.

46
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
Yes, yes, yes.

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,780
I feel like something is

48
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,980
staring at me.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,980
Dr. Jiu,

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,380
You Huang said that you can

51
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,580
catch demons and take them back.

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Is there anything

53
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,580
that can shake the demon's blood?

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,780
Give me some courage.

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,580
No.

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Find it for me.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,380
Let's go.

58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,780
Where are we going?

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,580
Didn't you say that the brother of Ban's family

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
seems to know something?

61
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,780
Go ask him.

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,780
Let's go.

63
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,980
Gui Ke.

64
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,180
Gui Ke,

65
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,580
someone is looking for you in the front yard.

66
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,780
Who is it?

67
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,980
It looks like a villager under the mountain.

68
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,980
He looks anxious.

69
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,180
Go and have a look.

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,180
A villager?

71
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,980
You're looking for me?

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,180
You must be Chu You Huang, the Chubutou.

73
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,380
Yes, I am. What's up?

74
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,580
I went up the hill in the morning

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,380
and found a corpse in the cliff.

76
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,180
There is this letter on you.

77
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,980
It mentioned

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,580
the Tuo Yan Inn and Chubutou.

79
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,580
I thought about it and came to ask.

80
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,580
This is the letter I sent to Lord Geng.

81
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,380
Tao...

82
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
Something happened in the inn.

83
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Where is the corpse?

84
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,580
It's in the cliff.

85
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,780
Take us there.

86
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,380
Okay.

87
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,980
Where is it?

88
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,980
It's there.

89
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,780
Yuan Li!

90
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,580
Yuan Li!

91
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,580
Yuan Li!

92
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,380
Tao!

93
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,780
Yuan Li!

94
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,980
What's going on?

95
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,780
Someone broke his zither.

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Who did this?

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,780
How dare you hurt someone in the palace?

98
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,780
How dare you!

99
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Don't let me catch you.

100
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
Don't let me catch you.

101
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,780
Tao.

102
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,580
Tao.

103
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,780
His son just turned 100.

104
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,580
He hasn't drunk yet.

105
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,180
Enough!

106
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Jin'er.

107
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,180
The swallow you gave me is so beautiful.

108
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
It wants to drink it with your own body.

109
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,580
I can't drink it with my own body.

110
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,580
舞娘.

111
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,780
舞娘.

112
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,180
Get out!

113
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,380
舞娘.

114
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,580
There was one thing my father asked me.

115
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,180
solution is given to him.

116
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,380
I didn't kill anyone.

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,980
Don't you believe me?

118
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Shut up!

119
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,580
If you don't believe me,

120
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,580
you can hand me over.

121
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,700
There are some

122
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
amulets in the shop.

123
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,180
I didn't mean that.

124
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
Tell me.

125
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,980
Did you do it?

126
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
No.

127
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,780
Why do you look like

128
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,380
you want me to kill you?

129
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,580
Fine, I'll kill one of them.

130
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,180
You can call me whatever you want.

131
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,780
Don't be ridiculous.

132
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Dad.

133
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,380
Do you really know me?

134
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Mo Niang.

135
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
I just hope

136
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,380
you can live a safe life.

137
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,980
I'll just let you go.

138
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,380
Mo Niang.

139
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,780
Can you be a little more obedient?

140
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,780
I just hope you can be good.

141
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
Okay.

142
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Brother, I'm Banxia.

143
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm going out.

144
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Dad.

145
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Brother,

146
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I thought you weren't in the room.

147
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,580
I was wondering why you didn't answer the door.

148
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,580
Enter the Wolf's Wall.

149
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,380
Climb the Wolf's West.

150
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
Good job!

151
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
Come on.

152
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,380
Brother, what are you doing?

153
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
Banxia is here.

154
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,180
Sit down.

155
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,580
Let's listen to the song.

156
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,580
Brother, what are you looking at?

157
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,780
Your sister-in-law.

158
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Brother, what are you talking about?

159
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
She can't do it.

160
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,380
She can't listen to this.

161
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Your sister-in-law thinks you're a little girl.

162
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,780
She can't get used to these

163
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,580
complicated and complicated songs.

164
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
She wants to sing you a

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,180
more gentle and complete love poem.

166
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,980
There's no such thing as a good song.

167
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Have you ever heard of the song,

168
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Man and Wood?

169
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Man and wood

170
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,980
can't be separated.

171
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Man and woman

172
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,980
can't be separated.

173
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Man and wood

174
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:50,980
can't be separated.

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,980
Man and wood

176
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
Banxia, come on.

177
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
Be careful.

178
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
How is it?

179
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,980
I'll go and wash your face after I finish the water.

180
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Come on.

181
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
Drink with me.

182
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
Listen to the song.

183
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
How did you find him?

184
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
Chief Chu,

185
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,980
usually,

186
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,180
there are not many people here.

187
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,180
There are many woods.

188
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,980
I...

189
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,980
I cut the woods here.

190
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Don't leave the village recently.

191
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,180
Go.

192
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,980
Okay.

193
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,380
Yan Li is good at fighting.

194
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,380
Even if he can't beat the strong enemy,

195
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,380
he should be able to escape.

196
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
The murderer is so powerful.

197
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
He tore off his back skin.

198
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,380
Who did this?

199
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,380
Who can know

200
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,780
what's going on in the wild?

201
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Unless Yan Li can open his mouth.

202
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Yan Li

203
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
You can't go in.

204
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
This is my inn.

205
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,380
Why can't I go in?

206
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
You can't go in either.

207
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
I don't care.

208
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,380
What's so great about it?

209
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
How could you do this?

210
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,380
I... I've already entered.

211
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,380
What else do you want?

212
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,380
Banxia lied to me.

213
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,380
Sister is here too.

214
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Why are you here?

215
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
I came to send the wine to the young master.

216
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,380
Didn't I tell sister?

217
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,380
After she came,

218
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
she couldn't leave the house all day.

219
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,380
She drank in the house.

220
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,380
Didn't you tell me before

221
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,380
that you didn't see her often?

222
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,380
You almost forgot her.

223
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Before, it was the servants who took care of her.

224
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,380
But I heard that she is sister's brother.

225
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,380
So I came here in person.

226
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,380
Wait.

227
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,380
What is this?

228
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,380
This is white wine.

229
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,380
Sister, haven't you heard?

230
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,380
All the guests here

231
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,380
like this kind of wine.

232
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,380
They say that after drinking it,

233
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,380
you can see the person you want to see the most.

234
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,380
Sister, do you want to drink?

235
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,380
Sister.

236
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,380
There is only one person on the chest.

237
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,380
He is only 8 inches and 2 cm tall.

238
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,380
He is tall and handsome.

239
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,380
He is very young.

240
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,380
But he is heavy.

241
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
He is a fat man.

242
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,380
Not necessarily.

243
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,380
Although he is not flexible,

244
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,380
he is strong.

245
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,380
If he is a fat man,

246
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,380
he can't be so weak.

247
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,380
He should be a medium-sized body.

248
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
A man with a strong body.

249
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,380
He doesn't have a military license.

250
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
He is not weak at night.

251
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,380
If he can kill him with bare hands,

252
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,380
he is a man of martial arts.

253
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,380
No.

254
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
He is stabbed.

255
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
No.

256
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
But why is there no blood on the ground?

257
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
Maybe he was cleaned up.

258
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,380
Maybe he wore a armor.

259
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,380
So his body is so pure.

260
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,380
It's giving me a headache at night.

261
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,580
He tore the skin off the wreath.

262
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,680
This is harsh.

263
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,280
Little Reminiscence

264
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,860
Bad idea

265
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,880
She looks totally not afraid of the resistance inside her eye

266
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,080
It' was like taking a toy

267
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
This is a trap.

269
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
He has one finger missing on his right hand.

270
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
It's just a little dizzy.

271
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
You can rest for a while.

272
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
You don't have to put your guest in a bad mood.

273
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
That person is in the inn.

274
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
I've seen him.

275
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
What's this?

276
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
What's this?

277
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Don't bring this kind of wine here again.

278
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Guests want to drink.

279
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
We don't sell it.

280
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
My brother is now in a coma every day.

281
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
His mind is not clear.

282
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
I'm his sister.

283
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
I have the right to make decisions for him.

284
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
If you bring these wines again,

285
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
don't blame me for turning against you.

286
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Okay.

287
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
I won't send it.

288
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Sister, don't be angry.

289
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Hurry up and take them away.

290
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Sister.

291
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Sister.

292
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Sister.

293
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Sister.

294
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Sister.

295
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Sister.

296
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Liar.

297
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
I was just teasing you.

298
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I'm really angry.

299
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
What's wrong with your neck?

300
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I have something to do.

301
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
I'm not teasing you.

302
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Let's go.

303
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Let's go.

304
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Sir.

305
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Let it go first.

306
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Everything is done.

307
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Let's go.

308
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
No matter what, it's a life.

309
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Really?

310
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
If he's alive,

311
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
he should thank me personally.

312
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Don't move.

313
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
And sir,

314
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
this person died outside.

315
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Don't bring it inside.

316
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
There are guests inside.

317
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm the head of Guangming City.

318
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I suspect that your inn

319
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
is related to the murderer who killed my colleague.

320
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
From now on, the inn is closed.

321
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

322
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Do you hear me?

323
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
You can't say that.

324
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
He died outside.

325
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
He didn't die in my inn.

326
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
What does it have to do with us?

327
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Besides,

328
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
do you have any evidence?

329
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
If you have evidence, you're a criminal.

330
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
If you don't, you're a criminal.

331
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Does it make any sense?

332
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Xingyi,

333
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
please help me to keep an eye on him.

334
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
What's wrong?

335
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
I told you to keep an eye on the inn.

336
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Have you ever seen a man

337
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
with only four fingers on his right hand?

338
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Yes.

339
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
I just saw him.

340
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
He left with Wu Niang.

341
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Where did they go?

342
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Follow me.

343
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
This way.

344
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Done.

345
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Thank you, Wu Niang.

346
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Sir.

347
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Sir.

348
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
This is it.

349
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Sir, where are you going?

350
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I'm going to see your servant.

351
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Why are you telling me?

352
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Sir.

353
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Sir.

354
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Sir.

355
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
It's him.

356
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Mr. Jiu.

357
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
I saw it.

358
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
What did you see?

359
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
He has only four fingers on his right hand.

360
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
This...

361
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
You must have seen it wrong.

362
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Impossible.

363
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
That's weird.

364
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
It's weird.

365
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
It's clearly five fingers.

366
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
That's right.

367
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Sir.

368
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
What are you doing?

369
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
You scared him.

370
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Tell me what's wrong.

371
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
If you have no evil intentions,

372
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
why did you stop me?

373
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
Do you know that

374
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
the same plan as the one with the coin...

375
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Mr. Jiu.

376
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Mr. Jiu and others have complained late at night.

377
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
I told my father to keep you here.

378
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
He is so rude to us now.

379
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Is it appropriate?

380
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
It's not rude.

381
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Sir.

382
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
You know that

383
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I have been weak and sick since I was a child.

384
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
If I offend you,

385
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
please forgive me.

386
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
It's a fox.

387
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
It always has a tail.

388
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Sir.

389
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
I advise you to

390
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
take good care of your people.

391
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Don't let anything happen to you.

392
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Okay.

393
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Please come in.

394
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Please come in.

395
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,080
What's wrong with my father?

396
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Did you do this?

397
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
No.

398
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
No?

399
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
What's wrong with his fingers?

400
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Yes.

401
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Tell my father

402
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
what's wrong with your fingers.

403
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Leave.

404
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
Get out!

405
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Why does my father always suspect me

406
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,080
the first time something like this happens?

407
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
I see.

408
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Because in your heart,

409
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
I am such a bad person.

410
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
I will do bad things.

411
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
So you don't want to take me home.

412
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
You don't want me to see my grandparents.

413
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
You want to keep me in such a

414
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
shabby place with no birds.

415
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
What kind of inn is it?

416
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
You are afraid that I will hurt your family,

417
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
right?

418
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
No.

419
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I am afraid of you.

420
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Then please tell me.

421
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
If it's not like this,

422
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
what will happen?

423
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
You are my family.

424
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
Who will be afraid of your family?

425
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
I am not afraid of you.

426
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
You are afraid.

427
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
You are always afraid of me.

428
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
And you are getting more and more afraid.

429
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Father,

430
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
you don't like me anyway.

431
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
If you like me,

432
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
why don't you let me go?

433
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Like my brother.

434
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
As long as I go,

435
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
I will never cause you any trouble.

436
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
No!

437
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
You can't go anywhere!

438
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
It's not safe outside!

439
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
This is your home!

440
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Home?

441
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Okay.

442
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Then we will wait.

443
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
But if

444
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
anyone gets hurt,

445
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
don't blame it on me.

446
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Brother, you are awake.

447
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Daxia,

448
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
you are here.

449
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Are you okay?

450
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
I am okay.

451
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
I am fine.

452
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
I am fine.

453
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
I am fine.

454
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
I am fine.

455
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
I am fine.

456
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
I am fine.

457
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I am fine.

458
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Is it because of that wine?

459
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
The boss's daughter came just now.

460
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
She said that the wine is called Fubai.

461
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
After drinking it,

462
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
you can see the person you miss the most.

463
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
You know it all.

464
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
That's right.

465
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,080
It's really the greatest thing in the world.

466
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
In the past half year,

467
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
I have seen it.

468
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Not only did I see the waist,

469
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,080
I also drank the wine called Fubai.

470
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Do you know how clear it is?

471
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
It's not the usual drunkenness.

472
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
It's just like the real thing.

473
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
In front of me,

474
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
she talked to me.

475
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
She laughed.

476
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
She smiled.

477
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
It's like...

478
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,080
It's like she never left me.

479
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Banxia,

480
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
do you want to try it?

481
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
I'll call you again.

482
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Just a little bit,

483
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
you can see your parents.

484
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Try it.

485
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Brother,

486
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
you can't stay here anymore.

487
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
There are still grandmothers and grandfathers in the family.

488
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
You never go back.

489
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
They are worried about you.

490
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
In the family?

491
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
There is no place to stay in the family.

492
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
I have my mother to accompany me.

493
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
You have been here for half a month.

494
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
It's all because of Fubai.

495
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Be sober.

496
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Man Niang.

497
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
I'm sorry.

498
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Chi Xun.

499
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Chi Xun.

500
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Chi Xun.

501
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Why is it here again?

502
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Didn't I come from here?

503
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Chi Xun.

504
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Is anyone here?

505
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Is anyone here?

506
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Help!

507
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Help!

508
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
Banxia.

509
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Xueyan.

510
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
I think I saw Jiuming just now.

511
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Come back with me first.

512
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
The murderer should be the one you talked about.

513
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Then catch him.

514
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Whether it is or not,

515
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
catch him first.

516
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
We'll know after interrogation.

517
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
The more hard it is,

518
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
the harder it is to get over the torture of the prisoners.

519
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
Manager Fengtian will not allow us to attack.

520
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
According to what the doctor said,

521
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
he is not a normal person.

522
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
And that Xiaosi is not a normal person.

523
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
There is not only one Xiaosi in this shop.

524
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
And that Wu Niang.

525
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
I always feel that she is very strange.

526
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Don't forget.

527
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
There are cat demons in the dark.

528
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Then...

529
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
If she can't beat us,

530
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
we'll withdraw and go back to move the troops.

531
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
Do you think they will wait for us here

532
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
to come back and catch them?

533
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
My brother is still here.

534
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
He is still here.

535
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
He is addicted to Fubai.

536
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
He must not want to leave for a while.

537
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Fubai?

538
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I was too anxious just now

539
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
and forgot to tell you.

540
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
I found that this inn

541
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
is selling a wine.

542
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
It's called Fubai.

543
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
It is said that after drinking it,

544
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
you can see the person you miss the most.

545
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
My brother is addicted to missing his wife's love

546
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,080
because he drank this wine.

547
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
That's why he doesn't want to leave.

548
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
I'm sorry.

549
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
We dare not act rashly.

550
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
I believe they dare not.

551
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
I'll go back and settle the body in the inn.

552
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Let's discuss other things later.

553
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Xuanye.

554
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
I don't think the cat demon and them are on the same side.

555
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
I was lost in the yard just now.

556
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
It seems that the cat demon lured me back.

557
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Are you sure your brother

558
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
drank Fubai?

559
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Yes.

560
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
You've heard of this kind of wine before.

561
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
Yuan.

562
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
You've only been married for more than a year.

564
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
You just had a son.

565
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,080
How can I tell your family?

566
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
You are the only son.

567
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
It's all my fault.

568
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
I should have gone.

569
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Break the case quickly.

570
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Revenge for Yanli.

571
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Yes.

572
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
Revenge.

573
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
I'm sorry.

577
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm sorry.

584
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Take it.

598
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,440
It's boring. Take it away.

599
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,740
You don't want to play, so you give it to me?

600
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,120
I'm going out to protect Banxia.

601
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,560
Don't leave me, okay?

602
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Where are you going?

603
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
It's your business.

604
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm going out to protect Banxia.

605
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
Banxia is worried about you.

606
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,960
This wine is called Fubai.

607
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,180
It's called Shan Zhu Yu.

608
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,400
It's made from the skin of the skin.

609
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
The recipe is simple.

610
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,480
It's just that the way it's extracted is not easy.

611
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,480
But as long as you know the trick, it's not difficult to make.

612
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
If you like it, I can teach you how to extract it.

613
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,080
So you can make it yourself when you go back to Nanyang City.

614
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
What?

615
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,080
You think I'm here to persuade you?

616
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,880
I've been drinking this wine for six years.

617
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,480
What right do I have to persuade you?

618
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Do you know?

619
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,480
When I was young, I offended an opponent.

620
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
I couldn't catch him and let him escape.

621
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,680
Later, he hurt my family.

622
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,080
They were poisoned and lost their minds.

623
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,480
All that's left in their minds is killing.

624
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
All that's left is killing.

625
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,280
I had no choice but to kill them all.

626
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,280
My parents, my brother, my partner,

627
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,480
they all died in my hands.

628
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm sorry.

629
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,680
This wine is really a good thing.

630
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,880
All these years, I've been living with this wine.

631
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,280
Whenever I feel like I can't live with it,

632
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,880
it's always deceiving me.

633
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,080
It makes me feel that nothing has changed.

634
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,080
Before I go home,

635
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,680
I'll have a drink at the door.

636
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
And when I leave,

637
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,480
my family is there.

638
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,680
You're different from me.

639
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm a widow.

640
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,880
I have a life and death.

641
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,280
No one cares.

642
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,080
But you're different.

643
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
You have a family.

644
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Your family is waiting for you to go home.

645
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,680
You're different.

646
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
I'm different.

647
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,280
I'm different.

648
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm different.

649
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,680
And your family is waiting for you to go home.

650
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,680
I have no one in my family.

651
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,280
Don't wait until my family is gone.

652
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,680
Then you'll regret it.

653
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,680
But it's too late.

654
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,600
I'll go now.

655
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,600
Here.

656
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,280
Women.

657
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,600
Here.

658
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm leaving.

659
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm fine. You don't have to help me.

660
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,600
I can walk on my own.

661
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
What's wrong with you?

662
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I can walk.

663
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,600
It's snowing.

664
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Where's Xuanye?

665
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
I don't know.

666
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
I'll go with you.

667
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
I'll go with you.

668
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
I'll go with you.

669
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Where's Xuanye?

670
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
I don't know.

671
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Xuanye asked me to protect you.

672
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Xuanye.

673
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,600
What's wrong?

674
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I'm different from them.

675
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I know it's fake.

676
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,600
What?

677
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm fine.

678
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I'll go with you.

679
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
I'll go with you.

680
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Dad.

681
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Dad.

682
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Dad.

683
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,600
Slow down.

684
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Girl.

685
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I have a little doll.

686
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Do you like it?

687
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Does it look like you?

688
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Yes.

689
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
My mom likes it.

690
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
I want to give it to my dad.

691
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Dad, you've worked hard.

692
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,600
It's not hard.

693
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm going to play with you.

694
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600
I'm going to play with you.

695
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm going to play with you.

696
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm going to play with you.

697
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I'm going to play with you.

698
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,600
I'm going to play with you.

699
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm going to play with you.

700
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I'm going to play with you.

701
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm going to play with you.

702
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm going to play with you.

703
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
I warned you.

704
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Don't come near her, and don't show up in front of me.

705
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,600
This is the last time you dare to destroy my Mountain.

706
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Be careful, I'll give you the rest of your life.

707
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,600
I'll give you the rest of your life.

708
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,600
I'll give you the rest of your life.

709
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,600
I'll give you the rest of your life.

710
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I'll give you the rest of your life.

711
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I'll give you the rest of your life.

712
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Are the rewards been made?

713
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,600
To you I am sure

714
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,600
To you, I am sure

715
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
I'm sorry.

717
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,600
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600

I'm sorry.

726
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

734
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,600
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

745
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
I'm sorry.

748
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
I'm sorry.

749
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I'm sorry.

750
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
I'm sorry.

751
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,600
I'm sorry.

752
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I'm sorry.

753
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600

I'm sorry.

759
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
I'm sorry.
