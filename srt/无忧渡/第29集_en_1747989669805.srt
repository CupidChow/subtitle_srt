I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Let's go!

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Let's go!

00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Let's go!

Let's go!

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Little Prince, you're awake?

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
How is it? Does it feel better?

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Any problem?

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Your clothes are inside. I'll get them for you.

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Please have a seat, sir.

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
I've already cleaned your clothes.

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Please rest assured.

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
We are the local gang members.

29
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
You are trapped in the fire.

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
You are the only one who can save you.

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Please stay here.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
There's more.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
There's more.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
You must be hungry.

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
The food is still hot.

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
I'll get you some.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Please have a seat.

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
The fire is still hot.

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Please have a seat.

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Please have a seat.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Please have a seat.

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Please have a seat.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Please have a seat.

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
What are you looking at?

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Mr. Lu.

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Mr. Bai's farewell letter.

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Farewell letter?

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,080
He said he would leave Guangping in two days.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Have you seen him?

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes.

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Did you do it?

53
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Do you think I'm just a cold-blooded murderer?

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
No.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Then why did he leave suddenly?

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Why do you care so much about him?

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I just think he shouldn't have fallen into a pitiful trap.

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
You've only seen him for a few days.

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
You think he's not good?

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
He's not good.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I went to the court yesterday.

62
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,080
So you mean there are two Mr. Bai?

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
One is a snake demon,

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
the other one is a fairy.

65
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Yes.

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
No wonder I sometimes think he's very close.

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
The one who's good to you is a fairy.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
I didn't expect that.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
I didn't expect that too.

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
A snake demon who didn't do anything bad

71
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
killed two people for him.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
He even helped him to get rid of the skin disease

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
and escaped from the court.

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
What are you looking for?

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,080
This snake demon is really good to the fairy.

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
It's not right to kill people.

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm not going to make it hard for him.

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
It's just that the life and death of a monster

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
is longer and stronger.

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
It's not that the mortal can compare to it.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
If they want to be a murderer,

82
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
the mortal's life and death are between their thoughts.

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,080
So it's hard for them to treat life as a precious thing.

84
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Since he has a reason to kill the first person,

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,080
then the future is likely to kill the second person

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
and the third person with the same reason.

87
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
So he can't just listen to the order.

88
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
He can't just give up.

89
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
No one is born to be a fairy.

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
No one can ever change the world.

91
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Besides, it's a demon.

92
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Fine, fine, fine. I'll give you a hand.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
There are too many of them.

94
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
They're even older than my father.

95
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Mr.

96
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Mr.

97
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
You're going out?

98
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Aren't you leaving in two days?

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I thought I'd see you in the prison.

100
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
It's a farewell.

101
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,080
What about you? Are you going to the water park today?

102
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
I have to go.

103
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
After all, I've been with the boss for more than ten years.

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
I've left.

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
I have to say goodbye.

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I'll go first.

107
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Be careful on the way.

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Good bye.

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Queen of trampoline stops quantizing the size of aので!

110
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
and яt.

111
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I儿 mossed in a must be.

112
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
it's the most perfect man.

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,080
I can't stop it with the熟 and polished me.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,040
Fairy Xinnu謝 Duke,

115
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,040
I will never have the chance to have the chance to see you again.

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I will never forget you, my dear.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
This is my little token.

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Please do not push it away.

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I can't accept it.

120
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Take it.

121
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
If Mr. Bai hadn't been here for so many years,

122
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
my Liu Shixuan would have been so famous today.

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,040
This token is a token of the future.

124
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Please do not push it away.

125
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I am a decent person,

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
but I can hear your feelings well.

127
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,040
You will have more people to hear your feelings.

128
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I will be happy for you and for those who...

129
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
I hope he dies.

130
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
He is so capable of living.

131
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Isn't it because I saved him?

132
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Mr. Bai.

133
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
I have to go.

134
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
I will take the tea and drink.

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I hope you can have a good life.

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
That's all.

137
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,040
There are three wishes in this life.

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Now they have been fulfilled.

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I should not have been so greedy.

140
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,040
But now, I have one last wish.

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,040
But this time, I will not beg you.

142
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Please forgive me.

143
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
This time, I will come by myself.

144
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,040
I will not beg you.

145
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Sir.

146
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Why are you here?

147
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
I am waiting for you.

148
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
You like the Star Flower wine, right?

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
I bought some.

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Oh, and the ginger tea.

151
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
It's good to drink it when you go back.

152
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Let's go.

153
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I will go.

154
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Let's go.

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Sir, it's too late.

156
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
It's so windy.

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I will leave tomorrow.

158
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I will eat well tonight.

159
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Here, have a taste.

160
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I heard that this is the way to eat from Jiangnan.

161
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
The meat is tender.

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Even the bones are tender.

163
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Not bad.

164
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,040
When we arrive in Jiangnan, we will be more relaxed.

165
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Okay.

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
When I was talking to the manager,

167
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,040
he mentioned some of the Qin's masters in Jiangnan.

168
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
He even gave me some of his bowels.

169
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
When we arrive in Jiangnan,

170
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,040
we will go to the Taoist School together.

171
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Your Qin is very special.

172
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
It's very gentle and smooth.

173
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
It's gentle and not too tired.

174
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I like it very much.

175
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
I haven't asked you yet.

176
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Who did you learn from?

177
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
It's my mother.

178
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
She was a Qin's master.

179
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Although she was in the world to live,

180
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
she was a little girl.

181
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
She was respected by many.

182
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Later,

183
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,040
she became the father of my Jin's family.

184
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
She became my father in the second year of the Kun family.

185
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
But she was not able to sing.

186
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I was six years old.

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
My father was in the capital for failure.

188
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
So I put my anger on my mother.

189
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I was so angry that I couldn't help her.

190
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,040
But I was still in the family.

191
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Later,

192
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
my brother was born.

193
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,040
My mother thought that my brother was a blessing.

194
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,040
This family was all because of my brother.

195
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
So I was married to my father.

196
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
I didn't need to be in love.

197
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
But do you know that

198
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I really want to be in love?

199
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Don't cry.

200
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,040
You will continue to be in love.

201
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
I will.

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Heaven let me be the one to die.

203
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
I will not let myself be the one to die.

204
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I will do what I want to do.

205
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
But I want to be in love.

206
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Sir.

207
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Sir.

208
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Why don't you drink?

209
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
The moon is like a flag.

210
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
I will sing it.

211
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
But I want to be in love.

212
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
OK.

213
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Sir.

214
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
OK.

215
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Bao Sen I just tell you a story.

216
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
calm down, please.

217
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,040
It's so difficult to help you,

218
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,040
we don't have any choice

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,640
to stay here

220
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,140
and leave.

221
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,040
Are you sure, affirmations?

222
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
No.

223
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
No.

224
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,360
Thank you.

225
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Okay.

226
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
OK.

227
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,840
I am the first one to write this song

228
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,540
The one who didn't want to give his all

229
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,340
It's too deeply不錯

230
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,300
Because I have one thousand patterns

231
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,820
So we can scrape off ever, even if it's any heavy rain

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,820
I just want to meetaves

233
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I'm happy to see you.

234
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,820
I'm so happy to see you.

235
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Thank you.

236
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,820
I'm glad to see you.

237
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
I'm happy too.

238
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
What's this?

239
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
You don't know?

240
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Miss, you're still working?

241
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
When is it?

242
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
The new stuff hasn't been sold out yet.

243
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
You're not in a hurry.

244
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
What about you?

245
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
If it's a week,

246
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
I'll have to force Master to get married.

247
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
I've already told Li Xian and my dad.

248
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
He can't move.

249
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
What can I do?

250
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Miss,

251
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
tell Master that

252
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
you and Dr. Jiu are so close.

253
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
You're already a master.

254
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
What are you talking about?

255
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Let Dr. Jiu do it.

256
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,820
He's our savior.

257
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Master can't be too cruel.

258
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
He has a lot of skills.

259
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
He can't bear the pain of being a little bit flesh.

260
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
What's on your mind?

261
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Uncle Duan!

262
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Let's have tea.

263
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
What are you doing?

264
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Get up and talk.

265
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,820
I'm sorry to have you two here.

266
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
I'm sorry to have you two here.

267
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
I'm really sorry.

268
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Good boy. What happened?

269
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
I couldn't sleep at night and I was too sleepy to turn around.

270
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
But after thinking about it,

271
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I still want to tell you my mind.

272
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Uncle,

273
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Aunt,

274
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
I want to get rid of the engagement with Banxia.

275
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
My ancestors were very rich.

276
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
They finally got a job and I studied as a waiter.

277
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,820
I really have a lot of expectations.

278
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
So I'm going to invest my heart into the market.

279
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
I'd like to be a waiter and be a good person.

280
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
As for the wedding,

281
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Banxia is a gentle and virtuous lady.

282
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,820
She will find a rich and powerful husband.

283
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Please help her.

284
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
You are a rich man.

285
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,820
You don't have a man to be your wife.

286
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
I can understand your attitude.

287
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,820
But your father...

288
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
I'll explain it to him.

289
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Then, the other person...

290
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Uncle, don't worry.

291
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I can't marry her because of my personal reasons.

292
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,820
I can't ruin Banxia's reputation.

293
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
I want to be a good person and be a good person.

294
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,820
I'm willing to help you.

295
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,820
This way, please.

296
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
Nope, you can't go to the temple.

297
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Only carls here

298
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Stop.

299
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,140
We are not good at thinking.

300
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,260
It's none of your business.

301
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,500
I am Xiao Zhi's son.

302
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,060
I didn't think about it.

303
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,140
Although I don't know what you are thinking,

304
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,540
I still want to thank you.

305
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,060
Thank you.

306
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,340
Then do me a favor.

307
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,500
Next week.

308
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,300
Jiu Yang.

309
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Please accept the wish.

310
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,140
I curious here.

311
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,860
For my multiple repair,

312
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,860
it's not easy to catch my dad and pretend he lied.

313
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,140
He lied to me like it's clear and wild.

314
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,100
It's just to make the kids MAC.

315
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
I was wrong.

316
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
I took a break from my work

317
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
and focused on the map.

318
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Until that day,

319
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I saw you.

320
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Master,

321
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
you were a great warrior in the forest.

322
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I only took a move

323
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
and let him show his true form.

324
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
I saw clearly.

325
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Then I took a small move

326
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
and fell in love.

327
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I talked to him

328
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
and let him leave Guangping

329
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
and avoid a dispute.

330
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
From that day on,

331
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I was so angry

332
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
and you were the one who made me fall in love.

333
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I know that's my promise.

334
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I must follow you.

335
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Please accept the map.

336
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Well...

337
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Well...

338
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Madam.

339
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm not very good at this.

340
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Can you please help me?

341
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Madam.

342
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
Madam.

343
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Madam?

344
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Yes.

345
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Master may not know

346
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
that I have broken the house

347
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
and left this ridiculous family.

348
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,100
From now on,

349
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
I and Madam will not be married.

350
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
I don't want to be together.

351
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Of course,

352
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
I didn't know

353
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
that you two were like this before.

354
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
If you didn't want to give me ten scams,

355
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
I wouldn't dare to do

356
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
such a big thing.

357
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Fortunately,

358
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I'm not in a hurry.

359
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Otherwise, I might have broken

360
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
this house

361
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
with Master.

362
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Please accept the map.

363
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Wait.

364
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Wait.

365
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm the one who lost the money.

366
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
I really can't give you...

367
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Master,

368
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
please don't push me.

369
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
I can see your skills

370
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
clearly that day.

371
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Of course, I understand that

372
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
such a high person like you

373
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
might not be willing to accept me.

374
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
But I'm different, Master.

375
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,100
I'm determined to die today.

376
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I must follow you.

377
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
If you don't agree,

378
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I'll kneel down

379
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
and kneel outside the gate of the Hall of Fame.

380
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
You have a position in the court, right?

381
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
How can you rest in peace?

382
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
You're worried about this?

383
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Then, Master, don't worry.

384
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
I'll return to the capital

385
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
tomorrow and send my parents to the capital.

386
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
By the way,

387
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
aren't you going to bow to the world?

388
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
That's just a trick

389
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
that's not enough to make you feel better.

390
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Master,

391
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
please don't be so serious.

392
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Moreover,

393
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I really don't have any taste in this.

394
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Am I not here?

395
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
I've decided

396
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
to follow you all my life.

397
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Is there any other request?

398
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Madam.

399
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Madam.

400
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Madam.

401
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Master.

402
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Master.

403
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Why don't you

404
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
consider it?

405
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Pour the tea.

406
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
The toast is tea.

407
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Thank you, Master.

408
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Master.

409
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Madam.

410
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I'll get up tomorrow and go home.

411
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
I wonder if it's convenient

412
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
for you to send me off to the capital.

413
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
The capital?

414
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Okay.

415
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
It's late.

416
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Go back and pack up.

417
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I'll take my leave.

418
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
You really take her as your disciple?

419
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Or

420
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
you'll marry her as your mother-in-law?

421
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
What did you say?

422
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Mother-in-law.

423
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
It's me.

424
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
I've been living in Guangping City for months.

425
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
My parents wrote to me several times

426
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
to come home with me.

427
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
I'm really sorry.

428
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Master.

429
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
I came home this time

430
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
and saw my parents.

431
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
I resigned.

432
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
So I came here to chase you.

433
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
You don't have to do that.

434
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
You can stay at home

435
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
with your parents.

436
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
That's not good.

437
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Of course, learning is dangerous.

438
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Since I've already become your teacher,

439
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
I'll naturally

440
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
follow you

441
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
and learn from you.

442
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
You really have

443
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
a good student.

444
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Master.

445
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
It's time to get up.

446
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Okay.

447
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Then, master.

448
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
It's you.

449
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
I'll take my leave.

450
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Yu Xuan.

451
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Thank you.

452
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
He won't allow her to resign.

453
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
He won't be able to come back

454
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
even if he's a little busy.

455
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
I'll leave now.

456
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Everyone, please stay.

457
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Master Gu, take care.

458
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Okay.

459
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Master Gu, take care.

460
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
What's the matter?

461
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Where's the chain?

462
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
You all

463
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
already know it.

464
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Since you're so dead,

465
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
I won't hide it from you.

466
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Actually, my husband, Zhang Pu,

467
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
is not as ungrateful as the others.

468
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
He has a lot of feelings for me.

469
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
My husband always treats me well,

470
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
but he loves drinking.

471
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
He's a little greedy.

472
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
He's always drunk.

473
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
It's hard to make him pay for it.

474
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,100
But men are not like that.

475
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
But he should be dead.

476
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
He loves me.

477
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100
I won't leave him.

478
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
He killed my husband.

479
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
He forced me to leave

480
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
as he is now.

481
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
You can prove it to me

482
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
that you're the one

483
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
who left me by his side.

484
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
The last time you came to the class,

485
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
I was the one who saw him.

486
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
I was also under his threat

487
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
and lied to you

488
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
without any reason.

489
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,100
You mean

490
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
he forced you

491
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
to do all this?

492
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Yes.

493
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Your husband treats you well?

494
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Yes.

495
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
My poor husband.

496
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Where is the hunter now?

497
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
He's dead.

498
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
He's always forced me to do things for him.

499
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I really don't dare to be insulted.

500
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I even want to avenge my husband.

501
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
So I asked the butcher

502
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
how he would help me

503
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
to drink the Bear's wine.

504
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
He's really

505
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
a bad guy.

506
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
I'm scared.

507
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
But I know I can't retreat.

508
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Otherwise, I'll die.

509
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
I even used his medicine

510
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
to stab him

511
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
and stab him in the back.

512
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
I'm going to kill him.

513
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
I'm going to kill him.

514
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
The body of the Immortal Sword

515
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
is in the box in the yard.

516
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
As you two saw,

517
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
I'm also in this form now.

518
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Although I've already accepted the enemy,

519
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
I can't go back to it.

520
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
I'm leaving Guangping

521
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
and starting a new life.

522
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Thank you both.

523
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Although I have to be patient,

524
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
your kindness

525
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
will be rewarded with a new life.

526
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
The Lord of the Valley is waiting.

527
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Let's not fight.

528
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
It seems that the person who found the Immortal Sword

529
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
will make some improvements.

530
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
But I don't know how to take it.

531
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,100
He has been practicing bitter medicine for years.

532
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
He has a shallow mind and a good practice.

533
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
He has no demon aura.

534
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
He can't get along with ordinary methods.

535
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
Even if he uses the Immortal's Blood,

536
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
he won't be able to cure it.

537
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Is he not dead?

538
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Is he lying to the Immortal?

539
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
I think so.

540
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Then why is he still dying?

541
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
To revenge the Immortal?

542
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
If he wants to revenge,

543
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
why bother to do it again?

544
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
He should be

545
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
trying to make the Immortal relax.

546
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
He wants the Immortal to believe

547
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,100
that there is no more love in this world.

548
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
There is no Mr. Bai anymore.

549
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
In this way,

550
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
the Immortal can take over this identity.

551
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
He can think about this life,

552
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
do what he wants to do

553
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
and live his life.

554
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,100
It's just a pity.

555
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
It's a pity that he has a love affair.

556
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
From now on,

557
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
he might never fall in love again.

558
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
He is so good to the Immortal.

559
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
He is so good at it.

560
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
I guess

561
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
the Immortal should have been kind to him.

562
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
So,

563
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
he should have been willing to do all this.

564
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
But this is too unfair.

565
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
No matter what,

566
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
the Immortal is the cause of death.

567
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
The result of this is

568
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
no longer valid.

569
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
I am willing to give up my obsession

570
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
and worry about my future.

571
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Maybe

572
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
he has left Guangping.

573
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,100
The sky is clear and the sky is high.

574
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
He will find

575
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
the one who is really good to him.

576
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
It's you again.

577
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
I was lucky and I don't die.

578
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
After all, I have been severely injured.

579
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I have been in the same position for many years.

580
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I have not had such a strong power

581
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
to protect my mother.

582
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
You are my brother.

583
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
My mother is my brother.

584
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
I am a mother.

585
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
I am the son of the Immortal.

586
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
I am a mother.

587
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
I am the son of the Immortal.

588
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
I am a mother.

589
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
I am a mother.

590
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
I can protect you.

591
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Why are you still following me?

592
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
You're angry?

593
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Why are you angry?

594
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
That master Zhu is right.

595
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
I've committed a murder with evil.

596
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
I must suffer this.

597
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Actually, God has already protected me.

598
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,100
At least I can start over now.

599
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Enough.

600
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Don't follow me anymore.

601
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
I'm sorry.

602
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm sorry, Master.

603
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
I feel something is wrong.

604
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
You're pretending.

605
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
I'm sorry.

606
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm sorry.

607
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm sorry.

608
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
I'm sorry.

609
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I'm sorry.

610
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
I'm sorry.

611
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
I'm sorry.

612
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm sorry.

613
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
I'm sorry.

617
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Enough.

619
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
You're acting like a girl.

620
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Where did you hide it?

621
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Did you?

622
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
I didn't see it.

623
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
You didn't eat it.

624
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
I didn't eat it.

625
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,100
The chicken leg and ribs were eaten by a dog.

626
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
Dog?

627
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Yes.

628
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
I'm a patient.

629
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
I shouldn't eat more.

630
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
You see what I eat every day.

631
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
I eat porridge every morning and afternoon.

632
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
I eat porridge every night.

633
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
You're a patient.

634
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
You can only eat beef.

635
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
I'm not good with you.

636
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
You're right.

637
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
If you don't say it, I'll forget it.

638
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
You can eat dog food.

639
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Si Ma Lin Ying.

640
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
You love food but no one is forcing you to eat.

641
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
I took care of you carefully.

642
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
I was wrong.

643
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

644
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
You want to lie here.

645
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
You want me to marry you.

646
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm telling you, I don't have a door.

647
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,100
I have someone I like.

648
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Who?

649
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Is it Ban Xia?

650
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Yes, it is Ban Xia.

651
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I'm not afraid to tell you.

652
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
In the world of painting, I'm the wife of Xian Wei.

653
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
She is the wife of my wife.

654
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
We love each other.

655
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
We love each other.

656
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
In painting?

657
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Why don't you say it's in your dream?

658
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Pain, it's fake.

659
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
It's true love.

660
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
OK, it's true love.

661
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Have you asked Ban Xia?

662
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
No need to ask.

663
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I have her in my heart.

664
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I have her in my heart.

665
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Yu Huang, Si Ma.

666
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
You're awake?

667
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Yes, I am.

668
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
You're so energetic.

669
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
You've been lying for so long.

670
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
I brought you a good news.

671
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Xuan Ye is going to be married.

672
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Who is the new wife?

673
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Who else?

674
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Of course it's Ban Xia.

675
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Ban Xia?

676
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
You're in trouble, Chu Bu Tong.

677
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
What's wrong?

678
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Have some salted egg.

679
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
I don't understand.

680
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Why didn't you ask Wen Jian

681
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
why we're getting married?

682
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
You've never asked me about this.

683
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
I went to your father.

684
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
It's your father's day.

685
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
You didn't discuss it with me?

686
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
You don't agree?

687
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
I don't want to.

688
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
I don't want to.

689
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
I don't want to.

690
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
I don't want to.

691
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
I don't want to.

692
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
I don't want to.

693
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
I don't want to.

694
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Why are you angry?

695
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Why are you angry?

696
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Why are you sitting here?

697
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
I'm sitting here.

698
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
This is not your seat.

699
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,100
We're getting married.

700
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
You're in this seat.

701
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
This family belongs to me.

702
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
I didn't give you a name.

703
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
Why are you so stubborn?

704
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
You gave me a name?

705
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Fine.

706
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Xuan Yi.

707
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm glad you gave me a name.

708
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
You're not angry anymore?

709
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
You can't do this alone in the future.

710
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I just want to fight for your father's consent.

711
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
I didn't expect him to be so hardworking.

712
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
The next day, he'll find a good life.

713
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
You don't know that

714
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
your father used to be a judge

715
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
and the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs

716
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
of the Yangtze District.

717
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

718
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

719
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

720
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

721
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs

722
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
of the Yangtze District.

723
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

724
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

725
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
He's now the head of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

726
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
What can I say?

727
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
At least you can have a discussion with me.

728
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I thought we had already agreed.

729
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Fine.

730
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
It's all my fault.

731
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Even if we agreed,

732
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
we should ask you again.

733
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
An Xia.

734
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
We've known each other for so long.

735
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
You know me very well.

736
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
I'm a father and a son.

737
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
My parents are both dead.

738
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
My brother is no longer here.

739
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
There's no fame or wealth.

740
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
I just want to keep it.

741
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
It's not easy to live

742
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
with a monster every day.

743
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
But I can use my life to swear.

744
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
If you're willing to marry me,

745
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,100
I'll always be with you.

746
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I'll do anything

747
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
to make you happy.

748
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
No matter what,

749
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
I'll keep my word

750
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
and help you out.

751
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
So,

752
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
do you want to believe me

753
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
and marry me?

754
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
I don't want to.

755
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Why are you so scared?

756
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Are you willing to?

757
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Think about it.

758
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
How long do you want to think?

759
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
I just started.

760
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
It's okay.

761
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
I can wait a little longer.

762
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
You can think about it.

763
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Is it three days?

764
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
I didn't think about it.

765
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Do you want to hold a meeting

766
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
when I think about it?

767
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
What?

768
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
I said I agreed.

769
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
I'll marry you.

770
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I've taken so many chances.

771
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Who else can I marry if I don't marry you?

772
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,100
I can't say much.

773
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
I keep laughing.

774
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,100
My heart is like a flash of time.

775
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,100
I'm so excited.

776
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

777
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,100
I'm so happy.

778
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

779
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

780
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
Shunyan!

781
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Shunyan!

782
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,100
I'm so excited.

783
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

784
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
I'm so happy.

785
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

786
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
I'm so happy.

787
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

788
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
I'm so happy.

789
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

790
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,100
I'm so happy.

791
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

792
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
I'm so happy.

793
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

794
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
I'm so happy.

795
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

796
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,100
I'm so happy.

797
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

798
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,600
I'm so happy.

799
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
I'm so happy.

800
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

801
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Why are you up here?

802
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,980
and the stool.

803
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,060
I'll put it on.

804
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,420
Miss, come down.

805
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,380
It's dangerous.

806
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,420
Be careful.

807
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
It's safe.

808
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,460
Don't go out to eat.

809
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,020
It's not a joke.

810
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,700
It's also

811
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,700
a thing that I've seen with Zhishi.

812
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,460
It's not good to see it when it's hot.

813
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,700
I'll go with you tomorrow.

814
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,220
I want to eat that soup.

815
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,900
If I go out,

816
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,620
we'll have to go to the clinic.

817
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,380
I'll get a new dress.

818
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
Okay, I'll go with you tomorrow.

819
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,380
Baixia, I have something for you.

820
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,620
Take it.

821
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,420
This is

822
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,940
my mother gave it to me.

823
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,460
It's for you.

824
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,020
Baixia.

825
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,420
Be careful.

826
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,580
Be careful.

827
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
I'll go with you tomorrow.
