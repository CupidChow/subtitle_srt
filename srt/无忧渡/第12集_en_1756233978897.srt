[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

2
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,960
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,590
The mountain is particularly quiet

4
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,680
at night.

5
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,490
There isn't even a dog barking.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,229
The mountain is a place

7
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,120
of serenity.

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,890
I don't like quietness.

9
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,890
I enjoy hustle and bustle.

10
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,070
The more people around, the better.

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,940
Since I became able to see demons,

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,410
I've always hated being alone.

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,900
There's a constant panic in my heart.

14
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,800
Even mirrors can turn into demons.

15
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,950
Doesn't it mean benches and chairs

16
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,510
can also become demons?

17
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,079
Demons are not that commonly seen.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,650
Don't you worry about that.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,820
You don't understand.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,380
You have no fear at all.

21
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,840
Demon hunters are still humans.

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,000
We have our fears.

23
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,000
Even my father

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,910
would sometimes get scared.

25
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,360
Otherwise,

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,620
why would he learn that spell?

27
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,770
Do you have fears?

28
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,190
I was afraid of nothing

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,010
when I was 13 or 14 years old.

30
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,680
I felt like I was omnipotent.

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,190
One day,

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,520
a tiger came from outside the city.

33
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,470
That tiger

34
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,870
caused many casualties.

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
I begged my father

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,110
to take me with him

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
and eliminate that tiger together.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
Did you kill it?

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
No, we didn't.

40
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,880
That tiger was maimed

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,880
after being shot by me and my father.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
It fled to a cave.

43
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,370
We followed it all the way,

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,760
and finally found that two tiger cubs

45
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,520
were waiting for it in the cave.

46
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,310
My father's heart was softened.

47
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,640
He then let the tiger go.

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,910
At that time, I was disappointed

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,070
and upset.

50
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,020
I thought

51
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,700
I could get a tiger skin.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
What are you laughing at?

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm not laughing.

54
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,110
Go on with your story.

55
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,280
A few years after that,

56
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,030
I realized that my father

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,160
didn't really go out

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,500
to practice medicine.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,329
He was out catching demons.

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,710
In most cases,

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,040
he would return after two or three days.

62
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,130
But one time,

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,890
he was gone for half a year.

64
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,910
There was no news about him at all.

65
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,080
When he came home,

66
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,170
he was seriously injured.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
That was when I understood

68
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,080
what fear truly was.

69
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,750
That was also when I realized

70
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,269
why my father

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,800
let go

72
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,800
of that tiger.

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,360
Anyway,

74
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,070
it's water under the bridge now.

75
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,240
Now, I'm poor

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,430
and all alone.

77
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm close to no one,

78
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,870
so I don't have any fear.

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,060
You're talking nonsense.

80
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,420
You're not poor

81
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,420
and all alone.

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
You have Ganshan Clinic. Chi Xue,

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,830
Wen Jian and I

84
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,320
are all by your side.

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,120
Xuanye,

86
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,920
feel my hand.

87
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,600
Touch it now.

88
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,070
Come on.

89
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,510
My palm is especially warm, isn't it?

90
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,690
It's because of the pattern you drew on it.

91
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,120
Every time I get scared,

92
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,630
it gives out heat.

93
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,240
Why don't you

94
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,430
draw one on your palm too?

95
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,260
I don't need such a thing.

96
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,120
Fine.

97
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,740
You're right.

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,940
Mine was drawn by you.

99
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,630
Physician Jiu is a miracle maker.

100
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,510
Ordinary people like us

101
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,240
are indebted to you for your protection.

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,500
I have to say thank you.

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
So how do you plan to thank me?

104
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,159
What do you want me to do?

105
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,870
Just be a good girl and sleep now.

106
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,040
You're just

107
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,330
tired of talking to me.

108
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,690
So you've noticed.

109
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm a bit tired of it.

110
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Neither do I want to speak to you now.

111
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,880
Why are you so quiet?

112
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,830
I'm asleep.

113
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,370
Yet you responded to me. How come?

114
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,230
I'm about to fall asleep.

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,920
Very impressive.

116
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,450
[Reunion Inn]

117
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,000
Did you use to be a soldier?

118
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,400
How did you figure that out?

119
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,270
The skills you just showed

120
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,299
look like what the military would teach.

121
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,230
Your armor is of high quality,

122
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,270
unlike that made by civilians.

123
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,440
Some features on it

124
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
tell me that it was made long ago.

125
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,950
Can't it be

126
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,510
something I borrowed

127
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,490
out of vanity?

128
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,650
You could borrow the armor,

129
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,330
but your skills have given away the truth.

130
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,350
You're very skilled at using that broadsword.

131
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,720
You couldn't have made this

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,390
achievement

133
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,320
without 10 to 20 years of practice.

134
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,160
You're perceptive.

135
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
This way, please.

136
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,550
Does it taste bad?

137
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,910
No.

138
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,200
It's okay.

139
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,920
I knew it wouldn't taste good.

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,970
My sense of taste doesn't work,

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,120
so I can't make delicious food.

142
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,220
Your sense of taste doesn't work?

143
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
Why is that?

144
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,120
I don't know.

145
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,750
I've been like this since I was little.

146
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,500
Miss Duan,

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,210
put it down.

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,900
I'll ask my father

149
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,440
to fix a new bowl for you.

150
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,840
It's fine.

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,020
The flavor is a bit strong,

152
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,300
but it's not entirely unacceptable.

153
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,880
When you cook next time,

154
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,700
try using less ingredients

155
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,340
and adding more water.

156
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,780
Then it'll be fine.

157
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,030
Someone else said the same to me before.

158
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,790
But when I cook,

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,170
I just can't help

160
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,900
but to put in many ingredients.

161
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,110
Maybe because

162
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,710
I can't taste anything,

163
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,550
I feel the need to make the food look pretty.

164
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,790
The country has been at peace for over 10 years.

165
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,920
Wars rarely happen.

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
Sir, where were you

167
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,030
recruited as a soldier?

168
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,670
Well,

169
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,290
I joined the army at 16.

170
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,960
It was more than 30 years ago.

171
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,270
Back then,

172
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,630
there were droughts.

173
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,360
Dead people outnumbered the living ones.

174
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,610
To make sure

175
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,290
I could survive,

176
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,850
my parents had me join the army.

177
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,440
At first,

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,170
I spent three years in the north

179
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
transferring grain.

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,760
Later on,

181
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,410
I went to the south with the troops.

182
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,290
That was when

183
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,890
I started working for General Zhang Guang.

184
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,380
General Zhang is said to be very strict with his troops.

185
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,290
All his soldiers

186
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,510
are brave and tough.

187
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,670
The fact that you were chosen to work for him

188
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,630
means you were a perfect warrior.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,750
I wouldn't say that.

190
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,980
I just followed the orders,

191
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,900
and never broke the rules.

192
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,420
That wasn't easy.

193
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,390
In fact, I didn't spend

194
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,150
much time in the south.

195
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,510
I was soon relocated

196
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,070
to Guima Fort.

197
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,770
[Guima Fort]

198
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
Sand storms frequently happen there.

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,330
It is an isolated place.

200
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,910
The soldiers stationed there

201
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,910
would be replaced every five years.

202
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,930
Those who finished their terms

203
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,830
[Junior Squad Leader]
[Hua Yingran]

204
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,910
could go home with handsome rewards.

205
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,980
And then what?

206
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,870
Well,

207
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,910
we led a plain life.

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,530
One could hardly

209
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,210
see any visitors there in a year.

210
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,030
What could we have done?

211
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,760
Our lives were all about grazing

212
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,860
and farming.

213
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,030
Finally, five years passed, and we were supposed

214
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,080
to be relieved.

215
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,480
But no one came

216
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,620
to replace us.

217
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,010
Six months after that,

218
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,560
the chief brought two attendants with him

219
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,630
and set out for the imperial court to seek an answer.

220
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,480
But we never heard from them

221
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,550
after that day.

222
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,610
Some time later,

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
a few merchants happened to pass by.

224
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,750
They told us

225
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,670
that

226
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,000
the then emperor had died.

227
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,450
The princes were fighting each other

228
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,870
for the throne.

229
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,570
As for us...

230
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,360
We were in the far west.

231
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
Under those circumstances,

232
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,150
we were probably neglected.

233
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,490
What did you do then?

234
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,670
What could we do?

235
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,120
Our days

236
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,600
became harder and harder.

237
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,990
Soon, some soldiers tried to flee.

238
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,570
The first few deserters

239
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,880
were caught by the junior squad leader Hua Yingran

240
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,050
and whipped.

241
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,550
But that was useless.

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,090
Other soldiers still wanted to leave.

243
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,440
It is a capital crime

244
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,040
for border guards to leave their posts!

245
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
Whether we're alive or dead,

246
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,600
we must stay on our jobs!

247
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,030
But how many soldiers

248
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,150
could he stop on his own?

249
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,930
They all wanted to leave.

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,690
He couldn't force them to stay.

251
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,200
What about you?

252
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,950
Did you leave as well?

253
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,030
Don't even get me started.

254
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,390
I did plan to go away.

255
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,200
I already packed up my stuff.

256
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,530
But later on, I knew I couldn't go.

257
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
Why not?

258
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,370
The junior squad leader fell ill.

259
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,300
Once I left,

260
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,630
he would die.

261
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,890
You, you, you...

262
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
Why don't you stay in bed?

263
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,850
W-Why do you have to get up?

264
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,200
Just take the medicine before you...

265
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't mind me.

266
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,960
My days are numbered.

267
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,270
What's that nonsense about?

268
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,240
Take the medicine now.

269
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,840
Okay?

270
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,960
I know

271
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm dying.

272
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,680
Yingran, you...

273
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Where's the flag?

274
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,870
Where's my flag?

275
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,750
I hung it up.

276
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,500
I hung it up for you.

277
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,640
Don't worry.

278
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,790
You and I are border guards.

279
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,390
We're the last living souls in the fortress.

280
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,360
Yes!

281
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,120
The flag must stay up!

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,280
The flag must stay up!

283
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,130
Unfortunately,

284
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,130
though I took care of him for six months,

285
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,940
he still passed away.

286
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,360
I stayed there for over 20 years

287
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,550
just to honor my promise.

288
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,630
Then, a royal envoy

289
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,650
passed by the fort

290
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,150
and reported this matter

291
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,980
to the imperial court,

292
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,550
which later assigned an official to take over that place.

293
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,320
As for me,

294
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,120
I came back home.

295
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,200
You guarded the borders alone for two decades.

296
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,960
Sir,

297
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,050
you're a true hero.

298
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,480
A true hero must be smart,

299
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,830
courageous and strong.

300
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,440
In what way

301
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,270
am I qualified to be a hero?

302
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,630
Those who devote themselves

303
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,810
to the country and the people are also heroes.

304
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,000
Brave individuals

305
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,080
may not be as great as real patriots, right?

306
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Patriots?

307
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,380
I was just trying

308
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,920
to do my job well.

309
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,210
Exactly because people like you

310
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,930
choose to do

311
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,200
their jobs right,

312
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,680
the country and the people are secured.

313
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,790
Young man,

314
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,120
you talk the talk,

315
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,240
but why don't you walk the walk?

316
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,630
You're always wandering around in the mountain.

317
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,910
How do you know

318
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,720
I'm idling about

319
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,960
and killing time

320
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,910
instead of working hard?

321
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,360
You were away for years,

322
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,180
and you know a lot of things.

323
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,340
Actually, I have a question.

324
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,910
Have you ever

325
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,630
seen a demon?

326
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,670
Wuniang,

327
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,480
a pillow is missing.

328
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,000
Miss Duan,

329
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,060
are you not getting along with your husband?

330
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,240
Did you sleep alone last night?

331
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,060
You two, as a young couple,

332
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,980
spent a night in this secluded mountain.

333
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,349
Why didn't you sleep together?

334
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,349
I caught a cold last night, didn't I?

335
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,900
I just didn't want to infect him.

336
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Don't lie to me.

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,550
I work in the inn,

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,109
and I've received

339
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,550
many couples

340
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,829
who have divided opinions.

341
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,360
It just didn't occur to me

342
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,570
that even a young and beautiful wife like you

343
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,880
would be resented by the husband.

344
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,480
People's lives

345
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,590
are so complicated.

346
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
Wuniang,

347
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,460
what kind of person do you wish to become?

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,530
I haven't thought about it.

349
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,000
But now, I feel like

350
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,970
it's a good thing to become

351
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
someone like you.

352
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,050
Everyone's experiences are different.

353
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,750
How can anyone

354
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,610
just copy another person's life?

355
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,030
In my opinion,

356
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,160
it's nice that you can

357
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,830
run an inn with your father.

358
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,440
You meet different people,

359
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,000
and you have various experiences.

360
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,460
Meet different people...

361
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,380
Have various experiences...

362
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,200
Wuniang,

363
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,110
how long have you been

364
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
running this inn?

365
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,910
For a long time.

366
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,170
More than 10 years, I'd say.

367
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,960
More than 10 years...

368
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
Look,

369
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
your inn

370
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
is located in the wilderness

371
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,610
and is far from the government office.

372
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,750
Has anything dangerous

373
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,530
ever happened here?

374
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,140
My father told me

375
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,640
that as long as I stayed in the inn,

376
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,160
I would be safe.

377
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,190
My father also told me

378
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,150
that the outside world was very dangerous,

379
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,590
and it could cost me my life.

380
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,080
The outside world...

381
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,240
You look

382
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,900
educated and well-mannered.

383
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Why would you believe demons exist?

384
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,100
To be honest,

385
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,130
I firmly believe they do exist.

386
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,380
The world is full of wonders.

387
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,750
Perhaps,

388
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,310
there is a demon in your inn.

389
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,020
Isn't it possible?

390
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,440
I've been running this inn for many years,

391
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,960
never have I heard

392
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,380
that there are demons.

393
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,370
Would you let me do a test then?

394
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,200
How?

395
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,320
What is this?

396
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,010
What it is doesn't matter.

397
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,700
The important thing is,

398
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,020
it detects demons.

399
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,350
W-What is it about the outside world that is dangerous?

400
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,620
Wild cats.

401
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,440
Every year, many people here

402
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,550
would be killed by wild cats.

403
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,250
Wuniang, do you mean cats?

404
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
The wild cats here

405
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,110
are big

406
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,170
and fierce.

407
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,610
When they act in packs,

408
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,800
they can fight like wolves.

409
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,350
If you run into those wild cats,

410
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,550
I'm afraid you won't be

411
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,570
able to fight them off.

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,260
In that case,

413
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
aren't you scared

414
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,260
of those dangerous wild cats

415
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,790
since you're running an inn here?

416
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,640
Not at all.

417
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,510
Why?

418
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,300
Because no wild cats

419
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,600
dare to enter our inn.

420
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Seriously?

421
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,230
Let's have some tea.

422
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,660
What makes you so sure of that?

423
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,400
Even the fiercest beasts

424
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
are afraid of humans.

425
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,230
There are many people

426
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,510
in our inn,

427
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,100
so the wild cats wouldn't dare to come in.

428
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Chief Constable Chu?

429
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,160
Here, would you like a turnip?

430
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,070
Smells good, right?

431
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,480
Eat it. Eat it now.

432
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,510
Help yourself.

433
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,990
Eat this.

434
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,730
What are you doing here?

435
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,350
Do you remember Gao Sheng,

436
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,750
whose horse killed a man?

437
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
Chi Xue told me about him.

438
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,260
That man was beheaded,

439
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
but he didn't really die.

440
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

441
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,880
I was ordered to catch him.

442
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,610
I followed him all the way here.

443
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,010
Have you caught him yet?

444
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,090
When I found him,

445
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,680
he was already dead.

446
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,530
How did that happen?

447
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,510
I discovered his corpse

448
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,680
in the woods.

449
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,020
His eyes had been gouged out.

450
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,840
His hair had been cut evenly.

451
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
The locals said the wild cats did it.

452
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,750
Wild cats might take a man's eyes out.

453
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,350
That could possibly happen.

454
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,830
But they can't cut a man's hair

455
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,030
off evenly, can they?

456
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,650
Wild cats may not be able to do it,

457
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,840
but the Cat Demon can.

458
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,230
Cat Demon?

459
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,890
What Cat Demon?

460
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,740
Chi Wangchuan once told me

461
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,140
that my father was helped by

462
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,880
a demon that could change lives.

463
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,450
We suspect that this demon

464
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,700
is actually the Cat Demon Nine Lives.

465
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,680
You were going after Gao Sheng.

466
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,540
Why would you stay at Reunion Inn?

467
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,070
It was too late when we were getting back to the city,

468
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,270
so we decided to stay here.

469
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,720
We planned

470
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,180
to leave the next morning,

471
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,640
but something I found held us back.

472
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,250
This is Gao Sheng's hair band.

473
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,380
Are you sure?

474
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,590
That day on the street,

475
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,750
I saw this on him.

476
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,060
I did find it familiar.

477
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,640
I wondered if Gao Sheng

478
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,560
had stayed here

479
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,900
on his journey.

480
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,960
So I asked the innkeeper about it.

481
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,640
Both he and his employees

482
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,500
said they had never seen this guy.

483
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,800
I got suspicious,

484
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,750
so I let a fellow go

485
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,030
to report the situation to the lord,

486
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,270
while I stayed here with a colleague

487
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,070
to continue our investigation.

488
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,440
What have you found?

489
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,030
The innkeeper's name is Feng Tian.

490
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,460
He has a daughter named Feng Wuniang.

491
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,550
The servants look odd.

492
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,980
They like to peep and to imitate others.

493
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,580
They don't seem very bright.

494
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,510
They're always whispering

495
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,840
behind people's backs.

496
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,680
As for the innkeeper Feng Tian,

497
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,950
he seems neat,

498
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,580
and he knows martial skills.

499
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,160
Speaking of demons,

500
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,160
do you think

501
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,070
he's one of them?

502
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
He used to be in the military.

503
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,130
I already ran a test.

504
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,120
He is a human,

505
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,110
not a demon.

506
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,920
He used to be in the military?

507
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,590
Yes.

508
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,960
He's an excellent martial fighter.

509
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,240
He is just

510
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,740
as good as you and me,

511
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,480
or even better.

512
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,850
Stay!

513
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,480
This...

514
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,250
W-What is this about?

515
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,810
You don't know about this?

516
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,110
Chi Xue is...

517
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,310
A demon?

518
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,360
A demon hunter takes a demon with him?

519
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,450
Does that sound strange to you?

520
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,680
Wuniang?

521
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,700
Wuniang.

522
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,790
Wuniang?

523
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,690
I'm coming in.

524
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,120
Wuniang,

525
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,060
the guest in Xin Court

526
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,940
has stayed here

527
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,890
for half a month.

528
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,080
If you've had you fun,

529
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,350
please just let him go.

530
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,290
The male guest in Jia Court

531
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,720
has talked to me.

532
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,750
He's a demon hunter,

533
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,640
clever and persistent.

534
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,550
You'd better stay away from him.

535
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm is talking to you.

536
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,540
Are you listening?

537
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,720
I'm telling you,

538
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,340
the male guest in Jia Court

539
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,670
could get you in danger.

540
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,560
Try not to

541
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,510
show up when he is around.

542
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,490
Father, didn't you tell me

543
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,810
that I would be blessed

544
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,720
if I acted like an upright person

545
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,200
and did good deeds?

546
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,730
I'm not evil.

547
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,680
Why would they want to hurt me?

548
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,550
Or do you think

549
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,630
I'll affect the inn's business?

550
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,550
We are very different from them.

551
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,900
Staying away from them

552
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,620
is staying away from trouble.

553
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,720
No.

554
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,660
I really like that female guest in Jia Court.

555
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,100
I want to spend

556
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,550
more time with her.

557
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,550
Is it pretty?

558
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,440
My dearest daughter,

559
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,750
can you stop with this nonsense?

560
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,280
Just listen to me, will you?

561
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,890
[Reunion Inn]

562
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,260
Here, have some water.

563
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,220
I'm fine now.

564
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,770
Is what Youhuang said true?

565
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,570
Does the Cat Demon really kill humans?

566
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,080
You don't think he does?

567
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
I don't think he does.

568
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,830
Clear your mind.

569
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,830
Go to bed now.

570
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,220
I'll be in the next room.

571
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,550
Scream if you need help.

572
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,380
Father, didn't you tell me

573
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,750
that I would be blessed

574
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,550
if I acted like an upright person

575
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,160
and did good deeds?

576
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,550
I'm not evil.

577
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,660
Why would they want to hurt me?

578
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,240
Who is it?

579
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,440
Who is out there?

580
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,140
A cat...

581
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,490
Xuanye!

582
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,480
Xuanye!

583
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,000
What's up?

584
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,130
I think I just saw the Cat Demon.

585
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,780
[Xin]

586
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,480
He's gone.

587
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,270
He disappeared right after

588
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,730
entering this courtyard.

589
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,140
Could this be

590
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,430
his lair?

591
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,410
Since we reached the Reunion Inn,

592
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,960
it seems like he's been trying to lead us

593
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,760
to this place.

594
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,780
Let's look for him.

595
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,450
Who is it?

596
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,510
Banxia?

597
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,310
Yanqiu?

598
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,260
What brought you here?

599
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,470
We're here for some issues.

600
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,240
Yanqiu,

601
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,480
why would you come here?

602
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,110
Haven't you gone back to Nanyang?

603
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,910
I happened to pass by this place,

604
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,790
and I found the scenery beautiful.

605
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,540
I felt a bit tired,

606
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,830
so I thought I should stay here for a rest.

607
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,590
Does the family know about this?

608
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,960
I already sent a letter.

609
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,960
But, Yanqiu,

610
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,000
do you know there's something wrong

611
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,830
with this inn?

612
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,060
It's not safe for you to stay here.

613
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,930
What's wrong with this inn?

614
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,510
I'm well aware of

615
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,970
what Mr. Jiu is capable of.

616
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,840
The innkeeper here is kind,

617
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,480
and his employees work hard.

618
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,010
I don't see anything wrong.

619
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,030
I can't be a jinx

620
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,340
who meets demons everywhere he goes, right?

621
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,630
Lord Duan,

622
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,790
maybe you're right.

623
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,080
All we have now is just a theory.

624
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,960
Lord Duan, have you not slept well

625
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,070
in these days?

626
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,480
I see dark circles under your eyes,

627
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,740
and your lips are pale.

628
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,830
Perhaps something is wrong with your blood circulation.

629
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,650
I guess the high humidity here

630
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,300
has affected your health.

631
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,060
I'm fine.

632
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,180
I just got disturbed

633
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,450
by the humming insects outside.

634
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,380
Banxia.

635
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,620
Why don't you let me feel your pulse,

636
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,170
so I can prescribe

637
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,900
some calming and sleep-aiding medicine for you?

638
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,200
Although I am a demon hunter now,

639
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
I used to study medicine.

640
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,960
What?

641
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,340
Do you not trust me, Lord Duan?

642
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,740
Why wouldn't I?

643
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,370
It's just that...

644
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,500
I know about

645
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,470
my own health.

646
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,310
There are no serious problems.

647
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,720
I'd hate to bother you, Mr. Jiu.

648
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,070
No worries. It's just a small favor.

649
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,970
It's getting late.

650
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,870
We'll pick up our talk tomorrow.

651
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,040
You two should get some rest.

652
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,480
Okay.

653
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,310
Goodnight, Lord Duan.

654
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,390
I'll take Banxia back to our room.

655
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,170
My cousin was acting weird, don't you think?

656
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Yes, I think so.

657
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,990
He was impatient

658
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,390
about our conversation,

659
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,460
and he refused any physical contact.

660
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,960
Most importantly,

661
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,140
he didn't seem to care about

662
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,480
us, a man and a woman,

663
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
being here alone.

664
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,070
He didn't ask a single question

665
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,340
when I took you away.

666
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
He is different from his usual self.

667
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
What do you think caused the change?

668
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,550
I think

669
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,630
he was hiding something.

670
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,280
Hiding something?

671
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,690
Did you smell

672
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,050
alcohol on him just now?

673
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,440
I did.

674
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,420
The strong calming fragrance

675
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,710
in the room

676
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,560
covered that scent, though.

677
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,199
But my cousin does

678
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,090
have a habit of drinking alcohol.

679
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,650
Don't worry.

680
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,670
He's staying at this inn now.

681
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,920
We'll look after him.

682
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,070
For the time being,

683
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,330
he is safe.

684
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,969
Let's go back to our place.

685
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,320
Okay.

686
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,530
Still worried about your cousin, aren't you?

687
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,360
I understand what you told me,

688
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,429
but something still baffles me.

689
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,190
My cousin has always

690
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,150
respected rules

691
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,280
and acted properly.

692
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,070
I can't figure out why

693
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,530
he would become like this.

694
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,230
My father is missing.

695
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,440
Although we're

696
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,370
onto a clue about the Cat Demon now,

697
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
we still don't know

698
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,560
where exactly he has been taken.

699
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,470
Now, even my cousin

700
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,020
has been dragged into this.

701
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,730
Why do things of this kind

702
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,330
keep happening to my family?

703
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,190
First, I became able to see demons.

704
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,720
Then, I found out my cousin was in love with a demon.

705
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,630
My father

706
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,290
was even taken away by a demon.

707
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,790
I can't stop thinking

708
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,550
if these misfortunes

709
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,190
befell us because of me

710
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,670
and my eyes

711
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,820
that can see demons.

712
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,330
Maybe that's the reason

713
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,920
that demons would try to hunt them down

714
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,000
or bewitch them.

715
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,190
Each of those incidents

716
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,850
happened right in front of me,

717
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,810
yet I couldn't do anything.

718
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,000
You're doing a good enough job already.

719
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,570
I remember when you first

720
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,810
met Manniang

721
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,920
and Chi Wangchuan,

722
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,390
you were so panicked.

723
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,510
But now, you can

724
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,910
calmly face everything.

725
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,220
For example,

726
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,400
when the Cat Demon suddenly appeared today,

727
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,440
you went after him without hesitation.

728
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,710
You didn't chicken out.

729
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,150
No one could've done

730
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,400
better than you.

731
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,190
Banxia,

732
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,480
you're very brave.

733
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,590
But if I had been braver

734
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,360
and more careful,

735
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,030
maybe I could've noticed

736
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,760
that my father was off that day.

737
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,630
If I had known Chi Wangchuan was in his room,

738
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,960
none of these things would have happened.

739
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,820
We are just ordinary people.

740
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,550
We can't foresee the future.

741
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,390
You shouldn't beat yourself up

742
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,550
for what you did.

743
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,990
You didn't do anything wrong.

744
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,670
Under these circumstances,

745
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,840
you must have a strong will.

746
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,920
Don't be sad.

747
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,010
I'm not sad.

748
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,620
Something got into my eye.

749
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,360
Really?

750
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,190
Let me see.

751
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,330
Where?

752
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,110
The right eye.

753
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,910
The right eye.

754
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,520
This one?

755
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,650
Are you feeling better?

756
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,760
If something gets into your eyes again,

757
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,320
wash them with clean water first,

758
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,650
or ask someone for help.

759
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,480
You can't rub them with your hands.

760
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,010
Or your eyes could get hurt.

761
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,520
I got it, Physician Jiu.

762
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,410
A laugh. Seriously?

763
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,760
Do you remember what I said?

764
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,000
I do.

765
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,160
But that can't stop me from laughing.

766
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,000
Is Banxia asleep?

767
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,360
Yes.

768
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,610
Where have you been?

769
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,110
I was out trying to catch the Cat Demon.

770
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,110
I meant to ambush it in a narrow lane.

771
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,450
But I got lost

772
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,610
in this large place.

773
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,190
Come on, lad.

774
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,630
What?

775
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,170
I'm curious.

776
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,760
Did you just kiss Banxia?

777
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,230
Who would kiss her?

778
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Give me an answer,

779
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,130
or I won't let you sleep.

780
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,910
Don't talk nonsense.

781
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,440
I clearly saw it.

782
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,000
You were sitting there with her.

783
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,660
And then...

784
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,210
When we were sitting there,

785
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,150
sand grains got into

786
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,860
her right eye,

787
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,320
so I gave her a little help.

788
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,790
Don't try to fool me.

789
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,140
I have

790
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,870
seen through you.

791
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,880
Is that so?

792
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,730
Tell me about it.

793
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,580
I'm all ears.

794
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,640
I can't describe it,

795
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:54,840
but I'm sure

796
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,240
the way you look at Banxia

797
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,470
is just the same as the way

798
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,400
your dad looked at your mom,

799
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,860
and the way your brother looked at Miss Wang.

800
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,900
[Reunion Inn]

801
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,000
Sir,

802
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,030
there are rats in our room.

803
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,590
Rats?

804
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,280
Yeah.

805
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,020
Why would there be rats?

806
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,880
It's true.

807
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,880
They made so much noise last night.

808
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,650
I didn't sleep well.

809
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,180
Please come and take a look.

810
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,550
Stop it.

811
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,290
Dismissed.

812
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,110
Miss Duan.

813
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,550
What were you doing?

814
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,880
Dancing?

815
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,920
We were

816
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,210
just playing in our spare time.

817
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,440
You look great today.

818
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,640
The mountain is very quiet.

819
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,770
I got some good rest.

820
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,280
I heard something big happened

821
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,850
in Jia Court last night.

822
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,240
Did that disturb you?

823
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,240
You already heard about it?

824
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,130
It was just a wild cat.

825
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,980
I brought some snacks from Guangping.

826
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,440
Not much is left. Try some.

827
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,440
Miss Duan, have you forgotten

828
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,730
that my sense of taste doesn't work?

829
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,130
Even so,

830
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,900
you still need food.

831
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,740
These snacks look good.

832
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,460
I'll bring them back

833
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,210
and eat with my father.

834
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,920
Wuniang,

835
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,080
I want to ask you something.

836
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,260
You told me

837
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,960
that we were the only guests here

838
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,890
since the inn was being renovated.

839
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,590
But yesterday, I saw someone staying

840
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,510
in Xin Court.

841
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,670
Really?

842
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,040
Oh, right.

843
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,280
A guest is staying there.

844
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,320
He is a young gentleman.

845
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Since he came to our inn,

846
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,340
he has never left his room.

847
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,890
I haven't seen him much,

848
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,610
so I just

849
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,040
forgot about him.

850
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,110
Forgot?

851
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,180
Some guests are odd.

852
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,030
They don't want to

853
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,280
stay at home

854
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,970
for certain reasons.

855
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,030
They would choose to come

856
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,320
to this remote mountain instead.

857
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,480
I don't know

858
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,150
what they are hiding from.

859
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,030
Miss Duan,

860
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,480
why did you suddenly ask about him?

861
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,070
Do you know him?

862
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,230
He is my cousin.

863
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,400
Really?

864
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,870
But you two don't

865
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,200
look alike at all.

866
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,390
You are better-looking.

867
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,380
You're so blessed, Miss Duan.

868
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,550
You have a husband

869
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
and a cousin.

870
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,800
By contrast,

871
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,310
all I have is my father.

872
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,560
My brother has been gone for a long time.

873
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,000
You have a brother?

874
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
He ran away.

875
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,800
Someday,

876
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,180
I'll run away too.

877
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,960
Miss Duan,

878
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,500
can I go to your home

879
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,510
when that happens?
