Focus on the

00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,960
on behalf of Shiba Family

3
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,360
will produce the answer

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,400
Shiba Cooper

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Episode 1

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Anxia, eat some fish.

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I picked the side dishes for you.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Shou Wutao, you don't have to be so polite.

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
You don't have to be polite with me.

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Her fish is good.

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Try it.

13
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm afraid you won't eat fish, so I picked the side dishes for you.

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
How is it?

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Eat more.

16
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
This is the wine of the imperial village.

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
It's very sharp. Don't drink this.

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Come on, have some tea.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I can do it myself.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
You've already drank it. Have some.

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
You really don't have to.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Is this the one?

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
What's wrong, Anxia?

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
I've drank the wine.

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Have some tea.

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you.

28
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
This is really good wine.

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Li is also a good person.

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
He didn't come today.

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Li is going home after the holiday.

32
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Why?

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
He's second brother's marriage.

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
He went to the wedding.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
He didn't go to the wedding.

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
He went home.

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
What does he know?

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:04:11,520
He's already passed the

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
wedding.

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm just kidding.

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm already married.

42
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Be careful.

43
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm telling you.

44
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
It's really good.

45
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Yes.

46
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
It's still hot.

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Mr. Yan.

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
You guys go back first.

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Don't wait for me.

50
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Let's go.

51
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I'll wait for you downstairs.

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
It's okay.

53
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
You go back first.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Tingzhu,

55
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
send Anxia back first.

56
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay.

57
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Go ahead.

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Be careful.

59
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Anxia.

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Didn't I ask you to go back first?

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Why are you waiting here?

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm going back anyway.

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
There's nothing to do.

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
What are you looking at?

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
What are you looking at?

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
The light is so good.

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm talking about clothes.

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
As I expected.

69
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You're so good at eating and eating.

70
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll give you your clothes.

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Should you give me something?

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
What do you want?

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Let's go.

74
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
It's okay.

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
It's here.

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
It's here.

77
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
You should rest early.

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I'll send you tomorrow.

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
No need.

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
As a resident,

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
if you don't think about it,

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
in the future,

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
you'll have to go back to your hometown.

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
We don't have to see each other again.

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
What do you mean?

86
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
No matter what the reason is,

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
if you think it through,

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
you can come to me in the heaven.

89
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I'll give you another year.

90
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Chu Rouhuang,

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm not saying that you're not.

92
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Thank you.

93
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Enjoy.

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's good.

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Try it.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
If you really want to give me food,

97
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
why didn't you buy two bowls?

98
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
We can have one bowl.

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
If you don't want to drink,

100
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
do you dislike me?

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
No.

102
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Try one.

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Is it good?

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
It's good.

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Eat it.

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I won't steal it from you.

107
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I won't steal it from you.

108
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
It's late now.

109
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
We'll go back when you're done.

110
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
You really want to go back so early?

111
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I want to go around again.

112
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You're worried about your parents when you're late?

113
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I called them when I left.

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
No need to worry.

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
How are they?

116
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Did they take the medicine?

117
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Did they eat well?

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
My father doesn't have any.

119
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
It's my mother.

120
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
She's not very strong.

121
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
She has to be a dreamer.

122
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
She needs to be strong to get up.

123
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
It's bad for your health.

124
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
How about this?

125
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll go back and

126
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
give you a soup made by God.

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
You take it back.

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay.

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Do you still remember

130
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
the wish you two made here?

131
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
The wish has come true now.

132
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
My parents are really safe now.

133
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
But I don't know why.

134
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I always think my mother doesn't like me.

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
She always hides from me.

136
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
She's very polite when she talks to me.

137
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
She doesn't like me touching her.

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Xuan Ye.

139
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Do you think

140
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm not good enough?

141
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I've grown up,

142
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
but I didn't look like

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
the way she likes me.

144
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
That's why she's like this.

145
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
You should know

146
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
what your mother has been through.

147
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
She's been in the Su City for more than ten years.

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
She can't speak or move.

149
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
She's awake,

150
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
but she's been controlled by the light.

151
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Can you understand what kind of despair that is?

152
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
She's not dead,

153
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
not crazy,

154
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
and she's not become another person.

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
It's not easy.

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Some experiences

157
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
are not over.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I've seen a lot of people

159
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,800
who can't reconcile with the past.

160
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
So your mother

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
has done a great job today.

162
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm very grateful

163
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
for your help.

164
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
It's good now.

165
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
You can be more patient

166
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
and accompany her.

167
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
You're right.

168
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I didn't know that.

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
You know a lot.

170
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
You know too little.

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
You scared me.

172
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I can't see the fireworks anymore.

173
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
We're out.

174
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Everything in the world

175
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
is fake, right?

176
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
That's also very scary.

177
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Ban Xia,

178
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
have you ever thought that

179
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
if you can't see the demon,

180
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
what kind of life will you live?

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
It should be very different.

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
The days are passing very fast.

183
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
My father is still in the office.

184
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
My mother has never left.

185
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
My family's relationship is closer.

186
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I might go to school,

187
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
study,

188
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
learn horse riding.

189
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Maybe I can still do martial arts.

190
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Isn't this a lotus face?

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
It's also a good lotus face.

192
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Do you like that kind of life?

193
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
I don't like it.

194
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Why?

195
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Because I can't meet you like that.

196
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Xuan Yan,

197
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
everything in the painting is fake.

198
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Is the painting you told me also fake?

199
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
What painting?

200
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
You forgot?

201
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
What?

202
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
How can you forget such an important thing?

203
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
That day you told me that you liked me.

204
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
You don't remember me,

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
but I remember you clearly.

206
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
That day is the same as today.

207
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
It's also a night like this.

208
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
The stars are full of stars.

209
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
There is no moon.

210
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
And then in that moment of the fireworks flying up,

211
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
you told me that you liked me.

212
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
You said that you didn't accept my feelings before.

213
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
It's because you think that

214
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
we are not suitable for each other.

215
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You are the demon in the Star Wind Blood.

216
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Why did you say that again?

217
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Why did you say that again?

218
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I asked you about it.

219
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
But that time Chu Bu Tou broke us.

220
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
You didn't answer me.

221
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I didn't answer you.

222
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Did you answer me?

223
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
It's late.

224
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Let's go back first.

225
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
No.

226
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
We must make it clear today.

227
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
You must tell me.

228
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
That's why you should know.

229
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Of course.

230
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Such an important thing

231
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
must be said clearly.

232
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You can't just

233
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
go through it all at once.

234
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
You must give me an answer today.

235
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Do you accept my feelings?

236
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Do you like me?

237
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Do you want to be with me?

238
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
I don't have this answer today.

239
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
I...

240
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
That's because...

241
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Have you

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
kicked me out of here?

243
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Let's go.

244
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
The world is full of you

245
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
The world is full of you

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
The world is full of you

247
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
The world is full of you

248
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
You are by my side

249
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Dad

250
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Why are you still here so late?

251
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
So I can't sleep

252
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Thank you for sending me home

253
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Uncle, it's a good trip

254
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Uncle, I have time to do something

255
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
I want to thank you for letting me have a drink

256
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Uncle, you are so kind

257
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
You have thanked me many times

258
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,800
No matter how much I thank you, it's not enough

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
It's late

260
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
You two should stop being so kind

261
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Xuan Ye, since my dad has a mouth,

262
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
you should come over

263
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Okay

264
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Let's go

265
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I'll go back first

266
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Uncle, I'll go first

267
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Let's go

268
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Fan Xia

269
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Have you had a drink?

270
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
A little bit

271
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Did my mom sleep?

272
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Your mom just came back from her baby

273
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
She's resting in her room

274
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
By the way, what do Dr. Jiu usually like to eat?

275
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Is there any kind of soup?

276
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
He likes to eat...

277
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Eat?

278
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Let's buy some more meat

279
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Have you eaten on the wedding?

280
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Do you want to know something?

281
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I've eaten

282
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm a little thirsty

283
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Dad, why don't you have some tea?

284
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay, you go back to your room and wait

285
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Brother, I finally found you

286
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Brother, you're really here

287
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Mom, it's me, Fan Xia

288
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Mom, did you sleep?

289
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Did I see you just now?

290
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Did you sleep?

291
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I'm not sure

292
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Mom, did you sleep?

293
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I did

294
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Anything wrong?

295
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm in a bad condition

296
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Can you help me to prevent it?

297
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Come in

298
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Brother, brother

299
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
No need to do that

300
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
The world of painting is just a dream

301
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
We can just call it that

302
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Then we'll call you Dr. Jiu in the future

303
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Okay

304
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
We're here for the little winter

305
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I'll send you a letter

306
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
The blood test shows that the descendants of the book

307
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
have been cleaned

308
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
The rest of the people are safe and sent to the next house

309
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
The demon you asked me to see

310
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
has left since yesterday

311
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Guangping and the underground city are far away

312
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I hope you and I will be together

313
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
If you have any difficulties, please come to me

314
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I'll help you

315
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Thank you

316
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Sit down

317
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Mom, you're so pretty

318
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
What do you mean?

319
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
You're really pretty

320
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Shunye told me

321
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
that the time in painting is the same as the outside

322
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Why don't you change at all?

323
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
You little horse

324
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
I don't have a horse

325
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Mom

326
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
It's great that you're back

327
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
You've been through a lot these years

328
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I'll listen to you well

329
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I won't make you angry and make you happy

330
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
We'll never be apart

331
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I went to the room to look for you

332
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
So you're here

333
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I came to look for my mom

334
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
It's bad

335
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Your mom's hand

336
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
You'd better not look for your dad

337
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
You're so mean

338
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
My mom is much better than you

339
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
It's late

340
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
The tea is in your room

341
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Go back

342
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Okay

343
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Thank you, mom

344
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Go back

345
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Mom

346
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Why do you call this kid?

347
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Why does he have a mouth?

348
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Don't be so formal

349
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I don't know

350
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
By the way

351
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I don't know your names

352
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm Xiangshan

353
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I'm Xianghuang

354
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Doctor

355
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Our brothers

356
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
are like a war soul

357
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
When we were in the underground city

358
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
we were so rude

359
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Please, Doctor Jiu and Hai Han

360
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
It's all over

361
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I remember you were brothers

362
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Why are you the only ones

363
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
in the world?

364
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Two years ago

365
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
we were looking for

366
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
the case of the new king

367
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
He stayed in the underground city

368
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
That night

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
we got the news

370
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
that the prince had been to the library

371
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
We also felt

372
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
the library was strange

373
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
We wanted to go to the library

374
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
to take a look

375
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
We didn't expect them to be so alert

376
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
We were found by the first-class door

377
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
The third class was killed

378
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
My brother and I were attacked

379
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
by the enemy

380
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
We were wrong

381
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
We didn't know our own amount

382
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
If you didn't help us

383
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
we would be

384
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Good day, brothers

385
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Doctor Jiu

386
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Your kindness

387
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,800
is in our brother's mind

388
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
That's right

389
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
If he needs my brothers

390
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
he will be so rude

391
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
You two are serious

392
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
In the world

393
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
you have helped me a lot

394
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
This love is back

395
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
It's late

396
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
We are going to move

397
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
It's late

398
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
We should stay overnight

399
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
We should go tomorrow

400
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
We still have to escort the third class

401
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
to the library

402
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
We have to delay it for a while

403
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes

404
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Brother

405
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm sorry

406
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm sorry

407
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I regret it

408
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I regret it

409
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I regret it

410
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I'll go to the library

411
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Okay

412
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
We are all in the library

413
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
You hold it

414
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
It's for the first class

415
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
What is this?

416
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
It's for the first class

417
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
It's good to have a meal

418
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
and have a good time

419
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
We don't need to go to school

420
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
We just need to stay overnight

421
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
That's right

422
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Let's buy a dish

423
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
and go back to stew it

424
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Okay

425
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Okay

426
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Wait

427
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
When are we going back to eat?

428
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Yes

429
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Call him by his name

430
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Okay

431
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
He is our family

432
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
He is our benefactor

433
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
We should be polite

434
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
You are so polite to him

435
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
He wouldn't dare to come

436
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Why?

437
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
You two have...

438
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
No

439
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Don't call him by his name

440
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
He is old now

441
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Just call him Xueye

442
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Da Xia

443
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Sir, your order is ready

444
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
How much?

445
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
20 yuan

446
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
The medicine shop in Ganshan is really cheap

447
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
It's cheaper than the Changming Medicine Shop

448
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Because we don't go to buy it

449
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Six months ago, there was a case

450
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Didn't you hear it?

451
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Six years ago

452
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
What case?

453
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
You heard me

454
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Six years ago, there was a case

455
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
You didn't know?

456
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I didn't know

457
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
The whole street knows

458
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I didn't know

459
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I thought you might be caught

460
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
They are all dead

461
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Famwalk

462
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Get out

463
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,180
...

464
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,700
I've found you.

465
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I'm not a good person.

466
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm not a good person.

467
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
I'm not a good person.

468
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm not a good person.

469
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I'm not a good person.

470
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm not a good person.

471
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I'm not a good person.

472
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm not a good person.

473
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
I'm not a good person.

474
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
I'm not a good person.

475
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
I'm not a good person.

476
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm not a good person.

477
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm not a good person.

478
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm not a good person.

479
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm not a good person.

480
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm not a good person.

481
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm not a good person.

482
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm not a good person.

483
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm not a good person.

484
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm not a good person.

485
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm not a good person.

486
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm not a good person.

487
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm not a good person.

488
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm not a good person.

489
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
I'm not a good person.

490
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm not a good person.

491
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I'm not a good person.

492
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I'm not a good person.

493
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm not a good person.

494
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm not a good person.

495
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm not a good person.

496
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm not a good person.

497
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
No wonder you aren't looking for Lou Ying.

498
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,480
Science

499
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,040
Into billion

500
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
What is this place?

501
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
What is this place?

502
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Shunyi!

503
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Shunyi, what are you doing on the street?

504
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Shunyi, what's wrong?

505
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Xia.

506
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
It's me. What's wrong?

507
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
How is it? Are you feeling better?

508
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm fine.

509
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Why did you go outside just now?

510
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,040
I don't know. Maybe I had a nightmare.

511
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
What's wrong?

512
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Why are you bleeding? How did you get this?

513
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm fine.

514
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Yuechong?

515
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Yuechong is biting you. Why did he hurt you?

516
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Maybe I had a nightmare. I offended them in my dream.

517
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Don't say that.

518
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
You haven't fed them for so long. Are you hungry?

519
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
It's possible.

520
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
They like to drink lamb soup.

521
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,040
I'll buy some lamb soup tomorrow morning.

522
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Okay.

523
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
I'll buy some lamb soup.

524
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Okay.

525
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
You don't have to keep watching this.

526
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
It's okay. I'm fine anyway.

527
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Yuechong must be hungry. He'll bite you when he's done.

528
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I'll make him some soup.

529
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Let me do it.

530
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Here.

531
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
I still want to feed him a lamb soup.

532
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Go ahead.

533
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,040
So you really like asking me away?

534
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:46,680
You're even

535
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,680
You can call me chin Trekking Season 2.

536
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,100
What are you thinking?

537
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,300
Nothing.

538
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,560
Really?

539
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Really?

540
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,880
Ban Xia, last night, on the street,

541
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,680
when you saw me,

542
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
was there anything strange?

543
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,360
I didn't sleep at night,

544
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
I was wandering on the street alone.

545
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,600
It's not strange.

546
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,440
Don't worry.

547
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,800
I won't destroy your dream.

548
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,800
You said those clear words and thoughts,

549
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,040
I clearly remember the first love,

550
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,840
but why didn't I remember it when it was useful?

551
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,480
That's just a dream.

552
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
You won't take it seriously, right?

553
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,960
The dance is fake, the dance is also fake.

554
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,360
As long as you leave the rules of the Shunyao Palace,

555
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,720
you won't be able to break it.

556
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,720
You never become a martial artist.

557
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,520
People who are good at dancing,

558
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,640
who are good at practicing,

559
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,880
who are good at dancing,

560
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,480
they are all year round,

561
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,920
they keep practicing and practicing.

562
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,720
If you can make a dream come true,

563
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,920
it's not that easy.

564
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,120
Go.

565
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,120
You want to dance?

566
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
How about this?

567
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,120
If you are not afraid of suffering,

568
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,320
I can teach you some moves to protect yourself.

569
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,720
Who wants to learn the moves to protect themselves?

570
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,320
I want to learn dancing and then dance with you.

571
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,520
Dancing and dancing is too dangerous.

572
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,920
You learn dancing and you can strengthen your body.

573
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,120
Don't underestimate me.

574
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,520
If I am a talented dancer,

575
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,120
a good dancer,

576
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,920
a talented dancer in the Heavenly Palace,

577
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
how can I be a good dancer?

578
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
Okay.

579
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,520
What are you doing?

580
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,720
You really think you have a iron sandal?

581
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,120
Let me do it.

582
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,920
I used to be a filial son-in-law.

583
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,520
I said I was a madman.

584
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,920
I always thought I was living in the drama.

585
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,120
But now I am like this.

586
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,920
Hey.

587
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,120
I hope Yue Chong won't be mad at me anymore.

588
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,920
Hey, what's wrong?

589
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,120
Tao, why are you drunk so fast today?

590
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,720
He is drunk today.

591
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,520
He is like this every day.

592
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,120
He doesn't seem to be sleeping.

593
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,320
Tao.

594
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,520
Tao, come again.

595
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,320
Hey.

596
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,120
I won't drink anymore.

597
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
I am going back.

598
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,120
And someone is waiting for me at home.

599
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,320
Who is waiting for you at home?

600
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
You bastard.

601
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,920
Here you are.

602
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
You are a madman.

603
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
You are dreaming about your marriage again.

604
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,520
Miss, what are you doing here?

605
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,320
The vegetables are very fresh today.

606
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,520
I will come later.

607
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,920
Okay.

608
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Miss, you are here.

609
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Did you come to pick the sheep?

610
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,520
They are resting at home.

611
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
This is the pig I just killed this morning.

612
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,720
It's Mr. Xin.

613
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,720
This is the meat I left for you.

614
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Isn't this the second house of the wine house?

615
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
Which wine house?

616
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Which wine house can it be?

617
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,720
The one from the year before the Ganshan Hall.

618
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Yes.

619
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
It is the second house of the Ganshan Hall.

620
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,920
It is not only Jingying's house,

621
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,720
but also the government's house.

622
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,320
It has been a great merit for the past few days.

623
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
And it has been awarded by the adults.

624
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,120
Dr. Jiu is a good doctor.

625
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,320
His skills are also excellent.

626
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,120
And I found that his herbs are much more valuable than others.

627
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
If you need them,

628
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
please visit them.

629
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,120
Miss, I will sell you this meat today.

630
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,120
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

631
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Why did you tell them that?

632
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,520
You did a good thing.

633
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,720
Why did you hide it in the night?

634
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,720
You went to the kitchen to cook, and you protected the people.

635
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,920
You didn't tell them to be so grateful.

636
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,720
At least that's the attitude.

637
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,320
Sometimes, you don't care.

638
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,520
But others will say that

639
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,320
things will only get worse and worse.

640
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,520
We get along well.

641
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,320
The most important thing is communication.

642
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,520
I'm here.

643
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,320
What are you doing?

644
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm buying presents for my parents.

645
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
Aren't you going to my house to eat?

646
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,920
Isn't your parents inviting me to the banquet

647
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,720
to thank me for saving my life?

648
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,520
Why do you want me to buy presents?

649
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,920
You are a young and old man.

650
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,320
No matter what the reason is, you should have the right to say it.

651
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Besides, you and I...

652
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720
Then...

653
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
What am I doing with you?

654
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
You don't know?

655
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
What do you mean?

656
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,520
You are pretending to be me, aren't you?

657
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,320
I didn't pretend to be you.

658
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,120
You are pretending.

659
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Father, mother.

660
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,320
These are all the herbs that Xuan Ye bought for you.

661
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,520
He said that you have been in a hurry for a long time.

662
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,320
You need to train more.

663
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Only then can you adjust your appearance.

664
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,320
Thank you, mother.

665
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,920
The two of us from the family of my father

666
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,520
saved the world from him.

667
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,720
This kindness hasn't been healed yet.

668
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,320
Today, we have sent you so many gifts.

669
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,720
You are so generous.

670
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,920
You are welcome.

671
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,120
I am the demon master.

672
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,320
The demon master is my duty.

673
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,520
You are elders.

674
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,120
Xuan Ye came here for the first time.

675
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
These are all my duties.

676
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Hurry and go eat.

677
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Okay.

678
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Eunuch, please.

679
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Eunuch,

680
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,520
do you have any purpose in saving my life?

681
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Uncle Duan is serious.

682
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Just call me Xuan Ye.

683
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
I really don't want to call you Eunuch anymore.

684
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Exactly.

685
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Why are you so polite?

686
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,520
You are also like your own family.

687
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Thank you.

688
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Don't worry.

689
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
He is always the one who teaches the demon.

690
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I think he is very aggressive.

691
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Xuan Ye is not just a demon master.

692
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,520
The other one is his.

693
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Usually, when he doesn't want to be a demon,

694
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
he gives people a position.

695
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Don't think he is so young.

696
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
But his magic is very powerful.

697
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
Usually, the demon is not his opponent.

698
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,520
His demon is as simple as a cat's claws.

699
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
What kind of defense did you hit him?

700
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Anyway, don't worry about your Eunuch.

701
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
He is very powerful.

702
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
No wine?

703
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I'll go and get it.

704
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
You are so kind.

705
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
You are so kind.

706
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
You are so good.

707
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,520
You have been so kind to me.

708
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Uncle Duan is so polite.

709
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
After this,

710
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
we have a good life.

711
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
It's time to get married.

712
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,520
We are going to hold the wedding of the Cao Ban.

713
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Thank you for your kindness.

714
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,520
We two can get married at the same time.

715
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
By the way,

716
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Ban Xia has told you about her wedding.

717
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,520
She is my son-in-law.

718
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,520
She is young and has a good learning.

719
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,520
She is also a good person.

720
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
We are parents.

721
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,520
We hope that the child can be safe.

722
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,520
We just hope that Ban Xia can get married safely

723
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,520
and live a safe life.

724
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
We are satisfied.

725
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
When I went out,

726
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
what did my father say to you?

727
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Nothing.

728
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
They said Dong Jie opened a restaurant.

729
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
We had a good time there.

730
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
We can try it someday.

731
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
Okay.

732
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
You can go back first.

733
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
I don't need to.

734
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Your father drank a lot of wine.

735
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Give him some new wine soup.

736
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
I will make it for you later.

737
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
It's okay.

738
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
It's not a big deal for me.

739
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
I am going back.

740
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
I will go back.

741
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
What's going on?

742
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
It's not a big deal for me.

743
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
What's wrong with you?

744
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,520
I'm afraid it's not a big deal for me.

745
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
I just want to get married.

746
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
I'm going back.

747
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
I'm going back.

748
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
I'm going back.

749
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
I'm going back.

750
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
I'm going back.

751
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
Sit down.

752
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Dr. Jiu, you're back?

753
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Your relationship with Er is pretty good.

754
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Yes.

755
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
Xuanye's father is also a drug dealer.

756
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,520
He was the one who ordered him not to go to the underground city.

757
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,520
But he did it for saving you and his father's life.

758
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
He's very nice to me.

759
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Dad, did Uncle Li write you a letter?

760
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I...

761
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
He's got a divorce. Have you forgotten?

762
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
No. I haven't forgotten.

763
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,520
How could I forget?

764
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,520
You said it's because I was afraid of being rewarded by the demon.

765
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I had a marriage ceremony that I had to attend.

766
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Now my parents are safe.

767
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
I don't have to worry about the burden.

768
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
And my left eye.

769
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,520
As long as I'm willing to marry Uncle Li and Uncle Li, I can't do anything.

770
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,520
Banxia, you don't agree with this marriage.

771
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
It's not just because of this.

772
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Yes.

773
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,520
It's like what my parents thought.

774
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,520
It's like what my parents thought.

775
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
I'm sorry.
