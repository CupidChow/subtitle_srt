00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,920
I

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,860
think

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm going to make a

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,580
little bit of a

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,500
little bit of a

little bit of a

little bit of a

Sound

51
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,220
What are you afraid of?

52
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,520
Nothing. Put it on.

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Really? You're so mean.

54
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,120
Hey, Boss.

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,420
I think Gao Sheng's case is a bit mysterious.

56
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,920
Just because of what Chen Kui said, he ran so far.

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,620
What if he's calling him?

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,720
The key is that there's more than one person who saw Gao Sheng alive.

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,620
That shouldn't be the case.

60
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,720
Old Li, we have so many eyes on us.

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,920
We can't be replaced, right?

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Could it be a threat?

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,020
Don't talk nonsense.

64
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,120
What threat?

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,120
This Gao family is so powerful. Maybe they've bought into someone's relationship.

66
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,320
They even gave us a trick to exchange for food.

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,920
Boss, this has happened before.

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,420
But as long as we catch them, we'll know.

69
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,520
Let's eat first.

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,220
Okay. I'll go get some water.

71
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,820
Old Li.

72
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,420
Manager.

73
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,520
What is it, Tao?

74
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,220
Open it.

75
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,420
This is a gift for your son's full month.

76
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,420
Thank you, Tao.

77
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,820
You already went home and prepared your son's full month party.

78
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,620
I shouldn't have called you back.

79
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,020
But this is not an ordinary event.

80
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,220
I think there are spies in the government office.

81
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,820
And you're good at attacking and you're quick to get your feet on the ground.

82
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,020
If you don't come to help me, I'm afraid it won't be enough.

83
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,220
Tao, I know.

84
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,820
Actually, you just can't bear to leave me.

85
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,020
Keep it well.

86
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,220
This Nine-Legend Immortal is too alert.

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,020
We've been discovered by him from so far away.

88
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,620
At least we have clues now, don't we?

89
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Banxia, how are you so sure that this Nine-Legend Immortal is related to your father?

90
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,020
Do you even know where he is?

91
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,020
I'm not so sure either.

92
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,820
But this is the only clue.

93
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,420
Every demon has its own special ability.

94
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,220
Like Chi Wangchuan, he can travel freely in the Mirror World.

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,420
That demon is called Nine Lives. It should have nine lives.

96
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,620
Plus, it can change its way of thinking.

97
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,620
So it's used to gain power.

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,620
But... but...

99
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,820
One life only sells 200 taels of silver. That's too much.

100
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,020
Besides, what does this demon want money for?

101
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,620
Shiyi!

102
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,620
I found a box in my yard.

103
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
I found a box.

104
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,420
This... isn't this my wallet?

105
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,420
This is the money I hid in the private room in the cat room.

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,020
Why did this cat demon send the money back?

107
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Is it to ask for mercy?

108
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,020
This is my father's wallet.

109
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,420
This is my father's wallet.

110
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,420
That means my father really asked the cat demon for mercy?

111
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,220
This is a card.

112
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,420
The reunion inn?

113
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
I really didn't know.

114
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,220
He suddenly came to me and said that he caused trouble in the factory.

115
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,620
I thought he was just gambling and losing money.

116
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,220
Who would have thought that it would be such a huge trouble?

117
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,020
I really was wronged.

118
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Enough. You've said it many times. Can you be quiet?

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,220
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,620
Where is he?

122
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm sorry. I didn't lie.

123
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Be quiet!

124
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,820
I really didn't know.

125
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,420
When he came, I sent him some food and drinks.

126
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,020
After that, I didn't come.

127
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,820
I didn't dare to lie.

128
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,020
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,020
I really didn't know where he went.

130
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,420
How could I lie to you?

131
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,620
How could I lie to you?

132
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,020
Tao, what should we do?

133
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Leave Li Bu Ge behind.

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,020
Take him out to look for him.

135
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,620
Yes!

136
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,820
Miss, there are your clothes inside.

137
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,420
There's also water and food. I also put some food in. It should be enough for you.

138
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,020
I know. Don't send me anymore. Go back.

139
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,420
Miss, you must come back safely.

140
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,420
Don't worry.

141
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,220
Ting Zhou, if you encounter anything that can't be solved here,

142
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,420
you can go look for Wen Jian.

143
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,220
Dr. Qiu, you must take good care of my Miss.

144
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,020
She's timid and weak.

145
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,820
If you encounter a monster, you must take good care of her.

146
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Don't worry.

147
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
Go back.

148
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,820
Miss, you must come back soon. Go back.

149
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,620
The traces of the first half

150
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm sighing for the rest of my life

151
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,620
The night is dark and the wind is blowing away the distant stars

152
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,220
You are like a star in the night sky

153
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,820
I am one step away

154
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,220
One move, one breath, and I am lost

155
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,620
Wen Xia, look. Is it pretty?

156
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,020
Mother, you have one too.

157
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,420
This is so pretty.

158
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,620
Look. What is this?

159
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,220
I love eating.

160
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,420
I'll give you some.

161
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,820
I love eating.

162
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,220
You have one too.

163
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,020
Once I fall asleep, I have a life to live

164
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,620
Officer, when can I go home?

165
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,820
Stop talking nonsense.

166
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,620
I'll let you go when I find Gao Shan.

167
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,020
What's that smell? Did you smell it?

168
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,620
I smell something rotten.

169
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,420
It's the smell of the body rotting.

170
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,620
Take a closer look over there.

171
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,420
I'll look over here.

172
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
Yan Li, over here.

173
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,220
Gao Shan.

174
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,620
Come here.

175
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,820
Get down.

176
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Xuan Ye, thank you for coming with me.

177
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,620
I promised you

178
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,420
and that cat demon came to me to send money.

179
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,020
I'll take money and help people get rid of the disaster.

180
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,020
I'll go and see what medicine is in this jar.

181
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,220
Why would the cat demon come to you?

182
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Could it be that he has someone he can't fight in the Tuenyuan Inn

183
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,420
and wants to help you?

184
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,020
I don't think this cat demon is a bad person.

185
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,420
He's doing evil things for the sake of his life.

186
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,620
He's just a little cat.

187
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,020
He might not even know who he's helping.

188
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,820
Think about it. He can't keep his human form like Chi Wang Chuan.

189
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,820
He's just a little demon.

190
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,020
A little cat, right?

191
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,220
Any demon is older than you.

192
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,820
When he decides you're going to live or die,

193
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,420
you can think about whether you should call him a little cat.

194
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,020
If you don't want to eat, do you want to eat some pastries?

195
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,820
Where are the pastries?

196
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
I didn't steal them.

197
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,620
I didn't say you stole them.

198
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,420
You have a mouthful of them.

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,620
Xuan Ye, save me.

200
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,420
Spit it out.

201
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Give it back to me.

202
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,220
It's good that Gao Sheng has a relative

203
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
who can help him clean up the grave.

204
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,620
Otherwise, he would have been in a lot of trouble.

205
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,420
We couldn't find any news about him.

206
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,220
Most importantly, we had to bring him back to Guangping.

207
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,820
That's right. Didn't his relative say that

208
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,620
there are always cat demons nearby.

209
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,020
Every year, someone dies because of a cat demon attack.

210
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,220
I think this guy is really unlucky.

211
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,820
He dodged the knife that cut his head

212
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,020
but he was able to get a bunch of cat demons.

213
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,420
I think it's better to cut him.

214
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,020
It's even worse that he got his eyeballs cut off.

215
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,220
Right?

216
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,020
A cat demon eats eyes.

217
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,020
Does it have to cut its hair?

218
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,420
I'm afraid this isn't that simple.

219
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,620
Boss, it's getting late.

220
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,020
Why don't we find a place to rest first?

221
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,420
Okay.

222
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,220
Tao, there's a fire in front.

223
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,820
Let's go.

224
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
The wind is coming, the rain is coming.

225
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,020
The fat monk is carrying a drum.

226
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,220
Where to hide it? In the temple.

227
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,420
Let's hide a little boy.

228
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Boys, hide quickly.

229
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,220
The wind and rain are coming. There's nowhere to run.

230
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,820
Let's go.

231
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,220
It's cold outside. You don't mind sleeping here for a night, right?

232
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,220
I don't mind.

233
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Shen Ye,

234
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,020
why don't you draw a mark on my hand again?

235
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
Last time, when we were in the world of the mirror,

236
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
I broke the mirror and used it.

237
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,820
Okay.

238
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,620
Okay.

239
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,020
Why is it so refreshing this time?

240
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,220
The place we are going to this time is very dangerous.

241
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,820
You have a mark on your hand, I can be at ease too.

242
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,420
Hurry and sleep.

243
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,820
You're not sleeping?

244
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Sleeping.

245
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,480
The

246
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,020
This looks really like it.

247
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,620
Wait.

248
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,220
What's wrong?

249
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,420
We seem to have lost our way.

250
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
Is that so?

251
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,020
We might have gotten lost in the forest.

252
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,020
If we can't find the right way, we will keep on wandering here.

253
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,620
It's really like it. It seems like we've been here before.

254
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,820
What should we do then?

255
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,020
Take a quick look.

256
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,020
All these of them arebuchet irgendwie.

257
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,320
It's like a pair of Project participate in an하겠습니다.

258
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,060
Come on

259
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Let's go.

260
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
Shen Ye, who are they?

261
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Human body.

262
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
They were making noise last night.

263
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
They are cute.

264
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
What's wrong with your eyes?

265
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Didn't you notice?

266
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
I can only see my waist with my left eye.

267
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Really?

268
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Didn't you notice anything strange?

269
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
I can't see it.

270
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
You are right.

271
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
My father is a doctor.

272
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
He is a doctor.

273
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
He is a doctor.

274
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
I can't see it.

275
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
You are right.

276
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
My father found many doctors.

277
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
They didn't notice anything strange.

278
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
They only said I had a disease.

279
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Do you remember I told you that

280
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
a young man saved me?

281
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,420
I remember.

282
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
In order to save me,

283
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
he was injured.

284
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
A drop of blood fell into my left eye.

285
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
A drop of blood?

286
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
Since then,

287
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
I can see my waist.

288
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
I see.

289
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
What about you?

290
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Did you tell me anything

291
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
about your childhood?

292
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
I don't have any secrets.

293
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
I have told you

294
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
my biggest secret.

295
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
You can tell me your childhood story.

296
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
I don't remember anything about my childhood.

297
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
You don't remember?

298
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
When I was twelve,

299
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
I had a high fever.

300
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
I don't remember anything about my childhood.

301
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Follow me.

302
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Is there anyone?

303
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Yes.

304
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Do you live here?

305
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Yes.

306
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
The inn is being repaired.

308
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
We can't help you.

309
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Please excuse us.

310
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
You are the manager of this inn, right?

311
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Yes.

312
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,420
We lost our way in the forest.

313
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
It's getting late.

314
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
There are many places to go.

315
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
I hope the manager can help us.

316
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Just give us a room.

317
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
We can just give you a room.

318
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
The inn is being repaired.

319
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
The inn can't be helped.

320
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Please leave.

321
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Keep going west.

322
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
Then you can go down the mountain.

323
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Dad.

324
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
It's getting dark.

325
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Where can we go now?

326
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,420
But the inn is being repaired.

327
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
We can't help you.

328
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
The inn is being repaired.

329
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
We can't help you.

330
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
Besides,

331
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
you told me that

332
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,420
it's fate that we meet.

333
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
We can help you as much as we can.

334
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I was sick a while ago.

336
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
So...

337
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
It's our fault.

339
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
Sister.

340
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
You are so beautiful.

341
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Take the guests with you.

342
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
Please follow me.

343
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
Please.

344
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,420
There are 22 apartments in our inn.

345
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
This is the second apartment.

346
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,420
They are named after the gods.

347
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:13,420
You live in the inn.

348
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,420
There are so many chicken feet here.

349
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm so unlucky.

350
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm so unlucky.

351
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm so unlucky.

352
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
I'm so unlucky.

353
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm so unlucky.

354
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
I'm so unlucky.

355
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Let's go.

356
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,420
My inn is beautiful, right?

357
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,420
People who came here said that they didn't want to leave.

358
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,420
They thought that this place is the best place to live.

359
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
This is a good inn.

360
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
You have a good taste.

361
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,420
No wonder you can marry such a beautiful woman.

362
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
It's right in front of us.

363
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Let's go.

364
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,420
There are two rooms in the inn.

365
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,420
You and your wife can live in the room inside.

366
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,420
This guest will live in this room.

367
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Please.

368
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,420
This is the upper room of our inn.

369
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,420
The view outside the window is very good.

370
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,420
There are some loquat trees in the backyard.

371
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
It's the season to eat loquat now.

372
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,420
If you like it, I can pick some up tomorrow.

373
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
You don't have to be so troublesome.

374
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
You're welcome.

375
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
There is no one in the inn.

376
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
I'm bored.

377
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
You come from afar.

378
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,420
You don't have to live here for a day.

379
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
It's close to the small town.

380
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,420
When I have nothing to do, I like to enjoy the view.

381
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
I'm leaving now.

382
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
If you need anything, I can help you.

383
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Thank you.

384
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
Do you smell anything?

385
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
It's incense.

386
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,420
You're still preparing the meal.

387
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
Why do you burn so much incense?

388
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
I forgot to tell you.

389
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Our carriage is still at the gate of the mountain.

390
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
Remember to take care of us.

391
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
I'll be back.

392
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
I'll be back.

393
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
I'll be back.

394
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
Okay.

395
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,420
Sir, is the room good?

396
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Not bad.

397
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
It's just not bad.

398
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
The price is not high.

399
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
Where do you have radishes?

400
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
I'm a little hungry.

401
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Radishes?

402
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,420
No.

403
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,420
But there are snacks in the small town.

404
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Do you want to make soup?

405
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Make soup?

406
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Make soup is the specialty of our inn.

407
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,420
The spring water is from the river that flows down the mountain.

408
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,420
It's heated by the earth and swum through the wheat.

409
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Many guests come here for a reason.

410
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,420
It's a usual thing.

411
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,420
We have to wait a long time for the pool to come out.

412
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
I'll go too.

413
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Okay.

414
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
I'll go prepare now.

415
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Clean it up.

416
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I'll get some fruits and tea later.

417
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
The guests will be here soon.

418
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
Yes.

419
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
Miss.

420
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Dad.

421
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Why did you let them stay?

422
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,420
We open the inn for guests.

423
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
But they are different.

424
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
They are not the same.

425
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Are you doing this for the guests?

426
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
But they are different.

427
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
I think something is wrong.

428
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
What's wrong?

429
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
I didn't see it.

430
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,420
I don't know either.

431
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Anyway, it looks wrong.

432
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Dad, we open the inn for business.

433
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
You dare not enter the city.

434
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,420
You've been hiding in the old forest.

435
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
What else are you afraid of?

436
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm afraid that I've been rude again.

437
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,420
I'll go to welcome the guests.

438
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,420
If you are okay, you can rest early.

439
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
It's no use if you destroy it.

440
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,420
All the candles in this place have incense.

441
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Don't you have that non-perfume?

442
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
Does it work on incense?

443
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
It's okay to use less.

444
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,420
But it's useless for non-perfume like them.

445
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
There is something wrong with this inn.

446
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I don't know why the cat is inviting us.

447
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
I'll know when I find it.

448
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,420
Banxia.

449
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,420
I live next door to Chi Xue.

450
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Call me if you need anything.

451
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
She just misunderstood our relationship.

452
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
You don't have to explain.

453
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
This inn is unusual.

454
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
We'll investigate it.

455
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,420
Okay.

456
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
Who is it?

457
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
It's me.

458
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
I'm here to guide you.

459
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Come in.

460
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,420
You two, the soup is ready.

461
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,420
You can go.

462
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
What soup?

463
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,420
It's good for your body.

464
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
We don't need it.

465
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Why?

466
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,420
Your assistant said we need soup.

467
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,420
I've prepared it.

468
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
We are too tired to rest.

469
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,420
You are too tired to go to the soup.

470
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,420
I'll try it.

471
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,420
I won't let you go.

472
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
Let's go.

473
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Lead the way.

474
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Okay.

475
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,420
I saw something running.

476
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
It's a cat.

477
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Is there a cat?

478
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
It was afraid of cats.

479
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Do you have cats in the inn?

480
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,420
There are many squirrels in the mountain.

481
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,420
The inn is being repaired recently.

482
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,420
There are no guests.

483
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
No one is raising cats.

484
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Maybe it was wrong.

485
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
This way, please.

486
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
This way, please.

487
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
The male is here.

488
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
The female is here.

489
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
This way, please.

490
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Come with me.

491
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
This way, please.

492
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,420
Your skin is white and tender.

493
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
I envy you.

494
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,420
What's on your forehead?

495
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,420
What's that?

496
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
It's beautiful.

497
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
It's beautiful.

498
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
It's not proper.

499
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Wu Niang, it's too noisy.

500
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
It's annoying.

501
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Let's go out.

502
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Yes.

503
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,420
We haven't seen the world in the mountain.

504
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,420
I don't know how the women outside dress.

505
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Did they disturb you?

506
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
It's okay.

507
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,420
You are so beautiful.

508
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
The flower shop is beautiful.

509
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
The people are beautiful.

510
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,420
You are beautiful too.

511
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
Am I beautiful?

512
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,420
I thought I was beautiful before.

513
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,420
But now I think you are more beautiful.

514
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,420
Let's go to make soup.

515
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Okay.

516
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
I'm so tired.

517
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,420
Xingyi, do you want to play?

518
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,420
You can play. I have something to do.

519
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
I'm going to play.

520
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,420
I'm going to play.

521
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
Let's go.

522
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Let's go.

523
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
You're so beautiful.

524
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,420
I'm so happy.

525
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,420
I'm so happy.

526
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,420
I'm so happy.

527
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
I'm so happy.

528
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
I'm so happy.

529
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
I'm so happy.

530
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,420
There are so many guests, I can't even see them.

531
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,420
Sorry, sorry.

532
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Are you okay?

533
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,420
I'm fine, I didn't see the road.

534
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Did you hurt your eyes?

535
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,920
No, no.

536
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,020
Then why are you all covered?

537
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm just a little dizzy.

538
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,820
I'll be fine after a short break.

539
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,020
You don't have to take it to heart.

540
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,020
Sister, is the water temperature still right?

541
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,520
This soup spring is a specialty of our store.

542
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,820
It can nourish the skin and relax the sleep.

543
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,520
Yes, Madam, it's very comfortable.

544
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Yes, yes, yes, Madam.

545
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Do you want to go and do something else first?

546
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Sister, don't you need us to serve you?

547
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,520
No need, I can do it alone.

548
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,120
Okay, we're not far away.

549
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,520
If you need, just call me.

550
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,320
You're not from the Wu Youjing. Where did you come from?

551
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,720
I don't know, I was abducted.

552
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,120
I just escaped and fell here.

553
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,920
Don't be afraid.

554
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,120
Are you hungry? I'll give you some peaches.

555
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,320
My name is Banxia. My father's name is Duan Ying Heng.

556
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,820
My mother's name is Tao Ru Yu.

557
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,620
Can you send me to find them?

558
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,620
Okay.

559
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,820
Oh no, they found us. Let's go!

560
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,420
What's your name?

561
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,620
Where are we going? What is this place?

562
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,820
Let's leave first.

563
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,220
Hurry and go! Don't bother with me!

564
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,020
What's your name?

565
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,820
My name is Man Ying! Hurry and go!

566
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,420
Night of the Mountain, Man Ying.

567
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,020
I'm really that bad?

568
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Hey! Hey!

569
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,420
Hey!

570
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,220
Hey!

571
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,220
Hey!

572
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,420
Sir.

573
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,020
This is a pet room.

574
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,220
They put stuff in here that's messy.

575
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,820
No one lives in it.

576
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Sir, you must be lost.

577
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,820
Oh no!

578
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,820
Dad!

579
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
It's okay, it's okay.

580
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,820
Still need to drank a little more

581
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,800
to work out

582
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,180
I will drink for you

583
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,160
Then you can go you can go

584
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,120
Oops

585
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,940
My colleague's photo

586
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
I have to wait for you

587
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,080
I need to come now

588
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,980
Well I like to take a look

589
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,960
I really like

590
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,520
Please wing

591
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,660
Let me help you

592
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,980
Birley

593
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,940
Emy

594
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,080
Take me to her

595
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,620
She is still smelly

596
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,700
you can ask

597
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,860
Which search background

598
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,040
I don't want to think about it

599
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,560
You –

600
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,360
She is hiding

601
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,960
pipeline

602
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,660
On More –

603
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,660
I saw Mao Yao.

604
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
Where?

605
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
In the yard.

606
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,660
But the shopkeeper suddenly appeared. I was lost.

607
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Come in.

608
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Sister, are you feeling better?

609
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,660
I made a bowl of iced tea for you.

610
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:44,660
It's all my fault. If only I could stay by your side forever.

611
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,660
I'll do it. I don't need to trouble you.

612
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
I can help.

613
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,660
It's late. We should rest.

614
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Sister, don't you really need me to take care of you?

615
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,660
You don't have to worry so much. I'll just sleep for a while.

616
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,660
Fine.

617
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,660
You're my wife. You should take care of me.

618
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Sister, I'm leaving.

619
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
I'll go.

620
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,660
Don't you think everyone here is over the top?

621
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,660
What happened to you?

622
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,660
I saw something strange in the pool.

623
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,660
Isn't this just a piece of broken wood? What's so interesting about it?

624
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,660
It's good everywhere. It's just a little cold at night.

625
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,660
How many months has it been? And there's no blood.

626
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,660
I should warm it up in the nest.

627
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,660
My sister is sleeping well?

628
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,660
And Ahjumma went home to rest.

629
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,660
They said she needed some pulse to help herself in her razziness.

630
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,660
She even took a nap from the hot lake.

631
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Upon her Warsan, a bee-来了舞队

632
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,200
The

633
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,440
Water

634
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,520
Who?

635
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,780
It's me

636
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,700
Why are you here?

637
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,660
It's cold at night

638
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,820
You just came back with your clothes wet

639
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold

640
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,460
So I made you a bowl of ginger tea

641
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,780
Thank you

642
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,660
I'm sorry

643
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
It's cold outside, go in

644
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Don't you come in and take a walk?

645
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,660
No need, go to bed early

646
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
Who? Come out

647
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Young Master, Madam

648
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,420
It's so late, what's the matter?

649
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,740
It's windy at night in the mountains

650
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,740
Madam has a cold today

651
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,740
The shopkeeper asked me to ask

652
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,740
if you need more charcoal

653
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
No need

654
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,620
Then Young Master and Madam, go to bed early

655
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
I'll go first

656
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
Shen Ye, don't you think he...

657
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
Madam, let's go inside

658
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
The shopkeeper asked me to go to bed early

659
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Madam, let's go inside

660
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,420
How is it?

661
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
It's gone

662
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
Did it leave?

663
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Not necessarily

664
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
This young master is really strange

665
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,420
He came here at midnight and didn't even take the charcoal

666
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Where is the charcoal?

667
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,420
The charcoal may be just an excuse

668
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,420
He's acting like a ghost

669
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,420
If I hadn't found it

670
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,420
he wouldn't have appeared

671
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,420
This inn is really strange

672
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Here, drink this first

673
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
I don't like the smell of ginger

674
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Then you like the smell of medicine?

675
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Oh, right

676
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,420
I heard you talking outside

677
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,420
What were you talking about?

678
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,420
The way you taught me

679
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Are you scared?

680
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
I'm not scared

681
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:28,220
Didn't you say that after you read the oral

682
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,420
I'll go back after I fall asleep

683
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,420
Then would it be too much trouble for you?

684
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
No trouble

685
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
We just moved in

686
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,420
The inn's foundation is not clear at all

687
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,420
Plus, the cat demon is out of the way

688
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
It's really dangerous

689
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
You live here alone

690
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,420
Without the company of the table

691
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
It's inevitable to be nervous

692
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
I'm not scared

693
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,420
I'm not scared

694
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,420
I'm not scared

695
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,420
I'm not scared

696
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,420
I'm not scared

697
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,420
I'm not scared

698
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,420
I'm not scared

699
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I'm not scared

700
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420
I'm not scared

701
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
I'm not scared

702
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
I'm not scared

703
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,420
I'm not scared

704
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
I'm not scared

705
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,420
I'm not scared

706
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,420
I'm not scared

707
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,420
I'm not scared

708
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,420
I'm not scared

709
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,420
I'm not scared

710
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
I'm not scared

711
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,420
I'm not scared

712
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,420
I'm not scared

713
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
I'm not scared

714
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,420
I'm not scared

715
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,420
I'm not scared

716
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,420
I'm not scared

717
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,420
I'm not scared

718
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I'm not scared

719
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,420
I'm not scared

720
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,420
I'm not scared

721
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,420
If you have no regrets

722
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,420
How can you leave the star to illuminate the world

723
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,420
The body is still in the stars

724
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,420
The light of the light is still in the stars

725
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,420
In the break of dawn

726
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,420
If you have no regrets

727
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,420
How many mountains and seas can only be forgotten

728
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,420
I have no regrets

729
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,420
I will meet you in the eternal world

730
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,420
I have no regrets

731
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,420
I have no regrets

732
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
I have no regrets

733
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,420
I have no regrets

734
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
I have no regrets

735
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
I have no regrets

736
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,420
I have no regrets

737
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,420
I have no regrets

738
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,420
I have no regrets

739
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,420
I have no regrets

740
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,420
I have no regrets

741
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,420
I have no regrets

742
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,420
I have no regrets

743
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,420
I have no regrets

744
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,420
I have no regrets

745
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,420
In the break of dawn

746
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,420
If you have no regrets

747
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,420
How many mountains and seas can only be forgotten

748
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,420
I have no regrets

749
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:39,420
I will meet you in the eternal world

750
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,420
I will meet you in the eternal world

751
00:46:52,420 --> 00:47:03,420
I will meet you in the eternal world
