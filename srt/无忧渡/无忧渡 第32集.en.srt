3
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,030
Are you blaming your father?

4
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,560
Xuanye,

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,560
things were not

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,789
as you imagine.

7
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,590
Your father had been

8
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,050
protecting you all along.

9
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,509
Twelve years ago,

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,530
I encountered an accident in the Underground City.

11
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,060
Your father came to find me,

12
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,030
but coincidentally met you.

13
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,190
Wake up!

14
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,680
My father was a demon hunter.

15
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,960
Why couldn't he recognize

16
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,930
I am a demon?

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,030
Because

18
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,360
you have extraordinary talent

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,030
and your demonic power is strong.

20
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,470
Without special methods, no one could see through you.

21
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,140
So your father

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,610
didn't suspect you.

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,590
Moreover, at that time,

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,400
you were severely injured internally

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,430
and had forgotten your own identity.

26
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,280
So your father

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,300
took you in and raised you.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,079
And that

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,220
lasted for four years.

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,630
And Xuanye,

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,630
your talent is extremely strong.

32
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,230
You're more suited

33
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,700
to practise magical tricks than your elder brother.

34
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,120
Your father was initially very happy,

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,020
thinking he had found

36
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,800
a genius who could inherit

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,960
his skills.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Hence,

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,760
he taught you all of his magical tricks.

40
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,770
But unexpectedly, four years later,

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,310
when you went demon hunting with him for the first time,

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,840
he discovered the truth.

43
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,260
Son,

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
demon hunting...

45
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,980
After discovering you are a demon,

46
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,680
your father initially struggled

47
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,590
and suffered.

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,890
But in the end, he still loved you too much.

49
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,410
He couldn't let you go.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,680
So,

51
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,019
he created the Peerless Bracelet,

52
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,329
hoping to use it to seal

53
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,290
your demon form.

54
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,120
But in the end, man's plans are no match for heaven's will.

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,830
Xuanye,

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
your father had already

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,780
tried his best to protect you.

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,070
No one is perfect.

59
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,670
Don't blame him.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,770
Xuanye,

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,080
I don't know

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,730
what's best

63
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,990
for you.

64
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,870
I'm afraid I've made a mistake.

65
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,290
You're still seriously injured right now.

66
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,630
There's no use in overthinking.

67
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,430
Plus, there are officials

68
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,920
still trying to catch you out there.

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,480
Stay here

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
and recover peacefully.

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,150
You've suffered severe internal injuries.

72
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,280
Those demon hunters

73
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,360
were too brutal.

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,760
This is

75
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,220
Yuyuan Soup.

76
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,000
It helps to regulate your inner energy

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,730
and clear your mind and spirit.

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,920
I've noticed that after your transformation,

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,070
you've been restless

80
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,560
and having trouble to control yourself.

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,600
This medicine might help to

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,700
alleviate it a bit.

83
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,510
Before you're completely stable,

84
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,510
you must remember

85
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,860
to take it daily.

86
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,070
Alright.

87
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,700
Oh, Uncle,

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,710
why can't I

89
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,330
control my beast form?

90
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,200
I don't know either.

91
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,630
It may be because you were

92
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,600
confined by the Peerless Bracelet for years.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,190
Once you transformed into a demon,

94
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,320
you couldn't adapt.

95
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,800
Xuanye,

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,040
I have a question for you.

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,950
Now that you know

98
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,080
your true identity,

99
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,330
what are your plans

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
for the future?

101
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,880
I don't know either.

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,380
I thought about leaving for good before,

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,340
so I don't burden her anymore.

104
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,610
"Don't burden her"?

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,790
You say that so easily.

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,640
But have you considered

107
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,070
that the person left behind

108
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,130
might not be happy,

109
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
and might not be able to

110
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,020
start a new life as you wish?

111
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,720
So,

112
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,860
I'm asking you seriously,

113
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,750
in the future,

114
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,290
do you want to be a human

115
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,830
or a demon?

116
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,650
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,330
You were waiting for us?

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,650
To be precise,

119
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,440
I was waiting for Miss Duan.

120
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,120
How is Xuanye now?

121
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,190
My master has been taking care of him.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,270
Let me ask you seriously,

123
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,450
in the future, do you want to be human

124
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,070
or a demon?

125
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,470
Jiu,

126
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,380
someone is here to see you.

127
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,630
Xuanye.

128
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,840
Are you alright?

129
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,210
I'm fine.

130
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,270
You're lying. How could you be fine?

131
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,120
Are you hurt anywhere?

132
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,150
I'm okay.

133
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,380
Why are you here?

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,900
Did they give you any trouble?

135
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,350
No.

136
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,430
it was Miss Sima and Chief Constable Chu

137
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,070
who rescued me from jail.

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Thank you all.

139
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,840
Xuanye,

140
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,290
you don't need to be so formal.

141
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,420
We know

142
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,580
your nature is kind.

143
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,740
There are bad people,

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,660
and there are good demons too.

145
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,200
Xuanye,

146
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,750
we've brought Chi Xue to you.

147
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,000
Will Xuanye obey?

148
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,990
Let's see how it goes.

149
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,550
If he doesn't behave,

150
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,880
there are ways to deal with disobedience.

151
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,130
Any news about

152
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,200
the panther demon?

153
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,870
Yes,

154
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,150
but he's very alert,

155
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,910
and his powers are formidable.

156
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,900
I...

157
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,760
I'm not confident I can capture him alive.

158
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,770
Forget it.

159
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
None of that matters now.

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,650
Now that we have Xuanye,

161
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
that panther demon

162
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,390
isn't important anymore.

163
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,440
Capture him if you can;

164
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,720
if not, just kill him.

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,840
Yes.

166
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,910
We can't let him ruin

167
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,770
our grand plan.

168
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,580
Have some tea.

169
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,550
Master,

170
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,790
there's something I don't quite understand.

171
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,790
Didn't you say...

172
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,290
Didn't you say

173
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,440
the Realm Gate that opens

174
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,720
once every twelve years

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,550
is the only passage

176
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,270
between the human and demon worlds?

177
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,120
Then how did

178
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,680
that panther demon get out?

179
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,570
This is how.

180
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,750
The Mystic Panther clan

181
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,150
has guarded the Realm Gates for generations.

182
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,800
I suppose

183
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,400
they have some special means

184
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,510
that allow them to move freely

185
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,840
between the two worlds.

186
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,200
However, such means

187
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,860
must have great limitations.

188
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,750
Otherwise, they would have come out long ago,

189
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,390
and not only one of them.

190
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,710
Is he Xuanye's family then?

191
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
At least they're from the same clan.

192
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,870
Master,

193
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,430
we can't delay treating your sickness any longer.

194
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,640
It's alright.

195
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,640
I have my own plans.

196
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,610
[Sky Cavern]

197
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,250
I'm the one who harmed him.

198
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,870
Xuanye.

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,940
Chi Xue grew up

200
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,510
in the Ganshan Clinic.

201
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,760
My father took good care of him.

202
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,110
But after I took over,

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,910
he never had a good day.

204
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,760
For the first two years after my parents passed away,

205
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,640
I hated demons

206
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,560
and wasn't very nice to him either.

207
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,990
Although later,

208
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,810
I gradually came to understand,

209
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,960
I still had nothing good

210
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,840
to offer him.

211
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,990
Chi Xue had the heart of a child.

212
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,930
He was playful

213
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,240
and loved to eat.

214
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,470
His martial arts skills were mediocre,

215
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,120
and he was very lazy.

216
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,210
I couldn't stand his laziness,

217
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,830
so I was very strict with him.

218
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,270
Life at the Ganshan Clinic was poor.

219
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Little attention

220
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,630
was paid to fancy food and clothing.

221
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,340
That's how

222
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,270
he foolishly followed me

223
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,850
year after year.

224
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,000
When my mother was still alive,

225
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,900
during spring and autumn festivals,

226
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,670
she would always make him new clothes.

227
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
But with me...

228
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,910
I hadn't bought him

229
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,440
new clothes for a long time.

230
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
You know what?

231
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,280
On the day of our engagement ceremony,

232
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,280
I saw that his pants were all torn.

233
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,620
I thought about buying him a new pair.

234
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,530
But I never expected...

235
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,030
Xuanye.

236
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,000
Anyway,

237
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,910
I've let him down.

238
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,540
Don't be too sad.

239
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,230
This isn't your fault.

240
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,500
It was those two demon hunters

241
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,540
who killed him.

242
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,000
Chi Xue was also trying to protect you.

243
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,710
I think,

244
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,820
if it were you,

245
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,260
you would also risk your life

246
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,920
to protect him, wouldn't you?

247
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,610
By the way, Banxia,

248
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,190
when did you

249
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
find out I was a demon?

250
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,120
When I first saw

251
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,560
your wound,

252
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,440
I had some suspicions.

253
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,450
But it was at the Underground City

254
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,650
where I confirmed it.

255
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,780
That early?

256
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,320
Xuanye,

257
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,340
♫Just sobered up after a dream, sighing for my life♫

258
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,030
I know it

259
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,960
was my fault,

260
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,840
I didn't explain it clearly to you.

261
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,230
♫In this desolate mortal world♫

262

♫The other side sees fantasies fading into obscurity♫

264

♫Is it a blessing or a calamity?♫

266
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,200
I was afraid you couldn't accept it.

267
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I was afraid you'd say

268
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
that we, human and demon, walk different paths.

269
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,270

Don't talk about yourself like that.

299

Whether one is a demon or human,

300
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,960
does it matter that much?

301
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,550
Chi Xue is also a demon;

302
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,550
don't you treat him like family too?

303
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,110
And there's Chilian,

304
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,720
isn't he a hundred,

305

You are who you are.

307
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,270
You punish evil, promote good, and are always willing to help others.

308
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,140
You protect me,

309

protect those around you,

Remember this.

312

As a human,

313
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,550
you're Xuanye.

314
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,680
As a demon, you're still Xuanye.

315

You're the one I wholeheartedly love

348
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,780
♫If all must fade away and be forgotten♫

349
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,520
♫I'd keep it all to myself♫

350
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,180
♫If we luck out♫

351
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:50,340
♫Let's reunite once again beyond the time♫

352
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,010
[Wugeng Inn]

353
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,910
You haven't told me

354
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,960
the reason why you don't stay at the Sky Cavern.

355
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,820
I don't like it.

356
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
You don't like it?

357
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,480
Why?

358
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,320
That uncle of Xuanye's

359
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,930
makes me feel uncomfortable.

360
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,410
Uncomfortable?

361
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,790
Do you know why my official position

362
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,830
rose so quickly?

363
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,440
Your father is the current Grand Secretary.

364
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,900
Your mother is the Empress Dowager's niece.

365
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
Not just that.

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,550
Your brother is the Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince.

367
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,790
You want to fight, don't you?

368
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,390
Of course.

369
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,640
This is inseparable from the Commissioner's

370
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
own efforts.

371
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,200
After all, not everyone

372
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,730
has such a good background.

373
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,270
Let go.

374
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,600
Alright.

375
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,960
Go on.

376
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,590
I trust my intuition very much,

377
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,760
and it's very accurate.

378
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
Whether a person is good or evil,

379
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,480
with one look,

380
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,880
I can tell it about right.

381
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,470
You, Commissioner,

382
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,490
are really impressive.

383
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Believe it or not.

384
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,680
Come.

385
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,440
Have some while it's hot.

386
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,540
I'm not hungry.

387
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,790
You should eat something even if you're not hungry.

388
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,270
Hasn't it been two days

389
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,930
since you've eaten anything?

390
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,330
You're not a demon.

391
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,100
How can you go without eating?

392
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,720
Can demons go without food?

393
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,770
I don't know.

394
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,950
I only know that

395
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,010
I have rich experience in catching demons,

396
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,410
but only a few days of experience being one.

397
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,250
Let me figure it out first.

398
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,550
Once I've figured it out,

399
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,550
I'll let you know.

400
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,940
You should also get a bowl and chopsticks and eat up.

401
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm not eating.

402
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,980
You go ahead and eat.

403
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,300
Just take a bite.

404
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,130
I can't finish it all by myself.

405
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,920
By the way, Banxia,

406
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,680
you were shot by an arrow earlier.

407
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,880
How does it feel now?

408
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,380
Miss Sima has already

409
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,350
bandaged it for me.

410
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,150
It's fine now.

411
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,110
You lost so much blood.

412
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,710
Is just bandaging it enough?

413
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
That can't be enough.

414
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,470
Give me your arm.

415
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,330
Let me check it.

416
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,690
I told you

417
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,750
it's fine now.

418
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,750
Does it hurt?

419
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,750
It hurts.

420
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,140
It hurts a lot.

421
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
It's really painful.

422
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,940
I'm just kidding.

423
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,200
It stopped hurting a long time ago.

424
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,600
You were so badly injured.

425
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
How could it not hurt?

426
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,740
The situation was so urgent at that time.

427
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,870
You were taken away.

428
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,930
How would I have time to think whether it hurts or not?

429
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,370
You're still so silly,

430
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,200
just like when you were little.

431
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,340
How do you know?

432
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,050
Do you remember now?

433
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,030
I just vaguely

434
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,290
remember some things,

435
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,850
but it's not complete.

436
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,830
Banxia,

437
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,540
can you tell me

438
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
how you

439
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,220
entered the Carefree Land back then?

440
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,440
Haven't I told you before?

441
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,120
When I was little, I was taken away by a child trafficker.

442
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,110
Then they took me to

443
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,510
a dark and unknown place.

444
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,440
It must have been the Underground City.

445
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,000
Then I ran away.

446
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
I ran and ran,

447
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
and somehow

448
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,400
I ended up in what you call

449
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,810
the Carefree Land.

450
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,310
That's where I met you.

451
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,880
So from where

452
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,760
did you enter the Carefree Land?

453
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,890
I can't remember that clearly.

454
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,270
All I know is

455
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,350
after we fell off the cliff together,

456
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,620
I woke up and I was already at home.

457
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,640
My father found me.

458
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,120
What about you?

459
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,210
When I woke up,

460
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I was already at the Ganshan Clinic.

461
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,060
My father was in the

462
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,350
dark river of the Underground City

463
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,280
when he found me.

464
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,130
I'm guessing

465
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,030
after we fell into

466
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,070
the Carefree Land,

467
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,200
we followed the dark river

468
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,130
to arrive at the Underground City.

469
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,400
I was severely injured at that time

470
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,550
and couldn't remember many things.

471
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,980
After that,

472
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,420
my parents adopted me.

473
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,590
Here.

474
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,580
Take a look.

475
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,810
You must be hungry.

476
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,270
Come on, eat quickly.

477
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,090
Go ahead and eat.

478
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,880
Try the chicken leg,

479
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,440
it's very fragrant.

480
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,030
Four years later,

481
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,200
my father discovered I was a demon.

482
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,640
Unable to bring himself to kill me,

483
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
he used the Peerless Bracelet

484
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,680
to seal my demon form.

485
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,350
Moreover,

486
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,400
he never allowed me

487
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,730
to learn demon hunting techniques again.

488
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,510
I see.

489
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,770
That means when we entered the painting,

490
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,750
the Peerless Bracelet became tangible,

491
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,210
which is why it shattered.

492
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,590
Your father must've prevented you from

493
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,440
coming to the Underground City because of this.

494
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,960
He not only

495
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,920
forbade me from going to the Underground City,

496
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,070
but also prevented me from becoming a demon hunter.

497
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,000
After his death,

498
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,750
I deeply hated demons

499
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,620
and took my father's Hidden Dragon Case

500
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,150
to hunt demons everywhere.

501
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,590
It was Chi Xue who enlightened me

502
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,010
and made me remember

503
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,310
what my father said

504
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,480
to me before he died.

505
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,380
People can be good or evil,

506
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,110
and the same goes for demons.

507
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,370
Even if your parents

508
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,070
and brother

509
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,210
were all killed by demons,

510
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,040
you can't let hatred

511
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,400
blind your eyes.

512
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't kill indiscriminately without distinguishing right from wrong.

513
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,260
Do you understand?

514
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,410
So that's how it was.

515
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,270
After I learned you were a demon,

516
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,440
I even blamed your father.

517
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,550
But thinking about it now,

518
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,020
he actually had good intentions.

519
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,480
I know.

520
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,270
Xuanye,

521
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,840
I'm sorry.

522
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,790
If it weren't for me,

523
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,720
you wouldn't need to come to the Underground City

524
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,180
and you wouldn't have experienced all this.

525
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,600
There's a purpose in everything that happens.

526
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,550
I couldn't have remained

527
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,680
in the dark forever.

528
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,390
By the way,

529
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,750
how did you know about

530
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,960
the scars on my body?

531
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,690
Did you take off my clothes?

532
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,880
At that time,

533
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,960
the two of us

534
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,090
weren't that close.

535
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,170
That was so long ago.

536
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,030
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

537
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,440
I just suddenly feel

538
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,690
that I don't know you well enough.

539
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,800
If I rashly

540
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,960
marry you like this,

541
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm afraid I won't feel at ease.

542
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,600
Why are you so surprised?

543
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,960
After what you said,

544
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,440
how could I abandon you?

545
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,310
Did you think I'd really make you

546
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,170
become a beggar

547
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,270
and search for me all over the world?

548
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,510
Why are you crying again?

549
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,920
You promised me.

550
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,960
You promised me,

551
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,720
so make sure

552
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,990
you don't leave me again.

553
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,880
You're a man of your words.

554
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,920
You must keep your promises.

555
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,790
Did you hear me?

556
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,070
Alright.

557
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,800
But, Banxia,

558
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
before you came,

559
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,840
I thought about a lot of things.

560
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,590
I thought about you,

561
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,440
about Chi Xue,

562
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,200
about myself,

563
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,720
about my father.

564
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,700
My thoughts were in chaos.

565
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,400
I didn't know where to begin.

566
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,000
But even though I haven't figured it out yet...

567
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,050
I haven't figured out

568
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,050
how I should live my life from now on,

569
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,550
and I haven't figured out

570
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,680
which path I should take in the future,

571
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,830
but I can promise you this.

572
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,880
No matter what plans I make,

573
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,750
I will always include you in them.

574
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,720
Okay?

575
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,360
Master,

576
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,510
as a government official,

577
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,000
you collude with demons

578
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,790
and lure us here.

579
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,570
Can you live up to your official uniform?

580
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,340
I'm not wearing my official uniform.

581
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,840
Thus, my identity today

582
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,930
is not an official,

583
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,000
but Jiu Xuanye

584
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
and Chi Xue's friend.

585
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,480
I, Jiang Shangyun,

586
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,280
have only killed

587
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,750
demons.

588
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,880
You killed Chi Xue.

589
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
I should have killed you.

590
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,380
But you're a demon hunter,

591
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,300
and I'm a demon.

592
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,110
You mistakenly believed

593
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
that I harmed that child,

594
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,350
so you acted ruthlessly against me.

595
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,810
It's all understandable.

596
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,220
So I won't kill you.

597
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,340
But you're too impulsive.

598
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,640
Several times, without distinguishing right from wrong,

599
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,840
you were quick to act.

600
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,000
People who can't think clearly

601
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
don't deserve to have power.

602
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,090
So I've nullified your cultivation.

603
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,570
I hope you'll be more cautious in the future.

604
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,790
If you kill recklessly again

605
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,050
and fall into my hands,

606
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,160
I won't show mercy.

607
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,110
Master.

608
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,040
Let's go.

609
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,180
I thought

610
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,420
you would kill them.

611
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,950
Would you allow that?

612
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,310
Logically speaking,

613
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,110
we should detain them first,

614
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,660
then write a petition and go to court.

615
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,160
But Lord Geng

616
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,630
doesn't seem to want to question them.

617
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,530
"A life for a life" is a universal principle,

618
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,950
but how should we deal with killing demons?

619
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,160
The law doesn't cover this.

620
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,150
Are you alright?

621
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,720
I'm fine.

622
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,360
Let's head back then.

623
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,750
They didn't catch up, did they?

624
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,410
They didn't catch up, Master.

625
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,740
Wait a moment.

626
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,640
How are you, Master?

627
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,580
It's nothing.

628
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,480
Master,

629
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,270
the person who saved him before

630
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,750
seems to be the owner of Sky Cavern.

631
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,480
I know.

632
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,270
Then why didn't you say anything?

633
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,920
Say what?

634
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,850
They're obviously working together.

635
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,680
The Sky Cavern is powerful and wealthy.

636
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,030
If there's anyone to blame, it's us both

637
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,490
for being so blind before.

638
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,470
But fortunes change.

639
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
In this world,

640
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,570
Eight Pillar Sect isn't just

641
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,230
the only demon-hunting sect.

642
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,000
Sooner or later!

643
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,550
Sooner or later, I will...

644
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,350
Why are you two in such a mess?

645
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,000
Manager Lyu.

646
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,620
Manager Lyu, why are you here?

647
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,640
Naturally, I'm here to look for you,

648
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,750
Daoist Jiang.

649
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,350
Disciple,

650
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,510
let's go.

651
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,550
Daoist Jiang, why do you seem

652
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,950
to be on guard against me?

653
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,540
We've known each other for years,

654
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,350
and our business has been ongoing.

655
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,480
I've always thought

656
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,580
we were friends.

657
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,440
I've also always thought

658
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,770
we were on the same path.

659
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,820
That day when your master saved the panther demon,

660
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,360
I thought you would kill him,

661
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,550
but you let him go.

662
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,830
Why?

663
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,270
Humans and demons walk different paths.

664
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,590
Don't the people at the Sky Cavern

665
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,200
also hate demons the most?

666
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,110
That's right.

667
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,340
We have an irreconcilable hatred for the demon clan.

668
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,940
This point

669
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,630
will never change.

670
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,460
Then why did you let him go?

671
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,240
Daoist Jiang,

672
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,140
I truly admire you.

673
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,360
It's just a pity that

674
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,250
my master's great work is unfinished.

675
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,860
As for you, you know too much.

676
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,760
Keeping you alive would ultimately be a disaster.

677
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,810
But don't worry,

678
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,710
after you die,

679
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,510
countless demons will soon

680
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,180
come to accompany you in death.

681
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,330
Dying for the cause of eliminating demons,

682
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,860
you can be said to have died for a worthy cause.

683
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,070
Daoist Jiang,

684
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,740
I apologize for the offence.

685
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,190
Disciple, quickly run!

686
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,830
Master!

687
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,880
Go!

688
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,350
Master.

689
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,500
Is everything taken care of?

690
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,120
Yes.

691
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,870
Xuanye made the move?

692
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,850
Just as you predicted,

693
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,880
Xuanye only destroyed his cultivation.

694
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
I took care of the person.

695
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,720
That senior brother of mine

696
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,150
really has some skills.

697
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,200
He can even turn a demon into a bodhisattva.

698
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
This is the place.

699
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Come here, come here.

700
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,310
Master.

701
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,400
Manager.

702
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,830
Have you been comfortable staying at my place

703
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,960
these past two days?

704
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,600
Yes, I have.

705
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,600
How's your injury healing?

706
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,080
All thanks to Master,

707
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,210
it's almost healed.

708
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,430
Is it beautiful?

709
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,010
Yes, it is.

710
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,720
This seems

711
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,070
not very good.

712
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,450
Throw him in.

713
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,440
Yes.

714
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,310
No, no, no!

715
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,440
Master, Master!

716
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,650
Why-Why did you save me

717
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,430
only to kill me now?

718
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:32,890
Master.

719
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,350
If you don't heal completely,

720
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,270
will your demon powers and abilities

721
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,070
be of any use to me?

722
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,700
Throw him in.

723
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,070
Master, please, I beg you!

724
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,530
I've never harmed anyone.

725
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,790
I've never done anything bad.

726
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,590
Master,

727
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
it's almost done.

728
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,980
We just need one more.

729
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,800
You're awake.

730
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,870
Did I sleep for a long time?

731
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,770
About a day and a night.

732
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,000
That long?

733
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,540
You must have been very tired.

734
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,370
Have you been here the whole time?

735
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,190
Banxia,

736
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,010
do you know that when you sleep,

737
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,699
you talk in your sleep?

738
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,530
That's impossible.

739
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,199
My mother said I sleep very quietly.

740
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,350
Alright then.

741
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,780
Are we leaving now?

742
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,440
Yes.

743
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,310
Are we going back to Guangping?

744
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,220
You revealed my identity earlier.

745
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,630
I'm afraid those with ill intentions

746
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,150
have already taken note of it.

747
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,950
Guangping...

748
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,030
We can't go back there for now.

749
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm sorry.

750
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,670
It's not your fault.

751
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,920
I'm injured now;

752
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,760
we can't stay here anymore.

753
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,510
Let's first

754
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,640
find a place to stay.

755
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,080
When my injury heals,

756
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I'll accompany you back to Nanyang.

757
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,380
You want to come back to Nanyang with me?

758
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,880
No matter what,

759
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,620
I owe your parents an explanation.

760
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,230
Don't think about that now.

761
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,160
Focus on recovering first.

762
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,760
You're leaving?

763
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,800
Yes.

764
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,190
Xuanye,

765
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,730
look, your old wounds haven't healed yet.

766
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,760
People outside still believe

767
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,430
you're the demon who harmed people.

768
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,110
Besides here,

769
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,310
where else can you go?

770
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,570
Don't tell me

771
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,860
you want to return to Ganshan Clinic.

772
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,610
Don't worry, Uncle.

773
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,200
I have no plans

774
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,600
to return to Ganshan Clinic yet.

775
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,290
Then,

776
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,590
what are your plans now?

777
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,410
Actually, I don't have any plans.

778
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,240
I just want to find a place

779
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,320
to rest quietly.

780
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,360
Then stay here!

781
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,070
Is there any place

782
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,150
safer than here?

783
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,920
Xuanye, do you find

784
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,880
the Underground City

785
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,210
uncomfortable to stay?

786
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,280
If you have any thoughts,

787
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,410
feel free to tell me.

788
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,960
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

789
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,920
After all,

790
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,190
I can't spend my whole life

791
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,960
hiding here.

792
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,440
Besides,

793
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,990
I have some matters to attend to.

794
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,920
That's fine.

795
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,750
As you can see, our Underground City is

796
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,510
dark and stuffy.

797
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,590
It's indeed not suitable for recovery.

798
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,120
You can leave if you want to.

799
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,150
If you encounter

800
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,070
any difficulties out there,

801
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,670
don't hesitate to come to me.

802
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:49,860
Xuanye,

803
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,360
whether you're human

804
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,070
or demon,

805
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,490
remember this.

806
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,760
I will always be your Uncle.

807
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,030
And,

808
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,970
those words I've told you before,

809
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,770
you must keep them in your heart.

810
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,180
You should believe

811
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,060
that man can conquer nature.

812
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,120
As long as you want,

813
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,920
you have a choice.

814
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,150
Thank you, Uncle.

815
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,410
I will remember.

816
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,190
Then we'll be going now.

817
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,380
Go ahead.

818
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,100
Master,

819
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,050
are we just letting them go like this?

820
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,610
What else can we do?

821
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,040
Kill him right here and now?

822
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,110
Don't forget,

823
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,880
there are two chief constables from the government

824
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
waiting outside.

825
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,840
So what should we do next?

826
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,550
Find the other panther demon

827
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,680
as soon as possible.

828
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,230
Yes.

829
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,790
[Tomb of Old Friend, Chi Xue]

830
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,040
I want to be alone for a while.

831
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,560
Don't you need me to accompany you?

832
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,760
No need.

833
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,020
Come out.

834
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,930
Do you understand now?

835
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,070
You are not human,

836
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,590
and you can never become one.

837
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,030
You're the one who caused Chi Xue's death.

838
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,590
No,

839
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,230
I'm not the one who caused it.

840
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,190
It was you.

841
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,390
If you had realized earlier

842
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,590
and returned with me,

843
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,620
none of this would have happened.

844
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:06,850
What?

845
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,780
Are you seeking revenge?

846
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,710
It's bad enough that you've accepted an enemy as your father,

847
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,750
now you want to kill your biological brother

848
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,410
for the sake of a rabbit demon?

849
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,640
Biological brother?

850
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,120
Man Ying,

851
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,980
for how long more do you want to remain

852
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,240
stubborn and deluded?

853
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,070
You see the human world as your home.

854
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,800
Isn't the Carefree Land your home too?

855
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,190
We've met so many times;

856
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,110
have you ever asked about our father?

857
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,710
Have you ever asked about the safety of the Carefree Land?

858
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,590
I don't remember those things you mentioned.

859
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,360
You will remember sooner or later.

860
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,320
Or perhaps you've already remembered,

861
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,180
but you're just

862
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,330
unwilling to admit it to yourself.

863
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
You are the clan leader

864
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
chosen by Father.

865
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,540
You have to go back.

866
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,440
I don't want to be any clan leader.

867
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,250
if you want to be,

868
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,250
go be it yourself.

869
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,150
Don't want to?

870
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
You say you don't want to?

871
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,250
Do you know

872
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,110
what the bloodline in you

873
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,840
represents?

874
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,870
Father is getting old

875
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,770
and can't hold on much longer.

876
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,430
The Carefree Herb withers year by year,

877
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,800
yet we still have no solution.

878
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,840
As the son of the clan leader

879
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,320
of the Mystic Panther Clan,

880
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,190
with extraordinary talent

881
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,150
and powerful demon energy,

882
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,230
guarding the Realm Gate,

883
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,150
saving the Carefree Herb,

884
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,320
and leading the entire clan

885
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,880
are your responsibilities.

886
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,540
You say you don't want to do it?

887
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,040
I don't understand what you're saying.

888
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,670
Xuanye.

889
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,300
You really disappoint me.

890
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,510
You're not worthy of being Mystic Panther Clan's leader,

891
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,280
even more so of being my brother.

892
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,190
From now on,

893
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,590
your affairs

894
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,680
are no longer my concern.

895
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,920
Who was that person?

896
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,700
It's indeed a bit messy.

897
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,480
I haven't had time to clean up yet.

898
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,150
But

899
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,150
the situation at Guangping

900
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,380
is still unknown.

901
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,160
So I can only trouble you two

902
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,150
to recover here for now.

903
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,150
It's fine.

904
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,570
I just have to get some water

905
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,860
and clean up a bit.

906
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,660
Let me help you.

907
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,840
No need.

908
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,120
You're still injured.

909
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,560
Aren't you injured too?

910
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,520
You two should rest.

911
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,400
I'll do it.

912
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,230
Miss Sima,

913
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,250
you shouldn't be working like this.

914
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,050
We still have Youhuang here, don't we?

915
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,600
Wipe more attentively.

916
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,430
Do you even know how to do chores?

917
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,460
Just sitting there making snide remarks,

918
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,190
without even offering to help.

919
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,310
Why should I help you?

920
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,970
You're not my husband.

921
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,960
Besides,

922
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,800
if one day

923
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,060
you become my husband,

924
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,920
my official rank will be higher than yours,

925
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,840
and my income will be more than yours.

926
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,360
Naturally, you'll be the one doing the housework.

927
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,390
Consider this as getting used to it in advance.

928
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,850
Well, thank you very much.

929
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,840
Take a rest and have some water.

930
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:15,530
Here.

931
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,900
You haven't done any work at all.

932
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,550
Aren't you afraid of burning your tongue while having water?

933
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,610
Banxia,

934
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,190
I'll go to town later

935
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,760
to buy some furniture and utensils for you,

936
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,960
and also some rice and noodles for food.

937
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,920
I can go.

938
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,900
That won't do.

939
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,000
There's nothing here.

940
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,170
We need to buy a lot of things.

941
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,790
You can't carry it all by yourself.

942
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,050
I'll go with her later.

943
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,000
Did you ask me?

944
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,390
Well, I'm asking you now.

945
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,010
Are you going or not?

946
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,080
Alright.

947
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,210
I'll go with you.

948
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,280
Banxia,

949
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,230
don't do the dirty work anymore.

950
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,870
Leave it for us when we come back.

951
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,200
Wait for us to come back.

952
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,340
Hurry up.

953
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,630
Stop dawdling.
