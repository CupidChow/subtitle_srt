[Episode 18]

3
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,430
Xuanye,

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,590
six years ago,

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,140
misfortunes befell your family.

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,509
I went to Guangping

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,640
to arrange your family affairs

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,170
because you were in prison.

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,310
Your father's matter was widely known,

10
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,760
so things weren't easy for me.

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,350
I had

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
to go to Shendu

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,210
where I finally made the problem go away.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
When I returned to Guangping,

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,530
I tried to meet with you,

16
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,190
but you had already left.

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,310
I was so distraught

18
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,910
that I went traveling around.

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,840
I didn't go back to Guangping until six months later.

20
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,470
Thanks to you,

21
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,710
I didn't lose my life

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
years ago.

23
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,910
I've always wanted to

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,040
thank you in person,

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,079
but I could never find

26
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,030
your abode after a long time of searching.

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,150
It's a real surprise that we could meet up today.

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,910
How lucky.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,020
Xuanye,

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,700
you're like a nephew to me.

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,620
Let's forgo the formalities.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
In fact,

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,490
I owe more gratitude

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,400
to your father than you do me.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,030
I heard from my father

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,890
that a junior fellow of his

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,100
was exceptionally gifted

38
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,560
and amazingly brilliant.

39
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,910
But since this person was expelled,

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,290
they had never met up again.

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:53,890
Yes.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,420
We were so young back then.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,590
We thought we'd have many chances

44
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,190
to meet up.

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,490
Neither did we think

46
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,160
we would be forever parted.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,750
Why

48
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,800
were you expelled from the sect?

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,190
Because of

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,210
conflicts in ideas.

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,910
I left the mountain for adventures at 20.

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,420
In Nanguo Town,

53
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,120
I met a woman,

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,150
who I hopelessly fell in love with

55
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,120
at first sight.

56
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,310
She also liked me.

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,840
We promised to spend the rest

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,100
of our lives together.

59
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,870
But soon I found out

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,329
that she was not a human,

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,960
but a fox demon.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,770
I struggled for a long time,

63
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,490
but I just couldn't leave her.

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,400
However,

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,650
as a disciple of the Eight Pillar Sect.

66
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,520
I had to follow its strict rules.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,250
The first one

68
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,990
is to stay clear of demons

69
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,290
and to never get emotionally attached to them.

70
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,560
When my master found out about us,

71
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
he got furious

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,579
and demanded me

73
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,280
to instantly sever ties with her.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
But at that time,

75
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,080
how could I bring myself to do it?

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,750
Therefore,

77
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,110
I had to bid farewell to

78
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,750
my master and the senior fellows,

79
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,280
and leave the sect forever,

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,360
so as to be with that woman.

81
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,320
What happened then?

82
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,089
Are you still with her now?

83
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,040
No.

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,120
Why?

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,630
She left.

86
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,560
Left?

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Although she was in love with me,

88
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,590
she couldn't defy the nature of a demon.

89
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,870
One time, when she got drunk,

90
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,200
and her mind was confused,

91
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
she lost control of herself

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
and almost maimed me.

93
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,990
After that,

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,430
she left.

95
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,430
Didn't you go look for her?

96
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,120
I did,

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,010
but I couldn't find her.

98
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,240
So,

99
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,070
I came to the Underground City.

100
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,510
Humans and demons mingle here.

101
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,170
There are all sorts of demons.

102
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,930
I thought

103
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,330
we would reunite one day.

104
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,430
Sadly, 20 years have passed,

105
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,730
yet she has never shown up.

106
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,740
How could this happen?

107
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,850
Well, humans and demons are inherently different.

108
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,720
Compared with other unfortunate couples,

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,180
she and I were quite lucky.

110
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,430
Hasn't there been an exception?

111
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,970
Maybe there has,

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,260
but I just don't know about it.

113
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,680
Uncle,

114
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,830
why did you ask me

115
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,000
for a meeting?

116
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,990
No reason.

117
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,590
I was just wondering

118
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,570
what you came to the Underground City for.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,060
Why do you want to visit this gallery?

120
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,270
Lord Xin'an is an expert in calligraphy and paintings.

121
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,750
When he

122
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,090
travels to a new place,

123
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,680
he'd visit the local galleries

124
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,640
for pleasure.

125
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,950
We're out

126
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,920
of leads anyway.

127
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,800
Might as well take a chance.

128
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,870
Which direction should we head towards?

129
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,120
Well...

130
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:04,970
Hello.

131
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,680
[Mr. Pu]

132
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,990
Are you looking for someone?

133
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
No, we're not.

134
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
How do you know

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,210
we are looking for someone?

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,720
I

137
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,250
observed the stars at night

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,330
and performed divination.

139
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,720
Then I just figured it all out.

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,180
One can't see the sky here.

141
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,820
How did you observe stars?

142
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,330
Young man, don't be so serious.

143
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,390
Or it'll be hard for you to find a wife.

144
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,320
I'm not in the market for a wife now.

145
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,930
It doesn't matter how I got to know your purpose.

146
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,990
The important thing is,

147
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,950
I can help you find the person you want to meet with.

148
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,190
How?

149
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,070
This is called the Miraculous Navigator.

150
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,720
It...

151
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,170
Isn't this just a compass?

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,480
Well,

153
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
it does look like

154
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,350
a regular compass,

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,510
but it doesn't function the same.

156
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,080
Compasses

157
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,550
show you where

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,220
the south and north are.

159
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,950
But this Miraculous Navigator

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,990
can tell you

161
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,750
where the person you want to see is.

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,000
Miss,

163
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,000
take my words for it.

164
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,790
Pray with your heart,

165
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,370
and this precious item

166
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,770
will definitely lead you

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,920
to the person you're thinking about.

168
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,430
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

169
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,120
No, I haven't.

170
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,909
Thank you.

171
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,600
It works well.

172
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,659
It works very well.

173
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,330
I'll take it.

174
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,650
What a squanderer.

175
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,750
You're

176
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,700

00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,750
Looking for someone?

353
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,990
You should've led with that.

354
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,510
We often draw portraits of missing persons.

355
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,720
Part of our service, I'd say.

356
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,250
The quality is guaranteed.

357
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,030
Would you

358
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,030
describe

359
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,120
the person you're looking for

360
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,840
to me?

361
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
On the day he or she went missing,

362
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,120
what was this person

363
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,960
wearing?

364
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,730
Don't bother.

365
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,480
We've got a clue already.

366
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,530
We just need

367
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,310
some information from you.

368
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,620
I don't go out much.

369
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,600
Perhaps I'm not able

370
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,750
to give you any information.

371
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,870
But since you're already here,

372
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,960
you can tell me what you want to know.

373
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,720
Maybe

374
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,810
I can be of

375
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,870
some help to you.

376
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,170
My mother's name is Tang Ruyun.

377
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,020
She went missing 12 years ago.

378
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,910
This is why

379
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,670
I came to

380
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,930
the Underground City.

381
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,460
I see.

382
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
I feel for you.

383
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,359
Do you know anything about my parents?

384
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,390
No.

385
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,089
Then why are you...

386
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm just

387
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,790
feeling sorry for you.

388
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,770
Why would something

389
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,710
that terrible

390
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,579
happen to a nice girl?

391
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,480
Although I can't

392
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
be of much help,

393
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,589
I still

394
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,720
hope your trip

395
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,609
to my bookstore can be rewarding.

396
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,550
Would you

397
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,720
show me

398
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
that letter?

399
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,500
Indeed...

400
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,630
I do sell

401
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,140
this type of rosin ink.

402
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,960
However,

403
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,870
tons of customers

404
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,890
have bought such kind of ink.

405
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,720
I can't give you a specific name.

406
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,950
The seal

407
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,240
seems to be from my shop too.

408
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,650
Why don't you

409
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,490
come with me and take a look?

410
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,880
Here you are.

411
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,810
See if one of these seals is of help.

412
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,450
Well...

413
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,110
So,

414
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,280
neither do you know Tang Ruyun,

415
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,680
or have seen this letter before, right?

416
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,240
Is there any information

417
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,100
you can tell us?

418
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm afraid no.

419
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,100
That said,

420
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I can ask someone else about it.

421
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
To be frank,

422
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,000
I've been living in the Underground City

423
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
for several decades.

424
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,830
I've made many acquaintances.

425
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,850
May I

426
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,680
have

427
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,590
your address?

428
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll let you know

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,590
if I get

430
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,720
any news.

431
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,490
I'm staying at Wugeng Inn.

432
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,220
Thank you so much for your help today.

433
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,890
You're welcome.

434
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,550
Come again if you need help.

435
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,440
Even if you don't,

436
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,110
you can still stop by to browse the paintings.

437
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,370
Walk these guests out.

438
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,310
Yes.

439
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,720
This way,

440
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:22,810
please.

441
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,960
Did they leave?

442
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,240
Yes.

443
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,070
Really?

444
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,240
Yes.

445
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,850
Get me the hammer.

446
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,750
Yes.

447
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,160
Lift up your head.

448
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,550
Are you blind?

449
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,150
Master...

450
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,200
Are you blind?

451
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,640
Go to hell!

452
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,980
One ran away.

453
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,760
And this one is useless.

454
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,270
I gotta paint a new one again!

455
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,200
What a dud!

456
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,270
I hate this.

457
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,050
I hate this!

458
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,590
Your mother has been missing for over 10 years.

459
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,480
It's not that easy

460
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,400
to find her.

461
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,800
This is just a minor setback.

462
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,360
Pull yourself together.

463
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,740
Miss,

464
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,770
I have

465
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,510
a magical item

466
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,730
named the Miraculous Navigator.

467
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,400
Miss,

468
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,750
just hold it

469
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,170
and think about

470
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,480
the person you most want to see.

471
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,900
Then, it will point out

472
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,090
a direction for you.

473
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,940
Is it really that magical?

474
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,000
It certainly is.

475
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,960
Well,

476
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,200
amicable lady,

477
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,960
this won't

478
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,570
cost you a fortune,

479
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,330
but only a trade note that is worth 50 taels of silver.

480
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,920
It's the Tracking Spell,

481
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,310
the easiest magic technique.

482
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,440
In Guangping,

483
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,290
it's not even worth one tael of silver.

484
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,760
One can easily learn it,

485
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,190
but can hardly master it.

486
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,680
Perhaps only one

487
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,080
out of one thousand guesses is accurate.

488
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,000
Come on, young man,

489
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,530
why did you have to say that?

490
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
Couldn't you just stay silent?

491
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,960
You were selling this

492
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,920
to my friend.

493
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Shouldn't I have kept her informed?

494
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,480
A genuine heart often gets rewarded.

495
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,720
Maybe

496
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,150
this young lady is in luck

497
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,240
to beat that one-in-a-thousand

498
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,640
odd.

499
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,310
Miss,

500
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,720
buy it now. It really helps.

501
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,480
You can find anyone you want with it.

502
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,240
What is this?

503
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,030
Miss,

504
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,440
y-you have such a good eye!

505
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,750
This is

506
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,590
a Conch of Blue Tides from Penglai Island.

507
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,200
It takes

508
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,650
10 years to harvest

509
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,770
such a conch

510
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,200
on the entire island.

511
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,780
If you are really interested in it...

512
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,490
It's just an Echo Conch.

513
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,310
When you speak to it,

514
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,370
your voice can be preserved for a long time.

515
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,680
How much is this?

516
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,540
I want to buy it.

517
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,660
You want to buy this?

518
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,050
Here you are.

519
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,670
This is too little, isn't it?

520
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,180
This...

521
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,490
More than enough, I'd say.

522
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,140
Customers are hard to please.

523
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,270
Why is it so difficult

524
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,640
for me to run a business?

525
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,310
Let's go.

526
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,000
My Lady!

527
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,720
My Lady.

528
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,480
Where have you been?

529
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
It's all Chi Xue's fault.

530
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,840
This rabbit is Chi Xue?

531
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,510
He's a lazybones.

532
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,970
He dozed off after eating.

533
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,300
He had me carry him home.

534
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,240
Are you not afraid of him anymore?

535
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,700
What's so scary about him?

536
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,550
He's just a rabbit.

537
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,200
A chubby rabbit.

538
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,510
He's not much different

539
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,780
from a regular rabbit.

540
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,110
You pretended

541
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,810
to be asleep, so Tingzhou

542
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,010
had to carry you back.

543
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,310
That was devious.

544
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,750
I was just teasing her.

545
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,830
There's a boundary between men and women in the mortal world.

546
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,360
What you think of as teasing

547
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,920
could be mistaken for flirting

548
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,270
by others.

549
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,480
What?

550
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,000
Does it sound harsh to you?

551
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,030
Yeah. It does.

552
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,540
You can have fun with Banxia,

553
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,750
but God forbid I should

554
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,680
tease Tingzhou!

555
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Is that even fair?

556
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,570
What nonsense is that?

557
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,560
Just admit

558
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,810
that you like Banxia.

559
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,690
Make a decision, you wobbler.

560
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,680
My Lady,

561
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,110
rest assured.

562
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,470
Physician Jiu definitely likes you.

563
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,460
Isn't it obvious?

564
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,270
He came after us right after we set out.

565
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,310
You didn't pay him.

566
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,240
Why would he help you for no reason?

567
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,110
When

568
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,510
your father is saved, you can ask him

569
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,310
to cancel your engagement to Mr. Li.

570
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,270
You've been a great daughter to him.

571
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,750
I'm sure he'll agree to that.

572
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,510
At that time,

573
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,480
nothing can

574
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,680
stop you from being with Physician Jiu.

575
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,310
Xuanye,

576
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,310
you're going

577
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,570
to be Banxia's family.

578
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,740
Don't refute that.

579
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,440
Xuanye,

580
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,610
I don't like that fellow of your father's.

581
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,270
His vibes are not to my liking.

582
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,340
What vibes?

583
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,560
The kind that screams he hates me.

584
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,060
He's been living here for a long time.

585
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,710
I'm sure he takes a milder attitude

586
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,110
towards demons than I do.

587
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,040
Is that so?

588
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:45,770
Xuanye,

589
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,680
I just overheard

590
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,940
Banxia and Tingzhou.

591
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,670
When Banxia finds her father,

592
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,310
she'll have her engagement cancelled

593
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,570
and marry you instead.

594
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,550
Just admit

595
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,880
that you like her.

596
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,840
Make a decision, you wobbler.

597
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,850
Xuanye!

598
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,290
Where are you going?

599
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,020
It's been quite a while

600
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,010
since you ran down here.

601
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,770
You must be sleepy, right?

602
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,240
You should go to bed now.

603
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,830
I'm good.

604
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,350
Are you having difficulty falling asleep?

605
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,920
If so,

606
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,180
I can keep you company.

607
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,440
No need. No.

608
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,870
I'm feeling sleepy now.

609
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,330
I should go back to my room.

610
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,200
Sit down!

611
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,750
When have you

612
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,510
become so bold?

613
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,410
Well, I...

614
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,880
I've been through

615
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,600
many challenges now.

616
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,550
Xuanye,

617
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,550
if I were a demon,

618
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,240
how would you treat me?

619
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,350
Would you still be my friend?

620
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,070
Would you pretend not to know me,

621
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,550
or would you kill me?

622
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:25,950
You're a human.

623
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,410
That's not a reasonable hypothesis.

624
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,810
How is it not reasonable?

625
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,960
Just give me an answer.

626
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,220
If I were a demon,

627
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,600
would you try to kill me?

628
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,270
Of course not.

629
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,970
I would

630
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,270
capture you

631
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,240
and tie you up.

632
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
You could keep me

633
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,720
in the dark for so long

634
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,120
without me realizing it.

635
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,480
That means

636
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,480
you're good at disguising yourself.

637
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,510
You would be the kind

638
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,570
of demon that has value for research.

639
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,070
Even if you were a demon,

640
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,310
I wouldn't mind.

641
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,430
[Inn]

642
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,440
Banxia,

643
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,640
you seem to be in love with Xuanye.

644
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,240
Do you know that?

645
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,000
No one will come to your rescue this time.

646
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,650
Let me see where else you can go.

647
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,000
Look at this.

648
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,480
Enlightenment Bookstore.

649
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,110
We've finally found it.

650
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,650
But it looks like

651
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,110
a liquor store.

652
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,920
Is there anything wrong with being a demon?

653
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,110
Not every demon deserves death,

654
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,370
not to mention the one that has helped me.

655
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,640
Who are you?

656
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,070
Why did you help me?

657
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,830
You were attacked

658
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,470
by two demon hunters.

659
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,450
How did you figure that out?

660
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,090
Why would they try to hunt you down?

661
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,490
Demon hunters kill demons.

662
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,200
Nothing unusual about it.

663
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,710
You might have to hide yourself for a while.

664
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,310
They

665
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,630
know where my home is.

666
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,940
Have you thought about

667
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,930
leaving the Underground City?

668
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,520
Given my current condition,

669
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,000
I'll be dead if I leave here, won't I?

670
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Let me take you to a place.

671
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,000
You may go now.

672
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,510
Thank you, sir.

673
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,380
Xuanye,

674
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,370
do you know him?

675
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,480
Barely.

676
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,690
Then why would you help him?

677
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,210
He has done nothing wrong.

678
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
He shouldn't die.

679
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,250
I thought

680
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,160
after what happened to your parents,

681
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
you would hate all demons' guts.

682
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,670
I applaud for your attitude.

683
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,900
If your father knew this,

684
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,300
he would be very pleased.

685
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,700
By the way, Xuanye,

686
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,150
how is your search going?

687
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,480
Have you found anything

688
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,340
in the Enlightenment Bookstore?

689
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,830
No, nothing.

690
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,240
Be patient.

691
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,140
I'll help you with it.

692
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Thank you, Uncle.

693
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,550
Anytime.

694
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,880
Try this.

695
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,160
I made this tea for you.

696
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,250
Come on.

697
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,510
Sure.

698
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,550
You'll

699
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,140
find my paintings satisfactory.

700
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,490
Girls like them.

701
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,030
Good to see you again, sir.

702
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,420
After all this walking,

703
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,240
we still ended up

704
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,500
on the Gallery Street.

705
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
You shouldn't have bought this.

706
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,210
Let's walk a bit further ahead.

707
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,350
What is it now?

708
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,420
Why is it telling us to go back?

709
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,510
What kind of junk is this?

710
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,590
It's not working at all.

711
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,770
Seems odd.

712
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,550
Silly gadget.

713
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,610
Why does it keep pointing at me?

714
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,489
Now you know you were scammed, don't you?

715
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,500
Never mind.

716
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
We should rely on ourselves.

717
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,239
We're all on our own now.

718
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,540
How should we proceed?

719
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,510
Laws still apply to

720
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,710
the Underground City

721
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,710
The residents here dare not to

722
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,760
openly defy the authorities.

723
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,360
As usual,

724
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,440
split up, tell them who we are and inquire.

725
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,100
This gadget

726
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,239
is yours now.

727
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,660
Sima Lingying!

728
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,370
Is anyone here?

729
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,410
Is anyone here?

730
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,070
Shop owner?

731
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,000
Miss,

732
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,610
you have a visitor.

733
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,920
A visitor?

734
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,590
Aren't you the owner of

735
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,320
the Enlightenment Bookstore?

736
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,760
You have such a good memory.

737
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,510
Impressive.

738
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,760
It's me, yes.

739
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,370
Have a seat.

740
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,500
Okay.

741
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,590
What brings you here?

742
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,070
Last time, after hearing your story,

743
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,280
I felt deeply sorry for you.

744
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,110
So, I asked my friends to collect information for me.

745
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,710
Finally, there is a finding.

746
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,560
I've figured out

747
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,160
where the person you're looking for is.

748
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,810
Take a look.

749
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,570
See if this is his handwriting.

750
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,700
It... It really is my father's handwriting.

751
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,310
Then come with me now.

752
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,880
Now?

753
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,960
Yes.

754
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,000
But my friends haven't

755
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,110
come back yet.

756
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,110
Don't miss out on this opportunity.

757
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,360
Seize the time,

758
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,450
or there might be another long wait

759
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,310
before a second chance presents.

760
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,330
In that case,

761
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,280
I'm afraid you might never

762
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,370
find the person.

763
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,840
Miss,

764
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,110
why are you hesitating?

765
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,210
You've made a trip here.

766
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,160
You should get some rest.

767
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm wondering

768
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,590
where my father is now.

769
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,800
Is my mother with him?

770
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,480
I've had them stay

771
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,310
at my shop now.

772
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,450
We'd better go

773
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,680
before it's too late.

774
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,480
Let's go.

775
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,880
At your shop?

776
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,440
Miss,

777
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,030
are you coming with me or not?

778
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,690
Yes.

779
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,280
Good.

780
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,250
Let me get my coat.

781
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,960
Sure.

782
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,710
Go ahead.

783
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,280
Do it now.

784
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,880
I'll be waiting outside.

785
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,770
Waiter!

786
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,280
Miss, let's go now.

787
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
The clock is ticking.

788
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,120
But I...

789
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,740
Let me through!

790
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,190
Do you think you can run away?

791
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,660
Banxia,

792
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,670
we're coming in.

793
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,860
-Banxia?
-Banxia?

794
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,360
Physician Jiu?

795
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,350
Tingzhou,

796
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,770
isn't Banxia with you?

797
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,290
No.

798
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,320
I just went out to buy pastries.

799
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,880
She was reading in the room.

800
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,840
The bookstore?
