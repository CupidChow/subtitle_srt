1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
And..

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,080
me.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,360
This was an scholarship.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,840
I think.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Even so..

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,160
you were there.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Most Bridge

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But time is off.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's go.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Such a big tent.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Such a big tent.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The owner said that it's a big day for the Ninth Brother.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We can't have any time to eat.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You really do feel sad for me.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's colder than last time.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The shop is closed.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Not only the water is closed,

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
they also closed the city.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It seems that your guess is right.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
People are fighting.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No matter what happens,

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the worst part is right.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We should go to the East Railway first.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's go this way.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Be careful.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't make a noise.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Be careful.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't make a noise.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The East Railway

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother, we are here.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Who is it?

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There is a situation outside.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know how to deal with them.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What's wrong?

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to deal with the small matter.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ninth Brother, please go first.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I will wait for you.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There are many people here.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will go in and have a look.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you have a way?

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Just kill them.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't be reckless.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There are many people here.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's a human being who is a rabbit.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't forget.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The one who is hurt by you

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
was beaten by a rabbit.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't talk.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Look.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Look.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are they talking about?

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They can't hear it.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There must be someone

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
who found the outside boat.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There must be someone

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
who found the outside boat.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No matter who it is,

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
it can't affect

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the matter in the skeleton.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It can't affect

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the matter in the skeleton.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There must be someone

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
who is not left.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, sir.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Xiguchi,

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
have they started?

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Follow me

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
on the road I took.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Xiguchi is over there.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will block them.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You go first.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Follow me.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Go.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Go.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Go.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Go.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Xun.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is this

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Xiguchi

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
what you said?

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
where you

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
took the skeleton.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's also the gate of the two realms.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's been 12 years since it was built.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Xun.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is your home.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I will go there.

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Do you know

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I have been there before?

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's hard to forget.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The two realms are everywhere.

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There must be a ghost monster.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They are all strong.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Such a strong demon group

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
can only be found in ten thousand

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and bring them time.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a secret.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They can't come.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I am the guardian of the Xuan Bao Clan.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The secret of the Xuan Bao Clan

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
is to protect the gate.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So,

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the demon group

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
can't enter the human realm.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Really?

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But you are here.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your brother is here too.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How can you guarantee that they won't come?

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How can you guarantee that

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the Xuan Bao Clan will never change

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and can always resist other demons?

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So,

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I built the Xiaodong Sky here

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
not for money

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but for the guardian of the gate.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of course.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The mission of Xiaodong Sky

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
is to resist the demon group.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Protect the gate.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If something happens,

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we will fight till the end.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Even if we put the whole underground city

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
as a place,

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
we can't let the demon group

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
enter the human realm.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I know.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If it's not for the demon group,

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
why did you

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
have to

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
take the demon group's punishment?

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Xuan Yi,

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you know that we have a saying

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that we are not the ones

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
who force the demon group to do so.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's not like all the demons are like you.

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
All I did

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
was to protect myself.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I hope the demon group won't come

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and never come.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Uncle.

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
When did you find this place?

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I told you before.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I used to like a tiger demon.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Later, it hurt me

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
because of the impurity

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and I left.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
After that,

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I started looking for

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
a way to turn the demon into human.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But now,

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I found a way.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But I can't find it.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Have you tried other people?

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Of course.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How could I let you try?

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you ready?

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Xuan Yi.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I have no idea.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have been a dog for a lifetime.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I may not have time to get the benefit.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will feel the fear

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
if I lie to you.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what?

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The ancient king came here as a master.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He may not have the wisdom to be a coward.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But he must have the courage to be a champion.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Look.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The door is open.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you want to be a human

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
or a demon?

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
At this moment,

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you can decide what you want.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Go.

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hurry.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Over there.

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yan Hao.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let's go.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's go.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Good job.

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Miss Duan.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We meet again.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where is Xuan Yi?

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He is a kind of love to you.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You hurt him with your demon.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Aren't you afraid of hurting him?

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You are the one who hurt him.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We helped you

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to get a demon.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's so cruel.

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why are you talking nonsense?

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We have a message.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If we die here,

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I will guarantee

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that you can't live

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
even a chicken.

212
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Catch them.

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's too late.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will go find Xuan Yi.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Go.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can't kill a man?

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I am a champion.

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I am not as good as you.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I am just a coward.

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You are so cruel.

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You...

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What?

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You don't dare?

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm really not afraid of that

225
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,000
I really don't have the courage to be a champion

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you for your hard work

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I have to think about it

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Think about how to go on my future path

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll take my leave

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Stop

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll take my leave

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Stop

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
When did you find her?

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're too anxious

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
My uncle and I have a brother

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We don't have much time to meet

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You usually look like a person who's gone too far

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're only interested in me

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and the thing about the monster

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I felt a little strange

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Maybe we're just concerned about you

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I thought so at first

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But very soon

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was exposed to the situation of losing my mind

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is it because of the second round?

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I thought so at first

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But the second time

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was very sure

250
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that someone was doing it on purpose

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Only Zikong was able to do it

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I went to find him

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You found him?

254
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But I found out where you were serving

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I knew the connection between the gate of the Eighth Gate and underground city

257
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If Zikong is really in your hands

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Who will be the one to blame?

259
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Uncle

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I really don't understand what you're trying to do

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you think I'm a monster

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Just do it

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why do you still have to be so anxious

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
to play such a game of love?

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm very curious

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
about your opinion on the monster

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So I went to the Eighth Gate

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and made a list of the records

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
about Song Qi's entry and exit of underground city

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He never left underground city

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But he told me

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that he had been sent away

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Uncle

275
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Are you lying?

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We are just waiting for the right time

277
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Maybe we used some means

278
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
to find out about Song Qi

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You killed him

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
These years

282
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I've been taking the monster for a long time

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I have many friends who are important

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I have many friends who are important

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They are all your guests

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Even

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Even Jiang Shangyun's master

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
is your superior

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Both of them

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
died in your hands

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You took so many monsters

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What place are you hiding?

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If I'm not mistaken

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They were all

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
put into the Western Valley

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You used the half-dress to lure me

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and made me lose control

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
To make me jump into the Western Valley

299
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
to avoid monsters

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You are so bold

301
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know I have a plan for you

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
How dare you

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I always have to make it clear

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
what you want to do

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Otherwise I will keep you in the room all day

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How can you live like this?

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You are not afraid that you can't leave

308
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Are you going to kill me?

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I never offended you

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you are going to kill me

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You had so many chances before

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why did you have to wait for today?

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I shouldn't have been the one

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
who was the monster

315
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You want me to jump down

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What do you want?

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You want to take away my spirit

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
or my body?

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Your little winter

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
has been in the underground city for so many years

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You must be trying to be a good man

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Could it be that

323
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you lost your magic and have no advantage?

324
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Stop talking about it

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay

326
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Since you have guessed it

327
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I will not fight with you

328
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We have a good deal

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
As long as you jump down

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
we are afraid that

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the master and the master will be able to keep the final face

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Jump

333
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Uncle

334
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Stop joking

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If you want to kill me

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
we have no face left

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If you go back now

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
maybe everything will be fine

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's too late

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's too late to come before the year of the 12th

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why are you still talking to me?

342
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The arrow

343
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Master's old servant

344
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
never told me about the Cangluo Xia

345
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and he told you that

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you are a great father

347
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and you are so good at it

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's ridiculous

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The Eighth Gate is full of evil

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and it's not easy to understand

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
people like you

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let go of me

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let go of me

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Ban Xia

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Shui Yan

356
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The West Palace is not able to help you

357
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You will get your illness

358
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You should leave

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let him go

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It has nothing to do with this

361
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It has nothing to do with this

362
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So Shui Yan

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
As long as you are willing to jump into the West Palace

364
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will let him go

365
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I will do my best

366
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Shui Yan, don't listen to him

367
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Shut up

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Shui Yan

369
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
His fate has nothing to do with me

370
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Everything is up to you

371
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You know that I am not a good person

372
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Shui Yan

373
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Push down

374
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,260
There's no need to worry about more.

375
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,760
I'll accept your proposal and you will do as best as I can.

376
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
I know it!

377
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,060
I'm sorry, Люб Zeit for my loss.

378
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,640
I know itwened to get you into this but I'm not drowning.

379
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,380
But on the other hand, he wasn't being himself.

380
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,800
Nah.

381
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

382
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

383
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

384
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

385
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

386
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,800
ki was back, right?

387
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,800
I'm not sure if I can get wipe before breaking the sons.

388
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I'm not sure if I can get the fourth one judicial jalay and politician.

389
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm not sure if I can get him beneficial, but I'm not sure about that on security.

390
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,800
He does heill yourself in many situations.

391
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Hold this

392
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,960
ваи

393
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Do you still remember the books my father taught you?

394
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Yes.

395
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Then let me see what you have in the human world.

396
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Interesting.

397
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Let's go.

398
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Father!

399
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Hahahahaha!

400
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Hahahahaha!

401
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Ah!

402
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Be careful!

403
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Ah!

404
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I will use my power to break the formation.

405
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
If there is a chance, you will escape.

406
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
We will use the stone armor when the formation is broken.

407
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I have a way.

408
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Just listen to me.

409
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
But...

410
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Don't fly!

411
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I am your brother.

412
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
You have to listen to me.

413
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Ah!

414
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Ah!

415
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Ling Ying!

416
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Ah!

417
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I will kill you!

418
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Ah!

419
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Yong Huang!

420
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Yong Huang!

421
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Sorry, dad.

422
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I am fine.

423
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Yong Huang!

424
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Yong Huang!

425
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Yong Huang!

426
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Yong Huang!

427
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Ah!

428
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
I really want to see you two.

429
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,800
But this is the end of this trouble.

430
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Ah!

431
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Man Ying!

432
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
The Xuan Bao Sect is so powerful.

433
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I will teach you a lesson.

434
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Ah!

435
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
You ran too slow.

436
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
I was the one who let you down.

437
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Don't say that.

438
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Let's do it again.

439
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Go and rest.

440
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Go and rest.

441
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Brother.

442
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
What do you want to do when you grow up?

443
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Like a father.

444
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Protecting the peace of the world.

445
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
And the leader of the Xuan Bao Sect.

446
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
What about you?

447
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I...

448
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
I want to help the people of the Xuan Bao Sect.

449
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
In the future, the Xuan Bao Sect's leader will be the leader.

450
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I will also be one of them.

451
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
And he will protect me.

452
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Of course.

453
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
In order to protect the people of the Xuan Bao Sect,

454
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
the leader will protect you.

455
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Brother!

456
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
I will take revenge for you.

457
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
I will take revenge for you.

458
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Brother.

459
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Brother!

460
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Brother!

461
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Brother!

462
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Brother!

463
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Brother!

464
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,800
You actually became a demon?

465
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
You're kidding me!

466
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
I actually became a demon!

467
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I became the most annoying demon!

468
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I became a demon!

469
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Miss Duan,

470
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I know you don't know me.

471
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Do you remember the person who sold you?

472
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Wow, so beautiful!

473
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Zi Wan.

474
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I think this one is better.

475
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I'll lie here.

476
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
I'll lie here.

477
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
That day,

478
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I was in this dirty, dirty, and dirty box.

479
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,800
The monster that killed me was exposed by my family.

480
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
I was the one who got the most votes.

481
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
That day,

482
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
I met you.

483
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Look at us.

484
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Go back with me.

485
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Let me go!

486
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
You little rabbit!

487
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I want to thank you.

488
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
It's you.

489
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
You brought me to Wu You Ji.

490
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,800
I saw the source of the monster there.

491
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
That's Wu You Cao.

492
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,800
There are so many people here.

493
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
I finally understand why there are more monsters

494
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
every twelve years.

495
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,800
I'll kill them all.

496
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I think as long as I get rid of Wu You Cao,

497
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
no matter how many monsters there are,

498
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I'll never have any more monsters.

499
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
But I hate myself.

500
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Because I'm a human being.

501
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I can't live in Wu You Ji.

502
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
I have to find a way

503
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
to make myself a monster.

504
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
I can enter Wu You Ji.

505
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I can kill all the monsters.

506
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,800
That's the way you think as a monster.

507
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
That's right.

508
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
If you want to kill the monster,

509
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
you have to become a monster first.

510
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Don't dream about it.

511
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Don't dream about it.

512
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
That's right.

513
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I dream about it.

514
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
But my dream is about to come true.

515
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
And your dream

516
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
will never come true.

517
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Shanyi.

518
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Shanyi.

519
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I'll show you how to open it.

520
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
The monster is coming.

521
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I'll kill you.

522
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
I want to enter Wu You Ji.

523
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I'll wait for 12 more years.

524
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
You?

525
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
No one can stop me.

526
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Open it.

527
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Okay.

528
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Since you won't let me open it,

529
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I'll let the whole city

530
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
and the whole Huaming City

531
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
die together.

532
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Let's die together.

533
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Let's die together.
