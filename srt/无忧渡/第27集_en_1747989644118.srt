00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
this

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,280
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
I've lost.

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,720
I was out, komma.

7
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,160
I was out, come here with me.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,400
When I was at home, my father didn't dare to come down with me.

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,000
Ban Xia, you're back.

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
I have something to do. Help me.

11
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
What is it? Say it.

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
It's autumn today. The weather is cool.

13
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to buy some clothes.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,600
But it's too far away. I have a carriage.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,400
It's simple. My carriage is outside. I'll take you there.

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Let's go.

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Wait.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Ban Xia, the meal is ready.

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
If you want to buy anything, go tomorrow.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
No, I have to go today.

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Dad, if you don't think anyone will eat with you,

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
you can go to the next door to find Dr. Jiu.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Anyway, he is your benefactor.

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,400
You can be more close to him.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Yes.

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Jiu is a good friend and he is very close to each other.

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Uncle Duan, you are neighbors.

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's good to walk around often.

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Then.

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Let's go.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Okay.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Where are you going, Mr. Wang?

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm going to buy some clothes.

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
If you want to buy clothes, you don't need to buy so many people.

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Do you know how to drive?

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
No.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Then let's go by ourselves.

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Of course.

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Wait here.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Okay.

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Ban Xia.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Ban Xia.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Jiu.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Are you leaving?

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
We are leaving.

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Let's go back and continue.

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Get up.

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Xuanyi.

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Do you know what happened to Ban Xia?

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
She doesn't care about me.

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
She doesn't ask me to go to her house to eat.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Mr. Li said that she is the husband of Ban Xia.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Xuanyi.

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Aren't you two the same?

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
If Ban Xia marries someone else,

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I can't eat her and make her delicious food.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Why are you talking so much?

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Work.

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Xuanyi.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Xuanyi.

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Are you sure it's useful?

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I knew it after trying it.

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
After all, I'm not sure about the recipe

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
of this video.

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
These are all the documents I've found in her place.

67
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Maybe this is the key to this magic.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
What magic?

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
It's so good.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I've heard that some monsters

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,400
can share the magic with other people.

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,400
But I'm still the first one to exchange the magic

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
and control the other person's health.

74
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Try it.

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Don't let her take your time.

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Xuanyi, help me to protect her.

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Okay.

78
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Go.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Go.

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm leaving.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Wait for my return.

82
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Go.

83
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
What?

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Xuan Yi?

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Who are you?

86
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Who are you?

87
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
If you don't say anything,

88
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
don't blame me for being rude.

89
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Who are you?

90
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
What are you doing?

91
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
What are you doing?

92
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Hurry up.

93
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
I said hurry up.

94
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
There's no way.

95
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I've made up my mind to get back to her.

96
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
There's something in the world.

97
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Hurry up.

98
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Hurry up.

99
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Hurry up.

100
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
You...

101
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Xuan Yi,

102
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Xuan Yi.

105
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Chi Xu, what's wrong?

106
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
The End

108
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Xuan Yi,

109
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
she doesn't want to say anything.

110
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,400
There's no relevant information in the White Demon's Manor.

111
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
But I can feel that this demon can't be saved.

112
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Did she die?

113
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I sealed her body's 8th grade.

114
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
If she breaks through the wall,

115
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
she will be hit by a heavy blow.

116
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
And I put a big fire before I left.

117
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
It's hard for her to escape.

118
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
She's still not stable.

119
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
You should have killed her.

120
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
We were in a mutual agreement.

121
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
If I killed her, I wouldn't be able to survive.

122
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Time is still too short.

123
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Why don't we fight with fire?

124
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
One more time.

125
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
This magic spell has a huge effect on the spirit.

126
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
It's very scary.

127
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
And she must be prepared now.

128
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
If we try again,

129
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
we might fall into her trap.

130
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I wonder if she's back in half an hour.

131
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Why did you mention her again?

132
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Because I'm hungry.

133
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
I didn't eat today.

134
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I was with that demon for a long time.

135
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm starving.

136
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Can't you eat the steamed buns?

137
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
No, I can't.

138
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm sad.

139
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Sad?

140
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Where did she go?

141
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
What did she buy today?

142
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Qiao Qiao told you

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
she didn't let me tell you.

144
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
She bought a water bottle.

145
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Why would she buy a water bottle?

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
She wouldn't use it.

147
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
She would use it.

148
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I taught her magic.

149
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
What's the problem?

150
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Wait.

151
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
We went to the East Market.

152
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Why did you come here?

153
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm already hungry.

154
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
And if we don't go back,

155
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
it's dark.

156
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
How about we go?

157
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Wait a minute.

158
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Wait a minute.

159
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Did my dad tell you

160
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
about my situation

161
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
when you were together?

162
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
He told me.

163
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Your dad said

164
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
you're a good teacher.

165
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You're gentle and virtuous.

166
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Although you're two years younger than me,

167
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
you're not as good as me.

168
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
He even said eight times

169
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
that we're very close.

170
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
We're a good couple.

171
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
He also said

172
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
we'll be together

173
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
when we get married.

174
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
That's all.

175
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I didn't mean that.

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
My left eye.

177
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
You mean your right eye?

178
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Uncle said the same.

179
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
No, you don't mind?

180
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm not that stupid.

181
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
There's no reason

182
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
for us to be sick

183
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
in a life-long relationship.

184
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
We can't do that.

185
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Of course, I understand.

186
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
You're a girl.

187
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
You have a lot of burden.

188
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
But don't worry.

189
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I'll take care of you.

190
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
And I won't give up.

191
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm not sick.

192
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm not sick.

193
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
What I see

194
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
is true.

195
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
There's really something in this world.

196
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
You think about it.

197
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
No one will come back to life.

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
My dad was taken away by the demons.

199
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I've been following Guangping from Nanyang

200
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
along the way.

201
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Although I had a high-ranking assistant,

202
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I also saved them

203
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
in a hurry.

204
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
There will be a second time

205
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
for this kind of thing.

206
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
There will be a third time for the second time.

207
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
You'll get married with me in the future.

208
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Aren't you afraid

209
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
that the demon will take you away one day?

210
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
They said

211
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
your illness has been cured.

212
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
They're so ridiculous.

213
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
But it's okay.

214
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm willing to be with you

215
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
in the future.

216
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I won't be disbanded because of this.

217
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
I knew it.

218
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
It's good.

219
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Take it.

220
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
The hair is so beautiful.

221
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
My dad is so beautiful.

222
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
My mom is so beautiful.

223
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
I'm so jealous.

224
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm so jealous.

225
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Close your eyes.

226
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
What are you doing?

227
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
What are you doing?

228
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I know I'm good.

229
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
But

230
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
we can't do this now.

231
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Because we're not good at talking to men and women.

232
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
And you haven't passed the door yet.

233
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Close your mouth.

234
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Okay.

235
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Okay.

236
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Move.

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Come on.

238
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Okay.

239
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Wait.

240
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Zhou Yan.

241
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Zhou Yan.

242
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Zhou Yan.

243
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Look over there.

244
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
What are you doing?

245
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Nothing.

246
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
What?

247
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Nothing.

248
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Nothing.

249
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Wait.

250
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Come on.

251
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Wait.

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Wait.

253
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Wait.

254
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I don't know what you're doing.

255
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
I don't know what you want to prove.

256
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
But I think

257
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
there are other ways to solve it.

258
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Wait.

259
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Okay.

260
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Wait.

261
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Hold it.

262
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I can't use it.

263
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
No.

264
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Zhou Yan is so great.

265
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
No.

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
You have to open your eyes.

267
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm so scared.

268
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
No.

269
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
You have to open your eyes.

270
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Open your eyes.

271
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Open your eyes.

272
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Open your eyes.

273
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Open your eyes.

274
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Look.

275
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Look.

276
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
See?

277
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Can we see the view now?

278
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Is the door so high?

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Can't you see it?

280
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
What?

281
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
No.

282
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Hold it.

283
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Hold it.

284
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
We've succeeded in the last time.

285
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I see it.

286
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I see it.

287
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
I see it.

288
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Here.

289
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Here.

290
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I see it, Ban Xia.

291
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Ban Xia.

292
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I see it.

293
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
There.

294
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
There, right?

295
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
It's what you want to show me.

296
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
It's everywhere.

297
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
It's too heavy.

298
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
It's done.

299
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Come on.

300
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Zhou Yan.

301
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Zhou Yan.

302
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Hold it.

303
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Come back.

304
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Come back.

305
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
You hold it.

306
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Hold it.

307
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Fish.

308
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
It's a demon.

309
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
The fish is coming.

310
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Miss.

311
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Miss, why are you back?

312
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
The master and the madam are in a bad mood.

313
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Master.

314
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Master.

315
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
This...

316
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Miss.

317
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
What's wrong with my master?

318
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
He fainted.

319
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
He fainted.

320
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Master, wake up.

321
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Master.

322
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Master.

323
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Master.

324
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Master.

325
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Master.

326
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Master.

327
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Master.

328
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Wake up.

329
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Master.

330
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Master.

331
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Where did you take him, Miss?

332
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
He's gone to the hospital.

333
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Your master has been shocked today.

334
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Take him to get some medicine for the body.

335
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
You used the perfume?

336
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
You should know how terrible the demon is.

337
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Why did you steal it from him?

338
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Aren't you afraid of any trouble?

339
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Didn't you steal it from me too?

340
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm different.

341
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
What's different?

342
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
I can see the demon.

343
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
He's going to marry a woman who can see the demon.

344
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Do you think I'm going to hide it from him forever?

345
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
If a person doesn't know what his own background is,

346
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
doesn't know what he's facing,

347
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
and how to make the decision to obey the law,

348
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
if I keep it from him,

349
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
that means I have to take away his right to make the decision.

350
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
It's not fair to him.

351
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Sometimes, you see him stealing,

352
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
and you hurt yourself.

353
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Do you really think this is good for him?

354
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
What about you?

355
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
If you do this,

356
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
do you really think it's good for me?

357
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
At least I'm better than you.

358
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
You didn't give me the right to make the decision.

359
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Miss, you said something really good just now.

360
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
What?

361
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,400
If a person doesn't know what his own background is,

362
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
and doesn't know what he's facing,

363
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
he can't make the decision to obey the law.

364
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
What's good about it?

365
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I think it's good.

366
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Sir, you're really good at talking.

367
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
I haven't heard such a beautiful tune in a long time.

368
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I want to try it.

369
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,400
It's a pity that I haven't played it for a long time.

370
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I've already played it for a long time.

371
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
And my makeup is all day long.

372
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
It's so dark and hard.

373
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
How can I play it?

374
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I'm not sure.

375
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
What's wrong with that tune?

376
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Then look at your own hands.

377
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Is it the same as before?

378
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Try it.

379
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Old Zhang, have you seen this woman?

381
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I've seen her before.

382
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Think about it again.

383
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I've indeed seen her.

384
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
She's a dancer.

385
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
She's from Shandu City.

386
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
If you want to find someone,

387
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
you can go to Shandu to see her.

388
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,400
You can get some money.

389
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Thank you.

390
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
You're welcome.

391
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Excuse me.

392
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Have you seen this woman?

393
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I haven't.

394
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Is this the woman?

395
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
She's just a man who's not supposed to be dressed.

396
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Is that the woman?

397
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Si Ma Ling.

398
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Si Ma Ling.

399
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Si Ma Ling, what's wrong?

400
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
What's wrong with you?

401
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
What's wrong with you?

402
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
You...

403
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
You...

404
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Si Ma Ling.

405
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Miss, you're awake.

406
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
She's here again.

407
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
She's waiting for you in the front hall.

408
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
She's here again?

409
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
She's not only here,

410
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
but she's also here with a sick patient.

411
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Her eyes are all covered in blood.

412
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
She's like a heavy shoe.

413
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
She's so scary.

414
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Why are you staring at me?

415
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Yes, I was in a daze yesterday.

416
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
But I didn't expect you to be so timid.

417
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
I was so dizzy.

418
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
But I'm sure I didn't mean it.

419
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I just wanted you to see it clearly.

420
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Don't make a mistake and get married.

421
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
In the future...

422
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
In the future,

423
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll be more respectful to you.

424
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I thought

425
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
you were righteous.

426
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
I didn't expect that I was a real sick person.

427
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I was so nervous.

428
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I was so sick.

429
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I was so ignorant.

430
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I thought I was a real sick person.

431
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I was so careful.

432
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Luckily,

433
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
you were there.

434
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
I knew there was a demon

435
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
in this world.

436
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Aren't you afraid?

437
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Of course not.

438
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
But you were dizzy.

439
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I was so excited.

440
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
To be honest,

441
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I didn't believe

442
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
you'd wake up this morning.

443
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I thought it was a dream.

444
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I only knew that

445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
you were real

446
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
when you asked me about your husband.

447
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
What?

448
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
What do you mean?

449
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
There are many kinds of demons in this world.

450
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Not all demons

451
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
are like the fish

452
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
that was caught yesterday.

453
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
They are kind and kind.

454
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
They often draw human-like

455
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
and hide in the crowd.

456
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
While you're not careful,

457
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
you'll be pulled out of your skin,

458
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
and your bones will be torn.

459
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
You'll be in trouble.

460
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Really?

461
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
That means

462
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
those foxes in the painting

463
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
are real?

464
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Wan Xia,

465
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
have you ever seen them?

466
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
They can really

467
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
speak and sing well.

468
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Wait a minute.

469
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
I've prepared the pen.

470
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
I need to remember the record.

471
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
I need to read the legend.

472
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
I'll be back.

473
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Sima Ling.

474
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Master,

475
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
can you be a little bit slower?

476
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay.

477
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Hold on.

478
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
When we arrive at Guangping City,

479
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Xuan Ye will find a way to save you.

480
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Hold on, okay?

481
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I'll be back.

482
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Okay.

483
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Huang.

484
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Hello.

485
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Have you ever seen this name?

486
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Let me see.

487
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I really don't know.

488
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
No?

489
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Please.

490
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Xuan Ye,

491
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I heard that

492
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
the line of the letter

493
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
of Zhang Bu's wife

494
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
was indeed not right.

495
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Why not?

496
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Do you remember the Lü San Lang

497
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
who fell in front of the door

498
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
two days ago?

499
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I do.

500
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
The man was greedy and was greedy.

501
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
He was even more innocent.

502
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
When Zhang Bu was there,

503
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
he didn't dare to disturb the stars.

504
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
But when Zhang Bu died,

505
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
he was so jealous

506
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
that he was bullied by the world.

507
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I don't know

508
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
if he was a good man

509
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
or a bad man.

510
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Who told you that?

511
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
The neighbors know.

512
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
What a coincidence.

513
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Zhang Bu often beat the stars

514
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
and finally left the world.

515
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Lü San Lang played the star

516
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
and broke his neck.

517
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Finally, the stars

518
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
died in a strange way.

519
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
The body was also missing.

520
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Any other clues?

521
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
No.

522
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Although Zhang Bu and Lü San Lang

523
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
are both criminals,

524
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
they are not familiar with each other.

525
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
They didn't have much contact before.

526
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
They didn't have any

527
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
common place.

528
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
For example,

529
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
people who know each other

530
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
or often go to the same place.

531
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
But I heard from the neighbors

532
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
that they all love to drink.

533
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
They are all the guests

534
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
of Liu Shui Xuan.

535
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
As long as they make money,

536
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
they will go to the flower shop.

537
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Let's go.

538
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Ban Jia.

539
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
What kind of rain is that?

540
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Is there a demon on the street?

541
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Can the demon be used again?

542
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm telling you,

543
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
the marriage is definitely a retreat.

544
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
The person I like

545
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
is not you.

546
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
If you lose it,

547
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
you should get the marriage back.

548
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
We all look good in the face.

549
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
If you don't lose it,

550
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
don't blame me.

551
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I'll be in trouble.

552
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Did you hear that?

553
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Mr. Bai.

554
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Mr. Liu Bu.

555
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Sorry to bother you.

556
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm new here.

557
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
I just heard that

558
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
you are a criminal.

559
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
What's your problem?

560
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
You know the person who knows Qin.

561
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Yes.

562
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
The song that you just sang

563
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
is very ordinary,

564
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
but it's hard to express.

565
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
I can't handle it.

566
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
I lost the meaning of giving it to someone else.

567
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
I don't know what you think

568
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
when you heard it.

569
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Good.

570
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Someone is different from the others.

571
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
It's in the middle of Qin.

572
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Even Wan Yu Yao

573
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
can't tell the difference

574
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
between the song that you sang

575
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
and the song that you sang.

576
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
You are afraid that you are listening to Qin.

577
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Or you don't understand the melody at all.

578
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
What's the meaning of the song?

579
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
You can't just say it.

580
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Mr. Bai.

581
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I won't let you

582
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
do that thing.

583
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Xuanyi.

584
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Don't.

585
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Xuanyi, where are you going?

586
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Xuanyi.

587
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Come, have a look.

588
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I know.

589
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
I guess he is a demon.

590
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Since you don't want to

591
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
tell me what you see,

592
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I better go to the school.

593
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
After you go to the school,

594
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
what are you going to do?

595
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
That's my business.

596
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
He didn't do anything.

597
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Why did you kill him?

598
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
I said I was going to kill him.

599
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
And how do you know

600
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
he didn't do anything?

601
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I was injured.

602
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I couldn't stop the evil that I wanted.

603
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
How did you distinguish?

604
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
You two are talking about...

605
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
You know him?

606
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Take me to see him.

607
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Okay.

608
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Brother Jiu, this is the place.

609
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Mr. Bai is a good singer.

610
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
But he is sweet and lively.

611
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
He is not happy.

612
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
If he wants to go to Chengdu,

613
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
put it down.

614
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Mr. Bai.

615
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
These two are my friends.

616
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
They are good friends.

617
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
They are also very good friends with Mr. Bai.

618
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
So I came here today to visit them.

619
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
I didn't expect that Mr. Gua would be

620
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
such a good singer.

621
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I am really surprised.

622
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I am not a good singer.

623
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
So I know that I am not good at singing.

624
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Mr. Bai is modest.

625
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I heard Mr. Bai's voice today.

626
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I am really surprised.

627
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I don't know if I am

628
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
confident in my voice.

629
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I can listen to it again.

630
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I remember that you don't know English.

631
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Yes, I don't.

632
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
But beauty is always

633
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
a good thing for people.

634
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
I go to Liu Shixuan every month to talk about

635
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
the seven days.

636
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
If you want to listen to it,

637
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
why don't you go to Liu Shixuan?

638
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I want to listen to it now.

639
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Mr. Bai, I want to listen to it too.

640
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Otherwise, you will be in English.

641
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
The temple.

642
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
The temple.

643
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,400
I can hear the beauty of a woman from it.

644
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
It's amazing.

645
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Maybe I was wrong.

646
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Yes, there is no such thing in this world.

647
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I care about her.

648
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,400
No, I just think she is not like a bad person.

649
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
And Li Xian also said that

650
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
she is a famous piano master.

651
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Yes, absolutely.

652
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
You still don't understand.

653
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Why?

654
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I always said that people have different waist.

655
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Not only that, it's just that the weight is different.

656
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,400
But it means that the length, the ability, the size, the power.

657
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,400
These are all destined to be different from the waist.

658
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
The evil people think in the world of waist,

659
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
it is very possible that it is not enough to be found again.

660
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,400
And the thing people are doing is also very possible.

661
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
It is the waist that they like.

662
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,400
So, the standard of the mountaineering is different.

663
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,400
It is decided that the result of the people and the waist is always the same.

664
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Xia, if you don't understand this,

665
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
you will be hurt by the waist sooner or later.

666
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Then you can't talk about it all at once.

667
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,400
The appointment of the waist group and the necessary appointment.

668
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,400
It is also a matter of time before the person who is hurt or the victim is taken away from the world.

669
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
What wrong have I done?

670
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,400
I just don't think so.

671
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Can't people and the waist be equal?

672
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Then you still have to keep the blood on your side.

673
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
I'm different.

674
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Well, let me check.

675
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Are you talking about Mr. Bai as a demon?

676
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
No wonder.

677
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
I always wondered why his Qin Yin

678
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
is so social and so different from others.

679
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,400
If he is a demon, then everything is connected.

680
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
What else?

681
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Did you forget your mother and forgot to eat and wear?

682
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Did you forget the waist that your parents had been separated for more than ten years

683
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
and finally disappeared?

684
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
You can forgive all these.

685
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
I don't know what to ask.

686
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Fan Xia, you told me that you wanted to get married to me

687
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,400
because you liked someone in your heart.

688
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Is that person Mr. Jiu?

689
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
It's true.

690
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Then I...

691
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Your eyes are really not wrong.

692
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Mr. Jiu, look.

693
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I'm so proud of you.

694
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
My fiancee and your loyalism.

695
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Your charm is really a good friend.

696
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
We are very close friends.

697
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
We should be close friends.

698
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
You didn't listen to me before.

699
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
What are you talking about?

700
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Who is your fiancee?

701
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Stop talking.

702
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Why is he angry?

703
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I should be the one who is angry.

704
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Mr. Jiu.

705
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Mr. Jiu.

706
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
I'm not really angry.

707
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Mr. Jiu, wait for me.

708
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Sir.

709
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
I think that person is from the government.

710
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,400
He came to me about what happened to Zhang Bu.

711
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,400
The government doesn't have such a high-ranking person.

712
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
High-ranking?

713
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,400
I'm afraid he has already seen through my bottom line.

714
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
What should we do?

715
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
We don't need to be afraid of him.

716
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,400
But if he connects these cases with each other recently

717
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
there will be some trouble.

718
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
How about this?

719
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
In the next few days

720
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
you will go to the waterfront for me.

721
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Me?

722
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
They will not be willing to work on it.

723
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
They will be on the first day.

724
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I will use my spiritual power to make you look like me.

725
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
But magic can only last for two hours.

726
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
You are human.

727
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
They can't help you.

728
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Xueyan.

729
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Xueyan.

730
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
What's wrong?

731
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
As you said, I found a spiritual power near the capital.

732
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
You can save him.

733
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
When I saw him in the waterfront

734
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
he fainted.

735
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
He said he had a fever.

736
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
How is he now?

737
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
You can go out first.

738
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
You go out first.

739
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
I will go out too.

740
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
You?

741
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Close the door.

742
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Okay.

743
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Don't be sad.

744
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
You still have to be a doctor.

745
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
How did you get it?

746
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
You are a doctor.

747
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
You should treat the patient with a little care.

748
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Tell me.

749
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
How did you get the medicine?

750
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
I want to hear the details.

751
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I was in the capital,

752
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
and I ran into a monster.

753
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I was in a conflict with him.

754
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
He was very hot.

755
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
I forgot what he was doing.

756
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
I was thirsty.

757
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I couldn't get water.

758
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
What's wrong?

759
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Xuan Ye said his spirit is trapped by the monster.

760
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I went across the way of the spirit.

761
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
I looked for it.

762
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I found it on the road to the underground tunnel.

763
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Why are you going far away near the capital?

764
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
The monster must have found Xuan Ye.

765
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
He was in the middle of nowhere.

766
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I am not going far.

767
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I am not going far away.

768
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
I am going to find Xuan Ye.

769
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
The monster must have found Xuan Ye.

770
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
The usual doctor can't cure him.

771
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
If I send him back to the capital,

772
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
if the monster comes after him,

773
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
how can I deal with it?

774
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Yes.

775
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
You are quite delicate.

776
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
I am delicate?

777
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
I used the oil from the yellow-brown.

778
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
I didn't want to steal your monster.

779
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
But...

780
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I underestimated him in the last part of your life.

781
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
What happened next?

782
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
He got rid of the oil.

783
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
I knew you.

784
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
So I forced you to do the trick.

785
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
He came for you.

786
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
I implicated you.

787
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Sorry.

788
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
What did you implicated?

789
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
You saved my life.

790
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Besides,

791
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
you saved the life of the yellow-brown.

792
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
I will solve this matter as soon as possible.

793
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
But you must be careful.

794
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
That monster is very powerful.

795
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
He must not be in danger.

796
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
I know.

797
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
I know you are used to it.

798
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
But some things can't be forced.

799
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
If you don't come,

800
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,400
I can ask people from the Yama to help.

801
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
I will take your kindness.

802
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
No need.

803
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Fine.

804
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Since you have a good will,

805
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
you will be recognized as a person.

806
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Help me.

807
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Okay.

808
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Come in.

809
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
How is he?

810
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
He is poisoned.

811
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
He needs oxygen to be neutralized.

812
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
He needs to be treated for 21 days.

813
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
He needs to be treated for 21 days.

814
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
The best is that he doesn't leave the village.

815
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
He needs to be treated for 21 days.

816
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
He needs to be treated for 21 days.

817
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
And he is poisoned.

818
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Yes.

819
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I also know him.

820
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
I know him.

821
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Is there any other way to detoxify him?

822
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
No.

823
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
I can't take care of him.

824
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
You can take him home.

825
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Me?

826
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
I told you.

827
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
I can't take care of him.

828
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Come.

829
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Come.

830
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Thank you.

831
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Can I really do it?

832
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
It's not a matter of time.

833
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
You can't do it.

834
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Remember.

835
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
The magic can last for two hours.

836
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Be careful.

837
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Mr. Bai.

838
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
You are here early today.

839
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Please.

840
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Please.

841
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Mr. Bai.

842
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
We almost reach the end of our relationship.

843
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Now it's time for情.

844
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Be carefull.

845
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
I will love you.

846
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Be carefull.

847
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
I broke the record.

848
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
What happened?

849
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
ITS YOUR TUR Hertz?

850
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I got an idea.

851
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Do you choose Chinese-style?

852
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
Sure.

853
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Success or failure?

854
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Your Vulcan.

855
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Apologies to the anhp탈s for pushing me away.

856
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,880
