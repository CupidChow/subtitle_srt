1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
24. I really don't fix up tons of things.

2
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,700
The King of Blaze

3
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,700
The King of Blaze

4
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Episode 16

5
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,700
The King of Blaze

6
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
There's no one here.

7
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Let's go over there.

8
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Over there.

9
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Over there.

10
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
There's no one.

11
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
Over there.

12
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Here.

13
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
What's wrong?

14
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
There are many puppets in the yard.

15
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,700
But I've already hidden myself.

16
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
Don't go out yet.

17
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Everyone's here.

18
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Can you walk faster?

19
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
I can.

20
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
We can't stay here for long.

21
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Feng Wu Niang has escaped.

22
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Let's go down the mountain as soon as possible.

23
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Everyone, be careful.

24
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
The shopkeeper is missing.

25
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Put it down.

26
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,700
I'll go back and find him.

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
No need.

28
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,700
He's Wu Niang's father.

29
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Wu Niang will definitely not hurt him.

30
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
What?

31
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Did I say something wrong?

32
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,700
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Let's go.

37
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
No.

38
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,700
You're right.

39
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Anxia.

40
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
The bodyguard I drew on your hand before,

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
why is it gone?

42
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
You guys go first.

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Wu Niang.

44
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Wu Niang.

45
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Wu Niang.

46
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
Wu Niang.

47
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Wu Niang.

48
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Wu Niang.

49
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Wu Niang!

50
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Wu Niang!

51
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm...

52
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,980
Seniors

53
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Miss

54
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,700
I'm not sure if you killed him.

55
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,700
No. Why do you seem to want me dead?

56
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Fine. I'll kill one of them.

57
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
I'll make you do as you wish.

58
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Father, do you really know me?

59
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Father, I'm sorry.

60
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Father, you found me.

61
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
You are...

62
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
It's me, father.

63
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
You can't recognize me?

64
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Have I become prettier?

65
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
I've been struggling for so many years.

66
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
I finally got a perfect me.

67
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
It's not easy.

68
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Why did you break it?

69
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
I'll show you more clearly.

70
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Why did you kill so many people?

71
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
What's wrong with killing people?

72
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
But they are innocent!

73
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I...

74
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
I...

75
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
I...

76
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
I...

77
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,700
I...

78
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
I...

79
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
I...

80
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Are you going to hit me again?

81
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm the innocent one.

82
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
You made me out of nothing,

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
but you don't like me.

84
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,700
You look at me with a hateful look.

85
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Do you hate me?

86
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Do you hate me for not letting you go home?

87
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Mother, I left you here

88
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
to protect you better.

89
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
I didn't want you to be looked down upon by others.

90
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I wanted you to live well.

91
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Do you really want me to live well?

92
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,700
You always tell others that I'm sick and rude.

93
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
You never understand me.

94
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
I can become better.

95
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,700
I have so many eyes, nose, and mouth.

96
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
But why?

97
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Why can't I find a daughter you want?

98
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Daughter!

99
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
I'll take you away from here.

100
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
You can go wherever you want.

101
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,700
From now on, I don't care about anything you do.

102
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
As long as you don't hurt others.

103
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Okay?

104
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
You're not my father anymore.

105
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,700
From now on, I don't care about you.

106
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm going to find my own life.

107
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Banxia!

108
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Banxia!

109
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Hey! Hey! Hey!

110
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Banxia!

111
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Xuanye, I'm here.

112
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Xuanye!

113
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
He stole my sword.

114
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
You turned into me first.

115
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
He's the one who did this to me.

116
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
He's too cunning. Don't believe him.

117
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Xuanye!

118
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Banxia!

119
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
You have no taste.

120
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Actually, I'm much stronger than him.

121
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
You...

122
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
You could have died alone.

123
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
You had to fight.

124
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Now I'm better.

125
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
That's good.

126
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Both of us have to die here.

127
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Don't say that too much.

128
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Who died here doesn't know yet.

129
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Young Master.

130
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I didn't mean to make things difficult for you.

131
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
I even think we're a good match.

132
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
You're so handsome.

133
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
I'm so beautiful.

134
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,700
How about we think about it again?

135
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
What is true?

136
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
What is false?

137
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Let me accompany you.

138
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I can do whatever he can.

139
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
If one day,

140
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
you don't like this face,

141
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
and you get tired of this person,

142
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
I'll change to something else to accompany you.

143
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
Isn't that good?

144
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Fake things are fake.

145
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Stop dreaming.

146
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I'm not a fake.

147
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I'm not a fake.

148
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
I'm not a fake.

149
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
If that's the case,

150
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
why are you so addicted to the white-eyed?

151
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Are you surprised?

152
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Everything in this inn

153
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
can't escape my eyes.

154
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
I've been drunk for a long time,

155
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
but someone still wants to be drunk.

156
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
You know everything is fake,

157
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
but you still want to be warm.

158
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Ninth Prince,

159
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
is this real or fake?

160
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Actually, you want something simple.

161
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
I can give you anything.

162
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
I want a family.

163
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I can be your family.

164
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Isn't that a hundred times better than the white-eyed?

165
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Family can never be replaced.

166
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Fake things can't be real.

167
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
You don't know what family is.

168
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Mother,

169
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
you are fake.

170
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
You are a vicious person.

171
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
You can be a person in the next life.

172
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Shut up!

173
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
As long as you die,

174
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
I'll be real.

175
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Mother!

176
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
Mother!

177
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
What is real and what is fake?

178
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
I'll tell you now.

179
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
For you,

180
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,700
the shell of the Golden Pond is fake.

181
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
And the inside is already

182
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
distorted and distorted.

183
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
You talk too much.

184
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Today, I'll use your blood

185
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
to kill the snake.

186
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Mother!

187
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Mother!

188
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Li Huo!

189
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Li Huo!

190
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Li Huo!

191
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Li Huo!

192
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Are you still going to do this?

193
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
She is my daughter!

194
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Please don't hurt her!

195
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Please,

196
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
let me take her away.

197
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Please don't hurt her.

198
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Thank you.

199
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Daughter,

200
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
You are right.

202
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
I shouldn't have

203
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
put you here alone.

204
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
I shouldn't have

205
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
brought you home.

206
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
I was wrong.

207
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
I was wrong.

208
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Can you forgive me?

209
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
I'll take you home

210
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
and see your grandfather,

211
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
grandmother, uncle, and aunt.

212
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
We'll plant another

213
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
orange tree

214
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
and raise a big yellow dog with you.

215
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
I'll always be with you.

216
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Okay?

217
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Okay.

218
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Father.

219
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Yes?

220
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
All of this is about to happen.

221
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Yes. Yes.

222
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
We just need to get rid of them.

223
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
You can't kill anyone anymore!

224
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
You can't kill anyone anymore!

225
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Li Huo!

226
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Daughter!

227
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
I'm here to take you home!

228
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm here to take you home!

229
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Why are you guys

230
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
stopping me?

231
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
What?

232
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Go away!

233
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,700
I don't want to die!

234
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Go away!

235
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
Go away!

236
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Go away!

237
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
What is Jiuming doing?

238
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Is he going to save Feng Tian?

239
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
This should be

240
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Jiuming's last life.

241
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Is it worth it?

242
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
In order to save Feng Tian,

243
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
the demon has ended his own life.

244
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
Maybe

245
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
he feels it's meaningful.

246
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
I don't know.

247
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Where am I?

248
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Am I still alive?

249
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Because

250
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
he doesn't want you to die.

251
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
In this world,

252
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
there are always people

253
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
who are like water and peace,

254
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
who are willing to die.

255
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
But in this world,

256
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
there are people who are like water and peace,

257
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
who are willing to die.

258
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
But in the eyes of the people

259
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
who really care about him,

260
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
his safety is more important than his life.

261
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Why?

262
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
For some living beings,

263
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
repaying kindness

264
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
can make a life

265
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
or even give up a life.

266
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Jiuming,

267
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
I remember now.

268
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
That was the most

269
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
cruel year of the plague.

270
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
My sheep died.

271
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
The grain in the stable

272
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
was cut off.

273
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
I was so hungry that day.

274
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Why are you looking at me?

275
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
Stop looking.

276
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Stop looking.

277
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
I didn't eat.

278
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Maybe I thought the cat was too skinny.

279
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,700
I couldn't stop eating.

280
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
I finally

281
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
had a piece of bacon.

282
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
I'll share it with you.

283
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Eat slowly.

284
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Don't worry.

285
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
That's the Central Plains

286
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
in the desert.

287
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
That's my home.

288
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
I don't know

289
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
how my parents are doing.

290
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
How are they doing?

291
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Your cat

292
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
is quite human.

293
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
With your company,

294
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
I'm not alone.

295
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I'll give you a name, okay?

296
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
I'll call you

297
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Jiuming.

298
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
Jiuming.

299
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Jiuming.

300
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
At one point,

301
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
we were together every day.

302
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Until one day,

303
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
a strange person came.

304
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
He saw me alone.

305
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
He felt sorry for me.

306
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
He taught me

307
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
how to make puppets.

308
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
I made

309
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Wu Niang and Qingshan.

310
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
But one day,

311
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I suddenly found

312
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,700
that they had their own consciousness.

313
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
It seemed

314
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
that they had become

315
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
the same person.

316
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
But after that,

317
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I never saw him again.

318
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
I thought

319
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
he had left.

320
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
He didn't leave.

321
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
He was always by your side.

322
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
But your sight

323
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
was occupied by something else.

324
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
You couldn't see him.

325
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
You were right.

326
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
When you came back,

327
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
he followed you.

328
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
He wanted to get close to you,

329
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
but he was driven away by Wu Niang.

330
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
He hid in the forest

331
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
because he had nowhere to go.

332
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Although he got the spirit,

333
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
he didn't get the chance

334
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,700
to transform.

335
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,700
He couldn't tell you all this.

336
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
He saw you

337
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
getting lost

338
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
and he was in a mess.

339
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
He brought us to the Taoyuan Inn

340
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
because he wanted us

341
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
to take you away.

342
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
To kill me?

343
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
He was a cat demon.

344
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
He had nine lives.

345
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
What about him?

346
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
He had gone through many hardships

347
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
and tried his best.

348
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
The last life

349
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
was on you.

350
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
He sacrificed his life

351
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
to bring us here

352
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
so that you could leave the inn.

353
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
So,

354
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
I hope you can

355
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
feel sorry for him.

356
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
The Taoyuan Inn.

357
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
I thought

358
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
we could spend our lives

359
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
here

360
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
and give Wu Niang and Qingshan

361
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
a peaceful death.

362
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,700
But I didn't expect

363
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
this place would become our prison.

364
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
I don't want to face

365
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
the fact that

366
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
I've changed.

367
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
That's why I'm so miserable.

368
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Manager Feng Tian,

369
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Jiuming's most important hope

370
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
is that you can get back up.

371
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
He never forgets

372
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
kindness and kindness.

373
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Love is not wrong,

374
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
but it can't be blind.

375
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Xuanye, when did you

376
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
know that there was someone

377
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
other than the cat demon in the Taoyuan Inn?

378
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
When I was looking for the beads,

379
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
I saw something strange in the pool.

380
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
So you knew it so early.

381
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,700
So you prepared it

382
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
and secretly contacted

383
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
You Huang and Jiuming.

384
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
And asked me to help you

385
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
to get Wu Niang out.

386
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Banxia, I'm going to

387
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
make the demon out of the weak.

388
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Thank you.

389
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
You're acting like it.

390
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
I'm not acting. I'm really scared.

391
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
How did you convince my brother?

392
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Actually, drinking the white wine

393
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
won't completely lose your mind.

394
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
As long as you're strong enough,

395
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
you can still tell the truth.

396
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Your brother is obsessed with business

397
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
and obsessed with the right thing.

398
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
He's here to wake him up

399
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
because he has nothing more important.

400
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
Banxia is in danger. Help us.

401
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
So that's how it is.

402
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Wu Niang said you didn't drink the white wine.

403
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
So you lied to him.

404
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
So you said you drink that wine every day.

405
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
You're lying, right?

406
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
Okay, it's stopped raining.

407
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Let's go to the botanical garden.

408
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Let's go.

409
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Thank you.

410
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
Thank you.

411
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
This is it.

412
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
Dr. Xiu,

413
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
come on, come on.

414
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
What are we eating today?

415
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Two potatos,

416
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
one glutinous rice lotus root,

417
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
one purple sweet potato, one beef bun,

418
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
and two spicy melon.

419
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
Do you have anything else to add?

420
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
No, it's enough.

421
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,700
That's all.

422
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
We're a little hungry.

423
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Hurry up.

424
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Dr. Xiu,

425
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
this is the first time you've brought a girl to my place to eat.

426
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Let's go.

427
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Miss,

428
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
how old are you?

429
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Where is your home?

430
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
My home is in Nanyang.

431
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
I just moved to Guangping.

432
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
You just moved? Where do you live?

433
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
I live in the eastmost building

434
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
on Sifang Street.

435
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Isn't that next to Ganshan Hall?

436
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Miss, are you married?

437
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Uncle Wu, go back to work.

438
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Wait a minute.

439
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
You look familiar with this shopkeeper.

440
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Do you come here often?

441
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
I gave her

442
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
an allergy to food. We've known each other for a long time.

443
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,700
Here, drink some water.

444
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
So what is this?

445
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,700
It's a magical weapon.

446
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
A magical weapon?

447
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
It's for protecting your body.

448
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,700
Is it related to your waist?

449
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
My father never told me about it.

450
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
Do you rub it every day

451
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
so that it doesn't fall off?

452
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,700
Do I have to?

453
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
It's for smelling.

454
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
It won't fall off.

455
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
Here's your hotpot.

456
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
That's a lot.

457
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,700
We're old shopkeepers.

458
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,700
We're not that picky.

459
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
I don't think it's enough.

460
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
What's this?

461
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
We didn't order it, did we?

462
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
This is a honey cake.

463
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Our boss gave it to us.

464
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
He said honey cake is made of honey and sesame oil.

465
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,700
It's good for your health.

466
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
You'll be able to enjoy it.

467
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Enjoy it.

468
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
Don't listen to him.

469
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Try it.

470
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
Do you want to try it?

471
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Okay.

472
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
I'll try it.

473
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
How did my father find the lifesaver?

474
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,700
I think your father found the lifesaver.

475
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,700
He heard the rumor that the lifesaver was dead.

476
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
He wanted to use the lifesaver to get rid of it.

477
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
But the lifesaver still found it.

478
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Don't worry.

479
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
We'll just look for clues.

480
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
I don't need your help.

481
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Don't worry.

482
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,700
What's wrong?

483
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
I stepped into the water.

484
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
I think I got my socks wet.

485
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
I'll carry you.

486
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
No, I can walk on my own.

487
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,700
You've been driving for so long.

488
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
You must be tired.

489
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Okay.

490
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Shanye.

491
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Do you like drinking?

492
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
If you like drinking,

493
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
I'll make you some sweet fruit wine.

494
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
You won't feel hot after drinking.

495
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Okay.

496
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
We've made a deal.

497
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
If you want to drink, come to me.

498
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,700
You can't drink alone.

499
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
You eat a lot tonight.

500
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Don't sleep too early.

501
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,700
You'll get hungry.

502
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Shanye.

503
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Can you draw me another mark?

504
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
I'm worried about that mark.

505
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
That life-saving mark is for saving lives.

506
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
If you use too much,

507
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
it will exhaust your energy.

508
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
So, if you have to,

509
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
don't use it.

510
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Do you understand?

511
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
I know.

512
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,700
I'm very careful when I use it.

513
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Okay.

514
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Why are your hands so cold?

515
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Are you not feeling well?

516
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
No.

517
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
It's raining tonight.

518
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
It must be cold at night.

519
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Remember to use a thick quilt.

520
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
I know.

521
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
I know.

522
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,700
I'll go back first.

523
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,700
Why did I have to do this again?

524
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
Erlang.

525
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
Why didn't you eat when you came back?

526
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Did you practice your kungfu again last night?

527
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
You didn't sleep well last night.

528
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
You even dreamed of fighting with someone.

529
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Brother, my name is Yang Feitang.

530
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
I feed Yuecheng a soup every month.

531
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
He's fat and strong.

532
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,700
He's a thousand years old.

533
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
He's three times more than before.

534
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Erlang, where's the mark?

535
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Who gave you the mark?

536
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,700
You won't admit it?

537
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Again.

538
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
You only know how to drink.

539
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Have you learned your kungfu?

540
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,700
You'll never remember it.

541
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
Come on.

542
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
I'll teach you again.

543
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Watch carefully.

544
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
I'll teach you again.

545
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Come on.

546
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,700
If you can fall asleep for a moment...

547
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Xianyin.

548
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Are you home?

549
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Xianyin.

550
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
I knew you'd come back today.

551
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Where did you go?

552
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,700
I went to Wenjian's house.

553
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
But the food Wenjian made was terrible.

554
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,700
I'm not full.

555
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
You went to get food and you picked so much food.

556
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,700
Xianyin, give me money.

557
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
I want to buy radishes.

558
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,700
No money?

559
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
I saw a big box of silver.

560
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
You saw it?

561
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
Then go find it yourself.

562
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
So much money.

563
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:46,700
One, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, nine.

564
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:42,700
One sword in the heart, one memory in the soul.

565
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:50,700
One year of yearning, one life.

566
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,740
The traces of the

567
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,700
The traces of the

568
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,700
The traces of the

569
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,700
The traces of the

570
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,700
The traces of the

571
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,700
The traces of the

572
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,700
