[Episode 26]

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,890
Let's hurry home.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,250
It's going to rain soon.

5
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,479
Banxia,

6
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,240
I have something to tell you.

7
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,840
Can't we talk

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,200
when we get home?

9
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,900
Let's go first.

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Let's end this here.

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,800
Do you

12
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,270
still want to continue to fish??

13
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,290
Go ahead. It's fine.

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,140
I'll just head home first.

15
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm serious.

16
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,280
Why?

17
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,310
Don't you like me a lot?

18
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,280
I do like you a lot.

19
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,740
You're kind and brave,

20
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
with a likable personality.

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,290
It's normal to like you.

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,910
But Banxia,

23
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,400
do you know?

24
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,550
There's an expiration date to liking someone.

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,079
I liked you a moment ago,

26
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,079
and I don't like you at this moment.

27
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,280
I thought you were adorable and straightforward yesterday,

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,430
but today I find you

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,720
particularly naggy

30
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,870
and troublesome.

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
When you were always around me

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
before,

33
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,640
I found it quite lively.

34
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,150
But now,

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,800
suddenly, there's a group of people

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,590
in your home.

37
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,000
When I think of

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,140
having to maintain relationships with so many people,

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,930
all those daily chores,

40
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,030
and the bickering and trivial matters,

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,360
I feel annoyed from the bottom of my heart.

42
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,560
I don't want to deal with them anymore.

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
I know

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,560
that everything you said is a lie.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
You made it all up.

46
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,710
I also know

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,150
that you're angry with me,

48
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,130
my father,

49
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,270
and Li Xian.

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,310
But I've also told you

51
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,470
I'll cancel this engagement.

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,030
And...

53
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,190
And my father has also promised me

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,430
that he'll break off the engagement as soon as possible.

55
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,000
Can you wait a little longer?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,660
It has nothing to do with this.

57
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,400
Then what is it about?

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,380
It's not that reason again, is it?

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,560
You think that because you're a demon hunter,

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
being with you

61
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,650
will put me in danger.

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,190
You can't protect me properly.

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,030
But I've told you

64
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,750
many times

65
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,350
that I don't care about that.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
But I do care.

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,150
Banxia,

68
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,240
how can you be so reckless?

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Do you know what I face

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,710
every day?

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,160
In this world,

72
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,450
there are many more dangerous and cunning demons

73
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,240
than just Chi Wangchuan,

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
Feng Wuniang,

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,360
and Moon-Fearing Demon.

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,390
They eat raw meat and drink blood,

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,040
driven by their bestial nature.

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,190
When they go berserk,

79
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,950
they don't even recognize themselves

80
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,410
or know what they've done.

81
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,560
They would even treat their closest kin

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,760
as food to devour.

83
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,830
How can you be sure

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,630
you won't encounter

85
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,920
these things I face every day in the future?

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,040
I won't.

87
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,490
You will protect me.

88
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,210
What if I can't protect you?

89
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,200
It's very likely

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,530
that you'll wake up one day and find

91
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm gone.

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,190
I might fall into someone else's trap.

93
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,950
I might

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,750
suddenly appear in the mountains,

95
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,630
or possibly

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,360
end up somewhere I can't see you

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
or protect you.

98
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
I can't even protect myself.

99
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
How can I protect you?

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't say such unpleasant things.

101
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,160
You're suddenly like this today.

102
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,120
Is it because my father

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,270
said something to you?

104
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,400
Don't listen to him.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,630
Banxia,

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
please stay away from me.

107
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,390
You shouldn't be with

108
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,560
a demon hunter.

109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,020
While we still have the chance

110
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,890
and can still turn back,

111
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,950
let's end it here,

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,400
okay?

113
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,830
I don't want to.

114
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,190
Banxia,

115
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,750
everything will pass.

116
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,220
In this world,

117
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,630
nothing lasts forever.

118
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,830
As time goes by,

119
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,270
feelings will fade,

120
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,560
or even disappear completely.

121
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,130
You just need some time.

122
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,930
After this period,

123
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,230
everything will be fine.

124
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,090
Why?

125
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,070
What makes you think

126
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,070
things will be fine after some time?

127
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,730
I came all this way to find you today,

128
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,420
because I was worried you might be unhappy.

129
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,600
I traveled such a long distance.

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,830
I searched for you for so long.

131
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,030
It's almost dark now.

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,510
After I finally arrived,

133
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,020
you started preaching to me,

134
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,800
without caring about my feelings,

135
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,750
trying to force me to believe what you said.

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,480
Why should I?

137
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,330
Jiu Xuanye, let me tell you,

138
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,770
it's true that you've done me a great favor,

139
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,360
but a relationship involves two people.

140
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,430
It's not up to you to do

141
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,510
whatever you want.

142
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,880
♫Melody echoes along the river; wild geese soar in sudden fright♫

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,040
♫The music ends, and I stand in solitude♫

144
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,909
♫I see you turn into a handful of starlight♫

145
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,220
♫Drifting past me♫

146

♫Crystallized into cold amber♫

148
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,720
♫I know it also brought you great pain to let go♫

149
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,120
♫But why did you♫

150
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,720
♫Still endure the pain and shatter?♫

155

165
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,000
Banxia.

166
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,750
Banxia.

167
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,700
Banxia.

168
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,360
Master.

169
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm bringing a bowl of ginger soup for her.

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
My Lady,

171
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,160
please have some ginger soup.

172
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm asleep. I don't want any.

173
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,030
Chi Xue.

174
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,070
Where's Xuanye?

175
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,480
He's sleeping.

176
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,450
What are you doing?

177
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,480
Looking for him.

178
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,760
He's not here.

179
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,120
Didn't you just say he was sleeping?

180
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,270
How come he's not here now?

181
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,840
Tell me first,

182
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,370
why are you looking for him?

183
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,000
There's a situation at Fa'en Temple.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
Youhuang sent me to find him.

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,370
Why didn't Youhuang come himself?

186
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,080
Youhuang is at Fa'en Temple.

187
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,470
You should have said so earlier.

188
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,470
Thank you for your trouble, Physician Jiu.

189
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,730
Where is the deceased?

190
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,390
Inside.

191
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,550
Since there's been a murder,

192
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,410
why haven't you cleared the area?

193
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,120
There are too many worshippers.

194
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,150
If we clear them out,

195
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,030
it will cause a commotion, and everyone will know.

196
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,200
Last time we caught the Mirror Demon,

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,600
we made too much of a fuss.

198
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,080
It caused the lord

199
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,390
to be reported by his colleagues.

200
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,120
Now we can only act discreetly.

201
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
You four stay outside.

202
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

203
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,510
The incense burning at Fa'en Temple

204
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,100
has always been quite brisk.

205
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,230
But for some reason,

206
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,670
in the past two years, rumor has it that

207
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,600
wishes made here

208
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,770
are especially easy

209
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,540
to come true.

210
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,670
Over time,

211
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,960
even worshippers from other places

212
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,620
have come here to make wishes.

213
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,800
There's a snake!

214
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,890
Don't be afraid of the snakes here.

215
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,120
They're all from the nearby mountains.

216
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
Everyone says the snakes at Fa'en Temple

217
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,260
understand the Buddhist teachings.

218
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,230
Big snakes don't come. Look,

219
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,150
they're all small snakes.

220
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,680
And they never harm people.

221
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,460
This further confirms

222
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,150
the notion that Fa'en Temple's Buddhist teachings are profound.

223
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,750
Everyone believes

224
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,150
it's an auspicious sign.

225
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,730
Let's go.

226
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,870
I've examined it.

227
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
It's not poisoning.

228
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,240
There are no fatal wounds.

229
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,420
I can't see any signs of illness either.

230
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,090
This morning, the temple

231
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,640
notified her husband's relatives,

232
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,910
who immediately rushed to the government office

233
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,870
to transfer the property deed.

234
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,870
That's when I found out she had died.

235
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,550
I think this matter is suspicious.

236
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,550
So I asked you to come and take a look.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,330
As for Zhang Pu's death,

238
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,960
Xingxian hasn't been cleared of suspicion yet.

239
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
Now Xingxian is dead too.

240
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,740
Can you determine the cause of death?

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,550
I can't tell just by examining like this.

242
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,680
I need to perform an autopsy to be sure.

243
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,480
I won't trouble you with the autopsy.

244
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,390
I just want you to check for me

245
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,410
whether this matter has anything to do with demons.

246
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,150
You're really once bitten,

247
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,620
twice shy, aren't you?

248
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,760
I've already investigated

249
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,910
three cases for you this month.

250
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,550
For every single case,

251
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,610
you claimed it was related to demons.

252
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,270
I need to rule out this factor first

253
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,960
before I can investigate normally.

254
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,270
If we investigate thoroughly

255
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,620
and it turns out to be the work of demons,

256
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,420
wouldn't our efforts be in vain?

257
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,120
Also,

258
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,030
her husband's relatives

259
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,430
are in a hurry to bury her.

260
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,330
If we can't produce evidence,

261
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,100
I can't hold onto the body

262
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,190
for a long time

263
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,930
without returning it to them.

264
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,270
My Lady,

265
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,270
Mr. Li just came by.

266
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,470
He heard you were ill

267
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,480
and wanted to come to the back courtyard for a visit,

268
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,810
but Madam sent him away.

269
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,120
I also heard Master say

270
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
that Mr. Li came this time

271
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,860
to compose some musical scores

272
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,510
for the imperial court.

273
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,120
My Lady,

274
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,630
if someone like Mr. Li

275
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,980
can become an official,

276
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,610
it seems quite easy to become one, doesn't it?

277
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,410
Who cares what kind of official he becomes?

278
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,940
It has nothing to do with me.

279
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,150
My Lady,

280
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,480
did you have a fight

281
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,610
with Physician Jiu?

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,000
Is he upset

283
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,750
because of Mr. Li?

284
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,810
I don't know.

285
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:10,880
My Lady,

286
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,200
there's something I've been wanting to say.

287
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
Seeing you were in high spirits,

288
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,510
I've held it back.

289
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,650
The way you interact with Physician Jiu,

290
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
isn't it too hasty?

291
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,360
Really? I don't think so.

292
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,150
As the saying goes,

293
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,030
the easier something is

294
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,120
to obtain,

295
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,340
the less it's valued.

296
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,360
Look at you,

297
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,360
as soon as you wake up, you rush to the next door.

298
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,150
You're either making soup

299
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,350
or preparing snacks.

300
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,120
A young lady like you

301
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,840
is living like an old nanny.

302
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,890
If I were Physician Jiu,

303
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:48,960
as time goes by,

304
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,090
I wouldn't take you seriously either.

305
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm not like that.

306
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,990
You should learn from Madam in this regard.

307
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,440
My mother?

308
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
Haven't you noticed?

309
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,120
Since Madam returned,

310
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,140
your status in our household

311
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,310
has plummeted.

312
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,790
You used to be the apple of the Master's eye,

313
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,260
but now you're dispensable.

314
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,910
He didn't even remember to wait for you at meals.

315
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,670
Really?

316
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,820
My Lady, you need to be more observant.

317
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,050
Even though Master suffered a lot

318
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,380
for Madam this time,

319
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,030
Madam

320
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,430
didn't act like you,

321
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,630
all grateful and indebted,

322
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,910
like a little maid.

323
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,360
They're married.

324
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,550
Of course, it's Master's duty to save her.

325
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,440
I once overheard them arguing.

326
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,510
Madam even complained that he came too late.

327
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,870
Is that true?

328
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,550
It's true.

329
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,390
So,

330
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,790
you should learn from Madam.

331
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,840
You need to learn to use some tricks.

332
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,440
Use some tricks?

333
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,280
Let me ask you,

334
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,480
yesterday,

335
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,510
you had a fight with Physician Jiu.

336
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,080
What should you do

337
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,670
if he comes to you for an apology?

338
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,510
I should...

339
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,180
Ignore him.

340
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,080
Yes.

341
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,840
When two people are together,

342
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,970
it's important to see who can hold out.

343
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,510
If you can, you'll win.

344
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,160
You want

345
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,510
to marry Physician Jiu.

346
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,550
If you want to have a good life together,

347
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,030
you need to establish the rules first.

348
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,750
Don't be swayed by a few sweet words,

349
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,480
or you'll lose your head again.

350
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
You're right.

351
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,830
Even if he comes to me

352
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,150
and begs me to pardon him,

353
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,600
I will never forgive him.

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
At least I have to hold out for...

355
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,270
Two days.

356
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,670
That's right.

357
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,270
Banxia!

358
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,910
Banxia!

359
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,910
Banxia!

360
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,510
Xuanye is looking for you!

361
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,310
Come quickly!

362
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,840
My Lady!

363
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,270
Xuanye.

364
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,530
Banxia is here.

365
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,740
Why did you call for me?

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,900
I heard from a friend

367
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,160
of yours, surnamed Xu,

368
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,460
that you went to Sanhuai Lane a few days ago

369
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
and saw Xingxian.

370
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,480
That's right.

371
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,490
She was bullied

372
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,490
and beaten badly.

373
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,960
Zhizhi and I stood up for her.

374
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,760
What's wrong?

375
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,589
On her body,

376
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,200
did you see a white crow?

377
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,750
No.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Why do you ask?

379
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,680
She died.

380
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,920
Think carefully again.

381
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,720
Are you sure you didn't see

382
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,050
a white crow on her body?

383
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,620
I'm certain there wasn't.

384
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,440
If there was no white crow,

385
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
what does it mean?

386
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,560
It means she's not dead yet.

387
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,370
Where are you going?

388
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,070
Banxia,

389
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
we're going to investigate the case.

390
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,370
I'll explain in detail after I return.

391
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,790
Xuanye!

392
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,070
When we had just left,

393
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,080
they buried the body.

394
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,960
Her husband's relatives

395
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,970
wanted her house

396
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,760
and couldn't wait for her to die.

397
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,490
We don't have

398
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,700
Lord Geng's warrant.

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,960
And this case

400
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,790
really has no points of doubt,

401
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,570
so naturally we can't go against her families' wishes.

402
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,280
It's done.

403
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,680
Chi Xue.

404
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,640
Open it.

405
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,640
Got it.

406
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,320
She's gone?

407
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,030
Where am I?

408
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,090
How did I end up here?

409
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,830
This isn't me.

410
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,040
How could I...

411
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,930
How could I have turned into a man?

412
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,450
[Chilian]

413
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,550
To think she escaped by faking her death.

414
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,830
Could it be that Xingxian is a demon?

415
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,680
I don't know if she's a demon or not,

416
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,940
but she's definitely related to demons.

417
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,440
And she must have something to do

418
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,700
with Zhang Pu's death.

419
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,110
I understand.

420
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll send more men when I get back

421
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,060
to search the entire city for Xingxian's whereabouts.

422
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,880
Five portions.

423
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,440
Alright.

424
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,960
Xuanye.

425
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,770
Chi Xue.

426
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,920
What a coincidence!

427
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,750
When I left home today,

428
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,550
I was wondering if I'd run into you.

429
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,480
I turned around,

430
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,520
and here you are.

431
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,580
It must be fate.

432
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,050
Where are you off to?

433
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,570
To take care of some matters with my friends.

434
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,440
I see.

435
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,270
Then I won't ask any more questions.

436
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,790
Xuanye is a man who is capable of achieving great things.

437
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,070
Some things can't be spoken of,

438
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,130
can't be spoken of.

439
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,590
Oh, by the way, Xuanye,

440
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,120
I'm about to visit a master.

441
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,510
His skills to play the Qin are unparalleled.

442
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,130
You could say each of his tunes is worth a thousand gold pieces,

443
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,160
and that wouldn't be an exaggeration.

444
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,000
What do you say?

445
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,860
Care to join me?

446
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,640
I still have some matters to attend to,

447
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,770
so I'll have to pass.

448
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,530
Well, how about tomorrow?

449
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,790
I have things to do tomorrow as well.

450
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,510
Well...

451
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,090
I'll get going then.

452
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,400
Well, then, let's do it another day,

453
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,880
Xuanye.

454
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,030
Chi Xue, Chi Xue.

455
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,380
I have a favor to ask of you.

456
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,030
One of the two bags of nuts

457
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,110
is for you guys,

458
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,030
and as for the other, please help me

459
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,920
deliver it to Banxia.

460
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,550
Thank you.

461
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,350
Well, don't you want to keep one for yourself?

462
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,800
It's fine.

463
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,930
I'll buy some later.

464
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,970
Alright.

465
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Farewell.

466
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,210
This person is so troublesome.

467
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,610
Is he Xuanye's friend?

468
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,400
No,

469
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,450
it's Banxia's.

470
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,350
Banxia's friend.

471
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,720
Banxia's fiancé.

472
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,350
Banxia has a fiancé?

473
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,530
Well...

474
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,640
Go by yourself?

475
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,960
My Lady,

476
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,860
since you came back from the Underground City,

477
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,720
you've become bolder and bolder.

478
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,090
What's the big deal?

479
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,560
Breaking off an engagement

480
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,480
is usually handled by parents.

481
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,580
Yet you're going by yourself.

482
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,240
Moreover, you and Physician Jiu

483
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,900
haven't even reconciled yet.

484
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,610
Has he agreed to marry you?

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,480
Not yet.

486
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,400
But whether I break off the engagement or not

487
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,880
has nothing to do with him.

488
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,160
Even without him,

489
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,480
I won't marry Li Xian.

490
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,310
His current awkward behavior

491
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,110
must be related to my father.

492
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,480
He must be

493
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
still thinking about

494
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,740
my marriage to Li Xian.

495
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,000
It's better for me to break off the engagement myself

496
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,860
than to wait for him to do it for me.

497
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,830
What about Physician Jiu?

498
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,930
His issues are even bigger.

499
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,420
But let's wait for now.

500
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I'll deal with him

501
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,310
after I take care of

502
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,370
the matter at hand.

503
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
That makes sense.

504
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,640
Time waits for no one.

505
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,480
I'm going now.

506
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,480
In lieu of wine, I offer this tea

507
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
to toast you, Mr. Bai.

508
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,850
I haven't asked yet

509
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,200
what brought you to Guangping.

510
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,830
Taking advantage of official business

511
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,400
to visit my future in-laws.

512
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,110
So,

513
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,570
you've found a good match.

514
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,940
Congratulations.

515
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,740
Not married yet.

516
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,860
But thank you anyway, Mr. Bai.

517
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,210
I came to Guangping this time,

518
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,310
so I can fortunately meet you again, Mr. Bai.

519
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,110
Two years ago,

520
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
your masterful performance

521
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
left a deep impression on me.

522
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,930
Unfortunately, I was tied up with trivial matters then

523
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,550
and couldn't learn more from you.

524
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,400
So this time,

525
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,160
I've taken the liberty of visiting you.

526
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,020
You flatter me.

527
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,680
Those snakes are suspicious.

528
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,810
They're being controlled by someone.

529
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,550
The reason why

530
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,920
I didn't tell Youhuang much

531
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,830
is that I'm afraid he might alert our target.

532
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,720
We'll investigate

533
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,780
this matter first.

534
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,680
We?

535
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,680
Yes,

536
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,110
you and I.

537
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,890
You're asking a rabbit to investigate snakes?

538
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,790
Why don't you ask a peach

539
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,650
to keep an eye on Monkey Mountain?

540
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,380
I'm asking you to investigate the case,

541
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,830
not to fight them.

542
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,270
From now on,

543
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,550
sleep a little less

544
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,410
and stay alert.

545
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,980
I always have a feeling

546
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,660
that the demon this time is not ordinary.

547
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,560
Please don't see me out, Mr. Bai.

548
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,440
I'll take my leave.

549
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,050
[Spring Trees and Evening Clouds]

550
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,350
Who...

551
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,540
Who exactly are you?

552
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,200
To others,

553
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,470
my surname is Bai.

554
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,790
I'm a Qin master.

555
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,840
Few people know my real name.

556
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,110
However,

557
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,880
I can tell you.

558
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,410
My name is Chilian.

559
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,790
Mr. Chilian...

560
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,140
Why...

561
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,790
Why would I become

562
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,870
like this?

563
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,450
Isn't this what you wished for?

564
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,690
That day at Fa'en Temple, you made a wish

565
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,850
to become a man.

566
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,970
Now your wish has come true.

567
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,550
You should be happy.

568
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,110
How did you know?

569
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,290
Are you a Bodhisattva?

570
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,440
I'm just a passerby

571
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,570
who does a good deed.

572
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,880
I dare not claim the title of Bodhisattva.

573
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,640
Then...

574
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,400
Are you an immortal?

575
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,160
Or...

576
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,400
Or...

577
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,830
I can tell you,

578
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,110
but don't be afraid.

579
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,260
You're too dishonest.

580
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,400
You don't keep your word.

581
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,750
You just ran away like that.

582
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,210
You think I won't kill you?

583
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,040
That's right.

584
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,720
If you want to kill me, then do it.

585
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,370
If you kill me,

586
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,880
let's see how you can find Xuanye.

587
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,940
If I can't find him,

588
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,060
I won't let you go.

589
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,030
Stop wasting your breath on me, boy.

590
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,760
You want me to betray my friend?

591
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,350
Dream on.

592
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,950
You've got guts, I'll give you that.

593
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,140
Blood for blood.

594
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,170
Eye for eye.

595
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,390
Life for life.

596
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Soul for soul.

597
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,530
Black covers the black head.

598
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,720
Cloud conceals the cloud tail.

599
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,930
Demon Ancestors are supreme.

600
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,790
The world is in the primal chaos of heaven and earth.

601
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,720
I wonder where Mr. Li

602
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,720
has gone off to.

603
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,520
He's always running out and about.

604
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,510
Gosh.

605
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,720
And it seems he has more acquaintances in Guangping

606
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,880
than we do.

607
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,790
Physician Jiu.

608
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:06,680
It's so late.

609
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,340
Why are you just getting back?

610
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,510
We went to look for Mr. Li,

611
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,720
but he wasn't there.

612
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,640
We waited for a long time,

613
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,880
so we came back late.

614
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,440
Do you want to know

615
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,770
why I went to see Li Xian?

616
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,580
I won't tell you.

617
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,370
I went to break off the engagement with him.

618
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,110
Break off the engagement?

619
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,550
Yeah.

620
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,940
But let me be clear,

621
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,480
me breaking off the engagement

622
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,420
has nothing to do with you

623
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,010
at all.

624
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,110
Even before I met you,

625
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,640
I didn't agree to this marriage.

626
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,690
No one can force me

627
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
to do something I don't want to do.

628
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
So no matter what,

629
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,530
I'm definitely going to break off the engagement with him.

630
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,880
What do you mean by "oh"?

631
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,830
It just means

632
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:04,960
I got it.

633
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,200
Let me tell you,

634
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,480
don't be too smug.

635
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,210
I won't keep pestering you.

636
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,590
What's so great about you anyway?

637
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,400
You're so boring.

638
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Your personality is odd.

639
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,630
And your mood changes at the drop of a hat.

640
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,440
Even if I break off the engagement,

641
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
I won't marry you.

642
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,980
If I end up being alone,

643
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,380
I won't marry you either.

644
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,080
It's okay that you don't like me.

645
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,410
I don't like you either.

646
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,220
And I think you're right.

647
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,720
I like to eat Chinese toon today,

648
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,350
but maybe,

649
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,350
I'd prefer to eat pastries tomorrow.

650
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,790
It's not like I'll always like the same thing.

651
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,310
Later on, perhaps,

652
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,440
I'll enjoy eating sumptuous meals.

653
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,200
I'll eat whatever is delicious.

654
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,000
I certainly

655
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,750
won't keep crying and whining

656
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,280
and making a fool of myself.

657
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,310
You're overthinking it. You...

658
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,610
Physician Jiu.

659
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,890
Xuanye, are you okay?

660
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,710
Xuanye, are you okay?

661
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
Xuanye.

662
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,750
Xuanye.

663
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,140
What happened to you just now?

664
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,790
What is this place?

665
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,070
Is this Shendu City?

666
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,480
Shendu City?

667
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,450
Physician Jiu,

668
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,000
this is Guangping City.

669
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,660
Guangping City?

670
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,070
Why are you here?

671
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,740
Do with me as you will.

672
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,590
I won't tell you

673
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,350
where he is.

674
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,790
Commissioner Sima,

675
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,410
what are you talking about?

676
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,810
Don't you recognize me?

677
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,950
I am Jiu Xuanye from the Ganshan Clinic.

678
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,550
Physician Jiu?

679
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,000
You...

680
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,070
Xuanye, are you okay?

681
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,110
Is... Is that you?

682
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,110
Are you all right?

683
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,480
It's me.

684
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,489
What happened?

685
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,010
I don't know either.

686
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,219
You were acting so strange just now.

687
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,960
It was like you became a different person.

688
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,920
And you asked us

689
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,110
if this was Shendu City or something.

690
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,130
What else did I say?

691
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,110
You said,

692
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,360
"Tell him,

693
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I'll come and find him soon."

694
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,230
What...

695
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,660
What exactly do you want to do?

696
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,970
Don't you remember me?

697
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,070
The first time I saw you

698
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,960
was 10 years ago.

699
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,170
You were still young then,

700
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,320
just a child.

701
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,930
But when you were playing the Qin,

702
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,330
there was actually a touch of vividness.

703
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,930
I happened to be passing by

704
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,870
and was attracted by your music.

705
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,580
Little snake,

706
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,070
do you like Qin too?

707
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,320
Kid,

708
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,000
remember this in the future,

709
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,480
the more colorful the snake,

710
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,510
the more poisonous it is.

711
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,150
In the future,

712
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,480
don't get so close to it.

713
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,150
Little snake...

714
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,350
How is the catch today?

715
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,590
Don't mention it.

716
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,030
Just caught a small snake.

717
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,890
I don't know how much it'll fetch.

718
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,670
Alright, enjoy your meal.

719
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,400
Okay, okay.

720
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,200
Little snake, little snake.

721
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,730
You should go home quickly.

722
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,820
Don't get caught by bad people again.

723
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,030
Go back.

724
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,130
You showed me kindness.

725
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,320
I should repay you.

726
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,070
However, your wish

727
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,330
is full of resentment.

728
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,230
I shouldn't have helped you.

729
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,710
But I've observed you

730
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,800
for a long time.

731
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,760
The actions of those people

732
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,550
are indeed evil.

733
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,090
You're drunk again.

734
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,960
Get away!

735
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,920
Be careful.

736
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,640
Don't drink anymore.

737
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,660
You annoying woman!

738
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,480
I'll strangle you!

739
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,880
Get away!

740
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,880
Young lady.

741
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
So,

742
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,990
you killed my husband

743
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,010
and Lv Sanlang?

744
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,800
That's right.

745
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,800
Since you brought me here,

746
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,070
what on earth do you want to do?

747
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,840
You once wished

748
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,880
to be a man.

749
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,710
Then you can no longer suffer

750
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,110
the exclusion and prejudice in this world.

751
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,400
Now,

752
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
you can start all over again.

753
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,350
This... This is a demonic spell?

754
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,270
It's my snake slough.

755
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,570
The snake slough can conceal one's true form

756
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,880
and reshape one's appearance.

757
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,590
That day, I cast a spell to fake your death,

758
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,720
took away your body,

759
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,000
and covered it with my snake slough.

760
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,460
So you can now transform into my appearance.

761
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,920
These are some travel expenses for you.

762
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,070
You can leave now.

763
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,650
Go wherever you want to go.

764
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,810
Lead the life you want to live.

765
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,510
Mr. Bai.

766
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,150
Mr. Bai.

767
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,710
Whether you're a demon

768
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,710
or a human being,

769
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,760
you're my savior.

770
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,040
You're not afraid of me?

771
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,580
You saved my life.

772
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,760
How could I be afraid of you?

773
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,810
Besides, I've long been accustomed to

774
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,840
the cold realities of this world

775
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,630
and the malicious nature of humans.

776
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,550
Human beings

777
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,120
are far more terrifying than demons.

778
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,960
Mr. Bai,

779
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,590
please take me in.

780
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,770
Give me a place to stay.

781
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,640
Mr. Bai.

782
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,250
I can make your bed,

783
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,910
wash clothes, and cook meals.

784
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,730
As long as you ask,

785
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,880
I can do anything.

786
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,070
Since you've already gotten your wish

787
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,150
and become a man,

788
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,880
why do you still want to do these things

789
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,340
that are about serving me?

790
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,760
I'm all alone in this world,

791
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,840
with no family to support

792
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,670
and no friends to rely on.

793
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,410
Although I've gotten my wish now

794
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,410
and become a man,

795
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,910
I have no skills to make a living.

796
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,520
What can I do if I leave?

797
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,480
Even if you give me more taels of silver,

798
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,710
I'll just be eating away at the money without gaining income.

799
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,400
Mr. Bai.

800
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,880
I know you're a capable man.

801
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,310
Please take me in and let me stay by your side.

802
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,830
What?

803
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,920
Sima Lingying has been captured by a demon?

804
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,400
Yes.

805
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,240
How do you know?

806
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:30,880
Where is she?

807
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,560
Is she hurt?

808
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,520
It was too rushed at the time.

809
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,110
I'm not sure about the specific situation.

810
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,190
I only remember it was a dilapidated temple.

811
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,590
It should be in the south.

812
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,760
It's a place that's warmer

813
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,000
than Guangping.

814
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,670
Where exactly?

815
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,840
That demon asked about Shendu.

816
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,360
It's likely near Shendu City.

817
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,280
Alright.

818
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,570
I'll go ask the lord for leave now.

819
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,400
Can you go with me?

820
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,630
I can't.

821
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,730
I have a feeling

822
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,110
that he will come looking for me again.

823
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,060
If I go,

824
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,960
I'll only cause you trouble.

825
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,000
Okay.

826
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,400
Yes, that's it.

827
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,090
You're back.

828
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,220
Have you figured out the reason for last night's incident?

829
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,680
It's nothing.

830
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,890
I'll handle it.

831
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,960
Don't worry.

832
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,970
I'll get going then.

833
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,430
You haven't paid yet.

834
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,520
What did she just buy?

835
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,190
She said not to tell you.

836
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,800
My Lady,

837
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,840
I was just about to look for you.

838
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,760
Is he here?

839
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,600
He's inside playing chess with Master.

840
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,320
Perfect.
