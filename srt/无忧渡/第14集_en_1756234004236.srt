00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,020
[Episode 14]

3
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,840
Why are you having a fever?

4
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
Where did you go?

5
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,450
Nowhere.

6
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,370
What were you doing?

7
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,550
You reek of alcohol.

8
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,150
Nothing much.

9
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,710
The bamboo forest at night

10
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,680
is a bit chilly.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,680
You got sick just as I recovered.

12
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,079
Let me take off your shoes

13
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,680
and cover you with the quilt.

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,560
No need to take them off.

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,360
Let me do it.

16
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,800
You don't know how to take them off.

17
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,430
Here, put… put them here.

18
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,800
Just rest up.

19
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll go boil some water for you.

20
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,710
No need.

21
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,630
You can use the hot water to wash your face

22
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,290
and then get some proper rest.

23
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
No need. I can't sleep.

24
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
Why can't you sleep?

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,150
Too noisy. Really.

26
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,410
They're making such a racket over there.

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,240
How can I sleep like this?

28
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,910
Xuanye.

29
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,730
You drank Fubai Wine, didn't you?

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,400
It's fine.

31
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,840
It's fine.

32
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,750
I drink it every day.

33
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,150
I'm fine.

34
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,720
What are you looking at?

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,590
Nothing.

36
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,440
Chi Xue, do you have any family?

37
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,360
Yes.

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,290
Where are they?

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,370
Xuanye is my family.

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,030
I mean actual family—

41
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,920
parents, siblings, that kind.

42
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,310
I don't remember.

43
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,920
How could you not remember?

44
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,190
For as long as I can remember,

45
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,620
I've been at Ganshan Clinic.

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,750
I haven't met any members of my family.

47
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,260
Have you met Xuanye's family then?

48
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,600
What are they like?

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Just like you.

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
Like me?

51
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,020
Talkative, always dropping by,

52
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,940
and good at cooking.

53
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,870
He must miss them a lot.

54
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm coming in.

55
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,640
Xuanye, are you awake?

56
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Where did Chi Xue go?

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Xuanye?

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,390
Where did you go?

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,750
I went to have breakfast.

60
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,800
Go get Youhuang.

61
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,390
Xuanye is sick.

62
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,720
He has a high fever.

63
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,800
Youhuang!

64
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,800
Youhuang!

65
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,900
Open the door! Xuanye is sick.

66
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Open the door!

67
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Physician Jiu is ill?

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Where's Youhuang?

69
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,510
Youhuang went back to get help.

70
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,570
He left last night.

71
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,430
What should we do then?

72
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,600
Treat the illness, of course.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Can't Physician Jiu treat himself?

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm watching over a corpse here.

75
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,430
I-I can't leave.

76
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,840
Why don't you stay here and…

77
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,370
Come out!

78
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,150
Have some water.

79
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,410
Wuniang.

80
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
So you are in the room.

81
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,080
Why didn't you answer

82
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,130
when I knocked?

83
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm going to fetch water.

84
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
Come, go with me.

85
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,080
It's too far.

86
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
I can't carry it all alone.

87
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,650
Ask the servants

88
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,670
to go with you.

89
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,030
They're so dull-witted

90
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
and can't even speak a proper sentence.

91
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,580
In your eyes,

92
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,310
aren't I just the same?

93
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,770
Dull-witted, stupid,

94
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,500
and bad with words.

95
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,150
Wuniang, you...

96
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,530
Father, do you have anything else to say?

97
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,250
Wuniang.

98
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,390
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,810
Yesterday,

100
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,300
I shouldn't have hit you.

101
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
That was my fault.

102
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,510
But I

103
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,610
was just afraid you'd make a mistake.

104
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,560
By the way,

105
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,840
last night,

106
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,280
I had another dream.

107
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,310
I dreamed that the two of us

108
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,970
returned to Guima Fort again.

109
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,510
It was a rainy night.

110
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,080
The royal flag got blown away.

111
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,250
I wanted to go retrieve it,

112
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,080
but you desperately tried to stop me

113
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,030
from going.

114
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,650
Then you went instead.

115
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
You were gone for four or five days.

116
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,530
Not a trace of you.

117
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,970
I was worried and went to look for you.

118
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,760
I finally found you at Haizi Bay,

119
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,380
but your arms and legs

120
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,750
were all broken.

121
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,060
Yet even then,

122
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,550
you were still tightly biting onto the royal flag.

123
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,390
Father,

124
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,390
that happened

125
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,910
a long time ago.

126
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,480
Yes.

127
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,440
But for me,

128
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,790
it feels like it happened just yesterday.

129
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Wuniang,

130
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,790
you're a good girl.

131
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Without you,

132
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,840
I might not have made it to this day.

133
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,240
No matter what others say,

134
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
I know in my heart—

135
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,520
we, father and daughter,

136
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,480
have done

137
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,410
something truly remarkable.

138
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,520
I've made up my mind.

139
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,490
I'm going to close the inn.

140
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,150
Then we'll leave.

141
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,060
Let's leave this place, shall we?

142
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,960
Leave?

143
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,120
Yes.

144
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,500
You don't like it here, do you?

145
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,670
So let's leave.

146
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,360
Then,

147
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,010
where will we go?

148
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,270
We can go anywhere we want.

149
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,600
We'll find

150
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,120
a scenic place to settle down.

151
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,270
Just the two of us.

152
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,360
We'll live a quiet life together.

153
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,580
What do you say?

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Wuniang.

155
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,520
Why are you laughing?

156
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,480
Nothing.

157
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,390
I just think

158
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,080
your idea is wonderful.

159
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,850
I've been tired of this place for a long time.

160
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,670
That's great!

161
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,910
I'll start packing right away.

162
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,270
Look.

163
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,670
I carved this for you.

164
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you like it?

165
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,880
Your craftsmanship

166
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
is always the best.

167
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,930
Glad you think so.

168
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,130
I'll go pack now.

169
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,870
You start packing too.

170
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay.

171
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,910
Good.

172
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,790
Wuniang,

173
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,920
we've caught the man.

174
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,470
You're awake.

175
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,470
You're still having a fever.

176
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,550
I'm fine.

177
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,410
Here, drink some water.

178
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
I just fetched it.

179
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh, by the way, Youhuang has returned to Guangping City.

180
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,600
I know.

181
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,640
His men were killed.

182
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,750
We all believe

183
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,550
it was done by someone at the inn.

184
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
He went back to get reinforcements.

185
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,720
Was it a demon?

186
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,360
If it was a demon,

187
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,490
he's no match for it.

188
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,840
I gave him something to protect himself.

189
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
He'll be alright.

190
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,400
Lie back down and rest a bit more.

191
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,510
Banxia.

192
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,600
Once I'm better,

193
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,440
I'll take you away from here.

194
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,550
You've been taking care of me all this time.

195
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,480
I bet you haven't had a proper rest.

196
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,790
Thank you.

197
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,840
You don't need

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,360
to say things like that.

199
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,390
Who's it?

200
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,910
The face must be pale, the lips red.

201
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,030
The paler, the better.

202
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,360
The redder, the better.

203
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
She also needs a flower mark.

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,750
Wuniang likes it, and so do I.

205
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,310
I like it too.

206
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,440
Wuniang.

207
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,150
One.

208
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,750
Two.

209
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,000
Three, four.

210
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,870
Five, six, seven.

211
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,480
Eight.

212
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,790
Xuanye.

213
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,200
This...

214
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,850
This...

215
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,960
Xuanye.

216
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,720
Xuanye!

217
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,120
Yanqiu.

218
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,600
Wuniang.

219
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,870
Miss Duan.

220
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,400
You're awake.

221
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,870
Chief.

222
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,620
You're...

223
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,810
all awake.

224
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,910
Wuniang.

225
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,790
What are you doing?

226
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,200
Why have you

227
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,550
tied everyone up here?

228
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,440
What are you doing?

229
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,410
Why have you

230
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,920
tied everyone up here?

231
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,660
Miss Duan,

232
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,000
don't you know why?

233
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,410
What's going on?

234
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
Untie us now!

235
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,720
Untie us!

236
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,950
Mr. Feng Tian,

237
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,390
what is your good daughter

238
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,350
trying to do?

239
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
How would I know?

240
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,400
Wuniang,

241
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,350
what are you doing?

242
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,560
Why have you

243
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,800
tied everyone up?

244
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,240
Hurry, untie us now.

245
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you all for being here.

246
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm glad

247
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,580
that you came.

248
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,160
Perhaps you don't know yet—

249
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,200
today is my birthday.

250
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,310
It's said that

251
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
one should celebrate

252
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,880
one's birthday with friends and family

253
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,350
to be blessed.

254
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,310
My life has been full of hardships,

255
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,350
with only my father by my side.

256
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,490
So I've taken the liberty

257
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,780
of inviting you all

258
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,830
to celebrate with me.

259
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,690
I hope you won't take offense.

260
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,400
I don't remember

261
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,060
how old I am this year.

262
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,930
Nor do I remember

263
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,700
what day

264
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,240
my birthday is.

265
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,690
Is it the day I was created

266
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,450
or the day I gained

267
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
self-awareness?

268
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,500
But it doesn't matter.

269
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,030
From today on,

270
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,610
I'll be like everyone else—

271
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,230
I'll have a birthday too.

272
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,750
Today is

273
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,950
the ninth day of July.

274
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,740
The Heavenly Noble Star enters fate,

275
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,240
favorable for all endeavors.

276
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,570
All things done shall succeed; all wishes shall be granted.

277
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,350
Father.

278
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,600
How do you like…

279
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,530
the date I picked?

280
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,250
It's great.

281
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,190
Oh, right.

282
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,430
I also made a bowl of birthday noodles.

283
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,160
A guest once told me

284
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
you're supposed

285
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,640
to eat longevity noodles on your birthday.

286
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,730
I can't taste anything,

287
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,750
and I can't swallow.

288
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,750
Father.

289
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,680
Aren't all people supposed to be able

290
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,480
to eat?

291
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,840
Why

292
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,640
can't I do it?

293
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,230
It's okay.

294
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,830
Then I just won't eat them.

295
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,550
Today is my birthday.

296
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,680
Have you prepared any gifts for me?

297
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,830
Who says we're celebrating your birthday?

298
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,630
I'm an official from Guangping.

299
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,750
Kidnapping an official is a serious crime!

300
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,270
Li!

301
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,200
Miss,

302
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
this all happened so suddenly.

303
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,510
We didn't have time to prepare a gift for you.

304
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,550
That was our mistake.

305
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,410
How about this?

306
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,270
If you release us,

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,240
we'll go buy you some gifts.

308
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,900
Good, good.

309
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,410
That's a good idea.

310
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,110
Officer,

311
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,400
you're so bad,

312
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,930
lying to a child like that.

313
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,160
If I let you go,

314
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,010
I'm afraid you'd disappear immediately.

315
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,760
How would I ever find you again?

316
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,020
How about this?

317
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,050
I've always loved listening to stories since I was little.

318
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,530
Why don't each of you

319
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,410
tell me a story?

320
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,560
That'll count as your gift.

321
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,740
You crazy woman!

322
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,060
Don't hurt him!

323
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,400
I'll tell one! I'll go first.

324
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,030
Alright.

325
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm not great

326
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,840
at telling stories,

327
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,130
so I'll share something

328
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,530
I actually experienced.

329
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,550
That year, I was ordered to catch a criminal.

330
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,680
I chased the gang leader alone

331
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,660
all the way to Qinglong Gorge.

332
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,880
During the fight, the gang leader and I

333
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,280
fell into a ravine and lost consciousness.

334
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,550
When I woke up,

335
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,040
the gang leader was already awake,

336
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,610
not a scratch on him.

337
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,070
But he didn't harm me.

338
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,510
Why not?

339
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,770
Because we were surrounded

340
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,400
by hungry, fierce wolves.

341
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,160
Though I was an officer

342
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,790
and he was a criminal,

343
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,180
surrounded by wolves,

344
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,340
we had no choice but to join forces.

345
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,530
We stood back to back

346
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,460
and fought all night long.

347
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,550
In the end, we drove the wolves away

348
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,750
and made it out alive.

349
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
Enemies

350
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,010
turned into partners.

351
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,190
And then?

352
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,550
Then the soldiers found us.

353
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,050
I was taken for treatment,

354
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,330
and he was thrown into the dungeon.

355
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,640
Then

356
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,260
what happened?

357
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,790
Then he was beheaded.

358
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,920
You didn't save him?

359
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,590
Why would I save him?

360
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
He was less injured than you,

361
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,100
woke up before you,

362
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,070
and could've killed you easily.

363
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,960
But he spared your life.

364
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,510
That means

365
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,240
you owed him a debt.

366
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,630
I'm an officer, and he was a criminal.

367
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,160
He killed someone and paid with his life. That's the law.

368
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,110
Under the law,

369
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
there are no personal debts!

370
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,970
How

371
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,920
righteous of you.

372
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,570
Then let me ask you:

373
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
what about

374
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,870
those wolves?

375
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,930
What about them?

376
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,240
You

377
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,150
killed the wolves.

378
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,490
What should we make of that?

379
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,380
Those wolves were vicious man-killers.

380
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,580
They deserved to die!

381
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,110
It's just

382
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,310
the law of the jungle, isn't it?

383
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,610
That day, the wolves

384
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,990
were weaker than you,

385
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,350
so you killed them.

386
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,400
The criminal was weaker than you,

387
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
so you killed him.

388
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,550
And today,

389
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,440
you are weaker than me.

390
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,380
So now you're the one on the chopping block.

391
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,150
Shut up with all that

392
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,300
hypocritical nonsense!

393
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,750
What a high-sounding story

394
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,970
about fake righteousness.

395
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,060
Isn't that

396
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,950
a great story?

397
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,480
No.

398
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,770
It's your turn.

399
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,980
I have no story to tell.

400
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,110
Yanqiu.

401
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,400
You

402
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,350
have no story to tell,

403
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,640
or there's nothing worth mentioning?

404
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,750
You simply don't understand

405
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,350
what love is.

406
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,400
Manniang and I fell in love at first sight

407
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,350
and got married.

408
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,690
I thought we'd grow old together.

409
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,200
I never imagined

410
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,210
she was a demon who killed people.

411
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,570
After her death,

412
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,830
I was consumed by grief and longing.

413
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,270
That's why I fell under the spell

414
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,270
of your Fubai Wine

415
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,970
and lingered in this place.

416
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,350
But in the end,

417
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,290
she still died at the hands

418
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,530
of that demon hunter.

419
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,000
Do you know

420
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,290
why your wife didn't flee

421
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,490
even after her tracks

422
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,390
were exposed?

423
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,350
For you,

424
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,590
she risked her life.

425
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,630
Yet after her death,

426
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,760
you enjoyed drinking with her killer.

427
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,720
That's how you missed her?

428
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,850
She killed people.

429
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,640
What's wrong with a demon killing people?

430
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,880
She only did it

431
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,850
because she was a demon.

432
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,840
I've watched plays.

433
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,590
They value love and relationships

434
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,770
so much.

435
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
But I know those stories

436
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,350
are all fake.

437
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,580
What's real is finding a fitting match,

438
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,020
being fickle,

439
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,040
and falling for someone new.

440
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,810
What's real is selfishness and hypocrisy.

441
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,740
Everything you said

442
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,750
was nothing but false pretenses.

443
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,710
Father.

444
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,350
You used to tell me

445
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,440
a person

446
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,620
should be forgiving,

447
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,080
frugal,

448
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,040
kind, and upright.

449
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,470
Yes.

450
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,820
But most of the people I've met

451
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,490
are just like them.

452
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,440
Stupid,

453
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,350
selfish,

454
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,000
hypocritical,

455
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,450
and full of lies!

456
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,960
Is this

457
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,040
what you want me to become?

458
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,680
No.

459
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,280
No.

460
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,510
You said

461
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,590
life in the desert was lonely and harsh,

462
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,360
and you couldn't bear it alone,

463
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,410
so you created me.

464
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,670
You said I was your daughter,

465
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,850
so I truly believed

466
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,130
you were my father.

467
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,110
You said…

468
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,310
at your old house in Guangping City,

469
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,680
there was an orange tree

470
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,200
that bore

471
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,720
so much fruit every year.

472
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,110
I can't taste anything,

473
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,120
but I still wanted to see it.

474
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,830
But Father,

475
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,440
we traveled thousands of miles,

476
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,030
and when we reached the doorstep,

477
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,720
why didn't you dare to go in?

478
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
Because you were afraid.

479
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,540
You were just afraid.

480
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,830
You saw me as a monster.

481
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,510
You were afraid I'd hurt your family.

482
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,170
But aren't…

483
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,980
aren't I your daughter?

484
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,770
What kind of father

485
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,790
would be afraid of his own daughter?

486
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,750
What's wrong with you?

487
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,790
You said

488
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,960
this place was good,

489
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,550
that you'd open an inn here.

490
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,110
You even gave it

491
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,110
a name:

492
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,830
Reunion Inn.

493
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,750
Reunion with whom?

494
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,960
You and me?

495
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,350
This isn't an inn at all,

496
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,750
but a cage where you imprison me.

497
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,350
You…

498
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,410
You want to trap me here

499
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,550
forever.

500
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,450
If…

501
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,790
if you're afraid of me,

502
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,910
why did you create me?

503
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,750
If you believe I'll never be more than a demon,

504
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,590
why did you teach me so many

505
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,270
human values?

506
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,000
You

507
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,680
fear me like a viper,

508
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,960
treat me like a prisoner,

509
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,640
and yet call me your daughter.

510
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
You keep saying

511
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
it's all for my own good.

512
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,440
Do you know that's the thing

513
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,110
I hate most about you?

514
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,110
Daughter, what's…

515
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,710
w-what's wrong with you?

516
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,920
Daughter.

517
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,030
Wuniang,

518
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,290
I understand now.

519
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,310
You long for genuine feelings

520
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,920
and love.

521
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,190
The moon waxes and wanes.

522
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,480
People are the same.

523
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,790
Yes,

524
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,940
some people are pedantic,

525
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,430
but they might be brave.

526
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,440
Some people are selfish,

527
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,910
but they might be intelligent.

528
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,900
No one is perfect.

529
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
We are all like this.

530
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,920
Your father is the same.

531
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:51,700
Yes.

532
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,350
You're right.

533
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,160
Miss Duan,

534
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,060
you truly are the one I've chosen.

535
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,330
You're better than all the others.

536
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,330
It's just a pity…

537
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,550
that you're about to die.

538
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,200
I once told you

539
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,880
I had a brother.

540
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,240
He was just like me once,

541
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
trapped here,

542
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,830
living a miserable life.

543
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,320
But he came up with a solution.

544
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,000
He found someone

545
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,040
he liked,

546
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,480
disguised himself as that person,

547
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,860
and then went home in their place.

548
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,650
My brother has been gone for a long time now.

549
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
I don't know if his new family

550
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,590
likes him or not.

551
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,070
Miss Duan,

552
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,480
I've also waited for a long time.

553
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
I really like you.

554
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,590
I like your appearance

555
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,550
and your personality.

556
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,440
Don't worry.

557
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,070
After I take your place,

558
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,550
I'll definitely take good care of

559
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,310
your family.

560
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,000
I believe

561
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,920
your loved ones…

562
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,410
Banxia.

563
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,510
will surely like me too.

564
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
All the things you wanted to do

565
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,750
but were too afraid to try—

566
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,720
I'll do them for you.

567
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,680
Wuniang.

568
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,890
You lunatic!

569
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,710
Daughter!

570
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,730
Have you finished talking?

571
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,550
Mr. Feng Tian,

572
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,860
now you see what kind of person

573
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,550
your daughter is, don't you?

574
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,440
No…

575
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,550
You're not sick?

576
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,690
You didn't drink that wine?

577
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,150
So you've been acting all along.

578
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,800
What a shame

579
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,159
that a blockhead like you gained self-awareness.

580
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,320
You don't even know

581
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,130
basic decency and moral values,

582
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,270
yet you're so eager to lecture others.

583
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm in a good mood today.

584
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,320
I'll teach you a truth that holds true

585
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,889
for both humans and demons—

586
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
evil

587
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,560
can never triumph over good.

588
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,030
Chi Xue!

589
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,150
Xuanye,

590
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,530
cut the net.

591
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,220
I didn't bring my sword. Don't you know that?

592
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,520
Why are you looking at me? Do something!

593
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,680
Transform!

594
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,250
Get off of me!

595
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,100
Get off!

596
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,990
Get off!

597
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,030
Get off!

598
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,650
How dare you hit me!

599
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,030
Xuanye.

600
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,550
She's leaving.

601
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,280
Chi Xue,

602
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,840
let's end this quickly.

603
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,630
This wound is quite deep.

604
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,800
Mr. Feng,

605
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,460
where do you keep the wound medicine?

606
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,100
Mr. Feng Tian?

607
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,840
Mr. Feng?

608
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,040
Forget it.

609
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,230
There should be

610
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,400
some basic medicine in Xuanye's room.

611
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,250
I'll go check.

612
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,400
Thanks.

613
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,380
Miss Duan, what are you looking for?

614
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,350
Looks just like you, doesn't it?

615
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,420
It looks just like you, right?

616
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,590
You...

617
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,070
Be quiet.

618
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,510
I don't want to kill you yet.

619
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,090
I've heard

620
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,100
that after people die,

621
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,600
their faces stop looking nice.

622
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,590
Today is my birthday.

623
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,210
Let me show you a little magic trick, okay?

624
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,450
Watch closely.

625
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,550
One,

626
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,070
two,

627
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,590
three.

628
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,840
Miss Duan.

629
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,710
Miss Duan,

630
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,760
where are you?

631
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,400
Am I beautiful?

632
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:24,480
Now,

633
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,660
we look exactly the same.

634
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,150
Very soon,

635
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,840
I'll become you.

636
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,800
Get away from me!

637
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,630
When I first saw you,

638
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,710
I thought,

639
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,230
how wonderful it would be

640
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,280
if I could be you.

641
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,330
You're so free

642
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,310
and unrestrained,

643
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,060
like no one can force you

644
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,880
to do anything you don't want.

645
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,920
But somehow,

646
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,020
I always feel that you're not happy.

647
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
That's not true.

648
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,070
I am happy.

649
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,820
Is it so hard to admit that

650
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,770
you're not doing well?

651
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,400
You humans

652
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,400
are so hypocritical.

653
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,820
So, Miss Duan,

654
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,140
let me take your place.

655
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,180
Let me take your name,

656
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,570
your identity,

657
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,960
and your life.

658
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,440
I swear,

659
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,360
I'll live happier than you ever did.

660
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
I'll live more like a human than you.

661
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,550
No.

662
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,480
No, I won't let you!

663
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,920
No?

664
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,420
Why not?

665
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,310
Who are you to refuse?

666
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,880
Why is it that everyone

667
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,940
gets to say no to me?

668
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,480
Wuniang, don't do this.

669
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,920
Wuniang, don't do that.

670
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,650
I've heard enough.

671
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,900
I'm sick of it.

672
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,020
Listen to me.

673
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,710
I want it.

674
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,540
I want everything.

675
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,980
The only thing I don't want now

676
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,440
is to keep being Feng Wuniang.

677
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,150
I don't want to be

678
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,210
a puppet manipulated by others anymore!

679
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,180
But in my eyes,

680
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,080
no one is manipulating you.

681
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,920
All this self-righteous talk

682
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,750
you're spouting now—

683
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,010
isn't it just you

684
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,110
justifying everything

685
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,640
from your own perspective?

686
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
You say your father imprisoned you,

687
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,910
but what did he really do?

688
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,650
Didn't he stay here

689
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,460
just to be with you,

690
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,920
even giving up going home?

691
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,510
It's all your fault.

692
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,590
You took lives without care,

693
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,790
killed the innocent,

694
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,460
and became

695
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,080
an unscrupulous evil demon.

696
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,150
Do you really think

697
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,360
killing me today

698
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,920
will make you become me?

699
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,730
Even if you wear my face

700
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,960
and leave this place,

701
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:58,800
my family

702
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,620
will see through you at a glance.

703
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,630
Do you really think changing your appearance

704
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,960
can change your life?

705
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,150
It's impossible!

706
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,850
Miss Duan,

707
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,280
you're so sharp with words.

708
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,280
No wonder…

709
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,190
I like you more and more.

710
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,460
If things turn out just like you said,

711
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,020
and your family sees through me at a glance,

712
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,500
then I'll send them to hell

713
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,830
to keep you company!
