00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,000
[Episode 5]

3
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,950
Sir.

4
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
Your dishes are here.

5
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,150
This should be

6
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,090
the roasted camel hump, right?

7
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,880
They say

8
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,630
it's a delicacy from the Western Regions.

9
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,490
Try it quickly.

10
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,710
Is it good?

11
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,020
It's good.

12
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,370
Then have some more.

13
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,680
Here.

14
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,010
This one's big.

15
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,800
Take it.

16
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,800
Have another piece.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,910
You eat it yourself.

18
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,970
No need to serve me.

19
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,750
I'm not serving you.

20
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,750
Back in Nanyang,

21
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,910
you saved my life,

22
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,630
saved Yanqiu's life,

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,700
and saved my whole family.

24
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,560
I didn't even get the chance

25
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,820
to thank you properly.

26
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,490
Now I'm asking for your help again.

27
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,280
Of course, I feel

28
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,480
a bit guilty about it.

29
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,710
You don't need to feel guilty.

30
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,110
Besides, I haven't decided to help you yet.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,260
You will soon, anyway.

32
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,800
Xuanye?

33
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,520
Can I call you that?

34
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,650
I feel that calling you Physician Jiu

35
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,960
or Mr. Jiu makes you sound a bit old.

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,540
You can call me Banxia too.

37
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,950
Guangping is indeed different.

38
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,310
As expected of the ancient capital of three dynasties.

39
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,110
The imperial family is wealthy.

40
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Look,

41
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,240
the people here are different.

42
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,680
Are you a local from Guangping?

43
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,360
Yes.

44
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,560
I thought so.

45
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,210
People from big cities

46
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,510
are all knowledgeable and experienced,

47
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,720
with extraordinary demeanor.

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,380
Can you not talk during meals?

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,120
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

50
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,480
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

51
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,360
Bravo!

52
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,430
Bravo!

53
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,240
Bravo!

54
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Bravo!

55
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,990
Something's not right.

56
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
What's going on?

57
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,090
Wasn't she dancing just fine a moment ago?

58
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,890
That's right.

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,410
Quick, take a look, take a look.

60
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,870
Don't be afraid.

61
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,560
Whatever I ask,

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,020
just answer accordingly.

63
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
What was your relationship

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,150
with the deceased?

65
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,430
We have no relationship.

66
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,830
We just arrived here not long ago.

67
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,480
Listen to me.

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,010
As she was spinning, she suddenly collapsed.

69
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,760
Someone's died.

70
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,830
Before Tian Rui, the deceased, went on stage,

71
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,920
who had seen her?

72
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,360
Officer,

73
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm not sure.

74
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,560
The backstage is off-limits to outsiders.

75
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,170
It should be

76
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,700
only people from their dance troupe, I guess.

77
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,160
Are there any other exits here?

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,630
Yes.

79
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,070
This way, please.

80
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,800
Lead the way.

81
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,630
Officer.

82
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,000
This was where Tian Rui

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,860
did her makeup.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,240
I see.

85
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,630
You can go out first.

86
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,120
Yes.

87
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
Chief Constable Wen,

88
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,110
Chief Chu said

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
to bring the deceased's belongings

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,409
to the government office for examination.

91
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:41,940
Alright.

92
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,150
Oh, right.

93
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,800
bring everyone outside

94
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,070
back for questioning later.

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,800
Understood.

96
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,290
My lord.

97
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,090
What's the situation?

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,000
My lord,

99
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,230
the deceased was a dancer from Yunmen Dance Troupe.

100
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,090
She suddenly died on stage during the performance.

101
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,600
Tian Rui?

102
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,580
Do you know her?

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,300
More than a decade ago,

104
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,940
I had a brief encounter

105
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,920
with her.

106
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
Her performance of the Xi River Formation

107
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,510
was as graceful as a dragon.

108
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,920
The audience was massive and the cheers were thunderous.

109
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Even now, thinking back,

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,330
it's still vivid in my mind.

111
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,420
I never thought...

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,060
More than a decade ago?

113
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,750
She must have been quite young, right?

114
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,120
Yes.

115
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,510
She was in her twenties,

116
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,480
the prime of a woman's life.

117
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,510
Well...

118
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,920
Is this the Tian Rui

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,720
that you know?

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,310
Yes,

121
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,610
indeed,

122
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,830
but

123
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,680
more than a decade has passed.

124
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,700
Why hasn't her appearance

125
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,630
changed at all?

126
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,530
My lord,

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,630
I heard that the women in dance troupes

128
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,160
all have their own secret methods for maintaining their youth.

129
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,750
Combined with makeup and attire,

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,720
looking young

131
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,530
isn't really surprising.

132
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,470
Lord Geng,

133
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,780
the cause of death is unknown.

134
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,390
I humbly request your permission

135
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,250
for an autopsy.

136
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,240
A body should not be casually examined.

137
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
We need the family's consent first.

138
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,559
If the autopsy yielded no results,

139
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,159
it would be difficult to explain to the family.

140
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,900
My lord,

141
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,100
I suspect this is a case

142
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,309
of poisoning.

143
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,390
I've led a team to inspect

144
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,630
the kitchen of Yanlai Restaurant.

145
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,090
We found nothing unusual.

146
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,550
Could it be that she

147
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,600
died suddenly from an illness?

148
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,040
Wen Jian,

149
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
what do you think?

150
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,570
My lord, I...

151
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,750
I think I'd better

152
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
not say anything.

153
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,440
Feel free to express your opinions. Don't hesitate.

154
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,250
My lord,

155
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,840
I believe

156
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,190
this is the work of demons.

157
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,510
Whenever we encounter a difficult case,

158
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,640
you always say it's the work of demons.

159
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,140
You said that female thief who slit throats last time

160
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,150
was also a demon.

161
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,430
But in the end?

162
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
In the end, I invited Xuanye to come out of seclusion

163
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,870
to eliminate that demon.

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
The lord is present here.

165
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,630
How dare you still spout such nonsense?

166
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,690
It was the lord who said we should express our own views.

167
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,820
My lord,

168
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,870
this corpse...

169
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,950
Next.

170
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
What's your name?

171
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,450
Are you hungry?

172
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll go buy you something to eat.

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,700
No need.

174
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,360
It's my fault.

175
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,100
I didn't choose a good place to eat.

176
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,030
Next time, I'll invite you to have dinner at my place

177
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,030
as compensation.

178
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,360
We're neighbors.

179
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,670
We live very close to each other.

180
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,390
You'll be there just by stepping out the door.

181
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,250
My cooking skills are quite good.

182
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,430
You really like cooking?

183
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm just cooking

184
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
for my savior.

185
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
Last time I saw you

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,270
in Nanyang,

187
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,270
you weren't like this at all.

188
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,120
Of course.

189
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,790
At that time,

190
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,840
you were willing to help voluntarily.

191
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,370
Now that you're unwilling,

192
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,670
my attitude naturally needs to have

193
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,870
a slight change.

194
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,550
Next.

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
What's your name?

196
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,740
Chief Constable Wen.

197
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,670
Are you finished?

198
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,150
Not yet.

199
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,080
I still need to go to Ganshan Clinic again.

200
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,810
Hey, Xuanye.

201
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,010
Xuanye?

202
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,030
You... Why are you here?

203
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,840
I went out for dinner last night

204
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,530
and had bad luck,

205
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,150
so...

206
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,080
You were also at Yanlai Restaurant last night?

207
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,600
Yes.

208
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,870
That's perfect.

209
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,510
I'm investigating

210
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,500
the case at Yanlai Restaurant.

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,200
Quick, follow me.

212
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Let's meet with the lord.

213
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,900
Well...

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,910
She's with me.

215
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,350
Alright then.

216
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,180
Let's go together.

217
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,750
I've brought him here.

218
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,880
Where are you going?

219
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,370
Relying on him?

220
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,440
I'd rather hope

221
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
the murderer would turn himself in.

222
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I don't have time for your nonsense.

223
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,820
Don't mind him.

224
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
The prefectural governor is inside.

225
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
Do you still want to go in?

226
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,880
Then I'll wait for you outside.

227
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,870
Wen Jian.

228
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,960
Tell Physician Jiu

229
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
about everything.

230
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,520
Yes, my lord.

231
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,080
This deceased person

232
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,200
was a dancer from Yunmen Dance Troupe.

233
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,860
A few days ago, she suddenly became young again.

234
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,320
This big box

235
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,520
should be placed in the evidence room.

236
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
I heard that

237
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,750
Physician Jiu from Ganshan Clinic has arrived.

238
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,810
What's he here for?

239
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,760
I don't know.

240
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,750
Be careful.

241
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,870
The box is broken.

242
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,960
Do you need help?

243
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,630
Thank you.

244
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
This case is really bizarre.

245
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,550
I heard that the deceased actually transformed after death.

246
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,750
What did she turn into?

247
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,750
When she was brought back,

248
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,080
she was still a young beauty.

249
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,870
After a while,

250
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,840
she turned into a mummified old woman.

251
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,630
Seriously?

252
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,790
See for yourself in a moment

253
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,720
and you'll know.

254
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,510
Thanks.

255
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,230
That's pretty much how it happened.

256
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
This case is indeed bizarre,

257
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,860
but we can't be certain yet

258
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,460
that it's the work of a demon.

259
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,370
My lord,

260
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,670
I need to go to the deceased's residence

261
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,070
to investigate further.

262
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,840
After the incident,

263
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,550
I've already sent people

264
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,410
to seal off the entire dance hall.

265
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,360
You accompany Physician Jiu for another visit.

266
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,490
Examine carefully.

267
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,040
Even if it's truly the work of a demon,

268
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,670
don't spread the word.

269
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,670
Yes.

270
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,040
Thank you, my lord.

271
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,030
What are you looking for?

272
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,280
Nothing.

273
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,160
Let's go.

274
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,960
Excuse me, officer.

275
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,560
What is it?

276
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,500
Can I take another look at that dressing mirror

277
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,790
I picked up earlier?

278
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,630
Why?

279
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,870
Because I think it looks nice.

280
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,240
Miss,

281
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,720
these are all pieces of evidence.

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Unauthorized personnel are not allowed to examine them.

283
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,980
You'd better go home quickly.

284
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,630
Officer,

285
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
how's it going inside?

286
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,720
When will Physician Jiu come out?

287
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,390
Physician Jiu

288
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,520
left a long time ago.

289
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,650
Where did he go?

290
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,920
Chief Constable Wen took him away.

291
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,480
They were in a hurry.

292
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,810
I think they went to investigate the case.

293
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,480
Thank you.

294
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,630
I can't explain it clearly anyway.

295
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,430
Let's go in and take a look first.

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,600
It's here.

297
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,450
Chief Constable Wen.

298
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,510
This is the deceased Tian Rui's room.

299
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,970
How long had it been since she last returned here?

300
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,890
What's wrong?

301
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,960
The tea strainer has grown small bugs.

302
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,600
It seems she hadn't

303
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,460
been back to clean for a long time.

304
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,270
Their troupe leader said

305
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,960
ever since Tian Rui had regained her youth,

306
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,200
she had been pursued

307
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,630
by the rich young men in the city.

308
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,360
She sang and danced tirelessly day and night,

309
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,820
and barely returned here.

310
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,270
W-What is this?

311
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,580
It's pear skin.

312
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,480
Pear skin?

313
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,590
Have you heard

314
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,590
about the legend of the jade pear?

315
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,570
It's said that if one sits alone

316
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,390
in a closed room at midnight,

317
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,910
face a mirror,

318
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,380
light two candles,

319
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,510
and peel a pear

320
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,870
while reciting the jade pear nursery rhyme,

321
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,000
then if the pear skin

322
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,440
remains intact after reciting,

323
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,550
one can summon

324
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,170
the pear-delivering demon.

325
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,080
This jade pear is also called the rejuvenating pear.

326
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,990
Once consumed,

327
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,010
it can restore youth overnight.

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,460
Restore youth overnight?

329
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,610
That does match up.

330
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
Tian Rui had always been passionate about

331
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,880
methods for maintaining health and beauty,

332
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,010
but they'd never been very effective.

333
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,760
You think she ate the jade pear?

334
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,160
Perhaps.

335
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,599
Where is her body?

336
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,640
Still at the government office.

337
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
Youhuang knows the lord is looking for you to solve the case.

338
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,750
He absolutely refuses to give me the key to the mortuary.

339
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,510
I'll go see the lord again tomorrow morning.

340
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,310
We can't wait.

341
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,990
Tell Chi Xue to go.

342
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,400
This mirror has a time limit.

343
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,430
If I don't go now, it'll be too late.

344
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,440
But if I tell him directly,

345
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,790
he might not believe me.

346
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,440
Never mind all that.

347
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,030
Friend, I'm leaving.

348
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,210
Let's get a drink another day.

349
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,590
They're asleep?

350
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,030
Are you following me?

351
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,160
I see.

352
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,710
She must have taken an immortality elixir.

353
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,350
Yes.

354
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,310
Chief,

355
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,570
you guessed right.

356
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,750
Um,

357
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,510
can I go home now?

358
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,490
Wait a moment.

359
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,730
According to this book,

360
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,590
in ancient times, there was someone called

361
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,440
Chi Songzi

362
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,810
who consumed a type of

363
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,270
immortality elixir called Ice Jade Powder.

364
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,000
From then on, he became immortal.

365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,200
He could even control the wind and rain.

366
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,030
There was also someone named Peng Zu

367
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,720
who took an immortality elixir

368
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,320
and lived for over 800 years.

369
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,480
In more recent times,

370
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,310
there was a Taoist priest in Hongzhou

371
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,370
with the surname Hu

372
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
who claimed to have taken an immortality pill

373
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
and lived for over 400 years.

374
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,920
It's said he's still alive today.

375
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,870
However, the old man

376
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,480
likes to travel all over the world,

377
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,410
making it difficult for ordinary people to find him.

378
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:02,960
Chief,

379
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,350
that's it?

380
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,680
You believe this?

381
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,280
Of course I don't believe it.

382
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,790
If such a miraculous medicine really existed,

383
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,590
how could there still be dynastic changes

384
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,920
and transfers of power?

385
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
I don't believe it,

386
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,960
but that doesn't mean others don't.

387
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,020
This book mentions

388
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,150
that some people, in pursuit of immortality,

389
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,430
become obsessed with elixirs

390
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,690
and ultimately die from poisoning

391
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,640
while bleeding profusely.

392
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,440
Tian Rui's corpse

393
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,940
aged instantly,

394
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,710
which is indeed strange.

395
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,030
I know that nowadays there are some alchemists

396
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,500
who do possess certain skills.

397
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,510
They can't produce

398
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,880
immortality elixirs,

399
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,070
but they can concoct

400
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,200
temporarily effective poison pills.

401
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,650
Perhaps Tian Rui

402
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,030
bought one of their pills.

403
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,040
Grab your things

404
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,490
and come with me.

405
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,220
Where are we going?

406
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,100
To the mortuary

407
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,580
for an autopsy.

408
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,570
Xuanye!

409
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,800
Hurry up.

410
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,320
Doing this so late

411
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,380
is such a sin.

412
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,440
Well done.

413
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,590
Did you encounter

414
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,850
any trouble on the way?

415
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,590
No trouble,

416
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
but there was a surprise.

417
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,060
What surprise?

418
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,340
I met Manniang's sister-in-law.

419
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,790
You met Banxia?

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,400
Yes.

421
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,680
How did you run into her?

422
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't know.

423
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,300
What was she doing?

424
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,150
Following me.

425
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,640
Why would she follow you?

426
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,690
To play with me.

427
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,750
Play with you?

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,500
What did you do?

429
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,990
I played with her too.

430
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,550
She followed me, trying to scare me,

431
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,940
so I left her in the mortuary.

432
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,870
That's payback.

433
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:32,960
Yan Li!

434
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,030
Yan Li!

435
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,730
Why did you fall asleep?

436
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,000
Chief.

437
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,290
If you want to sleep,

438
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,360
do it at home after resigning.

439
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,070
I wouldn't dare.

440
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,000
I wouldn't dare.

441
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,840
Next time I catch you...

442
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,070
Chief, there won't be a next time.

443
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,680
There won't be a next time, Chief Constable.

444
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm going to work now.

445
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,070
Wait a moment.

446
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,680
You're on duty at the mortuary today, right?

447
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,920
Yes, Chief Constable.

448
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,050
Open the door for me.

449
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,950
Remember this.

450
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,490
Before we come out,

451
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,720
you stay here and guard.

452
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes.

453
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,090
Don't let anyone in.

454
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,350
Yes, Chief Constable.

455
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,900
She followed me.

456
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,160
She was trying to scare me,

457
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,500
so I left her in the mortuary.

458
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,430
That's payback.

459
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Chief.

460
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,910
If the lord asks tomorrow...

461
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,830
Constable Li,

462
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,030
have you ever seen in all these years

463
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,450
a poison that can age someone overnight?

464
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,480
No.

465
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,030
If no poison is found in the stomach,

466
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
what should we do?

467
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,370
It could have been injected externally.

468
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,080
Skin, blood, and hair

469
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,110
all can be tested.

470
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,480
However,

471
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,640
she's been dead for a day.

472
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,980
It might be difficult.

473
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,020
Let's extract the stomach first.

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,730
Who's there?

475
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,800
Let's go back.

476
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,610
Alright.

477
00:26:59,170 --> 00:26:59,720
Chief!

478
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,240
The body is missing.

479
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,110
Find it!

480
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
It's alright now.

481
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,400
Come, put this on.

482
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,410
What were you doing at the government office?

483
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,000
This case is extremely tricky.

484
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,720
The culprit is likely to kill again.

485
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,180
I must investigate first.

486
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,830
As your father's matter,

487
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,960
I've kept it in mind.

488
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,380
We're here.

489
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,720
Where are you going?

490
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,100
About tonight,

491
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,550
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:10,790
Xuanye,

493
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,270
do you want some radish?

494
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,830
Rest up.

495
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,000
Xuanye!

496
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,550
Jiu Xuanye!

497
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,720
Jiu Xuanye!

498
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,550
Jiu Xuanye!

499
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,750
Xuanye!

500
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,440
Xuanye!

501
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,720
Jiu Xuanye!

502
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,080
I know you can hear me.

503
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,710
I have something to tell you.

504
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,680
Jiu Xuanye!

505
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,240
Xuanye!

506
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,480
Jiu Xuanye!

507
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,080
Jiu Xuanye!

508
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,920
Stop yelling.

509
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,370
Why are you here?

510
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,290
Didn't you call for me?

511
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,140
I didn't call you to come over.

512
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,510
Besides,

513
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,370
couldn't you have given me a heads up before coming?

514
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,280
What did you want to see me about?

515
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,390
If you don't say it, I'm leaving.

516
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,410
Wait.

517
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:16,930
Yes,

518
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm not as capable as you.

519
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,740
But compared to ordinary people,

520
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,830
I should be considered as

521
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,490
quite knowledgeable, right?

522
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,650
Over the years, I've seen flying fish,

523
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,830
talking spiders,

524
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,030
children with tails,

525
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,070
and butterflies that can pass through walls.

526
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,480
Aren't they all strange

527
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,240
and unique?

528
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
I just want to ask you.

529
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,490
Are mirrors that don't reflect people

530
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,700
also very common?

531
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,310
There was one at the fire scene in Nanyang City,

532
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,640
one in my father's room,

533
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,880
and also on at the restaurant in Guangping City.

534
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,790
Why is it that whenever it appears,

535
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,880
there's a murder?

536
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,590
I know.

537
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,790
You don't believe me.

538
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
You think I'm just missing my father

539
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
and making a fuss.

540
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,160
But now,

541
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,690
the evidence is right here.

542
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,080
If you don't believe me,

543
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,810
you should at least believe the evidence, right?

544
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,350
You went to the government office just now

545
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,440
to get this?

546
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,960
The workers said

547
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,730
it belonged to the dancer from last night.

548
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,160
I will follow this lead

549
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,590
and continue investigating.

550
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,640
As soon as I have any news about your father,

551
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,370
I'll let you know immediately.

552
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,250
Wait.

553
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,630
That's it?

554
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,840
What else do you want?

555
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,350
I want to be involved in

556
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,950
the Yanlai Restaurant case.

557
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,820
I want to find the killer with you.

558
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,170
This matter involves demons.

559
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,070
The dangers involved

560
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,730
are beyond your imagination.

561
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,960
If we find

562
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,510
the murderer who killed the dancer,

563
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,710
we can locate my father's whereabouts.

564
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
So even if what lies ahead

565
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,840
is a den of monstrous beasts,

566
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,360
I will still risk my life to venture forth.

567
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Do you like it?

568
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,480
Didn't I just

569
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
eat one recently?

570
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,920
[Chi Wangchuan]

571
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,110
It won't hurt to have another one.

572
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,260
You said before

573
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,480
that one jade pear

574
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,270
can maintain one's beauty for a year.

575
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,600
I just had one recently.

576
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,810
Why did you murder for a pear again?

577
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,650
And it was...

578
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,960
It was Tian Rui...

579
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,480
She was jealous of you.

580
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,960
She talked behind your back.

581
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,560
Shouldn't I have killed her?

582
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,350
But you...

583
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,240
But what?

584
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,280
You didn't even like her.

585
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,240
Alright.

586
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
I was wrong.

587
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,520
I promise you.

588
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,030
From now on, unless it's time...

589
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,159
I won't kill anyone.

590
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,000
You're just placating me again.

591
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
You promised before too,

592
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,440
but then you just

593
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,300
went and did whatever you wanted.

594
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,280
She's just Tian Rui.

595
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,000
Is she worth getting so upset over?

596
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,969
If you really don't eat it,

597
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,230
it'll go to waste.

598
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,320
Look.

599
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,320
What a beautiful face.

600
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,110
Who says beauty fades easily

601
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,990
and youth is hard to keep?

602
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,960
As long as I'm by your side,

603
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,710
you won't age.

604
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
You'll stay beautiful forever.

605
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,280
Always heavenly beautiful,

606
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,990
unparalleled in beauty.

607
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Recently,

608
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
there's been quite a commotion.

609
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,690
Your contract with the dance troupe is over.

610
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,770
We should also change places

611
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
and start a new life.

612
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,590
Wen Jian!

613
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,070
Xuanye is looking for you.

614
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,870
What's wrong?

615
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,830
He didn't say.

616
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,150
How about

617
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,180
I go back and ask, then come tell you?

618
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,920
No, no, no.

619
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
I'll go with you.

620
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,060
Did you steal the body?

621
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,550
Do you have any evidence?

622
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,320
Did you steal the body?

623
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,400
You...

624
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
So, you don't have any evidence.

625
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,440
If you don't have evidence, then what are you talking about?

626
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,320
If you falsely accuse me again,

627
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
be careful, I'll...

628
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,590
report you to the lord.

629
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,170
Is the body at Ganshan Clinic?

630
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,190
Xuanye is just a charlatan.

631
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,320
How can you be okay with

632
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,780
leaving the body with him?

633
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,280
Xuanye is capable.

634
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,210
You should trust him.

635
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,070
Why should I trust

636
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,070
someone who could

637
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,760
kill his own family?

638
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,230
He didn't do that.

639
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,110
Our government office has already reached a conclusion.

640
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,970
Then who did it?

641
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,960
A demon?

642
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,900
The old case has been closed.

643
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,880
There's no use in saying more.

644
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,410
If you have more questions,

645
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,450
go ask the lord.

646
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,380
Chi Xue.

647
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,110
Let me advise you one last time.

648
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,880
Demons have a strong desire for revenge.

649
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,190
Their methods are unpredictable and difficult to fathom.

650
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,120
If you insist on getting involved,

651
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,440
if anything goes wrong,

652
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,300
I may not be able to look after you.

653
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,600
It's not too late for you to back out now.

654
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,030
Let's get started already.

655
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,110
Stop dawdling.

656
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,880
Xuanye.

657
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
Someone at the government office insulted you.

658
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,710
It doesn't matter.

659
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,040
I didn't hear it anyway.

660
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,060
Why is she here too?

661
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,400
I asked her to stay here.

662
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,030
I asked you to investigate recent cases.

663
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,360
Do you have any results?

664
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,020
There is actually one.

665
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,040
The victim's death was very similar to Tian Rui's.

666
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,600
Not long ago,

667
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,760
the wife of Chief Secretary Zhang Cong

668
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,510
disappeared without reason,

669
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,550
but a mummified body appeared in their house.

670
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,110
We investigated it

671
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,030
as a disappearance,

672
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,670
but we couldn't find any clues.

673
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,000
Now that I think about it,

674
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,630
that mummified body

675
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,160
must have been Madam Zhang.

676
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,000
Xuanye,

677
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,020
didn't you say

678
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,480
eating that jade pear

679
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,070
could make one young again?

680
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,530
How come people are dying from it?

681
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,670
Because she took the child pear,

682
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,050
not the mother pear.

683
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,960
After the jade pear ripens,

684
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,000
it splits into the child pear and mother pear.

685
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,630
The Madam Zhang you just mentioned

686
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,670
and the deceased Tian Rui

687
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,730
probably both took

688
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
the child pear.

689
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,440
The effect of the child pear is short-lived.

690
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,480
It can preserve the youth of the consumer for seven days.

691
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,400
After seven days,

692
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,030
it will drain all their life force,

693
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,560
turning them into mummies.

694
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,070
But the mother pear is different.

695
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,000
After the person who took the child pear dies,

696
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,960
sorcery can be used

697
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,190
to remove their stomachs

698
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,720
and obtain the mother pear.

699
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
The mother pear will absorb

700
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,480
the vitality of the deceased.

701
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,810
If taken at this moment,

702
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,540
not only can it restore youth,

703
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,070
but it also

704
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,330
has no harm to the body.

705
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,510
So as long as one eats the mother pear,

706
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,730
one can achieve immortality

707
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,790
and eternal youth?

708
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,440
There's no such thing as immortality.

709
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,920
It just

710
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,520
lasts for a year, that's all.

711
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,400
After a year,

712
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,000
if one doesn't take another mother pear,

713
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,840
they will age

714
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,760
back to their actual age.

715
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,590
So,

716
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,030
according to what you're saying,

717
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,920
doesn't that demon

718
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,110
have to come out and murder people often?

719
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,590
Yes.

720
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,750
Her stomach is missing.

721
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,060
This... this...

722
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,000
How is this possible?

723
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,070
This... I...

724
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,800
A tree root actually grew

725
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,290
inside a human's abdomen.

726
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,730
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

727
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,030
I wouldn't believe it even if you killed me.

728
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,320
Humans have limbs and meridians.

729
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,960
Trees have branches, leaves, and vines.

730
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,190
Though they appear different,

731
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,790
the principles are similar.

732
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,190
Meridians become branches and the stomach condenses into a pear.

733
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,650
It's just a demonic spell.

734
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,070
I understand now.

735
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,360
So it's a tree demon?

736
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,920
Probably not.

737
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,830
Any demon can practice demonic spells.

738
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,190
Although this jade pear spell

739
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,920
is uncommon,

740
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,440
it's not exclusive to any particular type of demon.

741
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,590
If I knew the method,

742
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,810
I could master it too.

743
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,400
To know what kind of demon it is,

744
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,250
we need to know

745
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,880
this demon's innate talent.

746
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,030
Innate talent?

747
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,780
Chi Xue.

748
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,230
This mirror was left by Tian Rui

749
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,400
backstage at Yanlai Restaurant

750
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
before she died.

751
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,510
There were also two mirrors where Ms. Duan's father

752
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,540
had the accident.

753
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,520
This is Tian Rui's mirror...

754
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,670
This is evidence!

755
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,280
How did it end up with you?

756
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,110
It's nothing more than

757
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,770
an ordinary mirror, isn't it?

758
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,200
What's wrong with it?

759
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,360
Its effect has already worn off.

760
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,280
Last night,

761
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,370
it couldn't reflect human images.

762
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,320
If I'm not mistaken,

763
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,450
after the demon used this mirror,

764
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,320
it could only reflect objects,

765
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,680
not people anymore.

766
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,760
But after some time,

767
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,010
it restored itself.

768
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,880
The demon used this mirror?

769
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,840
How did the demon use it?

770
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,400
As a path.

771
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,430
It used this mirror

772
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,060
as a path for free movement.

773
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,840
Using mirrors to come and go as it pleases

774
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,590
is definitely not

775
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,720
an ordinary method.

776
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,280
This time,

777
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,960
we might have encountered

778
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,620
an enlightened Mirror Demon.

779
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,630
A Mirror Demon? Then...

780
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,630
How do we catch it?

781
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,520
We'll catch it like how

782
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,950
the victims summoned it.

783
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
By peeling pears?

784
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,530
Bronze mirror,

785
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,250
red candle,

786
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,670
pear, at 11:45 PM.

787
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,660
We need to do the whole ritual

788
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,460
without missing a single thing.

789
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,550
And this place won't do.

790
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,840
We need to find an empty house,

791
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,670
preferably one that's been uninhabited for a long time,

792
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,930
with a weak human aura.

793
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,090
I can arrange that.

794
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,680
What else do we need?

795
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
We also need bait,

796
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,280
preferably a woman.

797
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,070
A woman?

798
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,960
It's already time.

799
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,110
Why hasn't the boss arrived yet?

800
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,710
He should be here any moment.

801
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,110
Ji Li.

802
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,220
Come, sit down.

803
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:23,800
Sit.

804
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,460
Today, I specially

805
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,860
brewed a pot of fine tea.

806
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,450
It's top-quality tea.

807
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,550
I'd like to share it with you.

808
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,110
Come,

809
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,400
let's chat while we enjoy it.

810
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,050
Please.

811
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,740
Ji Li,

812
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,510
you've been working at Yunmen Dance Troupe

813
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,370
for almost five years now, right?

814
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,920
It will be five years in half a month.

815
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,070
Today, I am

816
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,910
putting my dignity on the line

817
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,480
to ask you a favor.

818
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,550
Please help me for another two years,

819
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,070
alright?
