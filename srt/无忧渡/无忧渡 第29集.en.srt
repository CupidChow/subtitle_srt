[Episode 29]

3
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,120
Young master.

4
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
You're awake.

5
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,890
How are you?

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,150
Are you feeling better?

7
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,550
Is there any discomfort?

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,690
Your clothes

9
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,590
are inside.

10
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,130
I'll go get them for you.

11
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,980
Young master, please have a seat.

12
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,190
I've tidied up

13
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,470
your clothes for you.

14
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,120
Please rest easy and recover.

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,870
Our master

16
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,420
knows a bit about medicine.

17
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,910
You were trapped in a fire.

18
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,750
It was a neighbour from the village

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,460
who rescued you and brought you here.

20
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,390
You can stay here and rest assured.

21
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,850
There are more.

22
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,650
There are these too.

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Young master, you must be starving.

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
There's still hot food on the stove.

25
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll bring it to you.

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Please wait a moment.

27
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,220
Man Ying.

28
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,740
What are you looking at?

29
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,940
You seem so absorbed.

30
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,380
Mr. Bai's farewell letter.

31
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,010
Farewell letter?

32
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,020
He said in a couple of days,

33
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,620
he'll be leaving Guangping.

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,310
You've seen him?

35
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,470
I have.

36
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,280
Did you take action?

37
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,120
Am I really just

38
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,810
a cold-blooded,

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,500
ruthless killer in your eyes?

40
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,400
No.

41
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,510
Then why is he suddenly leaving

42
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,910
when everything's fine?

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,390
Why are you so concerned about him?

44
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,570
I just think

45
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,470
he's not a bad person.

46
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,459
He doesn't deserve

47
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,459
a miserable fate.

48
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,630
You've only met him a few times,

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,680
and you already think he's not bad?

50
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,140
He's not bad to begin with.

51
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,980
Yesterday,

52
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,590
I went to Fa'en Temple.

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
So you're saying

54
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,450
there are two Mr. Bai?

55
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,890
One is the snake demon Chilian,

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,380
and the other is Xingxian?

57
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,990
That's right.

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,530
No wonder

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,870
sometimes I felt

60
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,130
he was very close to me.

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,540
The one you're familiar with

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,850
should be Xingxian.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,860
Surprising, isn't it?

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,820
I didn't expect it either.

65
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,340
A snake demon who had never done evil

66
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,140
actually killed two people

67
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,250
for her sake,

68
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,320
and even used the snake slough

69
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,180
to help her change her appearance

70
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,620
to evade the authorities' investigation.

71
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,040
This snake demon treats Xingxian so well.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
No matter how well, killing is still wrong.

73
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm not trying to make things difficult for him.

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,620
It's just that demons live longer

75
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,950
and are more powerful.

76
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,000
Ordinary people can compare to them.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,350
If they want to kill,

78
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,120
a mortal's life hangs

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,630
on their whim.

80
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,950
So it's hard for them to see human life

81
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,430
as something precious.

82
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,920
Since he had a reason

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
to kill the first person,

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,310
it's very likely that, in the future,

85
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,560
he uses the same reason

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,890
to kill a second person,

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,730
even a third.

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
So we absolutely cannot let it be

89
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,900
and allow him to act as he pleases.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,550
No one is born a sage,

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,970
and no one

92
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,030
can always distinguish right from wrong.

93
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,380
Let alone a demon.

94
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,850
Alright, alright.

95
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,940
Hurry up and eat.

96
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,470
You talk too much.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,130
You're even more naggy than my father.

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,310
Sir.

99
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,710
Are you going out?

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
Aren't we leaving in a couple of days?

101
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,540
I thought I'd go visit the neighbours

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,680
to bid farewell.

103
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,580
What about you?

104
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,090
Are you going to Liushui Pavilion today?

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,000
I have to.

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,310
After all, I've known the owner for many years.

107
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,240
Before leaving,

108
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,140
I should at least say goodbye.

109
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,880
Then I'll be going now.

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,630
Be careful on your way.

111
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,560
Come back early.

112
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,400
[Puji]

113
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,630
Your faithful devotee, Xingxian, is grateful for the Bodhisattva's blessings,

114
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,720
and have come specially to fulfil my vow.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,220
Although the act of solving my troubles

116
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,680
did not come directly from the Bodhisattva,

117
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,800
without you,

118
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,480
I would never have had the courage

119
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
to speak out all that was in my heart,

120
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,560
nor the wisdom

121
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,070
to understand where my true heart lies.

122
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,870
There would never have been

123
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,159
the Xingxian of today.

124
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Your great kindness,

125
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,960
your faithful devotee will never forget.

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,960
This is a small token of my appreciation.

127
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,770
I hope you won't refuse it, sir.

128
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,190
I can't accept it.

129
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Please accept it.

130
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,409
All these years,

131
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,080
if it weren't for Mr. Bai's support,

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,210
my Liushui Pavilion

133
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,160
wouldn't have the reputation it has today.

134
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,190
Just consider this small token of appreciation

135
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,950
as some

136
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,610
extra money for your journey.

137
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,830
I hope, sir,

138
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,440
you won't refuse it.

139
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,260
Although I'm just an ordinary person,

140
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,270
I can still tell that your Qin playing is excellent.

141
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,310
As you travel the world in the future,

142
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,270
more people

143
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,510
will hear your music.

144
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm happy for you,

145
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,240
and for those people as well.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,070
I hope he dies.

147
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,880
The reason he's still alive

148
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
is because I saved him, isn't it?

149
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,470
Mr. Bai.

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,049
You must be busy.

151
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,250
I won't take up more of your time.

152
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,850
Well then,

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,430
I'll use tea instead of wine

154
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,360
to wish you all the best

155
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,940
and a safe journey.

156
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,760
Then, let's bid farewell here.

157
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,490
Your faithful devotee, Xingxian,

158
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,370
once made three wishes here.

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,750
Now they have all come true.

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I shouldn't be greedy anymore.

161
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
But now,

162
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,510
I have one last wish.

163
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,000
However, this time,

164
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,870
I won't ask for your help.

165
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,350
Please forgive me, Bodhisattva.

166
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,370
This time,

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,140
I'll do it myself.

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,270
Sir,

169
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,960
why are you here?

170
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,660
I've been waiting for you.

171
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,270
Don't you like the apricot blossom wine

172
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,700
from that tavern at the foot of the mountain?

173
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,100
I specially bought some.

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Oh, right,

175
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,770
there's also some marinated duck.

176
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,630
It'll be perfect to go with the wine when we get back.

177
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,850
Let's go.

178
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,890
Sir,

179
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,590
the dishes are all ready.

180
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,580
It looks so sumptuous.

181
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,620
We're leaving tomorrow,

182
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,550
so let's have a good meal tonight.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Come,

184
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,030
try this.

185
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,150
I heard this is a cooking method

186
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,720
that originated from Jiangnan.

187
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,630
The duck meat is tender,

188
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,290
and even the bones are crispy.

189
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,670
Not bad.

190
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,880
When we get to Jiangnan,

191
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,380
we'll have the even more authentic ones.

192
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,370
Alright.

193
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,270
When I said goodbye to Shopkeeper Song today,

194
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,050
he mentioned

195
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,930
several Qin masters in Jiangnan,

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and even drafted a few visiting cards for me.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,330
When we reach Jiangnan,

198
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,600
let's visit and learn from them together.

199
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,070
Your Qin playing has a unique style.

200
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,830
It's clear and melodious,

201
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,570
gentle but not cloying.

202
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,870
I really like it.

203
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,880
I don't think I've asked before,

204
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,390
who did you learn to play the Qin from?

205
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,090
It was my mother.

206
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,400
She was originally a Qin master.

207
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,520
Although she was making a living in the marketplace,

208
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,250
she was quite well-known

209
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,090
and respected.

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,910
Later,

211
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,240
she fell in love at first sight

212
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,670
with my merchant father.

213
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,390
Two years after their marriage,

214
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,390
I came into being.

215
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,810
Unfortunately, the good times didn't last long.

216
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,690
When I was six years old,

217
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,810
my father's business failed.

218
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,840
He then took out his frustration

219
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,390
on my mother.

220
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,090
He constantly berated her for her humble origins,

221
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,150
saying she couldn't help the family.

222
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,570
As time went on,

223
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,240
my mother stopped playing the Qin.

224
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,290
Eventually,

225
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,870
my younger brother was born.

226
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,320
My mother seemed to believe

227
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
that my brother was a lucky star.

228
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,080
She thought that

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,530
the family's fortune got better

230
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,990
all because of my brother.

231
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,320
So she joined my father

232
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,630
in belittling me,

233
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,030
and forbade me from touching the Qin again.

234
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,840
But you know what?

235
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,240
I really wanted to play the Qin again.

236
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,590
Don't cry.

237
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,720
You'll definitely be able to

238
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,520
play the Qin again in the future.

239
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,510
I will.

240
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,550
Heaven has given me this wretched life,

241
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,250
not so I could wallow in self-pity.

242
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,120
I will do what I want to do,

243
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,500
and play the Qin I want to play.

244
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,510
Sir.

245
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,750
Sir,

246
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
why aren't you drinking?

247
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,650
WIth the moonlight weeping

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,420
I shall play a tune.

249
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,770
Would you like to listen?

250
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,030
Alright.

251
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,860
♫The sun rises, shining bright♫

252
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,580
♫Its brilliance blazing♫

253
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,730
♫By chance, I glimpse my loved one♫

254
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,280
♫Reflected in my eyes♫

255
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,990
♫The moon ascends, glowing white♫

256
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,000
♫Its glow serene and clear♫

257
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,990
♫Again, I glimpse her♫

258
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,890
♫Reflected in my eyes♫

259
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
I told you before

260
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,250
that this was a lost old tune.

261
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,660
Actually, I lied to you.

262
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,270
This piece

263
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,010
was composed by me,

264
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,820
written for an old friend.

265
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,730
♫Torturous lovesickness♫

266
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,170
I caught a glimpse of my loved one,

267
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,230
♫Yet mutual confession is even harder♫

268
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,380
and my heart leaps with joy.

269
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,150
She haunts my soul and dreams,

270
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,270
and lingers in my thoughts ever since.

271
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:05,140
♫Drifting like a willow in the wind, yearning for a good ending♫

272
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,200
Because my heart is bound,

273
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,910
no matter the storm or gale,

274
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,230
♫Side by side, we share a gaze too deep for words♫

275
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,880
harsh frost or cold snow,

276
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,120
I just want to see her once,

277
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,630
even if it's just a glimpse from afar.

278
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:17,990
♫Keep silent with no regrets♫

279
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,150
Although I have to endure countless hardships,

280
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,480
I'll never be tired of it.

281
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:24,520
♫Share days and nights with you♫

282
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,880
Xingxian.

♫In exchange for a lifelong deep love♫

284
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,910
Are you glad

285
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,200
to have known me?

286
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,460
♫Entwined through the endless night♫

289
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
I'm happy too.

290
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:51,010
♫Share days and nights with you♫

291

♫With no regrets, only joy in this life♫

295
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,390
When did I get this?

296
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,010
Why haven't I worn it before?

297
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,200
My Lady,

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,010
you still have the mood to dress up?

299
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,780
At a time like this?

300
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,150
The engagement withdrawal

301
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,510
is still up in the air,

302
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,330
and you're not worried at all?

303
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,340
Then what do you think?

304
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,170
If it were up to me,

305
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,870
I would urge the master

306
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,200
to break off the engagement immediately.

307
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,200
I've already spoken clearly

308
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,110
with Li Xian and Father about this matter.

309
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,440
He's still not taking any action.

310
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
What else can I do?

311
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,320
My Lady.

312
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,050
Why don't you just tell Master

313
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,290
that you and Physician Jiu are in love

314
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,710
and have sealed the deal.

315
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,870
What nonsense are you talking about?

316
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,870
At worst, Physician Jiu

317
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,930
will get a beating.

318
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,140
After all, he's

319
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,180
our Duan family's saviour.

320
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,079
The master can't beat him too severely, right?

321
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,450
Besides, Physician Jiu

322
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,780
knows martial arts.

323
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,450
A little physical pain,

324
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
he can surely endure.

325
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,319
What on earth are you thinking?

326
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,160
Uncle.

327
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,880
Uncle Duan.

328
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,990
Xian.

329
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,520
Have some tea.

330
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,110
Xian,

331
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,650
what are you doing?

332
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,830
Get up and speak.

333
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,690
I have failed you both, uncle and aunt.

334
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,890
I have failed Banxia.

335
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,660
I am too ashamed to stand up.

336
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,440
Good child,

337
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,160
what exactly happened?

338
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,430
Recently,

339
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,750
I've been unable to sleep at night,

340
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,950
tossing and turning.

341
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,550
But after careful consideration,

342
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,510
I still want to express

343
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,570
what's in my heart.

344
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,070
Uncle.

345
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,640
Aunt.

346
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,560
I want to break off the engagement with Banxia.

347
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,640
My family has been in business for three generations,

348
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,720
and they've built this successful enterprise

349
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,550
with much hard work.

350
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,020
to support my education and career.

351
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,150
I indeed carry many expectations

352
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,080
on my shoulders.

353
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,680
Hence, in the future, I plan to devote my energy

354
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,010
to my political career,

355
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,210
to work diligently as an official,

356
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,670
and make a name for myself.

357
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,590
As for the matter of marriage...

358
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,000
Banxia is gentle and virtuous,

359
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,360
clever and intelligent.

360
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,180
She will surely find

361
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,440
a husband a hundred times better than me.

362
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,120
I beg you, uncle and aunt, to grant my request.

363
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,680
To become a high-ranking official,

364
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,300
and bring honour to one's ancestors.

365
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,460
There's no man in this world

366
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,240
who wouldn't be moved by such an ambition.

367
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,570
I can understand your grand aspirations.

368
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,260
But your father...

369
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,790
As for my father,

370
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,520
I will explain everything clearly to him myself.

371
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,310
Well,

372
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,700
what about others?

373
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,210
Uncle, please don't worry.

374
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,030
To the outside world,

375
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,110
I will say it's due to my personal reasons

376
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,240
that I cannot marry.

377
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,030
I will not tarnish

378
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,290
Banxia's reputation.

379
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,960
I am wholeheartedly committed to becoming an official

380
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,290
and serving my country.

381
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,810
I sincerely ask for your approval.

382
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,270
Xian,

383
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,240
please stand up.

384
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,210
My dear Xian,

385
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,400
your determination is admirable.

386
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,130
How could I not grant your wish?

387
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,480
If all the men in the world

388
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,550
were like you,

389
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,720
it would truly be a blessing for the common people.

390
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,550
Uncle, you are so understanding.

391
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,880
I am ashamed to face you.

392
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,540
This matter

393
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,310
is due to our lack of consideration.

394
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,270
It has nothing to do with you.

395
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,470
No, no, it's my fault.

396
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,280
It's my lack of consideration.

397
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
Although I don't know

398
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,180
what you're thinking,

399
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,440
I still want to thank you.

400
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,930
If you really want to thank me,

401
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,270
you can help me with something.

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,590
Xuanye,

403
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,110
please accept my bow.

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,790
Since childhood, I have longed for

405
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,350
the art of seeking immortality and enlightenment.

406
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,440
I even shaved my head

407
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,510
to enter a monastery for cultivation.

408
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,640
But unfortunately,

409
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,790
I was still caught and brought back home by my father.

410
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,920
he even deceived me,

411
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
saying there were no deities

412
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,350
or demons in this world,

413
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,070
and it was all just to fool children.

414
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,240
But as I grew older,

415
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,200
I gradually began to think it was all false.

416
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,350
So I gradually gave up on the idea

417
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,880
and focused on my political career.

418
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,740
Until that day,

419
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,960
I saw you.

420
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,160
Master.

421
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,270
You fought the willow spirit in the stone forest.

422
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,790
With just one move,

423
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,070
you made it reveal its true form.

424
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,310
I saw it clearly.

425
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,080
Then you reasoned with it,

426
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,960
appealed to its emotions,

427
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,870
and with just a few words,

428
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,480
you made it willingly leave Guangping

429
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,780
and avoided a conflict.

430
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,910
From that moment on,

431
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,160
the raging fire in my heart

432
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,220
was ignited by you.

433
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,880
I knew

434
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,350
that was what I had been seeking all my life.

435
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,510
I must follow you.

436
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,620
Please, Master, accept me as your disciple.

437
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,480
Wait.

438
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,020
Master's wife,

439
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,070
things are not going well on my end.

440
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,330
Could you please put in a good word for me?

441
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,540
Master's wife.

442
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,580
Master's wife.

443
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,170
Master's wife?

444
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,640
Indeed.

445
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,210
Master may not know.

446
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,740
I just went to the Duan family

447
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,510
and called off this absurd marriage.

448
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,370
From now on,

449
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,200
the master's wife and I will go our separate ways,

450
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,590
and have nothing to do with each other.

451
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,980
Of course,

452
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,160
I truly didn't know before

453
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,790
that you two have such a relationship.

454
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,090
Otherwise, even if I had ten times the courage,

455
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,000
I wouldn't dare to do

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
such a disrespectful thing.

457
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,350
Fortunately, I came to my senses in time.

458
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,750
Otherwise, I might have

459
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,530
severed this bond with you, Master.

460
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,960
Please accept me as your disciple.

461
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
Wait, wait, wait.

462
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,400
The main issue is that my knowledge is limited.

463
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
I really can't teach you.

464
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
Master,

465
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,750
please don't make excuses.

466
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,310
Your skills,

467
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,920
I saw them clearly that day.

468
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
Of course, I understand.

469
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,920
A master like you

470
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
might be reluctant to take on disciples.

471
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
But Master, I'm different.

472
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,830
Today,

473
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,400
I've come with a do-or-die determination.

474
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
I must, absolutely must, follow you.

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,060
If you don't agree,

476
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,310
I'll kneel until I die

477
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,970
outside this Ganshan Clinic.

478
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,960
Hold on.

479
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,310
Don't you hold an official position?

480
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,770
How can you focus on spiritual cultivation?

481
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,410
Are you worried about this?

482
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,790
Please don't worry, Master.

483
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,310
I will inform my parents tomorrow

484
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,240
that I'll resign from my position.

485
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,480
Oh, right.

486
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,790
Weren't you aiming to become a high-ranking minister?

487
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,030
That was merely rhetoric

488
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,000
to deceive Uncle.

489
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,480
Master,

490
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,700
please don't take it seriously.

491
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,920
Moreover,

492
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,550
I truly find this official position

493
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,080
completely unsatisfying.

494
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,870
My ambitions lie elsewhere.

495
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,840
I've decided

496
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,930
to follow you for life, Master.

497
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,290
Do you have any other requirements, Master?

498
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,130
Master's wife.

499
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,680
Master's wife.

500
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,540
That's enough.

501
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,480
Xuanye,

502
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,710
why don't you

503
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,920
consider him?

504
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,040
Pour the tea.

505
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,480
Offer the tea to your master.

506
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,460
Thank you, Master.

507
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,300
[Ganshan Clinic]

508
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,510
Master.

509
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,210
Master's wife,

510
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,310
I will set off for home tomorrow.

511
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,370
I wonder if you two elders

512
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,500
would be available

513
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,480
to see me off?

514
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,920
"You two elders"?

515
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,450
Alright,

516
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,610
it's getting late.

517
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,480
Go pack your things quickly.

518
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,030
I take my leave, Master.

519
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:07,930
Wait,

520
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,360
you're really taking him as your disciple?

521
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,270
What else?

522
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,060
Should I let you, the master's wife,

523
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,120
marry him instead?

524
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,960
What did you say?

525
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,680
Master's wife?

526
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:26,900
It's me.

[Jude Restaurant]

528
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,720
I have been staying in Guangping

529
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,850
for over a month now.

530
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,950
My parents have written to me several times,

531
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,160
urging me to return home.

532
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,960
I really can't delay any longer.

533
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,160
Master,

534
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,540
once I return home,

535
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,340
meet my parents,

536
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,270
and resign from my official position,

537
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,600
I'll immediately come back to follow you.

538
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,160
There's no need to rush like that.

539
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,480
You can spend more time with your parents at home.

540
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,410
How can I do that?

541
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,960
Of course, learning the art comes first.

542
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,590
Since I've already taken you as my master,

543
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,310
it's only natural that I follow you

544
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,970
and focus on learning, right?

545
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,160
You've really taken on

546
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,090
a studious disciple, haven't you?

547
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Young master,

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,850
it's time to depart.

549
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,600
Alright.

550
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,480
Well then.

551
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,480
Master.

thank you.

His father won't allow him to resign from his position.

557
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,920
I guess he won't be able

558
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,030
to come back anytime soon.

559
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,830
You don't need to worry anymore.

560
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:39,870
Everyone,

561
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,910
please wait.

562
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,350
Take care, Lord Gu.

563
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,640
Take care, Lord Gu.

Is there something

565
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,010
I can help you two with?

566
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Where's Chilian?

567
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,680
You...

568
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
You already know?

569
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,630
Well, since that's the case,

570
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,520
I won't hide the truth from you.

571
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,590
Actually, my husband, Zhang Pu,

572
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,020
is not as bad as

573
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,170
the neighbours say.

574
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,170
Our relationship was very close.

575
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,660
My husband treated me very well,

576
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,580
but he loved to drink.

577
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,400
He often drank too much.

578
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,920
When he gets drunk,

579
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,640
he would inevitably become a bit irritable.

580
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,680
But you know,

581
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
aren't all men like that?

582
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,700
But that damn snake demon Chilian,

583
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,230
he took a liking to me.

584
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,490
When I refused him,

585
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,770
he killed my husband,

586
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,890
and even forcibly abducted me

587
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,420
to transform me into his current appearance,

588
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,480
forcing me to stay by his side

589
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
as his substitute.

590
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,240
You can

591
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,230
testify to this.

592
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,350
The last time you came to visit,

593
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,790
the person you saw was me.

594
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,270
I was also

595
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,880
forced to deceive you

596
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,570
under his threats and intimidation.

597
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,680
You mean,

598
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,130
all of this was forced upon you by him?

599
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,160
Yes.

600
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,840
Your husband treated you well, didn't he?

601
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,680
Yes.

602
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
My poor husband.

603
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,730
So where is Chilian now?

604
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,440
Dead.

605
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,960
He kept forcing me to do things for him.

606
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,000
I couldn't bear the humiliation anymore,

607
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,330
and wanted to avenge my husband even more.

608
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,370
So I asked a snake catcher,

609
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,700
used the method he gave me

610
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,460
and fed Chi Lian realgar wine.

611
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,670
After he drank the medicinal wine,

612
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,530
he indeed revealed his true form.

613
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
I was very scared,

614
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,640
but I knew I couldn't back down.

615
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Otherwise, I would be the one dying.

616
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,310
I took advantage of the moment when the wine took effect,

617
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,570
and stabbed his vital point with a knife,

618
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,380
killing him.

619
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,830
Now his body

620
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,480
is inside that box

621
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,590
in the courtyard.

622
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,640
As you two can see,

623
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,680
I am now in this state.

624
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,110
Although I have already killed my enemy with my own hands,

625
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,920
my life

626
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,890
can never go back to what it was.

627
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,820
So I'm leaving Guangping

628
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,880
to start a new life.

629
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Thank you both.

630
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,230
Although I was still no match for the cunning demon,

631
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,440
your kindness

632
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,970
will be remembered by Xingxian.

633
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,040
Lord Gu must be getting impatient.

634
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
Let's part ways here.

635
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,990
It seems that the snake catcher

636
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,910
Xingxian found

637
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,690
knows some snake-catching techniques,

638
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,750
but doesn't know how to catch demons.

639
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,070
Chilian has practiced asceticism for many years,

640
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,830
and has also devoted himself to studying Buddhism.

641
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,660
There's no trace of demon aura left on him.

642
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,660
Ordinary methods won't work on him.

643
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,490
Even if realgar is used on him,

644
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
it won't be fatal.

645
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,270
So does that mean he's not dead?

646
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,270
He's deceiving Xingxian, isn't he?

647
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,920
I suppose so.

648
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,520
[Blossoms by Day, Moonlight by Dusk]

649
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,370
Then why does he want to fake his death?

650
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,210
To take revenge on Xingxian?

651
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,860
If he wanted revenge,

652
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,000
why would he go to such lengths?

653
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,510
He probably wants to put Xingxian's mind at ease.

654
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,200
He wants Xingxian to believe

655
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,100
that Chilian no longer exists in this world,

656
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,030
that there's no longer a person called Mr. Bai.

657
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,590
This way,

658
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,590
Xingxian can

659
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,990
take over this identity,

660
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,060
and have this life all to herself.

661
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,680
She can do whatever she wants,

662
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,340
and live the life she desires.

663
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,550
It's just a pity,

664
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,440
a pity for Chilian's Qin skills.

665
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,350
From now on,

666
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,070
he might never play the Qin again.

667
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,370
He's been so good to Xingxian,

668
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,170
yet this is how it ends for him.

669
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,160
I guess

670
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,590
Xingxian must have

671
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,030
helped Chilian in the past.

672
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,950
So all of this

673
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,640
is likely of his own will.

674
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,370
But this is so unfair.

675
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,920
Regardless,

676
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,730
Chilian did commit murders after all.

677
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,490
To have this outcome today

678
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,520
is considered not bad at all.

679
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,590
The bonds of grudges and grievances unravelled

680
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,510
and the shackles of obsession broken free.

681
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,110
Perhaps,

682
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,380
he has already left Guangping.

683
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,790
In this vast world of mortals,

684
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,650
with boundless skies and waters,

685
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,740
he will surely find

686
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,980
someone who truly cares for him.

687
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,210
It's you again.

688
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,110
Although I was lucky to survive,

689
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,920
I still suffered severe injuries.

690
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,680
Years of cultivation

691
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,440
have been destroyed in an instant.

692
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
I no longer possess such strong magical powers

693
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,050
to protect you anymore.

694
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,240
Why are you still following me?

695
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,530
You're very angry?

696
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,960
What's there to be angry about?

697
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,400
That demon hunter

698
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,530
was actually right.

699
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,530
I fought evil with evil,

700
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,320
and committed acts of killing.

701
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,810
Naturally, I must face the consequences.

702
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,750
In fact, heaven

703
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,150
has not been unkind to me.

704
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,430
At least I'm still alive now,

705
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,650
allowing me to start anew.

706
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,750
Alright,

707
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,330
stop following me.

708
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,290
You're busted, Commissioner.

709
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,120
I've been feeling

710
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,580
something was off lately.

711
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,320
You were faking it after all.

712
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,270
I...

713
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,000
I just woke up.

714
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm dizzy.

715
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,800
Alright, stop pretending.

716
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:16,960
The smell of your braised duck

717
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,690
has spread all over the street.

718
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,790
Where did you hide it?

719
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,680
Really?

720
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,930
I didn't smell anything.

721
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,480
Don't say you didn't eat it.

722
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,890
I didn't eat it.

723
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,920
The chicken leg from yesterday,

724
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,400
the ribs from the day before,

725
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,640
and the braised pork hock from three days ago.

726
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,970
Were they eaten by a dog?

727
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
Dog?

728
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,310
Right.

729
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,350
I ate them.

730
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,880
So what?

731
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,750
I'm a patient.

732
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,640
Shouldn't I eat a bit more

733
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,440
to nourish myself?

734
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,000
Besides,

735
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,830
look at the kind of food

736
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,060
you feed me every day.

737
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,110
Thin porridge for breakfast,

738
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,880
thin porridge for lunch,

739
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,470
and still thin porridge for dinner.

740
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,600
You're a patient.

741
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,750
Patients can only have liquid food.

742
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,480
Moreover,

743
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,310
didn't I give you pickles?

744
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,240
Two kinds, even.

745
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,790
Right.

746
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,310
I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

747
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,360
Those pickles of yours,

748
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,550
they're so salty they could kill a dog.

749
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,750
Is this even fit for human consumption?

750
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,450
Sima Lingying,

751
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,920
eat it or not, it's up to you.

752
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,450
No one's forcing you to eat.

753
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,960
I'm taking care of you out of kindness,

754
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,150
and now I'm the one at fault?

755
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,000
Don't think I don't know

756
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,260
what you're thinking.

757
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,610
You want to stay here

758
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
and make me marry you.

759
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,730
I'm telling you, no way.

760
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,909
I already have someone I like.

761
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,310
Who?

762
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,670
It couldn't be

763
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,550
Banxia, could it?

764
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,860
Yes,

765
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:31,940
it is Banxia.

766
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,860
I'm not afraid to tell you.

767
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,270
In the null,

768
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,190
I am the county commandant

769
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,710
and she is my bride-to-be.

770
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,730
We are in love

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,330
and have pledged ourselves to each other.

772
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,760
In the null?

773
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,350
Why don't you say in your dreams?

774
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,670
The null... The null may be fake,

775
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,870
but the feelings are real.

776
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,469
Fine, the feelings are real.

777
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,590
Have you asked Banxia?

778
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,659
Does she feel the same way?

779
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,710
There's no need to ask.

780
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,960
She's in my heart,

781
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,500
so naturally, I'm in hers too.

782
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,100
Youhuang.

783
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,920
Youhuang.

784
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,760
Sima.

785
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,200
You're awake?

786
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,480
Indeed.

787
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,630
It's time to wake up.

788
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,800
You sure have perseverance.

789
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
You laid here for so long,

790
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,130
you even gained weight.

791
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,220
I have

792
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,440
some good news for you two.

793
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,970
Xuanye is getting married.

794
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,480
Then,

795
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,000
who's the bride?

796
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,760
Who else could it be?

797
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,090
It's Banxia, of course.

798
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,710
Ban-

799
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,710
Banxia.

800
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,320
You've been exposed, haven't you, Chief Constable Chu?

801
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,960
What's wrong? What's wrong?

802
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,290
Have some pickles.

803
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,340
No, I don't understand.

804
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,070
Why did you tell Wen Jian and the others

805
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,630
that we're getting engaged?

806
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,690
You haven't even asked me about this.

807
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,320
I went to see your father.

808
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,880
He was the one who set the date.

809
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,740
But you didn't discuss it with me.

810
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,070
You don't agree?

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,090
Why are you angry?

812
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,910
Why are you upset?

813
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,160
Why are you sitting here?

814
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,230
What's wrong with me sitting here?

815
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,430
This isn't your seat.

816
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,710
Well, we're getting married,

817
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,400
Forget about your seat,

818
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,990
this whole house is mine.

819
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,510
Your name isn't carved here.

820
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,310
How can you prove it's all yours?

821
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,560
You want names carved, huh?

822
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,190
Fine.

823
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's carve names.

824
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Xuanye,

825
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,680
do something about her.

826
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,630
I actually think

827
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,940
it's carved quite nicely.

828
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,980
[Banxia]

829
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,990
Don't be angry anymore.

830
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,630
You can't make decisions

831
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,290
on your own like this anymore.

832
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,000
I just wanted to

833
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,930
get your father's approval first.

834
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,960
I didn't expect that the old man

835
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,620
is so decisive and efficient.

836
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,550
The very next day, he have found someone

837
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,010
to set an auspicious date.

838
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,400
You know well, that

839
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,230
your father used to work as an official in the government

840
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,430
and is good friends with Clerk Yang Lin.

841
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,300
He was the one who told Clerk Yang,

842
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,880
who then told Wen Jian.

843
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,750
Wen Jian then came to ask me,

844
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,110
so what could I say?

845
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,540
Well, you could at least

846
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,740
discuss it with me first, couldn't you?

847
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,590
I thought we had

848
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,320
already agreed on this before.

849
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,110
You...

850
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,800
Alright.

851
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,250
It's all my fault.

852
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,080
Even if we had agreed,

853
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,110
I should have formally

854
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,040
asked you again.

855
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,550
Banxia,

856
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,110
we've known each other for so long.

857
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,550
You know me well.

858
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,180
I'm merely a fighter.

859
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,050
Both my parents died

860
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,020
and my brother is gone as well.

861
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,740
I have no accomplishments

862
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,150
nor talent.

863
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,340
I just look after this medicine shop,

864
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,520
catching demons and monsters every day.

865
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,180
Life isn't easy for me either.

866
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,590
But I can

867
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,910
swear with my life.

868
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,660
if you are willing to marry me,

869
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,680
I will treat you sincerely

870
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,290
for the rest of my life,

871
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,230
do my utmost

872
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,330
to make you happy and content.

873
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,260
No matter what dangers may come in the future,

874
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,590
I will fight with my life

875
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,560
to protect you completely.

876
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,000
So,

877
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,260
are you willing to believe me

878
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,070
and marry me?

879
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Why do you make it sound so scary?

880
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,060
Will you or won't you?

881
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,000
Let me think about it.

882
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,110
How long do you need to think?

883
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,160
I just started thinking.

884
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,150
It's okay.

885
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,120
I can wait a bit longer.

886
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,980
Take your time to consider it.

887
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,830
Is three days enough?

888
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,760
Dream on.

889
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Are you hoping that

890
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,050
while I'm considering,

891
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,450
you can change your mind?

892
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
I've agreed to it.

893
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,440
What?

894
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,760
I said I've agreed.

895
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,830
I'll marry you.

896
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,600
♫When you're in love, your smile is like the spring breeze♫

897
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,110
You've tried to snatch me as a bride so many times,

898
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,480
who else could I marry if not you?

It took you so long to come up.

922
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,830
Wait a moment.

923
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,730
My father bought these dates from the East Market.

924
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,390
They're very sweet. Try some.

925
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,800
How did you get up here?

926
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Is there a ladder?

927
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,630
No.

928
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,000
There are two stools.

929
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,400
Tingzhou is holding them steady.

930
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,590
My Lady, please come down quickly.

931
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,520
It's dangerous.

932
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,360
Be careful.

933
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,200

It won't digest if we eat now.

941
