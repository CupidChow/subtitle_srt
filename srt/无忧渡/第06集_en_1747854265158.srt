1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,860
But...

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,980
The game Nightmare exhausts the game like this...

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,380
Thought i tried to acrylic?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,080
It's ban English part because there was no meaning.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,120
grandfather...

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,440
I kitten!!

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,320
What are you chewing!!!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

9
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
little bit of a

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
little bit of a

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
little bit of a

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
little bit of a

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
little bit of a

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
little bit of a

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
little bit of a

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
little bit of a

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
little bit of a

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
little bit of a

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
little bit of a

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
little bit of a

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
little bit of a

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
little bit of a

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
little bit of a

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,660
little bit of a

27
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,240
little bit of a

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,360
little bit of a little ye

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,360
n에도

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,160
Please help me for two more years, okay?

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,860
I understand. I understand everything.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,960
When Miss Ji Li came to the Five Directions, she was already determined to die.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,360
The period of her life was only five years. Five years later, she was able to enter and exit freely.

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
I remember everything.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,960
It's just that right now, I really don't have a way.

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,560
Ji Li, you say, just look at our five years of friendship.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,160
You can't leave now.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,960
If you leave now, it's like you're tearing my stage apart.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,960
We have to think of a way to help Yunmen Wu Fang get through this period.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Right?

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
Sect Leader, I...

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,960
Miss, please.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,760
Let me think about it.

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Okay.

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,560
Here, have some tea.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,760
The same mirror is a ghost. Its nature is calm.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,160
The ghost's life is a phantom. It lives in the yin and yang.

48
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,360
It has no meaning of going through the world of mirror.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
If you want to cut off the path of the ghost,

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,960
the first thing to do is to remove all the surrounding light.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,960
Have you read enough?

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,560
No, I only read a few lines.

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Can't you read it all?

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,560
Okay.

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Be gentle. I borrowed this and I want to return it.

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,960
Other than my room, all the mirrors in the house are here.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,160
Pack it up.

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,960
Xuan Yue, you said I can't understand it in your house.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,160
But we're ambushed across the street.

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
Is it a little far?

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
If he can smell the smell of the key room, he definitely won't dare to come.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
Yes. Then, what if...

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,160
There's no such thing as if.

64
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,560
I won't let anything happen to him.

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,360
Light the lamp.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,360
Light the lamp.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,360
Light the lamp and unicorn comes minutes later,

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,560
een what be a lamp and unicorns come through the air.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,160
As I'm looking at the moon And I'm looking at the moon

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,060
Hey, aucun tao ah di

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,760
but I'm the same special beautiful girl

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,160
How do I look after you and Magnificent Goddess of Summer?

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
The moon is bright and bright

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
It's a good marriage that I don't want to ask for

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,160
The moon is bright and bright

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,160
It's a good marriage that I don't want to ask for

77
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,160
It's not a good marriage

78
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,160
It's not a good marriage

79
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,160
It's not a good marriage

80
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Moonlight

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
The fairy of Li'er asked me to wish

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,160
The flower of the hospital blooms

83
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Life and death are in one's own hands

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,160
The second wish is to give blood

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
I only want to be a young man

86
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
What are you doing?

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,160
The third wish is to give blood

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I only want to be a young man

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Li...

90
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Li...

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
No need to look

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
There is only this mirror in this room

93
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Li...

94
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
The water...

95
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
The water surface is also a mirror

96
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
We lost

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
The water surface is also a mirror

98
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
We lost

99
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I don't want to go back to the dance hall today

100
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I don't want to go back to the dance hall today

101
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,160
No, there are many places with many people

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
No, there are many places with many people

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,160
If I don't go back, I will be told off

104
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,160
What? You don't want to leave me?

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I don't want to leave you

106
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Then you marry me back

107
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Then you marry me back

108
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
I'm kidding, don't take it seriously

109
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Li, I...

110
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
I'm from a different world

111
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I don't deserve you

112
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I know it in my heart

113
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
What are you talking about, Li?

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Okay, I won't hide it from you

115
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I told my mother about us

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
She...

117
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
She...

118
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
What did she say?

119
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
She asked me to marry you

120
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
She asked me to marry you

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
How?

122
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Actually, my mother's situation is similar to yours

123
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Actually, my mother's situation is similar to yours

124
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Before she married my father

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
She was a singer

126
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Before she married my father

127
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
My mother told me to make it clear to you

128
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
I was born in a foreign country

129
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I inherited the family business

130
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,160
It's impossible to have a rich life in the future

131
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
If you still want to marry

132
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Father and grandfather will solve it

133
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I promise I will marry you in a grand way

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Li, I want to marry you

135
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Will you marry me?

136
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Why are you here?

137
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I met a nail

138
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
You can't come to me

139
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
We have a deal

140
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I want to rest

141
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
I want to rest

142
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I want to rest

143
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I want to rest

144
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Li, I have recorded it

145
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,160
We can't stay in Guangping

146
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Where are we going this time?

147
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Northwest, South, North

148
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Anywhere is fine

149
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
We have said

150
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Change a place every five years

151
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Change a place every five years

152
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Where do you want to go?

153
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
I can go anywhere

154
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I will decide

155
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
You have to deal with Wu Fang

156
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Have you talked to the leader?

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Li

158
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Not yet

159
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,160
I haven't seen the leader in a few days

160
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Li

161
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
You have to deal with it before you leave

162
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:45,180
Don't be a

163
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,180
I have seen you so nervous for the first time in so many years

164
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,180
I must revenge

165
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
I want him to pay back

166
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
Then pay it back before you leave

167
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
Pay it back before you leave

168
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Miss, what's wrong?

169
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Miss, what's wrong?

170
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
Let him take the mirror away

171
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Miss, these are all good bronze

172
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,180
Are you sure you don't want it?

173
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,180
No

174
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,180
These bronze are good

175
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,180
And expensive

176
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,180
Do you want money or life?

177
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Then you can take it

178
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,180
I don't want it

179
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,180
I don't want it

180
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
I don't want it

181
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
I don't want it

182
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
What about our makeup?

183
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
No makeup

184
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Ok

185
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Ok

186
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I will pack these things

187
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I will pack these things

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Let's go to the gate

189
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Miss, I will go to the gate

190
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I steamed some buns in the kitchen

191
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
You go to eat

192
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Ok

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Wait

194
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I will go to get something

195
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
You can calculate

196
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Ok, I will calculate

197
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Wait

198
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Tengcheng

199
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You haven't left yet

200
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Did you see our maid?

201
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Miss, eat this

202
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Tengcheng, it's sweet

203
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Xueye

204
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Xueye

205
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Miss

206
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Eat this

207
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Eat this

208
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Miss

209
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Are you ok?

210
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Sister

211
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Eat this

212
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Eat this

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,220
Go

214
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
I can't hide

215
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
You can't hide

216
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
You have to hide

217
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,220
Go

218
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Xueye

219
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Xueye

220
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Xueye

221
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Anxia

222
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Anxia

223
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Doctor Jiu

224
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
What's wrong with Miss?

225
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
She has been shocked

226
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
She needs to rest

227
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Do you have any medicine?

228
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Cook some food for her

229
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Ok, I will do it

230
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Ok, I will do it

231
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Ok, I will do it

232
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Change her clothes

233
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Change her clothes

234
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Ok

235
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Change her clothes

236
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Ok

237
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,260
Doctor Jiu

238
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Miss needs to change her clothes

239
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
I will stay outside

240
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,260
Call me if you need anything

241
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,260
Ok

242
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Miss

243
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Miss

244
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,260
Miss

245
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,260
You are awake

246
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,260
What happened to you?

247
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
What's wrong with you, Miss?

248
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Tingzhao.

249
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Do you have a pear?

250
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Pear?

251
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Do you want to eat a pear, Miss?

252
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Do you have one?

253
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Miss.

254
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Miss.

255
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
What's wrong with you?

256
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
Are you blind, Miss?

257
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
Miss.

258
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Tingzhao.

259
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
I have a pear.

260
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Don't scare me.

261
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
Don't scare me.

262
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Where is the medicine, Miss?

263
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Where is Shen Ye?

264
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
The doctor is outside.

265
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,260
If the doctor is here, the medicine will not come in.

266
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Miss.

267
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Drink the medicine first. I'll go find him.

268
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Miss.

269
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Miss.

270
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,260
What's wrong, Banxia?

271
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Shen Ye, there's medicine in the bowl.

272
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
The medicine is here.

273
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Banxia.

274
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,260
There's medicine in the bowl.

275
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
Don't panic.

276
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
What's going on?

277
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,260
What medicine?

278
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,260
Jingyao appeared again.

279
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,260
He bewitched many people.

280
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
He made them give me a pear.

281
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,260
He pushed me into a alley.

282
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Luckily, the mark you left me worked.

283
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,260
So I kicked him out and escaped.

284
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
But just now,

285
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,260
his shadow appeared in the bowl.

286
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,260
What should I do, Shen Ye?

287
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
I think I was targeted by him.

288
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
He was targeted?

289
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I didn't think it through.

290
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260
I got you into trouble.

291
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
He's Jingyao.

292
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
He can come and go freely in the world of the mirror.

293
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,260
But the world of the mirror is not just the same mirror.

294
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,260
It's something that can reflect light and find the shadow.

295
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Don't be afraid.

296
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
I'll be outside tonight.

297
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,260
If he dares to come, I won't let him go.

298
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Jingzhou.

299
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,260
All the things that can reflect light and find the shadow

300
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
should be kept.

301
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,260
Like vase, teacup.

302
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
None of them should be left.

303
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Besides,

304
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,260
water can also reflect light.

305
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
So the medicine and tea that you drink

306
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,260
should be kept.

307
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
What about my lady's medicine?

308
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Use a jug or a water bag.

309
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
And the window must be blocked.

310
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
It's better to use black cloth.

311
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Okay.

312
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
Xuanye.

313
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Are you asleep?

314
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
Are you cold?

315
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,260
Do you want a blanket that's thicker than the bed?

316
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Or a thick coat?

317
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,260
I'm not cold.

318
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Are you hungry?

319
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
If you are hungry,

320
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
I'll ask Jingzhou to get some pastries.

321
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
I'll go get some pastries.

322
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I'll go get some pastries.

323
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
I'll go get some pastries.

324
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
I'll go get some pastries.

325
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
No need.

326
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
If you're not sleepy,

327
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,260
do you want to play cards?

328
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
I'm good at it.

329
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
I've played so many times.

330
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,260
No one can beat me.

331
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
You're always moving?

332
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Yes.

333
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
You know my eyes are so bad.

334
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
They always cause trouble.

335
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
My dad can't help

336
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
but take me around to move.

337
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I've been to many places.

338
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Nanyang,

339
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
I've been to many places.

340
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Nanyang,

341
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
Nanyang,

342
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Yuanzhou, Huizhou,

343
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Lingquan, Baishai,

344
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Antu, Guangping,

345
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Anyway,

346
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
I've been to many places.

347
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
What about you?

348
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
I've seen more than you have seen.

349
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
So, where have you been?

350
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
I've been to many places.

351
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
That sounds exciting.

352
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
By the way,

353
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
have you been able to see

354
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,260
your waist since you were little?

355
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
I couldn't see it when I was little.

356
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
Did something happen?

357
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
When I was little,

358
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
I was kidnapped by a duck.

359
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
It took me to a dark place.

360
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,260
I didn't know where it was.

361
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
I was just scared.

362
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Later,

363
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
I sneaked out

364
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
while it was counting.

365
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
I accidentally fell into a pool.

366
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
But I didn't die.

367
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
I went to a magical place.

368
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Many things

369
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
were upside down.

370
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
The house was floating in the sky.

371
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
It was like a huge mountain.

372
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
The whole place was covered with smoke.

373
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
It was deserted.

374
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Later, I met a duck

375
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,260
who looked like a mountain.

376
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
I was lucky to have a young man

377
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
to help me.

378
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
I was lucky to escape.

379
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
He saved me.

380
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
But he also chased after me.

381
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
He was holding a gun and trying to kill me.

382
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
In order to save me,

383
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
he was injured

384
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
and fell into the cliff with me.

385
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
When I woke up,

386
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
it was three days later.

387
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
My parents found me.

388
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
I told them

389
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
what happened.

390
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
They didn't believe me.

391
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,260
But they couldn't control me.

392
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
So they went back to find the young man.

393
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
But they didn't find the young man.

394
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
He disappeared

395
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
in that place.

396
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
My parents told me

397
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
everything was a dream.

398
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
It was a dream.

399
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
I felt the same way before.

400
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
Since then,

401
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
I can see the duck.

402
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
They said I was sick.

403
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
I was worried at first.

404
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Until...

405
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
I met you.

406
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
Xunye.

407
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
Do you think

408
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
my dream is real?

409
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
There is a place

410
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
where I can feel the warmth.

411
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,260
A young man saved me.

412
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
Summer

413
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Xunye.

414
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Are you asleep?

415
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm here.

416
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,260
So you think my dream is real?

417
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,260
I don't know.

418
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
It's very possible.

419
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
Really?

420
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,260
If your eyes are not natural,

421
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,260
then you must have encountered something

422
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,260
that allowed you to see the true power of the demon.

423
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,260
This is not an ordinary power.

424
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260
What is not ordinary?

425
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,260
You can see it too, right?

426
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,260
I am different. I can't see it, but I can feel it.

427
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,260
If I want to see the demon, I still need to use the water of the non-luminous.

428
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,260
If...

429
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,260
Okay, go to sleep.

430
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I am not sleepy yet.

431
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,260
How about you tell me about your childhood?

432
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,260
I don't want to talk about it.

433
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,260
I am not sleepy.

434
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Actually,

435
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,260
I am just a little scared to talk to someone.

436
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Sun Ye,

437
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,260
I really can't sleep.

438
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
I will teach you to recite a poem.

439
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
My father taught me.

440
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
He said that when you are afraid,

441
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,260
you will calm down and be fearless.

442
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Okay.

443
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,260
I will go to sleep.

444
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,260
The heart is always determined.

445
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,260
The heart is always determined.

446
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Like clouds, like water, like a river.

447
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Like clouds, like water, like a river.

448
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,260
The face is always straight, the answer is vague.

449
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,260
The face is always straight, the answer is vague.

450
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,260
Peace, air, jade, jade. Everything is separated.

451
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,260
Peace, air, jade, jade. Everything is separated.

452
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,260
The heart is always determined.

453
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,260
The heart is always determined.

454
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,260
The heart is always determined.

455
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Shen Ye, your accent is not good at all.

456
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
When did you come?

457
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
I came a long time ago.

458
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
You didn't call me, so I came out myself.

459
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
The heart is always determined.

460
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
Determined.

461
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,260
Determined.

462
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
The heart is always determined.

463
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Determined.

464
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Determined.

465
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,260
Who are you?

466
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
Who let you in?

467
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
The government changed the case.

468
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,260
Get out. Why are you messing around?

469
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
You can't mess around.

470
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Shen Ye.

471
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
Go find Wenjian.

472
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
Dr. Qiu.

473
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
What's the matter?

474
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,260
Three days ago, the five-man martial arts Tian Rui died in Yanlai House.

475
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
The cause of death is unknown.

476
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
The murderer has not been caught yet.

477
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
But his body was stolen.

478
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,260
The police found that the person who stole the body was you, Jiu Xuanye.

479
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Dr. Qiu, come with us.

480
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
What happened?

481
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Xuanye.

482
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Listen.

483
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
Who is inside?

484
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Who is inside has nothing to do with you.

485
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,260
I have something to do.

486
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,260
I'll be back soon.

487
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
What happened?

488
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Is it okay?

489
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
It's okay.

490
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,260
It's just that it will waste some time.

491
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I used drug powder as a barrier.

492
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,260
If you put a barrier outside, it won't dare to come close.

493
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,260
As long as you stay in the house, it's safe.

494
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Remember, you can't go out.

495
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Don't worry. I won't mess around.

496
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
Wait for me.

497
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
Can we go now?

498
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I'll be back soon.

499
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
Pretending to be a ghost.

500
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
I'll be back soon.

501
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Let's go.

502
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
Listen.

503
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,260
What happened? Where did Xuanye go?

504
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Don't worry.

505
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
Dr. Jiu is fine.

506
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,260
The inspector said that the government is investigating the case.

507
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,260
He needs to ask about something.

508
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
He'll be back soon.

509
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Really?

510
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
Really.

511
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
I also bought some buns.

512
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
You must be hungry.

513
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Eat some.

514
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Miss, water.

515
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
Xiao'ai, come and have some buns.

516
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Here you are.

517
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Have some buns.

518
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Have some buns.

519
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Have some buns.

520
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Eat some.

521
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Have some buns.

522
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Chu Butou, you've been interrogating me for half a day.

523
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,260
If you can't find any evidence, why don't you let me go?

524
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Evidence will come soon.

525
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
Really?

526
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I've sent someone to search your Ganshan Hall.

527
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,260
As long as I find the body, I can make you guilty.

528
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Why did you search the Ganshan Hall?

529
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:30,840
Because I'm a

530
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
I'm a

531
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm a

00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
I'm a

533
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
I'm a

534
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
I'm a

535
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
I'm a

536
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,260
I'm a

537
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
I'm a

538
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
I'm a

539
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
I'm a

540
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
I'm a

541
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
I'm a

542
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm a

543
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
I'm a

544
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm a

545
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
I'm a

546
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
I'm a

547
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
I'm a

548
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm a

549
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
I'm a

550
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
I'm a

551
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
I'm a

552
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I'm a

553
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
I'm a

554
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I'm a

555
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
I'm a

556
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
I'm a

557
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I'm a

558
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
I'm a

559
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
I'm a

560
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm a

561
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
I'm a

562
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I'm a

563
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
listen

564
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,980
The

565
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,580
and

566
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,380
hi

567
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,860
and

568
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,260
I will use the poison as a barrier to block the path.

569
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,260
He won't dare to come near.

570
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,260
As long as you stay in the room, it's safe.

571
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,260
