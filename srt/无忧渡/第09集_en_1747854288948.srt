1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
B portable remote controller

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,140
L type

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,540
This controller is easily touchrel

4
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm going to make a

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,260
little bit of a

6
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,180
little bit of a

7
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,900
little bit of a

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,100
little bit of a

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,100
little bit of a

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,100
little bit of a

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,100
little bit of a

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
little bit of a

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,100
little bit of a

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,100
little bit of a

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,100
little bit of a

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,100
little bit of a

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
little bit of a

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,100
little bit of

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
a

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
little bit of

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,100
a little bit of

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
a little bit of a

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
little bit of a

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
little bit of a

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,100
little bit of a

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
little bit of a

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
little bit of a

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
little bit of a

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,100
brushed

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,100
No worries

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Banxia

32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,100
Banxia Yiqian

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
The fifth row, the third draw

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
The...

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,100
I found it

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
The fifth row, the third draw

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,100
I've been thinking about what Chi Wangchuan said

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Now I can confirm that my father is still alive

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
He was just taken away by a demon

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
But he didn't tell us who the demon was before he died

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Not to mention where he lived

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Then we have no clues

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
What's this?

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Two thousand for the poison fire

45
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Poison fire...

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
I found it

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Chi Wangchuan also said that my father was taken away by a demon before he died

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,100
He wanted to escape death, but he failed

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Two thousand for the firewood pot

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Firewood pot...

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Firewood pot...

52
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
The fifth draw in the second row

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
The second row...

54
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
I found it

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Now we have a question

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,100
What exactly did he say about the demon?

57
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Since he dared to take his life, it means he has a way to escape death

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
A way to escape death

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,100
So if we find him, we can know where my father is?

60
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Did you forget something?

61
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
What?

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
I told you before

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
Our main job is to collect money

64
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
I can help you, but you have to pay

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
One thousand taels of silver

66
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,100
When you caught Manning and Chi Wangchuan, you didn't collect money

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Lord Geng of Guangping Prefecture helped me

68
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,100
I promised him that as long as he is in Guangping, I will keep him safe

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
I am also his subordinate

70
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
Besides, I helped you before

71
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,100
If it weren't for me, how could you catch the demon so quickly?

72
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Don't go

73
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Why are there so many bugs?

74
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
So many bugs

75
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
There are bugs

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
No, why are there so many bugs?

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
This is called a moon bug

78
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
It is specifically for dealing with demons

79
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Didn't you see it before?

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
What are you doing?

81
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,100
What are you putting in the medicine store?

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Are you scared?

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
You are laughing

84
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Since you are so afraid of bugs, don't touch my stuff

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
I am not afraid

86
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Don't be afraid, I just haven't seen this kind of thing

87
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Why does it shine?

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
The moon bug is a food of moonlight

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Of course it will shine

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Food of moonlight

91
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
What are you holding now?

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
They occasionally eat some fish gills and sheep lung

93
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Sheep lung

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
You are a good bug

95
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,100
How about you lend me a book?

96
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,100
What book?

97
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,100
The book you read when you borrowed the file

98
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,100
I often see demons

99
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
I read them in advance

100
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
At least I won't be so nervous next time

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
I won't lend you the book

102
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Why?

103
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Erlang, Erlang

104
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Erlang

105
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
What happened?

106
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I just passed by the garden

107
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I saw a bird and it was in the yard

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Go and have a look

109
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Go

110
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Go

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Dr. Jiu

112
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Cui, are you feeling better?

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Did I pass out again?

114
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Yes, your heart disease hasn't healed yet

115
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
You still need to take the medicine

116
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I have prescribed some medicines for you

117
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
You will get blood later

118
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
And

119
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
And this

120
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
You can't eat this

121
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
The silver you gave me last time is not finished yet

122
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Sister-in-law Cui, don't be so polite

123
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
I should do this

124
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Thank you

125
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
I will leave now

126
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Who is Cui?

127
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
My friend's wife

128
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
What kind of friend do you have?

129
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
So you saw it

130
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I don't have enough staff

131
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
There is almost no business in the pharmacy

132
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
There is less revenge in the office of the government

133
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
And there are a few families who want to raise

134
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
You ask me for help

135
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Are you still ashamed to charge a price?

136
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
The main thing is that you want too much

137
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
How about this?

138
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I will pay you a part

139
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
When you find my father

140
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Let my father pay you

141
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
He has a lot of money

142
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Get out of the way

143
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Get out of the way

144
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Be careful

145
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
So fast

146
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Move, move, move

147
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Move

148
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
So fast

149
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Yes

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
So fast

151
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
So fast

152
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Yes

153
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Wombot

154
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Are you done?

155
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
Yes

156
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Thank you

157
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
Let's go

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
It's really too dangerous

159
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
You are not scared, right?

160
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
How about the person who was hit?

161
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Xuan Yue didn't save him

162
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
He was gone in a second

163
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Hold him

164
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Hold him

165
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
It's you again

166
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Mr. Gao

167
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
You two

168
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Where is the master?

169
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
In the backyard

170
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Take him away

171
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Hurry

172
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
What will that person do?

173
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
What to do?

174
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Hit the street, hurt people

175
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
This bastard is not the first time

176
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Lord Geng will not forgive him

177
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
It's getting late

178
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
You two go back first

179
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I'll be busy again

180
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
I remember your father's case

181
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
But this matter

182
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
It's not a matter of a move

183
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
There is no result

184
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
You don't have to follow me all the time

185
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
You don't want money

186
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm not urging you

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Didn't people say

188
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
One person is short, two people are long

189
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
I just want to discuss with you

190
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Should we

191
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Start from this life-changing demon

192
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
You say this life-changing demon

193
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
What kind of demon is it?

194
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Why is he so bold?

195
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
He is not afraid of death

196
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Okay, don't say it anymore

197
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I'm home

198
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
You go back quickly

199
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
What's the progress?

200
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
I will tell you

201
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I'm going to the office

202
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Then tomorrow

203
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Miss, where did you go?

204
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
I

205
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Her company

206
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Brother

207
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Sit down

208
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Do you want tea?

209
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
I'm not busy drinking tea

210
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
I have something to ask you

211
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Why are you with him?

212
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Who?

213
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
The person next to you

214
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
My father was kidnapped

215
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
You don't believe me

216
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
I can only find him

217
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
He is a good person, a bad person

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Do you know

219
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
You trust him so much

220
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Do you know grandma is sick?

221
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
The doctor looked at it

222
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Said it was too much worry

223
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Heartbroken

224
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
How come?

225
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
I was fine when I left

226
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
You know that's when you left

227
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
You left home without thinking

228
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
I haven't even received a letter

229
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Grandma has been in the seventh semester

230
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
She just suffered from the pain of losing her child

231
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
And she is worried about you all day

232
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
How can you not be sick when you have tea, food, and a bowl of noodles?

233
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Benxia

234
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
You were not like this before

235
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
The family said you were the most obedient and gentle

236
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
But how can you do such a big thing now?

237
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Uncle has not even passed the first period

238
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
You left home

239
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
A woman is alone outside

240
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
How can the family not worry about you?

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
I know it's my fault this time

242
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
But I have no choice

243
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
What do you want me to believe in?

244
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Believe in the so-called monster in your mouth

245
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Or believe that uncle can come back to life

246
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
My father is not dead

247
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I have already found the clue

248
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Enough

249
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Pack up

250
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Go back with me immediately

251
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
I won't go

252
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
The family has been turned upside down by you

253
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
What else do you want?

254
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
You have to go back with me today

255
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
I won't go, Tianzhen

256
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
I won't go

257
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Let go of me

258
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Young master

259
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
You believe in Miss, right?

260
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
I didn't believe it at first

261
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
You get out of the way

262
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
I won't go

263
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Don't let me go

264
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Do you need help?

265
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
These are all the files about the case of the monkey

266
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
You can have a look

267
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Why are the files of the government in your hands?

268
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
I handled the case

269
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
So I can borrow it

270
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
In addition, Mr. Duan is also a member of the public

271
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
And the relationship with the criminal is very close

272
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
You don't have to avoid it

273
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Qu Manniang came to Guangping City three years ago

274
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
In just three years

275
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
He committed 23 murder cases

276
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
The deceased has a boy and a girl

277
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
There are old and young

278
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Most of them are beautiful people

279
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
He has a lot of identities

280
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Singer, dancer, merchant, tourist

281
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100
He committed the last case in Guangping City

282
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
And killed a child

283
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Mr. Geng from the government asked me to come out

284
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
I fought with him

285
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
He couldn't beat me

286
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
After I ran away to Nanyang

287
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
In Nanyang City

288
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
He disguised himself as a man of the spirit

289
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
He was very good at it

290
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
He caused a lot of commotion in the city

291
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
And then

292
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
He met you

293
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
It's ridiculous

294
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Manning's all the weak women

295
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
How could he kill a singer in a mansion guarded by heavy troops?

296
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
And take away his throat

297
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
And this

298
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
There are many guests under the table

299
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,100
How could he dig into Mr. Shu's throat silently?

300
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
It's ridiculous

301
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Weak women can't do it

302
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
But he is not just a weak woman

303
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
What do you mean?

304
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I've made it clear to you before

305
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
You just don't want to believe it

306
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I said, how dare Banxia leave home

307
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
So you're the one who suffered

308
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Before this

309
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
You sneaked into my mansion and slandered my wife

310
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Now you're lying to my sister

311
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Who are you?

312
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Brother

313
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Shut up

314
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Manning's sister-in-law is really a monster

315
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
There are several other men in the Guangping Prefecture

316
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
They can all be proven

317
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Why don't you believe it?

318
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
And my father is not dead

319
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
I'm not talking nonsense

320
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I don't want you to discuss this now

321
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I just want to take you home

322
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Grandmother is sick

323
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
People in the family are worried about you

324
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
If you still have some reason

325
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Go back with me now

326
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
I can't go back with you

327
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
You

328
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
You're deaf and blind

329
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Mr. Duan is so stubborn

330
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I have no ability to convince you

331
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
You should feel it yourself

332
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Chi Xun

333
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Mr. Duan

334
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Mr. Duan

335
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Buns

336
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Thank you so much today

337
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
What are you laughing at?

338
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,100
You seem to be saying this all the time

339
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
You don't understand

340
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
You actually have to be more careful

341
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Don't be rude

342
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Go

343
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Actually, in this world

344
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Most people

345
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Have no courage to face the truth

346
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Compared to the blood-drenched facts

347
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
They are more willing to believe

348
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
What you want to believe

349
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
This is normal

350
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
If your brother's name is Mi

351
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
He has to believe his wife is a demon

352
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I understand.

353
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
So,

354
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
cheer up.

355
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,580
Don't cry.

356
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,340
Are you comforting me?

357
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
What do you think?

358
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,180
I'll take it as yes.

359
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Miss.

360
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Why is your house so small?

361
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
Put it down.

362
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Put it down.

363
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Drink it.

364
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
It's good.

365
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
It's good.

366
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
It's good.

367
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
It's good.

368
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
It's good.

369
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
It's good.

370
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,620
You don't drink.

371
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,980
My father doesn't like drinking.

372
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,420
In the whole family,

373
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,500
only Man Niang can drink with me.

374
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,660
Man Niang is very good at drinking.

375
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,380
She can't even compete with me.

376
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Drink.

377
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,940
headman, don't drink.

378
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
You are being drunk.

379
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Yes.

380
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
I'm drunk.

381
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
Very drunk.

382
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,260
When I토 deficit back then,

383
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,300
my family didn't agree.

384
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,580
Said

385
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,700
her affiliation with me wasn't good.

386
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,100
But who knows whether they deserve it or not?

387
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Only I...

388
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Only I know.

389
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm 16 years old, I'm a civil servant.

390
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
I study and practice martial arts.

391
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm not lazy.

392
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I can eat and drink on my own,

393
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
and take care of my family.

394
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I don't want those rich ladies

395
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
who come to my family for official duties.

396
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
I only want one.

397
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
One who only likes me.

398
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
One who only cares about me.

399
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
That's the man I want.

400
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
But I didn't protect him.

401
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
But he's a demon.

402
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
He's hurt many people.

403
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
But he didn't hurt me.

404
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
But people are different.

405
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
People are different.

406
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Yes.

407
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Just like what father said,

408
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
when two people are together,

409
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
the most important thing is to be on the same side.

410
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
But when two people are together,

411
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
the most important thing is to like each other.

412
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Dad.

413
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Xia,

414
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
when I was about to die,

415
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
does it hurt?

416
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I think it doesn't hurt.

417
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
That's good.

418
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
That's good.

419
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Brother.

420
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Sister-in-law told me to tell you when she died.

421
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
She really likes you.

422
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
She never thought of hurting you.

423
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
I know.

424
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I know.

425
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Sister.

426
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Tell me.

427
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
If I had met her earlier,

428
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
I would have stopped her.

429
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
I would have found out sooner

430
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,100
if she would give up on her love for me.

431
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
And stop hurting me.

432
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,100
I am different from her.

433
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I am different from her.

434
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
The ship is rough.

435
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
The water is hard to get.

436
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
The boat is full of water.

437
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
The boat is full of water.

438
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I am different.

439
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I am different.

440
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I am different.

441
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I am different.

442
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Chief.

443
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Chief.

444
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Listen.

445
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Listen.

446
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Help me carry her up.

447
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Okay.

448
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Miss.

449
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,100
How about I go to help Chui Chui?

450
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
It's late.

451
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
She is asleep.

452
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
No.

453
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
I'll go and check.

454
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
Chief.

455
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Dr. Jiu.

456
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Miss.

457
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Why are you here?

458
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
What else?

459
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Where is Chui Chui?

460
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
She said she went out.

461
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Hold her hand.

462
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Be careful.

463
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Thank you for today.

464
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
I'll send you out.

465
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Okay.

466
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
I have something for you.

467
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
This is...

468
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
You have a cold.

469
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Thank you.

470
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
I'll go back now.

471
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
You have white hair.

472
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
It's okay.

473
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
You can't see it.

474
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
I'll buy some black hair

475
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,100
and make a bun for you tomorrow.

476
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
You know how to dye hair?

477
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,100
My father used to dye it when I was at home.

478
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
Okay.

479
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Miss.

480
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
I think Dr. Jiu likes you.

481
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Why did you say that?

482
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
I just went to the next door.

483
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
I saw Chui Chui.

484
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
She said she was not home.

485
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
She insisted on coming to help.

486
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Really?

487
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Absolutely.

488
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Chui Chui became a rabbit.

489
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
I saw it.

490
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Miss.

491
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Do you think we can

492
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
use it?

493
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Dr. Jiu will help us find him.

494
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Don't talk nonsense.

495
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,100
He has agreed.

496
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Really?

497
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Okay.

498
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Don't tell anyone.

499
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Otherwise, it will be embarrassing.

500
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
I won't tell anyone.

501
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Miss, you have a engagement.

502
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
It's impossible.

503
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
I do.

504
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Xuan is nice to me.

505
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Who said that?

506
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm back.

507
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
I bought some snacks.

508
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Do you want some?

509
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Chui Chui.

510
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
What is this?

511
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
This is my pet.

512
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
You are so cute.

513
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Xuan Ye, can I keep it?

514
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Your pet?

515
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
I don't know.

516
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I just want to keep it.

517
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Your pet?

518
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
I can't keep it.

519
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
You are a high-class criminal.

520
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
I have seen your past records.

521
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Three years ago,

522
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
you were drunk and entered the field.

523
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,100
You ran into Mrs. Zhang, who was working.

524
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Mrs. Zhang was pregnant.

525
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
One year ago,

526
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
you were on the street

527
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
and broke the beggar's leg.

528
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,100
You are so stubborn.

529
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Yesterday,

530
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
you were on the street

531
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
and hit Wang Zi An.

532
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Do you admit your crime?

533
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I was drunk.

534
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
I didn't mean it.

535
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,100
All these things are said by witnesses.

536
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Look carefully.

537
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
There is a sentence

538
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
for you.

539
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Sir, don't interrogate me.

540
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I'll admit my crime.

541
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I'll pay for all the money they want.

542
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
It's natural to lose money.

543
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
But you have to pay for it.

544
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Sir,

545
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
I'm drunk and you are drunk.

546
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
You are not new to Guangping.

547
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Don't you know our family?

548
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Sir,

549
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,100
this is the son of the highlander in the east.

550
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
He has a sister.

551
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Three years ago,

552
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
he entered the House of Xiang Wang and became a concubine.

553
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
He gave birth to three sons.

554
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
He is very favored.

555
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
Sir, don't worry.

556
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
I'll pay for all the money.

557
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I won't make it difficult for you.

558
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
I'll sit in jail for a few days.

559
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
I'll take it as a remorse.

560
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,100
If you want to take it seriously,

561
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
go to the residence

562
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
and tell the dead.

563
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Guards!

564
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Yes.

565
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
The criminal Gao Sheng

566
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
deliberately hit the horse.

567
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
According to our law,

568
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
he will be executed in the prison.

569
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
Yes.

570
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Go.

571
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
How dare you?

572
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
My brother-in-law is the prince of the court.

573
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
How dare you touch me?

574
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I'll be back in a few days.

575
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Then, Mr. Gao,

576
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
when will your sister come back?

577
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
She'll be back in three days.

578
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
Then,

579
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,100
ask for the execution tomorrow at noon.

580
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Take him away.

581
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Yes.

582
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
How dare you?

583
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
My brother-in-law can't spare you.

584
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
He can't spare you.

585
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Don't worry.

586
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
I'll take good care of my grandmother.

587
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
You stay here

588
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
and be careful.

589
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Find my brother-in-law soon.

590
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I'll go with him.

591
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
The past is the past.

592
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Thank you for not remembering the past.

593
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
I'll remember this kindness.

594
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
I'll be your back.

595
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Shun Mei has been raised in the family.

596
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
She doesn't know the human condition.

597
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,100
I have to take care of my brother-in-law.

598
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Be careful.

599
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Take care of yourself.

600
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Wang Xin,

601
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
come with me.

602
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
I'll do it.

603
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Sit down.

604
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
What is it?

605
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Try it.

606
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
This is what Chi Xue bought last night.

607
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
It's the one your brother was drunk

608
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
and he asked me to help him.

609
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
It tastes good.

610
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
It tastes good.

611
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
You can try it.

612
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Okay.

613
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
What's that sound?

614
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Chi Xue has a rabbit.

615
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Isn't he a rabbit demon?

616
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
What rabbit does he have?

617
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Yes.

618
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
I don't know either.

619
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,100
Maybe he's raising his own daughter-in-law.

620
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
So,

621
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
do you understand?

622
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
What?

623
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
You don't understand?

624
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Do you like it? I'll give it to you.

625
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Miss.

626
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Chi Xue?

627
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Chi Xue's wife.

628
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Master.

629
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
How could he sleep so soundly?

630
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
He's been shouting all day.

631
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,100
I think he's tired of talking.

632
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Let's go.

633
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
Chi Xue.

634
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Are you okay?

635
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm fine.

636
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
I'm fine.

637
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm fine.

638
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,800
Call heed to the process, we're nearing the right time.

639
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,500
Summer,

640
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,880
quick!

641
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,500
!!

642
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,600
Stop, let's feast then!

643
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,300
Ahh, the park!

644
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,640
Hey, I think these are what you get when you are working at a street gym.

645
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,400
Sh pepper paste!?

646
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,820
Don't tell me, she dealt with some luck yesterday,

647
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,580
it sounds like she's having fun since day two.

648
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Maybe he's tired from the scolding.

649
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Lord Geng is also a grown-up.

650
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,100
He even treats Prince Xiang as a little uncle.

651
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Then do you know

652
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
whose little uncle our Lord is?

653
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Whose?

654
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
His Lordship's name is Geng.

655
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Her Highness the Noble Consort's name is also Geng.

656
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
The 53th hour has arrived.

657
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Execute!

658
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,000
The

659
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
stone hand is placed on the top of the tower.

660
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
I'll give the king a stone road.

661
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
I advise the king not to go south.

662
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
South is the right way.

663
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Fire is deep.

664
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
I advise the king not to go west.

665
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
The west is dry and cold.

666
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
The west is dry and cold.

667
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
The west is dry and cold.

668
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
I advise the king

669
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
not to go in the middle.

670
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Go in the middle.

671
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
The stone road is closed.

672
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
The stone road is closed.

673
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
The stone road is closed.

674
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
The stone road is closed.

675
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
The stone road is closed.

676
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
The stone road is closed.

677
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
The stone road is closed.

678
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
The stone road is closed.

679
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
The stone road is closed.

680
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
The stone road is closed.

681
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
The stone road is closed.

682
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,100
The stone road is closed.

683
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
The stone road is closed.

684
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
The stone road is closed.

685
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
the smooth road

686
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
the tiny road

687
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
the spider ambitions

688
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:59,820
the lightning

689
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:09,360
and the wrist

690
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,820
by the Bill's

691
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,820
screen

692
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,020
What should we do? He doesn't want me to keep an eye on him.

693
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,380
I see that he's been very lazy lately.

694
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,820
He doesn't go out either.

695
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,020
He stays at home all day. How can he help us investigate?

696
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,660
What if he only cares about the government affairs

697
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,620
and doesn't take our affairs seriously?

698
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,220
The world is so big.

699
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,420
It's definitely not just his main task.

700
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,820
If we can't do it,

701
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,020
let's go look for another door.

702
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,420
Let's find a more powerful main task.

703
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,220
Main task?

704
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,220
I'm afraid you two have encountered something dirty.

705
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,820
You should go look for the half-god, Kong Tongzi.

706
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,620
If we're talking about the ability to catch monsters and catch monsters,

707
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,420
I'm afraid no one will be the first to take the second place.

708
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,080
The

709
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,620
The

710
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,420
The

711
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,620
Greetings, Immortal.

712
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,020
Last night, I saw the sky at night.

713
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,020
I saw the clear sky and the bright stars.

714
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,620
I think there's a guest who wants to come in.

715
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
It's a girl.

716
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,420
Immortal, you're overreacting.

717
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,620
I heard about your ability before.

718
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,220
There's a sky, there's a ground, and there's a house.

719
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,220
I had a few memories.

720
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,620
Now that I see it, it's indeed a gift from an immortal.

721
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,020
You know sword?

722
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,820
I don't know. But I read in my youth.

723
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,420
It's written in a book that there's a kind of high-class body.

724
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,820
The name is not wrong.

725
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,420
Even when the wheel turns, the body floats and moves.

726
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,220
The shoulders are as sharp as a mountain.

727
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,820
Even if a bird flies and stops on the shoulder,

728
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,020
it won't feel the vibration and won't fly away.

729
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,420
I always thought it was a hand-held spinning wheel.

730
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,420
I didn't think it was real.

731
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,820
May I ask what is a bird that doesn't fly?

732
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
Isn't it right here?

733
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,020
Is this a crow?

734
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,420
Why is it white?

735
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,020
Did you raise it first?

736
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,020
This...

737
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,220
Did you send it away?

738
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,220
Yes, I did.

739
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,020
Master, this Miss Duan is very rich.

740
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,820
She must be very rich.

741
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,420
If we don't give her the bird,

742
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,820
we can't just let her go.

743
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,620
Let's talk about it.

744
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,220
This girl is a bit weird.

745
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,220
A bit strange.

746
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,620
Does it hurt?

747
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,620
No, it hurts.

748
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,420
You took it?

749
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I took it.

750
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,220
You have to be careful these days.

751
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,420
You can't work or lift heavy things.

752
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
You have to rest for a few more days.

753
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,220
Okay.

754
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,220
Here.

755
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,820
Thank you, Dr. Jiu.

756
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,420
Goodbye.

757
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,020
Miss! Miss!

758
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,620
Miss, wait for me!

759
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,420
An Xia!

760
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,020
Dr. Jiu.

761
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,020
What did you do?

762
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,820
Nothing.

763
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,820
I just walked around on the street.

764
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,020
Before, even if I closed the door,

765
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,020
you would still want to look at the wall.

766
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,020
What's wrong with you today?

767
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,420
Did you do something bad?

768
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,820
How could I do something bad?

769
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,020
We went to buy black beans.

770
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,820
Black beans.

771
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,420
Didn't we agree to dye your hair with soy beans?

772
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,820
Black beans.

773
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,020
What's in your hand?

774
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,620
Let me see.

775
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,220
Black beans.

776
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,620
Did you go to find Kong Kong Zi?

777
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,620
He just went to look around.

778
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,420
He's a liar.

779
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,220
He's being fooled by the lie.

780
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,820
What should we do, Miss?

781
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:24,220
I'm afraid that when the rain falls, I'll look back and think about it for a thousand years.

782
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:31,820
If I had a chance to see you, how could I leave a deep regret in my heart?

783
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:40,420
I'm afraid that when the rain falls, I'll think about it for a thousand years.

784
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:47,420
I'm afraid that when the rain falls, I'll think about it for a thousand years.

785
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,420
I'm afraid that when the rain falls, I'll think about it for a thousand years.

786
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:58,420
I'm afraid that when the rain falls, I'll think about it for a thousand years.

787
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:23,420
The end is in the eternal world.
