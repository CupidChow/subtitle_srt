00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,000
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,560
Today, I'm

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,470
shamelessly

5
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,000
asking you

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
to help me for another two years.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,130
Is that alright?

8
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,030
I understand.

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,490
I completely understand.

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,900
When you first came

11
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,200
to the dance troupe,

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,710
it was already settled.

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,310
The contract was only for five years.

14
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,250
After five years, you could come and go freely.

15
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,730
I remember it all.

16
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,950
But now,

17
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,730
I really have no other choice.

18
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,750
Ji Li,

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,030
listen.

20
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,150
Given our

21
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,930
five years of friendship,

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,910
you can't walk away now.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
Leaving at a time like this

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,990
would be like bringing down everything I've built.

25
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,390
We should work together

26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,870
to help the Yunmen Dance Troupe through this difficult time,

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,670
shouldn't we?

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,280
Sir,

29
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,070
I...

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,720
Miss,

31
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,840
please.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,630
Let me think about it.

33
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,280
Alright.

34
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,170
Come on.

35
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,300
Let's have some tea.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
When a bronze mirror gathers spirit and transforms into a demon,

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,810
its essence becomes cold and desolate.

38
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,400
The demon's form is an ethereal illusion,

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,120
existing in the space between yin and yang.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,870
This is why it can traverse

41
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,310
into the mirror world with its innate powers.

42
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,680
To sever the path of the Mirror Demon's comings and goings,

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
the first step is to remove all reflective objects

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,870
in the vicinity.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,280
Have you finished reading?

46
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,320
I've...

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,780
I've only read a few lines.

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,160
Can't you recite it quietly?

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,810
Be gentle.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,300
I still need to return the things I borrowed.

51
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,280
Except for the bedroom,

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,150
all the mirrors in the house

53
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,010
are right here.

54
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,640
Pack them up.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,300
Xuanye,

56
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,400
I understand you can't do it in your house,

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,750
but our ambush is across the street.

58
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,310
Isn't it a bit far?

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,400
If it catches the scent

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,630
of the demon hunter,

61
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,730
it definitely won't dare to come.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,960
Yes.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,910
But,

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,430
what if...

65
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,630
There's no "what if."

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
I won't let her get into trouble.

67
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,290
The lamp is lit.

68
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,760
The first watch of the night,

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
the moon hangs low.

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,310
Pear Fairy, heed my humble plea.

71
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,120
It's not that wealth has dimmed my eyes,

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
nor do I yearn for a fine marriage.

73
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,340
The second watch of the night,

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,780
the moonlight chills the air.

75
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,390
Pear Fairy steps into my garden.

76
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,560
It's not to sigh before the mirror,

77
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,870
nor to foolishly beg for longer years.

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
The third watch of the night,

79
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,820
the moon lingers late.

80
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,040
Pear Fairy, may your ear attend my wish:

81
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,030
First, let the flowers bloom once more.

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,740
I'll face life and death without regret.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,720
Second, let my blood and bones be spent,

84
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,490
just to reclaim my youthful days.

85
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,820
It's broken.

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,190
Pear...

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,650
No need to search anymore.

88
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,810
This room only has one mirror.

89
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,210
The water...

90
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,950
The surface of the water is also a mirror.

91
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,010
We miscalculated.

92
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,940
Today,

93
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,320
can you not return to the dance troupe?

94
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,800
No.

95
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,830
Where there are many idle people, there are many rumors.

96
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,120
If I don't go back,

97
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,320
they'll start gossiping about me.

98
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,390
What?

99
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,460
You can't bear to leave me?

100
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,539
[Zhou Jingyuan]

101
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,780
I wish we could be together every day.

102
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,710
Then marry me.

103
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,549
Just kidding.

104
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,380
Don't take it seriously.

105
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,910
Li, I...

106
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,470
With my humble background,

107
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,380
how could I possibly be worthy of you?

108
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
I know that deep down.

109
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you saying, Li?

110
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,080
Alright.

111
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,560
I won't hide it from you any longer.

112
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,240
I've already told my mother

113
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,270
about us.

114
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,870
She...

115
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,600
What did she say?

116
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,410
She told me to marry you.

117
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,670
How could that be?

118
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,670
Actually, my mother's situation

119
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,130
is quite similar to yours.

120
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,520
Before she married my father as a concubine,

121
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,450
she was a singer.

122
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,600
My mother wanted me to make things clear with you.

123
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,060
As an illegitimate child,

124
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,080
it's impossible for me to inherit the family business.

125
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,150
A life of wealth and glory

126
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,500
is unlikely to happen.

127
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,740
But if you're still willing to marry me,

128
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,840
she'll take care of things with my father and grandfather.

129
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,660
I promise,

130
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,130
I'll marry you with full ceremony.

131
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Li,

132
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,850
I want to marry you.

133
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,390
Will you marry me?

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,730
Why are you here?

135
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,480
I've hit a dead end.

136
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,290
But you can't come here.

137
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,050
Didn't we agree before?

138
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,330
I just want to rest for a while.

139
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Li,

140
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,530
I've already exposed myself.

141
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,600
We can't stay

142
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,700
in Guangping anymore.

143
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,680
Where shall we go this time?

144
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,820
The northwest,

145
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,760
Nanyang,

146
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,670
Beiyan,

147
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
anywhere is fine.

148
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,790
Didn't we agree

149
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,610
to change locations every five years?

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,220
Where do you want to go?

151
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,190
Anywhere is fine with me.

152
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,460
Then I'll make the arrangements.

153
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,760
You need to take care of the dance troupe matters.

154
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,310
Have you talked to the troupe leader?

155
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,160
Li.

156
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,000
Not yet.

157
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,670
I haven't seen the leader

158
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,800
these past few days.

159
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,630
Li,

160
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,120
before we leave, everything needs to be settled properly.

161
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,390
We can't afford to raise any suspicions.

162
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,120
Understood?

163
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,570
In all these years,

164
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,480
this is the first time

165
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,010
I've seen you this nervous.

166
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,110
I must

167
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,790
get my revenge.

168
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,870
I'll make him pay double.

169
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
Let's settle everything before we leave.

170
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,860
We'll leave right after that.

171
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,610
My Lady,

172
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,550
what's wrong?

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,720
My Lady,

174
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,430
what's wrong?

175
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,000
Tell him to remove the mirrors at once.

176
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,630
Miss,

177
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,840
these are all fine-quality bronze.

178
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Are you sure you don't want any of them?

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
I don't want them.

180
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,950
But these bronze items are of superior craftsmanship,

181
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,360
and quite expensive as well.

182
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,420
Would you prefer wealth or your life?

183
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Then how will we do our makeup later?

184
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,850
We won't do makeup anymore.

185
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,360
Fine.

186
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,120
Alright,

187
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,360
I shall take these to the carriage first.

188
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,420
We'll settle the payment at the door.

189
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,000
My Lady,

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll go settle the bill.

191
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,140
I steamed some buns in the kitchen.

192
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,340
You should have some.

193
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,160
Alright.

194
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,590
Wait a moment.

195
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,150
I'll

196
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,870
go get something first.

197
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,240
You calculate the amount.

198
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,650
Alright,

199
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,710
I'll calculate it.

200
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,360
Tingzhou.

201
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,150
You haven't left yet?

202
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,710
Have you seen my maid?

203
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,600
Miss,

204
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,720
have a pear.

205
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,840
Try it.

206
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,080
It's very sweet.

207
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,080
Xuanye!

208
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,980
Chi Xue!

209
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,720
Xuanye!

210
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,840
Miss,

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,750
have a pear.

212
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,980
Have a pear.

213
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,680
Miss,

214
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
are you alright?

215
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,910
Sis,

216
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,520
have a pear.

217
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,260
Have a pear.

218
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,890
You can't escape this.

219
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,670
Whether you want to or not,

220
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,600
you'll have to

221
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,330
eat this pear.

222
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Come, take a look! Have a peek!

223
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,570
Charms and trinkets!

224
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,120
Come and see!

225
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,170
Come, have a look! Take a peek!

226
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,910
Charms and trinkets!

227
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,340
Xuanye.

228
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,840
Banxia!

229
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,910
Banxia!

230
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,970
Physician Jiu,

231
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,320
what happened to my lady?

232
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,200
She's been frightened.

233
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
She needs to rest.

234
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,630
Do you have any calming medicine at home?

235
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,090
Brew a dose for her to take.

236
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,160
Alright, I'll go prepare it right away.

237
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,190
By the way,

238
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,750
her clothes are all wet.

239
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,000
Change her into some dry clothes

240
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,060
to prevent her from catching a cold.

241
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,510
Got it.

242
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,260
Physician Jiu,

243
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
my lady needs to change her clothes.

244
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,790
I'll wait outside then.

245
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,660
If you need anything,

246
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,590
call me anytime.

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,530
Alright.

248
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,010
My Lady,

249
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,350
you're awake.

250
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,920
My Lady.

251
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,570
What's wrong, My Lady?

252
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,320
Tingzhou,

253
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
do you have any pears?

254
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,400
Pears?

255
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,920
Do you want to have a pear, My Lady?

256
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,640
Do you have any?

257
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,830
My Lady.

258
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,110
My Lady.

259
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,970
What's really wrong with you?

260
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,950
You haven't been frightened out of your wits, have you?

261
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,510
My Lady.

262
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:32,880
My Lady.

263
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,860
My Lady.

264
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,110
Ting... Tingzhou.

265
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,640
I encountered a demon.

266
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,270
A demon?

267
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,270
Don't scare me.

268
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,340
A demon.

269
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,360
Where is the demon, My Lady?

270
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,040
Where's Xuanye?

271
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,220
Physician Jiu is outside.

272
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,590
With Physician Jiu here,

273
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,320
the demon surely won't come in.

274
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,830
My Lady,

275
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,590
please take the medicine first.

276
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,520
I'll go find him.

277
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,830
My Lady.

278
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,530
My Lady.

279
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,770
What's wrong, Banxia?

280
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,030
Xuanye,

281
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,370
there's a demon in the bowl.

282
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:32,750
He...

283
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,920
He's back. There's a demon in the bowl.

284
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,770
Banxia.

285
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
Banxia!

286
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,640
There's a demon in the bowl!

287
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,400
Banxia!

288
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,610
Don't panic.

289
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,890
Take it slow.

290
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,890
What exactly happened?

291
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
What do you mean, a demon in the bowl?

292
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,740
That Mirror Demon has appeared again.

293
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,350
He has bewitched many of the townsfolk,

294
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,610
compelling them to offer me pears to eat.

295
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,560
He cornered me

296
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,550
in an alley,

297
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,460
but fortunately, the mark you left on me

298
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,350
took effect,

299
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,350
allowing me to drive him away

300
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,220
and narrowly escaping disaster.

301
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,200
But just now,

302
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,130
his shadow appeared in the bowl again.

303
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,840
What should I do, Xuanye?

304
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,310
It feels like he's targeting me.

305
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,870
Sorry, I didn't think it through

306
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,020
and ended up causing you trouble.

307
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,160
He is a Mirror Demon,

308
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,400
able to come and go freely in the world

309
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,460
inside the mirror.

310
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,640
But this world inside the mirror

311
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,550
doesn't only refer to bronze mirrors,

312
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,130
but anything

313
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,390
that can reflect light

314
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,720
and cast a shadow.

315
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,810
Don't be afraid,

316
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,820
I will guard outside tonight.

317
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,640
If this demon dares to come,

318
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,020
I won't let him get away.

319
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,880
Tingzhou,

320
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,440
everything in the room

321
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,000
that can reflect a human shadow

322
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,930
must be put away.

323
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,960
Like vases, teacups,

324
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,830
none of it can be left behind.

325
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,030
Besides,

326
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,480
water surfaces can also reflect shadows,

327
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
so the usual

328
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,590
medicinal soups and tea

329
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,920
must all be kept away from light.

330
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,120
Then how will my lady take her medicine?

331
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,880
Use a gourd or a water pouch.

332
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,000
Also,

333
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,990
the windows must be covered,

334
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,650
preferably with black cloth.

335
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,310
Got it.

336
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,590
Xuanye,

337
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,680
are you asleep?

338
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,750
Are you cold?

339
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,410
Do you want

340
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,510
an extra blanket

341
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,080
or some thicker clothes?

342
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,690
I'm not cold.

343
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,920
Then, are you hungry?

344
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,000
If you're hungry,

345
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,790
I'll have Tingzhou

346
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,990
bring some pastries.

347
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,750
No need.

348
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,510
If you're not tired,

349
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,830
would you like to

350
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,230
play a game of leaf cards?

351
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm really good at it.

352
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,340
I've moved so many times.

353
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,600
No one can ever beat me.

354
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,550
Do you move often?

355
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,510
Yes,

356
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,260
you also know about my eye condition.

357
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,640
It always causes trouble,

358
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,960
so my father had no choice

359
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,790
but to take me everywhere.

360
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,000
I've been to many places,

361
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,110
Nanyang, Yuanzhou, Huizhou,

362
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Lingquan, Baisai, Antu,

363
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,680
Guangping.

364
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,920
Anyway, it's everywhere.

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,860
What about you?

366
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,800
I'm not as well-traveled as you.

367
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,640
So where have you been?

368
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,070
Wherever the demons go, I go.

369
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,370
That sounds pretty thrilling.

370
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,190
By the way,

371
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,940
about your eyes,

372
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,110
have you always been able to see demons,

373
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,710
or did it start at some point?

374
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,660
I couldn't see them as a child.

375
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,870
Did something happen to you?

376
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,200
When I was little,

377
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,680
I was kidnapped by a human trafficker,

378
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,040
and he sold me to

379
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,510
a dark and unknown place.

380
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,700
I didn't know where it was.

381
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,930
I only knew I was terrified.

382
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,030
Later, when he was busy with

383
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,770
settling the bills,

384
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,960
I managed to escape,

385
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,610
but I accidentally fell into

386
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,830
a pool.

387
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,160
I didn't die.

388
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,360
Instead, I ended up in a

389
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,580
very strange place.

390
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,920
That place

391
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,140
was full of things that were upside down,

392
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,830
houses floating in the sky,

393
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,570
statues as big as mountains.

394
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,260
The whole place was shrouded in mist,

395
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,090
completely deserted.

396
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,440
Then I encountered a fierce beast,

397
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,000
as big as a mountain.

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,380
Luckily, a young man saved me,

399
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,090
and I narrowly escaped death.

400
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,130
He saved me,

401
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,950
but that man also caught up.

402
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,000
He had a gun and tried to kill me.

403
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,200
To save me,

404
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,380
he got injured

405
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,240
and fell off the cliff with me.

406
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
When I woke up again,

407
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,690
it had already been three days.

408
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,720
My parents found me,

409
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,720
and I told them

410
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,830
what had happened,

411
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,320
but they didn't believe me.

412
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,640
They couldn't convince me,

413
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,520
so they went with me

414
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,750
to find the young man.

415
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,480
But not only did we fail to find him,

416
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,190
even the misty place

417
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,950
was gone.

418
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,200
My parents told me

419
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,960
it was all fake,

420
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,110
just a dream.

421
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,550
I had thought the same before.

422
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,140
Since then,

423
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,430
I've been able to see demons.

424
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,530
They said I was sick,

425
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,350
and at first,

426
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,090
I was half-believing it too,

427
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,640
until

428
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
I met you.

429
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,830
Xuanye.

430
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,830
Do you think

431
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,880
my dream was real?

432
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,830
Was there really

433
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,480
such a misty place,

434
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,940
and did a young man really save me?

435
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,070
Xuanye.

436
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,550
Are you asleep?

437
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,590
I'm here.

438
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,270
So do you think

439
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
my dream was real?

440
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,930
I don't know.

441
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,770
But it's very possible.

442
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,030
Really?

443
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,510
As for your eyes,

444
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,290
if they weren't something you were born with,

445
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,150
then something

446
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,220
must have happened

447
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,200
to give you the ability

448
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,860
to see the true form of demons.

449
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,590
That's not an ordinary ability.

450
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,420
What's so extraordinary about it?

451
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,370
You can see them too, can't you?

452
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,130
I'm different.

453
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,650
I can't see them.

454
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,920
I can only feel them.

455
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,770
If I want to see demons,

456
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,440
I still need to use the hypostasis water.

457
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,430
Alright, go to sleep now.

458
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,960
I'm not sleepy.

459
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,440
How about

460
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,930
you tell me

461
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,220
about your childhood?

462
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,910
I don't want to talk about it.

463
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,000
Actually,

464
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,360
I'm just a little scared

465
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,020
and want to talk to someone.

466
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,270
Xuanye.

467
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,750
I really can't sleep.

468
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,350
Let me teach you a mantra.

469
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,430
My father taught it to me.

470
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,000
He said to recite it whenever you're afraid,

471
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,400
and it will calm your mind

472
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,940
and make you fearless.

473
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,270
Alright.

474
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,320
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

475
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,030
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

476
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,140
Like clouds drifting, like rivers flowing.

477
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,770
Like clouds drifting, like rivers flowing.

478
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,210
Face all without turning away.

479
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,000
Face all without turning away.

480
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,750
In peace, release desires that cloud the mind.

481
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,000
For all things rise and fall, unite and part like the ebbing tide.

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,600
In peace, release desires that cloud the mind.

483
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,630
For all things rise and fall, unite and part like the ebbing tide.

484
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

485
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,680
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

486
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,770
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

487
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,720
Xuanye,

488
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,830
your mantra isn't powerful at all.

489
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,960
When did you get here?

490
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,830
I've been here for a while.

491
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,350
You didn't call me,

492
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,610
so I came out by myself.

493
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,720
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

494
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,320
Serenity.

495
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,000
Serenity.

496
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,670
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

497
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,800
Serenity.

498
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,050
Serenity.

499
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,330
Who are you?

500
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,720
Who let you in?

501
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,960
We're here on official business.

502
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,160
Get out! How dare you

503
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,810
barge in like this?

504
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,300
You can't just barge in like that.

505
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:02,850
Xuanye.

506
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,960
Go find Wen Jian.

507
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,260
Physician Jiu.

508
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,719
What brings you here, Chief Constable Chu?

509
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,840
Three days ago,

510
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,719
a dancer named Tian Rui from Yunmen Dance Troupe

511
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,110
died in Yanlai Restaurant.

512
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,110
The cause of death is unknown,

513
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,920
and the murderer has not been caught yet.

514
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,699
But her body

515
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,630
was stolen.

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
After investigation,

517
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
it was discovered that the person who stole her body

518
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,889
was you, Jiu Xuanye.

519
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,739
Physician Jiu,

520
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,449
please come with us.

521
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,110
What happened?

522
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,840
Xuanye?

523
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,550
Tingzhou?

524
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,489
Who's in there?

525
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,750
It's none of your business.

526
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,590
I'm going out for a while.

527
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,590
I'll be back soon.

528
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,100
What's going on?

529
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,000
Is it serious?

530
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,540
It's not a big deal.

531
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,110
It will just

532
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,990
take some time.

533
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,590
I'll set up a formation using medicinal powder

534
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,990
and create a barrier around your room

535
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,720
so that he won't dare approach.

536
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,200
As long as you stay inside,

537
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,120
you'll be safe.

538
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,560
Remember,

539
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
don't go outside.

540
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,730
Don't worry,

541
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,440
I won't wander off.

542
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,750
Wait for me to return.

543
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,430
Can we go now?

544
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,250
All this hocus-pocus.

545
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,450
Let's go.

546
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,440
Tingzhou,

547
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,720
what's wrong?

548
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,170
Where did Xuanye go?

549
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,510
My Lady, don't worry.

550
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,230
Physician Jiu will be fine.

551
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,810
The constable mentioned

552
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
they're investigating a case

553
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,030
and need to ask a few questions.

554
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,290
He'll return shortly.

555
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,280
Really?

556
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,420
Really.

557
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,600
I bought some steamed buns.

558
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,670
You must be starving.

559
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,270
Have some.

560
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,840
My Lady, water.

561
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,840
[Guangping Government]

562
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,310
Chief Constable Chu,

563
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,280
you've been questioning me for half a day.

564
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,010
If you don't have any evidence,

565
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,840
maybe you should just let me go.

566
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,710
Evidence

567
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,310
will be here soon.

568
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,480
Is that so?

569
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,840
I've already sent people

570
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,570
to search your Ganshan Clinic.

571
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,650
Once they find the corpse,

572
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,880
I'll be able to convict you.

573
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,140
What right do you have to search my house?

574
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,860
Because I'm the Chief Constable,

575
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,240
and you're a bandit.

576
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,640
Trying to leave?

577
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,070
Stop him!

578
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,400
You tried to leave the government office

579
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,670
without my permission.

580
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,000
Is there no law anymore?

581
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,630
Youhuang.

582
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,560
What's wrong?

583
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,930
Tingzhou.

584
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,080
Tingzhou.

585
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,190
Tingzhou.

586
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,800
Tingzhou.

587
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,840
Tingzhou.

588
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,570
Wake up, Tingzhou.

589
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,440
I'll set up a formation using medicinal powder

590
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,760
and create a barrier around your room

591
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,490
so that he won't dare approach.

592
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,000
As long as you stay inside,

593
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,860
you'll be safe.

594
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,190
Remember,

595
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,710
don't go outside.

596
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,110
Tingzhou.

597
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,970
Tingzhou, wake up quickly.

598
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,960
Wake up, please.

599
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,230
I'm not scared.

600
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,860
I'm not scared.

601
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm not scared.

602
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,020
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

603
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,500
Like clouds drifting, like rivers flowing.

604
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,630
Face all

605
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,100
without turning away.

606
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,020
In peace, release desires that cloud the mind.

607
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,620
For all things rise and fall, unite and part like the ebbing tide.

608
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,470
Come out! I'm not afraid of you.
