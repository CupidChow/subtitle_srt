00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The End

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 1

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The End

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go home, it's raining soon.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Xia, I have something to tell you.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can't go home.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go to the temple.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you still thinking about fishing?

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Then you can go fishing.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll be back.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm serious.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll never be everywhere.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why?

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You like me, right?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,700
I really do like you.

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,000
You're kind and brave, lucky that you escaped.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I like you very much.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But you know what,

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I like it when it comes to reality.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I liked it last time, but I don't like it now.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I thought you were cute yesterday.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Today, I'll think you're very clumsy and troublesome.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You used to be by my side.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I still feel very lively.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But now, there's a group of people in your family.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I thought of the relationship between these two.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I thought of the fact that you're a chubby and elegant girl.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm a little bit of a chubby and elegant girl.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm just a little bit of a chubby and elegant girl.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't want to be a burden anymore.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I know that you're lying to me.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I know that you're mad at me.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're mad at my father.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But I told you that I'll settle this engagement.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And my father promised me that he'll get married as soon as possible.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He'll wait for me, okay?

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't care about that.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then what does it have to do with it?

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not that reason, right?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You think you're a chubby and elegant girl.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll be in danger with you.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can't protect me well.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I've told you many times that I don't care.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I care.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ban Xia, why are you so bold?

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you know what I face every day?

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In this world, there are more evil spirits than Chihuahua,

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Phoenix Mother, and the Demon of the Fierce Demon.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're like a cat and a dog.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're eaten by the beast.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They're crazy.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They don't even know what they're doing.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They still treat their own actions as food.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How can you be sure that you won't meet them every day?

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can protect me.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What if I can't protect you?

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's possible that the next day you wake up,

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you'll realize that you can't see me anymore.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You've found someone else.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I might suddenly appear in the forest.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's possible that I might not be able to see you anymore

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and can't protect you.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't even protect myself.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How can I protect you?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't say those harsh words.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're so naive today.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Did my father tell you something?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't listen to him.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ba Xia.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stay away from me.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You shouldn't be with an important person.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
While we're still here,

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we can still talk about it.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay?

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Ba Xia.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Everything will pass.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's nothing in this world that will exist forever.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
With time's passing,

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
feelings will become bigger and bigger.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They'll even disappear completely.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You only need a short time.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
After this,

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
everything will get better.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why do you think it'll get better after a while?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I came to you with a lot of effort today.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was afraid that you'd be unhappy.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I walked such a long way,

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I've been looking for you for so long.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's getting dark.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
After I came,

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you told me some big things,

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and forced me to believe in it.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Jiuxuan Ye, let me tell you.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You love me for real.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it's about two people.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can do whatever you want.

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not a bad person.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm not a bad person.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm not a bad person.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not a bad person.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not a bad person.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm not a bad person.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm not a bad person.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not a bad person.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not a bad person.

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm not a bad person.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm not a bad person.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm not a bad person.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not a bad person.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not a bad person.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm not a bad person.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not a bad person.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Bai Xia.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Bai Xia.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Bai Xia.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Bai Xia.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Master.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll get some soup for her.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Miss.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Have some soup.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm not sleeping.

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Zhi Xun.

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Where's Xuan?

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
She's sleeping.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you doing?

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm looking for her.

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
She's not here.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You said she's sleeping.

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why is she not here?

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tell me why you're here.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The criminal is in trouble.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The criminal asked me to come.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why isn't the criminal here?

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The criminal is in the criminal's room.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What are you talking about?

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
To my master.

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Say something.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Open the���.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OK.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's the matter?

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's the matter?

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The police rescind me.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
The purpose of the robbery was to

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
help him in North Campus.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So he can't go through the room.

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You think he's off先?

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
One man.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You four stay outside.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The incense fire is very old.

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know what's going on.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
These two years, they suddenly passed out.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a very easy to realize.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's been a long time since they've been outside.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They're all here to make a wish.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Snake again.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Snake again.

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You don't need to be afraid of snakes here.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They're all from the mountains.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Everyone says that the snake of the magic temple

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
knows the English.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't see big snakes here.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They're all small snakes.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They never hurt people.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This is more like the magic of the magic temple.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Everyone thinks this is a long-distance search.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's go.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I've tried it.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm a poison.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't have a fatal wound.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't see any disease.

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This morning, the four temples told his family that

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the man went to the temple to give up the incense fire.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I knew that he was dead.

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think it's strange.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I want to come and take a look.

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Zhang Pu's death is not yet clear.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Now, he's dead.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Can you see the death?

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you can't see it,

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you have to open the Yan Temple.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I won't bother you with the Yan Temple.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I want you to help me see

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if this has anything to do with the demon.

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're really scared of the snake.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're ten years afraid of the snake.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I've already found three cases for you this month.

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You said that every case has something to do with the demon.

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have to find out the normal case

199
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
before I can find out the truth.

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You said that we came to find out the truth,

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but it turned out to be a demon.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We're not wasting time.

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
his relative is going to bury him here.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If we can't get the evidence,

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I can't keep my hands off

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and give it back to him.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Miss,

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
a young master just came.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I heard that you're sick

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and you're going to the hospital

212
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
to see your wife.

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I heard from the old master that

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you're going to help the court

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to make a bet.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Miss, you said that

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you can't even be a person like that.

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's quite interesting.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No matter what he's doing,

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it has nothing to do with me.

221
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Miss,

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
did you fight with Dr. Jiu?

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's angry because of you.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I've always wanted to say something.

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I've been waiting for you on the planet.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't be too proud to be with Dr. Jiu.

228
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not afraid.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The more I say it,

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the more I feel relieved.

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The more I don't regret it.

232
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Look at you.

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You run away every day.

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're a stew and a dessert.

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The young lady

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
is living her life as a mother.

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
If I were Dr. Jiu,

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I wouldn't hit you

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
even if you were drunk.

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How could I be like that?

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You should learn from your wife.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
My mother?

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You didn't see it?

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
After your wife came back,

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you were in the position of our family

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
to be a good wife.

247
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You used to be my husband's new friend.

248
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Now you're so pitiful.

249
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can't even remember waiting for you to eat.

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Really?

251
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Miss, you have to observe.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't you think

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
my husband has committed such a big sin?

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But he's not like you.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He's so grateful to be with a little demon.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He's a husband.

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
My husband should save him.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I heard him talk about it again.

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He's late.

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Really?

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Really?

262
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So you have to learn from your wife.

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You have to learn to be cool and be cool.

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Be cool and be cool.

265
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me ask you.

266
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You and Dr. Jiu fought yesterday.

267
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If he apologizes to you today,

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
what should you do?

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I should...

270
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
ignore him.

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You should see who can be touched

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
when you're with him.

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You should be a good wife.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You want to be a husband to Dr. Jiu.

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you want to live a good life,

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
you have to take the rules first.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Don't be soft and talkative.

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're right.

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Even if he comes to beg for forgiveness,

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I can't forgive him.

282
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I have to make him feel bad.

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're right.

284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Banxian.

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Banxian.

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Banxian.

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Xuan Yi is looking for you.

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Come here.

289
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Miss.

290
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Xuan Yi.

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Let's go down.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What do you want me to do?

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard from your friend Xu.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You went to Sanhuai County a few days ago

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and saw Xu Xian.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes.

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He was hit by a blow by a blow.

298
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll give him a headache.

299
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's wrong?

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Did you see Bai Wuya on him?

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What's wrong?

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He's dead.

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You should remember him.

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Do you really see Bai Wuya on him?

306
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Are you sure?

307
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What does it mean if there's no Bai Wuya?

308
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It means he's still alive.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What are you doing?

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Banxian.

311
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's go to the police station.

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll tell you later.

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Xuan Yi.

314
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,080
Brother,

315
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
can we go now?

316
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,640
Yes, you sure you need it?

317
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's get back here.

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,720
Alright.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's go.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We just left the former绞.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They just buried him.

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
His family's connections in his house

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
can't seem to get him to die begun.

324
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
We still have General Rui in our hands.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm done.

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Chi Xu, open the door.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Where are you?

329
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Where am I?

330
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Where am I?

331
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Where am I?

332
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Where am I?

333
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why am I here?

334
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Where am I?

335
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Where am I?

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Is it me?

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why am I...

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why am I a man?

339
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He is dead.

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Is it the demon?

341
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know.

342
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But it must be related to the demon.

343
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And Zhang Pu's death

344
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
has nothing to do with him.

345
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I understand.

346
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll go back and destroy the people.

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll search the whole city.

348
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay.

349
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Brother Jiu, Chi Xu.

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What a coincidence.

351
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I was thinking about it today.

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But you showed up.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's so far away.

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Where are you going?

355
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
To do something with friends.

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I understand.

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Brother Jiu is from Chengdash.

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He can't say something.

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
By the way, Brother Jiu.

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm going to visit a master.

361
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He has a great passion.

362
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He can say that he's a great man.

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How about you?

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I have something to do.

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm not going.

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Then tomorrow...

367
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Tomorrow, too.

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then...

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll go first.

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's change the date.

371
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Chi Xu.

372
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I have something to do with you.

373
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I have two tickets.

374
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll leave one for you.

375
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Thank you.

376
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You don't want to eat?

377
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll buy it later.

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay.

379
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's so hard to get this person.

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
A friend from the industry?

381
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No.

382
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He's not going to pay me.

383
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm not going to pay you.

384
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm not going to pay you.

385
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm going to visit a master.

386
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm not going to pay you.

387
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Then...

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to visit myself.

389
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
My lady.

390
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
After you are back from the city,

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
you're getting more and more Japanese.

392
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What's the matter?

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Everyone has their parents.

394
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You go by yourself.

395
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
In addition, you and Dr. Jiu

396
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
haven't recovered yet.

397
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Did he agree to marry you?

398
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No.

399
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But it has nothing to do with me getting married.

400
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Even if he doesn't,

401
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I won't marry Li Xian.

402
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He's being so mean now.

403
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It must have something to do with my father.

404
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It must be a fantasy

405
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
between Li Xian and me.

406
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He's going to get married to me.

407
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm not going by myself.

408
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Then Dr. Jiu...

409
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He's more likely to have a problem.

410
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But wait a minute.

411
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
After I handle the matter of my hand,

412
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll keep it in my hands.

413
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If you have the right,

414
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'll go now.

415
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I've been waiting for you.

416
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Please come in, Mr. Bai.

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I've asked you before.

418
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
When did you come to Guangping?

419
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I've been visiting the Moon and Moon

420
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
since the construction.

421
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So you've been together for two months.

422
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Congratulations.

423
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I haven't been there yet.

424
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But I still thank Mr. Bai.

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thanks to you,

426
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I came to Guangping

427
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
to see Mr. Bai.

428
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Two years ago, Mr. Bai made a great memory

429
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and made me remember his feelings.

430
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a pity that he didn't know

431
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
how to be kind to you.

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So I came to visit you.

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're too much.

434
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Those snakes are quite small.

435
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They're being controlled.

436
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
What?

437
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I didn't tell You Huang

438
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that he's afraid of cleaning the snakes.

439
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We'll investigate this.

440
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Us?

441
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes.

442
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You and I.

443
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You're a rabbit.

444
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Why don't you let Taozi go to see the monkey mountain?

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I didn't ask you to investigate.

446
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I didn't ask you to do it with him.

447
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
From today on,

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
don't sleep too much.

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You'll get tired.

450
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I think this is not the best time.

451
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Mr. Bai, please wait.

452
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll leave now.

453
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Who are you?

454
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
To be honest,

455
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm Bai.

456
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm a lover.

457
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I know very little about you.

458
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But

459
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I can tell you

460
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
that I'm Shilian.

461
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Mr. Shilian?

462
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I...

463
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm...

464
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Why do I look like this?

465
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Didn't you beg yourself?

466
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You wanted to be a man

467
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
in the court that day.

468
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Now you're willing to be happy.

469
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How did you know?

470
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You're a Bodhisattva?

471
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I've been there before.

472
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

473
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Then

474
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
you're a immortal?

475
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm not.

476
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm not.

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Shilian?

478
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Or...

479
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Or...

480
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I can tell you

481
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but don't be afraid.

482
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You...

483
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You're so mean.

484
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're not good at speaking.

485
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You're so good at running away.

486
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You think I won't kill you?

487
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes. If you want to kill me, you can.

488
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
If you kill me, how can I find Xuan Yin?

489
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If you can't find her, I won't let you go.

490
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Stop talking nonsense.

491
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If you want me to betray my friends,

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
you can.

493
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

494
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

495
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

497
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

498
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

499
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

500
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

501
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

502
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

503
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

504
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

505
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

506
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

508
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm not afraid of being a Bodhisattva.

509
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
She is next.

510
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
She is next.

511
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
She is next.

512
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
She is next.

513
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Next

514
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,200
For this treaty, I gave it myself.

515
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,700
.

516
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,200
And he's more vicious than us when he's on the street.

517
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Dr. Jiu!

518
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Why did you come back so late?

519
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
We went to find Mr. Li.

520
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
But he's not here.

521
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
We waited for a long time, so we came back late.

522
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Do you want to know why I went to find Mr. Li?

523
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Okay.

524
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I won't tell you.

525
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
I went to find a boyfriend.

526
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
A boyfriend?

527
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Yes.

528
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
But think it through.

529
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
I have nothing to do with you.

530
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
I've been in a relationship with you before.

531
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
I don't want to be forced by anyone.

532
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
So no matter what, I must be with him.

533
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
What do you mean?

534
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I just know.

535
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
I'm telling you, you're not a good person.

536
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
I won't keep pestering you.

537
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
What's good about you?

538
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
You're so boring and weird.

539
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
And you're so annoying.

540
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Even if I'm a good person, I won't marry you.

541
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
No one will marry you.

542
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
I don't like you.

543
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
I don't like you.

544
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
And I think you're right.

545
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I like to eat sweet and sour food today.

546
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
I'll like to eat cakes tomorrow.

547
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I won't like it.

548
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
I'll like to eat big fish and big meat.

549
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
I'll eat whatever I like.

550
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
I won't keep making people laugh.

551
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
I think too much.

552
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Dr. Zhou.

553
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Shanyi, what's wrong?

554
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Shanyi, what's wrong?

555
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Shanyi.

556
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Shanyi.

557
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
What's wrong with you?

558
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
What's this place?

559
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Is it the city of the gods?

560
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
What's the name of this place?

561
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
It's the city of the gods.

562
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
What's the name of this place?

563
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
It's the city of the gods.

564
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
The city of the gods?

565
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Dr. Zhou.

566
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
This is Guangping City.

567
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Guangping City?

568
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Why are you here?

569
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I'll kill you if you want to kill me.

570
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
I won't tell you where you are.

571
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
What are you talking about?

572
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
You don't know me?

573
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm the wine business of Ganshan Hall.

574
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Dr. Jiu?

575
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
You...

576
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Shanyi, what's wrong?

577
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Are you all right?

578
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Are you all right?

579
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Are you all right?

580
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
It's me.

581
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
What happened?

582
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I don't know.

583
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
You were so weird.

584
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
You looked like a different person.

585
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Then you asked us

586
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
if this is the city of the gods.

587
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
What else did I say?

588
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
You said...

589
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
you said that

590
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
I would come to see him soon.

591
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
What are you doing?

593
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Don't you remember me?

594
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
It was the first time I met you.

595
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
It was ten years ago.

596
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
You were still young.

597
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
You were just a child.

598
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I was a child.

599
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I was a child.

600
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I was a child.

601
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
I was a child.

602
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I was a child.

603
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I was a child.

604
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I was a child.

605
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
But you were

606
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
so emotional.

607
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
I was just passing by

608
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
and I was so emotional.

609
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Shes, are you all right?

610
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Little girl,

611
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
you should remember

612
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
that the more you are in love,

613
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
the stronger you are.

614
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
You should never be so close to each other.

615
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm sorry.

616
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
How was your shopping today?

617
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Don't mention it.

618
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I just want to buy a small snake.

619
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I don't know how much money I can make.

620
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Okay, enjoy.

621
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Okay.

622
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
The next day

623
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Little Snake,

624
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
go home.

625
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Stop being caught by the other people.

626
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Go home.

627
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,120
Next season

628
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,120
Waiting for you

629
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,200
You oh

630
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,280
as lawyers

631
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,240
you

632
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,100
�

633
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,240
I love you

634
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,320
But in Hope

635
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,080
with longer watch

636
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,540
were

637
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,920
The change

638
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Hmm.

639
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Hmm.

640
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Hmm.

641
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Ah.

642
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Hmm.

643
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Hmm.

644
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Ah!

645
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Be careful.

646
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Hmm.

647
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Hmm.

648
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Hmm.

649
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Hmm.

650
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Ah!

651
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Hmm.

652
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Hmm.

653
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,640
Hmm.

654
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,120
He's damaged.

655
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,840
So...

656
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,520
You killed my husband, Yiusang Sect.

657
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,460
Good.

658
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,040
Stop fighting!

659
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Then what did you gerçekten me take on?

660
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,780
You dream to be honest with a guy

661
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,040
and unfortunately,

662
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
you won't be able to tell the truth.

663
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,040
Now,

664
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
You can come from anywhere.

665
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,740
This is a monster tree.

666
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
It's my snake leg.

667
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,540
Snake leg can cover the original form and create a new form.

668
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,640
That day, I asked you to hide and take your body away.

669
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,740
Then you can become my snake leg.

670
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,640
This is the plate you gave me.

671
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,840
You can leave now.

672
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Go to the place you want to go.

673
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
Live your life as you want to.

674
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,440
Sir.

675
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,240
Sir.

676
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,040
Whether it's a monster or a human,

677
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,640
you are my savior.

678
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,140
Aren't you afraid of me?

679
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,040
You saved my life.

680
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
How could I be afraid of you?

681
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,540
And I have seen the evil of the world.

682
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,740
This person's heart is more terrible than the monster.

683
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,240
Sir.

684
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,740
Please take me and give me the body of the snake.

685
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,140
Sir.

686
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,440
I can make the bed and cook by the snake.

687
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,940
As long as you can do anything, I can do anything.

688
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,540
You have already become a man in the hospital.

689
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,140
Why do you still have to do these things?

690
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,940
I have been living alone in this world.

691
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,540
My family is not dependent on me.

692
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,940
My friends can support me.

693
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,940
Although I have become a man in the hospital,

694
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,940
but I don't have the ability to do anything.

695
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,940
How can I leave after I leave?

696
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,140
You are the one who gives me more money.

697
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,940
I am also a man in the world.

698
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Sir.

699
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,340
I know you are capable.

700
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,540
Please take me by your side.

701
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,140
What?

702
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,540
Sima Li has been arrested?

703
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,940
Yes.

704
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,740
How did you know? Where is she? Is she hurt?

705
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,940
She was too reckless. I don't know the exact situation.

706
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,940
I only remember that it was a temple.

707
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,540
It should be in the south.

708
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,340
It's a place that is even warmer than Guangping City.

709
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,540
What exactly is it?

710
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,140
The monster asked about the capital.

711
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,540
It's likely to be near the capital.

712
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,140
Okay. I will go find the master now.

713
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,740
Can you accompany me to the capital?

714
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,540
I can't go.

715
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,940
I have a feeling that he will come to me.

716
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,540
If I go, I will only cause you trouble.

717
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,740
Okay.

718
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,940
Here.

719
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,340
Yes, this is it.

720
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,740
You are back.

721
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,540
I thought about the reason last night.

722
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,740
It's nothing. I will solve it. Don't worry.

723
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,740
Oh, then I will leave first.

724
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
You haven't paid yet?

725
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,140
Did he buy anything just now?

726
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,140
Or did he say that he didn't want to tell you?

727
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Let's go.

728
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,140
Miss, I am going to find you.

729
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,740
He is coming.

730
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,140
He is playing chess with the master.

731
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,140
Great.

732
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,140
I will go to the capital.

733
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,140
I will go to the capital.

734
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
I will go to the capital.

735
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
I will go to the capital.

736
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
I will go to the capital.

737
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
