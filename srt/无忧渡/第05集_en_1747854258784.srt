1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
little bit of a

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
a little bit

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of a

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
little bit

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:13,480
Welcome to the Chicago

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,120
succeed

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,320
do

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Here comes the New Year's Eve dinner.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
This should be the roasted peach.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
They say it's from the Western region.

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Let's try it.

50
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Come on.

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Is it good?

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
It's good.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Then eat more.

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Here. Eat some soup.

55
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Here.

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
One more.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
You eat it yourself.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
You don't have to serve me.

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I didn't serve you.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
When I was in Nanyang,

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
you saved my life.

62
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
You saved my brother's life.

63
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
You saved my family's life.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I didn't have time to thank you.

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I have to ask you for help again.

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
I feel sorry for you.

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
You don't have to feel sorry.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
And I didn't decide to help you.

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
You won't answer me anyway.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Xuan Ye.

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Can I call you that?

72
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
I don't think so.

73
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
I always think that Dr. Jiu

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,320
or Mr. Jiu are a little old.

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
You can also call me Banxia.

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
The online reviews are different.

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
It's really the ancient capital of the Three Dynasties.

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
It's rich and rich.

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Look.

80
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
The people here are different.

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Are you from Guangping?

82
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Yes.

83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I mean,

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
people in Dachang

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
are all rich and rich.

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
They are all different.

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Can you not talk when you eat?

88
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Bravo!

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Bravo!

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Bravo!

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
No.

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
What's going on?

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
He's lying down.

94
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Where is he?

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Let's go.

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Hurry up.

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Go.

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Turn around.

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Don't be afraid.

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Just answer my question.

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
What's your relationship with the deceased?

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Nothing.

103
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
We just came here.

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Listen to me.

105
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
He's down.

106
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
What's going on?

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
What do you know?

108
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Who saw him before he died?

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm not sure.

110
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
The backstage is not for others.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
They are all from Wu Fang.

112
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Is there any other exit?

113
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Yes.

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
This way, please.

115
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Mr. An, this is the place where Tian Rui did his makeup.

116
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
I see.

117
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
You can leave now.

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Yes.

119
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Chief Wen,

120
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Chu told me to bring the deceased's belongings back to the factory.

121
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Okay.

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
By the way,

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,320
bring everyone outside back to the office.

124
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Okay.

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Chief Wen,

126
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
you can leave now.

127
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Okay.

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Thank you.

129
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Chief Wen,

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I'll go and check on the deceased.

131
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay.

132
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Thank you.

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Chief Wen,

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
you can leave now.

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Okay.

136
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Thank you.

137
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Chief Wen,

138
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
you can leave now.

139
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
His song, West River Formation,

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
is like a dragon dancing in the corner.

141
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
The one who sees it is like a mountain, the one who hears it is like the sea.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Now that I think about it,

143
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
it's still in my mind.

144
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
I can't believe

145
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
it's more than ten years ago.

146
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
He's not old, right?

147
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Yes.

148
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
He's in his 20s.

149
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
It's the best time for women.

150
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Is this the Tianming that you know?

151
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Yes.

152
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Yes, it is.

153
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
But...

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
It's been more than ten years.

155
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Why hasn't his face changed at all?

156
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Sir,

157
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
I heard that women in the Wu family have their own secret recipe.

158
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
He's dressed up at home.

159
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
He looks young, but he's not old.

160
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm not old.

161
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm not old.

162
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm not old.

163
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I'm not old.

164
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:39,320
And my father

165
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Man zusammen

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Man

167
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
I've checked Yanlailou's kitchen.

168
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
I didn't find anything suspicious.

169
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,040
Could it be that he's sick?

170
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Wenjian,

171
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,480
what do you think?

172
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,680
Your Excellency, I...

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,720
I thought I'd better not say it.

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
You can say whatever you want.

175
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,440
Your Excellency,

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
I think

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
this is a threat.

178
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,960
The case of the man who was found is a threat.

179
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,240
You said the thief who was singing was a monster.

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
What happened?

181
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,320
I asked Xuanye to go out

182
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,960
and kill the monster.

183
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Your Excellency,

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,520
you're still talking nonsense.

185
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Your Excellency, you're talking nonsense.

186
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,640
Your Excellency, this is...

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Next.

188
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,040
What's your name?

189
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,040
My name is Xiao Cu.

190
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,440
I really don't know anything.

191
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Are you hungry?

192
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll buy you something to eat.

193
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
No, thanks.

194
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
I really didn't know.

195
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,320
Where were you?

196
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,320
It's my fault.

197
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
I didn't choose a good place to eat.

198
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Next time, I'll treat you to a meal at my house

199
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
as compensation.

200
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,680
We live very close to each other.

201
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,960
You just need to open a door.

202
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
But my cooking is good.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,160
You like cooking.

204
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
I just cook for my savior.

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,480
You're really good at cooking.

206
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,640
When I saw you in Nanyang last time,

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
you weren't like this.

208
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,440
Of course.

209
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
You were the one who helped me.

210
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
Now you don't want to help me.

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,160
My attitude has changed a little bit.

212
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Next.

213
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
What's your name?

214
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
What's your name?

215
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,160
What's your name?

216
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,960
What's your name?

217
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
What's your name?

218
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
What's your name?

219
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,600
I don't know.

220
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,400
Are you done?

221
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,000
No.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,520
I'm still going to Gan Shan Tang.

223
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,560
Xuan Ye.

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,040
Xuan Ye.

225
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,960
Why are you here?

226
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,600
I came out for dinner last night.

227
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm not very lucky.

228
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,080
So...

229
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,200
You were in Yanlai Restaurant last night?

230
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes.

231
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,720
That's good.

232
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm investigating the case of Yanlai Restaurant.

233
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,000
Come with me.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,680
Let's meet the man.

235
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,480
This is Mr. Feng.

236
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,400
He was in the restaurant.

237
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,040
This...

238
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
He was with me.

239
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,320
He was in the restaurant.

240
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,240
Okay.

241
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,840
Let's go together.

242
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,840
Okay.

243
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,560
I got it.

244
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,920
Next.

245
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,160
Why am I not here?

246
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,680
I invited him.

247
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,440
Where are you going?

248
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,320
You want him to do it?

249
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
Why don't you ask the murderer to do it?

250
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

251
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,840
Ignore him.

252
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,800
The man is inside.

253
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Do you want to go in?

254
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,040
No.

255
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,840
I'll wait for you outside.

256
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,640
Wenjian.

257
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,880
Tell Dr. Jiu about this.

258
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,080
Yes, sir.

259
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,440
This man is a military agent of Yunmen's military police.

260
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,640
He suddenly went back to his old job a few days ago.

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,960
Let's put this big box in the government office.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,800
I heard Dr. Jiu from Ganxian Drugstore is here.

263
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,040
What is he doing here?

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
I don't know.

265
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,360
Be careful.

266
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,400
The box is broken.

267
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,280
It's not broken.

268
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,160
It's broken.

269
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,920
It's broken.

270
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,600
It's broken.

271
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,240
Wenjian.

272
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
The box is broken.

273
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,440
Do you need help?

274
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,040
Thank you.

275
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,840
This case is really evil.

276
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,120
I heard that the victim was killed.

277
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
What happened?

278
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,040
When he was brought back,

279
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
he was still a young girl.

280
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,200
After a while,

281
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
he turned into a dead man.

282
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Really?

283
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,000
You'll see it later.

284
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,440
Thank you.

285
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,360
That's about it.

286
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
This case is really strange.

287
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,960
But we can't be sure that it's a monster.

288
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,360
Sir.

289
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
I still need to go to the victim's residence

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
and check it.

291
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,680
After the incident,

292
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,080
I've already sent someone to seal the entire military defense.

293
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,320
Okay.

294
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay.

295
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,600
Okay.

296
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,320
Okay.

297
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,440
Go with Dr. Jiu to check it again.

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,520
Even if it's a monster,

299
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,640
don't make any noise.

300
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,120
Yes.

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
Thank you, sir.

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
What are you looking for?

303
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,680
Nothing.

304
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,360
Let's go.

305
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
Excuse me.

306
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,560
What?

307
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
Can you show me the mirror

308
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,840
I picked up?

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Why?

310
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,920
Because I think it's beautiful.

311
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,440
Miss.

312
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
It's full of evidence.

313
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,280
It's impossible to check it.

314
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,640
You'd better go home.

315
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,320
Okay.

316
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,280
Mr. Bu Kuan.

317
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
How is it going?

318
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,080
When will Dr. Jiu come out?

319
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,480
Dr. Jiu has left long ago.

320
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Where did he go?

321
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,240
I don't know. He left.

322
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,880
He left in a hurry.

323
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,920
He seems to be going to the case.

324
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
Thank you.

325
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,720
I don't know.

326
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,840
Let's go in and talk.

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,640
Here.

328
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,560
Mr. Wen.

329
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
This is the room of the victim, Tian Rui.

330
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,000
When did he go back to this four-way apartment

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,640
all his travels?

332
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,200
How long has he never been back?

333
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,720
What?

334
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,400
He hits road and bites a bug.

335
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I didn't come back.

336
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
What is this?

337
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
It's a pear.

338
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
A pear?

339
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Have you heard of the rumour of the Jade Pear?

340
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
It is said that in the time of Ziye,

341
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
a man sits alone in the secret room,

342
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,600
facing the mirror, lighting two candles,

343
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,860
and reading the jade pear's

344
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
and if the pear is not cut,

345
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
the monster can be summoned.

346
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,860
This jade pear is also called the spring pear.

347
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,860
As long as you take it, you can return to spring overnight.

348
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Return to spring overnight?

349
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
You are right.

350
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Tianrui has always been passionate about the method of health and health.

351
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
But it has always been very effective.

352
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Do you think he has taken the Jade Pear?

353
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
Maybe.

354
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
Where is his body?

355
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
He is still in the yard.

356
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
The Emperor knows that the Lord is looking for you to solve the case.

357
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
He doesn't give me the key to the room.

358
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
I will go to the Lord tomorrow morning.

359
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,860
If you can't wait, call Shixue.

360
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
I will go.

361
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,860
This mirror has a visual effect.

362
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
It will be too late if I don't go.

363
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,860
But I told him directly that he might not believe me.

364
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
I will go.

365
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Tian, I'm leaving.

366
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
I will call you for a drink another day.

367
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,860
I went to that shop last time.

368
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
It's really good.

369
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Tianrui.

370
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
You fell asleep?

371
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Tianrui.

372
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Are you following me?

373
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
I know.

374
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
He took the Divine Herb.

375
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Oh, right.

376
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860
You are right.

377
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Can I go home now?

378
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
Wait.

379
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,860
According to the book,

380
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
there was a person called Chisongzi

381
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
who took the Divine Herb

382
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
which is called Ice Jade.

383
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Since then,

384
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,860
he has been taking the Divine Herb.

385
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
He is the one who took the Divine Herb.

386
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
He is the one who took the Divine Herb.

387
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,860
He is the one who took the Divine Herb.

388
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
He has been alive for more than 800 years.

389
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
He has been alive for more than 800 years.

390
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,860
According to our recent research,

391
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,860
there is a Taoist priest named Hu in Hongzhou.

392
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,860
He claimed to have taken the Divine Herb

393
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
and lived for more than 400 years.

394
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,860
It is said that he is still alive.

395
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
But he likes to travel around the world.

396
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
He is a man of great talent.

397
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
He is a man of great talent.

398
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
He is a man of great talent.

399
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,860
He is a man of great talent.

400
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
He is a man of great talent.

401
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
It is hard to find a trace of a man of great talent.

402
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
It is hard to find a trace of a man of great talent.

403
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Master, you believe that?

404
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Master, you believe that?

405
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
Of course I don't believe it.

406
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
If there is such a Divine Herb,

407
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,860
how can there be a change of dynasty

408
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
and a change of the country?

409
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't believe it.

410
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
It doesn't mean that no one believes it.

411
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,860
According to the book,

412
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
someone who is in love with the Divine Herb

413
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
for the sake of immortality

414
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
will die of poison.

415
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Tian Rui's body

416
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,860
is old and worn out.

417
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,860
It is strange.

418
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,860
I know there are some methods

419
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
to cure it.

420
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Although they can't make the Divine Herb,

421
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
they can make the poison that is effective.

422
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
they can make the poison that is effective.

423
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Maybe Tian Rui

424
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
bought their elixir.

425
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Take your things.

426
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,860
I'll go with you.

427
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Where are you going?

428
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,860
The Lotus Room.

429
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,860
The Envoy.

430
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,860
Xuan Yi!

431
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Hurry up.

432
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
It's so late at night.

433
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
What are you doing?

434
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,860
You did a good job.

435
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
Did you encounter any trouble on the way?

436
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
No.

437
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,860
I did encounter a surprise.

438
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
What surprise?

439
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,860
I met the little girl who was hiding.

440
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,860
I met her.

441
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
You met Ban Xia?

442
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Yes.

443
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
How did you meet her?

444
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
I don't know.

445
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
What is she doing?

446
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,860
She is following me.

447
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
What is she doing?

448
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,860
She is playing with me.

449
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Playing with you?

450
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
What did you do?

451
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
I played with her.

452
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
She wanted to scare me.

453
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
I was scared of her.

454
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
Yan Li!

455
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
Why did you hit me?

456
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

457
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Are you done already?

458
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,380
Salute!

459
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,860
To the Instead!

460
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
To the obligation!

461
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,860
I don't dare!

462
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,780
You're a guard, right?

463
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,580
Yes, sir.

464
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Open the door for me.

465
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,940
Remember,

466
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,700
before we come out,

467
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,740
you stay here.

468
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,220
Yes, sir.

469
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,300
No one is allowed to enter.

470
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,940
Yes, sir.

471
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,020
He followed me and wanted to scare me.

472
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,580
So I put him in the practice room.

473
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
I scared him, too.

474
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,140
Tao,

475
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,660
don't let him ask questions.

476
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,140
Go.

477
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,740
Mr. Li,

478
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Have you ever seen a poison that makes people age overnight?

479
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
No.

480
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,740
If it's not possible to get the poison from the stomach, what should we do?

481
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,740
It's possible to get it from the body.

482
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,740
Skin, blood, hair, everything can be contaminated.

483
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,740
But it's a little troublesome because he's been dead for a day.

484
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,740
It's a little troublesome.

485
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,740
Then let's take a seat.

486
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,740
Who is it?

487
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Who is it?

488
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Let's go back.

489
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,740
Okay.

490
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Tao!

491
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
The body is gone!

492
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Let's go!

493
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,740
It's okay.

494
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Come on, put it on.

495
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,740
Let's go.

496
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
What were you doing in the yard?

497
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,740
This case is very tricky.

498
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,740
The other party might continue to kill people. I have to investigate it first.

499
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,740
I've kept your father's case in mind.

500
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,740
We're here.

501
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Where are you going?

502
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Hey.

503
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,740
I'm sorry about tonight.

504
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
Let's go.

505
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,740
Hey, Xie Yi, did you eat the radish?

506
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Go to bed early.

507
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Okay.

508
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,740
Xie Yi!

509
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Jiu Xie Yi!

510
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,740
Jiu Xie Yi!

511
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Jiu Xie Yi!

512
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
Xie Yi!

513
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Xie Yi!

514
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,740
Jiu Xie Yi!

515
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,740
I know you can hear me. I have something to tell you!

516
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
Jiu Xie Yi!

517
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
Xie Yi!

518
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,740
Jiu Xie Yi!

519
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
Stop shouting.

520
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
What?

521
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Why are you here?

522
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Didn't you call me?

523
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
I didn't call you.

524
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Besides, you won't tell me in advance.

525
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
What's the matter?

526
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
You don't want me to leave?

527
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Wait!

528
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,740
Yes, I'm not as good as you.

529
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,740
But compared to Chang'er,

530
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
I've seen a lot of things.

531
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I've seen the fish that can fly,

532
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
the spider that can speak,

533
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
the child that can grow a tail,

534
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
and the butterfly that can climb walls.

535
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,740
They are all different.

536
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
I just want to ask you,

537
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
is it normal to see a mirror that can't see?

538
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
There is a fire in Nanyang City.

539
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,740
There is one in my father's room.

540
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,740
There is also one in the nine buildings in Guangping City.

541
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
There is a murder case every time.

542
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
I know.

543
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
You don't believe me.

544
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
You think I miss my father

545
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
and I'm a fool.

546
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
But now the evidence is here.

547
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
You don't believe me, but you have to believe the evidence.

548
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
You just went to the government office

549
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
just to get this?

550
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,740
Those government offices said

551
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
they were made by Wang Wuji.

552
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
I will continue to investigate along with this clue.

553
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
Once I have news about your father,

554
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
I will tell you immediately.

555
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
No, that's it?

556
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
What else do you want?

557
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
I want to participate in the case of Yanlai Building

558
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
and find the murderer with you.

559
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
This case involves the demon.

560
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
You can't imagine the danger in it.

561
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
If I find the murderer who killed Wuji,

562
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
I can find my father's whereabouts.

563
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
So even if the front is a dragon pool,

564
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
I have to fight for it.

565
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
I have to find the murderer.

566
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
I have to find the murderer.

567
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
I will help you.

568
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
Do you like it?

569
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,740
I just ate it a while ago.

570
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
There is no harm in eating another one.

571
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
You said that a jade pear

572
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,740
can maintain the appearance of a year.

573
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
I just ate it a while ago.

574
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Why did you kill someone else to get the pear?

575
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Especially...

576
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Especially Tianrui.

577
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,740
She was jealous of you and scolded you behind your back.

578
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Shouldn't I kill her?

579
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,740
But you...

580
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
But what?

581
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
You don't like her.

582
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,740
All right.

583
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
I was wrong.

584
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
I promise you

585
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
that I will not kill anyone

586
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
until the time comes.

587
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
You didn't lie to me again.

588
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
You promised me well.

589
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
But you changed your mind.

590
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,740
Isn't she just a Tianrui?

591
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Is she worth your anger?

592
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,740
If you really don't eat it,

593
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
it will be a waste.

594
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
Look.

595
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,740
What a beautiful face.

596
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Who said that a red eye can't stay long

597
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,740
and a fire can't stay long?

598
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
As long as I am by your side,

599
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
you will not get old.

600
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
You will always be beautiful.

601
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,740
You will always be the most beautiful person.

602
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
You will never be tired of your beauty.

603
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
You will always be the most beautiful person.

604
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
You will always be the most beautiful person.

605
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,740
You will always be the most beautiful person.

606
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,740
The situation has been different lately.

607
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
You and Wu Fang have been together for seven months.

608
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
We have to change our place

609
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,740
and start a new life.

610
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
Men Tian.

611
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Xianye is looking for you.

612
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Tiao Men.

613
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
He didn't tell me.

614
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
How about I ask him and tell you?

615
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,740
No, no, no.

616
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,740
I will go with you.

617
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
Did you steal the body?

618
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
Do you have any evidence?

619
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
Did you steal the body?

620
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
You have no evidence?

621
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
If you have no evidence, why did you tell me?

622
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
If you are framing me,

623
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
I will go to the master and report you.

624
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
Is the body in the temple?

625
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Xuanye is a liar.

626
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Why did you put the body in his hand?

627
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,740
Xuanye has this ability.

628
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
You should trust him.

629
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,740
I trust him as a person who hurts his own heart.

630
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
He didn't do this.

631
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
We have a conclusion.

632
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,740
Who did it?

633
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
It's Yao.

634
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,740
Yao.

635
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,740
The case is over.

636
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
It's no use saying more.

637
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
If you have any questions,

638
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,740
go to the master.

639
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,740
Yes, sir.

640
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
I will give you one last advice.

641
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Yao is very ambitious.

642
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
He has many ways to change.

643
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
It's hard to predict.

644
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
If you insist on participating,

645
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
I may not be able to care about you

646
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,740
if something goes wrong.

647
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
You can still quit now.

648
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,740
Let's get started.

649
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm in a hurry.

650
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,740
Xuanye.

651
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Someone in the government says you are a bad person.

652
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,740
It's okay.

653
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
I didn't hear it anyway.

654
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Why is he not here?

655
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
I told him to stay here.

656
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
What is the result of the case

657
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
I asked you to investigate?

658
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
There is one.

659
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
It's similar to Tian Rui's death.

660
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
Not long ago,

661
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Zhang Cong's wife disappeared for no reason.

662
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
There were more dead bodies in the house.

663
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,740
We searched for the missing direction.

664
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
But there was no clue.

665
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Now I think

666
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,740
the dead body should be Zhang's wife.

667
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Xuanye,

668
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,740
didn't you say that the jade pear

669
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
can make the old man feel better?

670
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Why is he dead?

671
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Because he took the purple pear,

672
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
not the female pear.

673
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,740
The jade pear is divided into the female and the purple pear.

674
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
From green to mature.

675
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
You just mentioned Zhang's wife

676
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
and the dead Tian Rui.

677
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,740
They took the purple pear.

678
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
The effect of the purple pear is short.

679
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
It can keep the user's youth for seven days.

680
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
After seven days,

681
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,740
it will absorb their lives

682
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
and turn them into dry corpses.

683
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
But the female pear is different.

684
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,740
After the person who took the purple pear died,

685
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
he or she can use magic to turn them into dead bodies.

686
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
The female pear is different.

687
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,740
After the person who took the purple pear died,

688
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,740
he or she can use magic to turn them into dead bodies.

689
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
The female pear is different.

690
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,740
The female pear will absorb all the lives of the dead.

691
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,740
At this moment,

692
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
it can not only restore youth,

693
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
but also do nothing to the body.

694
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
So as long as the person took the purple pear,

695
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
he or she can live forever?

696
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,740
There is no such thing as living forever.

697
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
It's just that it took a year.

698
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,740
If the person didn't take the purple pear,

699
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
he or she will age

700
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
and return to the age he or she should be.

701
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
Then,

702
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
according to what you said,

703
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
the monster often comes out to harm people?

704
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
Yes.

705
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,740
His stomach is gone.

706
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,740
This...

707
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
How is this possible?

708
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
This...

709
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,740
I...

710
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
I...

711
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,740
The tree roots actually grow into human skin.

712
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,740
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

713
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
I wouldn't believe it even if I killed it.

714
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,740
Humans have four meridians.

715
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,740
Trees have branches that grow into nodes.

716
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
Although the phenomenon is different,

717
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
the principles are the same.

718
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
The nodes are the branches,

719
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,740
the age is the time,

720
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,740
and the monster is the tree.

721
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
I understand now.

722
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
So it's a tree demon.

723
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,740
It shouldn't be.

724
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,740
Yes.

725
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Any demon can practice the demon skill.

726
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Although the magic of the Jade pear is not common,

727
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
it doesn't belong to a certain demon.

728
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,740
If I know the door of the magic,

729
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,740
I can also practice it.

730
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,740
If you want to know what kind of demon it is,

731
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,740
you need to know the natural talent of this demon.

732
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,740
Natural talent?

733
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,740
Chi Chi.

734
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,740
This mirror is left behind

735
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,740
by Tian Rui before he died

736
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
in the backstage of Yanlai Building.

737
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,740
There are two mirrors

738
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,740
in the scene where Miss Duan's father died.

739
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,740
This is Tian Rui's mirror.

740
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,740
This is a real one.

741
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
Why is it with you?

742
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,740
This is just an ordinary mirror.

743
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
What's wrong?

744
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,740
It's been 10 hours.

745
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
Last night,

746
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,740
it couldn't take the figure.

747
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,740
If I'm right,

748
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
the demon used up this mirror.

749
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,740
This mirror can only take the figure.

750
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,740
It can't take the figure.

751
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,740
It can't take the figure.

752
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,740
But after a while,

753
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,740
it can be restored.

754
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
The demon used this mirror.

755
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
How did the demon use it?

756
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,740
The path.

757
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,740
He used this mirror

758
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
as a path to travel freely.

759
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,740
Using the mirror to travel freely

760
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,740
is not an ordinary method.

761
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
This time,

762
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
it's very likely that we met a demon who got a mirror.

763
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
It's a mirror.

764
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
A mirror?

765
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,740
How do we catch it?

766
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,740
We can catch the victim

767
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,740
by calling him.

768
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Xiao Li?

769
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,740
A mirror, a red candle, a pear,

770
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,740
a purple stone, and three grams.

771
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
We can't miss out on any of them.

772
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,740
And this place is not good.

773
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,740
We have to find an empty house.

774
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,740
It's best to find a house

775
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,740
where no one lives

776
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,740
and where the popularity is weak.

777
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
I can solve this.

778
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,740
What else do we need?

779
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,740
We need an ear.

780
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,740
It's best to find a woman.

781
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,740
A woman?

782
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,740
It's already time.

783
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,740
Why hasn't the leader arrived yet?

784
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
He should be here soon.

785
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Ji Li.

786
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,740
Come, sit.

787
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Sit.

788
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,740
Today, I especially made a pot of good tea.

789
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,740
High-class tea.

790
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Please, Miss Ji Li, share it with me.

791
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,740
Come.

792
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,740
Let's chat while we taste it.

793
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
Please.

794
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,740
Ji Li.

795
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,740
Look.

796
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,740
It's been almost five years

797
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
since I've been in the Cloud Recesses.

798
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
Almost five years.

799
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Today, I'm here to beg you

800
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,740
with this old face.

801
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Please help me for two more years.

802
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,740
Okay?

803
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,740
Ji Li.

804
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,740
The moon crosses the snowy land.

805
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,740
The moon has forgotten.

806
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,740
The peach blossoms have fallen.

807
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,740
I look back again.

808
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,740
A glance of ten thousand years.

809
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
I will remember you forever.

810
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,740
I will keep the stars and lights in my heart.

811
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,740
I will remember you forever.

812
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,740
I will remember you forever.

813
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,740
I will remember you forever.

814
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,740
I will remember you forever.

815
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,740
I will remember you forever.

816
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,740
I will remember you forever.

817
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,740
I will remember you forever.

818
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,740
I will remember you forever.

819
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
I will remember you forever.

820
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,740
I will remember you forever.

821
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,740
I will remember you forever.

822
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
I will remember you forever.

823
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,740
I will remember you forever.

824
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,740
I will remember you forever.

825
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,740
I will remember you forever.

826
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,740
I will remember you forever.

827
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,740
I will remember you forever.

828
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
I will remember you forever.

829
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,740
I will remember you forever.
