00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,200
Girlfriend

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640

little bit of a

Prop tasty

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
You don't need to wait so long.

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,140
Z Robin.

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,520
No password on it.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,540
Now it's a contract deal.

28
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,260
what happened?

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,740
get out

30
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,740
You ruined my mood!

31
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
You are crying?

32
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Who is talking?

33
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Who is talking?

34
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Who is talking?

35
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Who is talking?

36
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Don't you like this old face?

37
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Do you want to get back your youth?

38
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
I want...

39
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
Then you need to promise me one condition.

40
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
Are you willing to?

41
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
I'm willing.

42
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,740
You need to promise me...

43
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
to stay by my side forever.

44
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
You just need to promise me...

45
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
that I can let you...

46
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
keep your youth forever.

47
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
I'm willing.

48
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
I'm willing.

49
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,740
I'm willing.

50
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
I'm willing.

51
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
I'm willing.

52
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm willing.

53
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
I'm willing.

54
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
I'm willing.

55
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I'm willing.

56
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
A-Li.

57
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
I must prove you right.

58
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
I must let everyone in the city know...

59
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
that the one who married me...

60
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
is the most beautiful woman in the world.

61
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
No matter what you become,

62
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
I will love you...

63
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
and love you forever.

64
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
I will be good to you.

65
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
I will be good to you.

66
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Do you remember now?

67
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
They are all people who want to steal your beauty.

68
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
They don't understand you.

69
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Only I...

70
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,740
love you the most.

71
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,740
But you killed all the people I love.

72
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
One by one.

73
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,740
I'm going to kill you.

74
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,740
You promised me...

75
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
that you can't leave me.

76
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
You can never leave me.

77
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
You were good to me.

78
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
But they...

79
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
They spoiled you.

80
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
They are all bad.

81
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Not you.

82
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I've locked them up.

83
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
I've forgotten...

84
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
all the bad things.

85
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
A-Li.

86
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Let's start over.

87
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Okay?

88
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Okay?

89
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
I'm going to kill you.

90
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
I'm going to kill you.

91
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
I'm going to kill you.

92
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
I'm going to kill you.

93
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I'm going to kill you.

94
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm going to kill you.

95
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,740
I'm going to kill you.

96
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
I'm going to kill you.

97
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm going to kill you.

98
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
I'm going to kill you.

99
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
I'm going to kill you.

100
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
I'm going to kill you.

101
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
I'm going to kill you.

102
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm going to kill you.

103
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,460
Where is she?

104
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,340
I don't know anymore.

105
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,740
You can't solve this problem.

106
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Get in the bed and leave.

107
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Let's go to the locked room.

108
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Hurry up.

109
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,740
They are going to kill me again.

110
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
There are very scary people here.

111
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Don't tell me.

112
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Wait for me.

113
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Shen Ye!

114
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Who let you in?

115
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Shen Ye, save me!

116
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Don't be afraid. I'm here to save you.

117
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
You have some skills.

118
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Go find a place to check on him.

119
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
See how I can deal with him.

120
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
You be careful.

121
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
Don't worry.

122
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
You're so talkative.

123
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
Talkative but also capable.

124
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
You'll see.

125
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Greedy wolf!

126
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Shen Ye!

127
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Shen Ye!

128
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Don't worry.

129
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm still alive.

130
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Hanshan!

131
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Hanshan!

132
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Hanshan!

133
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
Don't panic.

134
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
I let him in.

135
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,740
The money is in my hands.

136
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I'm here to save you.

137
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Don't worry.

138
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
I'm still alive.

139
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Hanshan!

140
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Hanshan!

141
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Hanshan!

142
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Hanshan!

143
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Hanshan!

144
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Hanshan!

145
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Hanshan!

146
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Hanshan!

147
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Hanshan!

148
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Hanshan!

149
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
Hanshan!

150
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
You seem a little different.

151
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
How?

152
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
You still don't understand?

153
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
What do you mean?

154
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
You touched my mirror.

155
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
I sealed you.

156
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
You're no match for me.

157
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
I'm a big monster.

158
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
You want some face?

159
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Hanshan!

160
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
Don't, Shen Ye!

161
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Don't shoot!

162
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Shen Ye!

163
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
What are you doing?

164
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Don't shoot!

165
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Don't shoot!

166
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Come on!

167
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Don't shoot!

168
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Don't shoot!

169
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Where is Hanshan?

170
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
Hanshan!

171
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Don't shoot!

172
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Hanshan!

173
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Hanshan!

174
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
I'll kill you!

175
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Miss Ji Li?

176
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Let me out!

177
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
I'll kill you!

178
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
I really underestimated you.

179
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
I have something to ask you.

180
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
You'd better answer honestly.

181
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
You don't understand what I'm saying, do you?

182
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,740
You once took away a person named Duan Ying Heng in Nanyang City.

183
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Where is he now?

184
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
The third house on the left of Penglai County, Nanyang City.

185
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Someone set fire to the house there.

186
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,740
I saw a mirror in front of the scene that couldn't be seen.

187
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
My father's room has one too.

188
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
So did you set fire to kill someone and take my father away?

189
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
It was me.

190
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Why?

191
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Eight years ago, I was entrusted by a demon senior to catch your father.

192
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,740
When I was in Yuan Zhou, I almost succeeded.

193
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
He was very cautious.

194
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,740
He took the house and fled to Nanyang.

195
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
I chased after him all the way.

196
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
But I was about to succeed.

197
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
But there was a demon.

198
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
He was so close to me.

199
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
He took your father's life.

200
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Took my life?

201
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Yes.

202
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
He became your father's face.

203
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,740
He set fire to help him.

204
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
He almost killed me.

205
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
He almost fooled me.

206
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Luckily, I caught him in your house.

207
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Father.

208
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Father.

209
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
What's wrong?

210
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,740
I beg you.

211
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Don't hurt my daughter.

212
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
I beg you.

213
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
I beg you.

214
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Let my daughter go.

215
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
I'll go with you.

216
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,740
So you were in the room that night?

217
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
Why would I be busy?

218
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
You didn't have a good rest.

219
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,740
You must be tired.

220
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
Who is the demon that you caught?

221
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Where is he?

222
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Tell me.

223
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Okay.

224
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
I'll tell you.

225
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
I'll go with you.

226
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
I'll go with you.

227
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
I'll go with you.

228
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I'll go with you.

229
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
I'll go with you.

230
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
I'll go with you.

231
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
I'll go with you.

232
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
I'll go with you.

233
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,740
I'll go with you.

234
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
I'll go with you.

235
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
I'll go with you.

236
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
I'll go with you.

237
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
I'll go with you.

238
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
I'll go with you.

239
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
I'll go with you.

240
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Please.

241
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
No!

242
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Qin Wochuan!

243
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Ban Xiang, stop the clue!

244
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Ladyières of the believe!

245
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,080
Your Majesty, my face can't apartment officers curtain your face,

246
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,500
let alone put your teacher,

247
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,380
pretty- facto down the normal display,

248
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,380
nobody can born you under this extendent of staff!

249
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,340
So, how could you chose to destroy so many people?

250
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,400
Little오朋友

251
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,920
penis

252
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Littleachun!

253
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Littlechun!

254
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,040
Littlechun!

255
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,040
The love is like a broken love

256
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Xiao Zhuang!

257
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Xiao Zhuang!

258
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Xiao Zhuang!

259
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
An Xiang, let's go.

260
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Wait!

261
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Here, the police will be here soon. Let's go.

262
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
This is his memory. He's dead.

263
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
This is his place.

264
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
You guys go.

265
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
He's already dead. If we don't go, it'll be too late.

266
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
The person I love is dead.

267
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
The person I hate is dead too.

268
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Everything is over.

269
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,040
I know I'm wrong. I can't blame anyone.

270
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Let's go.

271
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Let's go, An Xiang. Let's go!

272
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Xiao Zhuang.

273
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
The person I love is dead.

274
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Let's end this.

275
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
I can't see anything.

276
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
I can't see anything.

277
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Do you think there's a possibility that there's a secret passage in the inn?

278
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
No.

279
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
I've already dismantled the floor.

280
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
But you've dismantled the floor.

281
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Then there's a possibility that the secret passage is on the wall.

282
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I've also dismantled the wall.

283
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
You've also dismantled the wall?

284
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
I've dismantled it all.

285
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
անת豆

286
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Are you alright?

287
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,000
Something's wrong you can tell me

288
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,940
There is an emergency in Wen Wen World

289
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,840
He can't see drinking

290
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,620
What i can do?

291
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,800
I want to know the case of Ganshan 향

292
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:33,040
The Ganshan Hall was destroyed by the Xuanye family one night.

293
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,280
Everyone said it was done by Xuanye.

294
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,200
I thought so too.

295
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,360
The Ganshan Hall is simple.

296
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,800
There are four people from Xuanye and three from outside.

297
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
His father is a doctor from the Yuanjing Civilization.

298
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,920
Stop sleeping.

299
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,120
Study hard.

300
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,400
Their brother is a little famous for studying with his father.

301
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,680
The Ganshan Hall is usually used to treat bone bones and lower damage.

302
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,920
Of course, the nine families have another identity.

303
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,760
It's the key to what you know.

304
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,600
When the school case happened, I just arrived in Guangping.

305
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,080
That was the first case I had after I came to Guangping.

306
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,360
It was also the most terrifying crime scene I've ever seen.

307
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
I can't imagine it without seeing it with my own eyes.

308
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,560
Give Me The vessel.

309
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,320
Father.

310
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,880
Mom.

311
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,780
Mr. Befeshirt...

312
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,740
Still no Tell her

313
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,100
get out of my way

314
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Xuan Ye

315
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
I've been saved

316
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
I've been saved

317
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Do it

318
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,780
Do it

319
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Do it

320
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Xuan Ye

321
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Son

322
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
It's not your fault

323
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
It's not your fault

324
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
It's because I hurt Zhang Yao's head

325
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
But I've already killed him

326
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Don't be afraid

327
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Yes, Dad

328
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
I've hurt your mom

329
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
I've hurt your brother

330
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,780
I've hurt everyone

331
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
It's none of your business

332
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Dad

333
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
It's me

334
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
It's me

335
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
I made Zhang Yao angry

336
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Zhang Yao came to Ganshan Hall to look for a cook

337
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I caused you and I...

338
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Do you remember what Dad said to you before?

339
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Good and evil are different

340
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
There are good and bad things in the devil

341
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Even if your parents and your brother

342
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
are all killed by the devil

343
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,780
You can't be blinded by hatred

344
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Kill the innocent regardless of right and wrong

345
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,780
And you can go to the world

346
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
But the underground city

347
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
There are devils, scum, big devils, and rebels

348
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
You can't go

349
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
And

350
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,780
This is your bodyguard

351
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
As long as he's still here

352
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
You'll be safe

353
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
Do you remember?

354
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Dad

355
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,780
Why did you suddenly tell me this?

356
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
It's okay

357
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Xuan Yi

358
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Xuan Yi

359
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
Dad

360
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
Xuan Yi

361
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,780
I'll leave Ganshan Hall to you

362
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,780
And you have to keep the underground city

363
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,780
Those five swords are not ordinary soldiers

364
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Especially the last two

365
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,780
You can't use them unless you have to

366
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Xuan Yi

367
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Xuan Yi

368
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Chang Le, come in

369
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Xuan Yi

370
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Dad, I'm here to save you

371
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Don't waste your energy

372
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm sorry

373
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
The cause of the country's fate

374
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
Chang Le is not a thread

375
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,780
It means everything is destiny

376
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
Our family

377
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,780
It's destined to happen

378
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
This is

379
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
Hu Lian's daughter

380
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
Xuan Yi

381
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
I don't know

382
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
For you

383
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
What is the best?

384
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
I made a mistake

385
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
Dad

386
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Dad, hang in there

387
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
There are so many keyers

388
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,780
You can find keyers to solve the medical books

389
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
I'll take you to the hospital

390
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
Go

391
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,780
It's useless

392
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
It's useless

393
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Son

394
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
Remember

395
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:19,780
Only you can decide who you are

396
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Dad

397
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,780
Dad

398
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Dad

399
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
When I arrived at the crime scene

400
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
The sky was already bright

401
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Xuan Yi kneeled at the cliff

402
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,780
The knife in his hand killed his father

403
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,780
I can see the situation at the time

404
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Everyone died

405
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Xuan Yi's hand was unchangeable

406
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
So I took him to the case

407
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,780
I've been believing all these years

408
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
He is the murderer

409
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Until these days

410
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Until these days

411
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,780
I believed that there was a demon in the world

412
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
I went to ask Wen Jian

413
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,780
Wen Jian told me

414
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,780
Xuan Ye's family was poisoned

415
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
The poison is very strong

416
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,780
Once poisoned, it will lose its mind

417
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Become like a beast

418
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Xuan Ye's family was also helpless

419
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
But at that time

420
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,780
He didn't defend himself

421
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
What did he say

422
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
He said he was the murderer

423
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
Why

424
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,780
I used to think he had nothing to change

425
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
But he was wrong

426
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
He was wrong

427
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,780
I used to think he had nothing to change

428
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
But now it seems

429
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,780
He was dying on purpose

430
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
It seems that the day of the interrogation

431
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Xuan Ye's master uncle suddenly came to the square

432
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,780
He is quite capable

433
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,780
I don't know how to convince the Lord

434
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,780
So I put this case in the hands of Liu Kou

435
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Xuan Ye was acquitted

436
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
I naturally don't accept it

437
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,780
But Lord Fu Yun said

438
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
Liu Kou is just an excuse

439
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
The truth is that there is a demon

440
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
How could I believe it at that time

441
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Chu Bu Tao

442
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,780
Do you know if Xuan Ye has been poisoned

443
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,780
Did Xuan Ye get any serious injuries?

444
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,780
There is no one in this line who is not injured

445
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,780
I was hurt when I was young

446
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
Then I don't know

447
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,780
I always thought he was a murderer

448
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
Always make him difficult

449
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
I can't count on him as a friend

450
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,780
I want to know what Xuan Ye used to be

451
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
I heard from Wen Jian

452
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,780
He is a free-spirited person

453
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
He is free-spirited

454
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Don't be afraid, I'll save you

455
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,780
You have some skills

456
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,780
Live and believe

457
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
Don't worry

458
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
I haven't hurt my waist yet

459
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
I think I am extraordinary

460
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
Great

461
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
High in the eye

462
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
Very arrogant

463
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,780
I'm a big demon

464
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
You should be ashamed

465
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
But now

466
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Who has experienced such a thing

467
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Will change

468
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Do you know what I said to me at the scene of the crime

469
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
What is the first sentence

470
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
Why

471
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
He asked me to kill him

472
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
I don't know

473
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
I'm all over

474
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,780
Yes

475
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
All over

476
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
Come back

477
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Are you hungry

478
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,780
If you are hungry, find something to eat first

479
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Put it on the horse

480
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Erlang, look

481
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
The goods on the mirror are very good

482
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
It must be worth it

483
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Yes, Erlang, it's really good

484
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Xuan Ye, Xuan Ye

485
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
I have no money for you

486
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,780
You go to your brother and you go

487
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Dad, can't you afford it

488
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Can't you afford it

489
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,780
As the saying goes, there are two kinds of people

490
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
See a pig become a pig

491
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
This is what you taught me

492
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Did I teach you to cut off the head of the moon?

493
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
They like

494
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,780
I beat you to death

495
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
What are you doing

496
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Hurry up, why don't you listen to me

497
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Once you have a thought, you can

498
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
I didn't expect the chiropractor

499
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,780
I've experienced such a terrible thing

500
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Miss, what are you looking at

501
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
Nothing

502
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Childe

503
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,780
Childe, a letter from Yuanzhou

504
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,780
Childe, did you get any news from the miss

505
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
Uncle Xu, help me with the horse

506
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Yes

507
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,780
I told you I really don't feel well

508
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
How can you say that

509
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
I told you I really don't feel well

510
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,780
I've never been cold since I came

511
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,780
And said I don't need to take medicine

512
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Sit down first

513
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
I'll help you take your pulse later

514
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
It's still cold

515
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
Just take some medicine

516
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,780
If you are busy, you tell me about the medicine

517
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
I'll take it myself

518
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
You go to catch

519
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I'll go to catch

520
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,780
Okay, windproof two thousand

521
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,780
Windproof in

522
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
The third row, the fourth drawer

523
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
Found it

524
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,780
You sleep for six days

525
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
You don't eat or drink

526
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,780
I'm afraid you'll starve to death

527
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
I want to send you food

528
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
But I can't eat and drink

529
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,780
He said you don't need to eat and drink when you sleep

530
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Banxia

531
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
Banxia Yiqian

532
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
Banxia Yiqian

533
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
Banxia Yiqian

534
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
Oh

535
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,780
Banxia Yiqian

536
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Oh

537
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,780
Banxia Yiqian

538
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
Oh

539
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
Banxia Yiqian

540
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
Oh

541
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
Banxia Yiqian

542
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
Oh

543
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Banxia Yiqian

544
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
Oh

545
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
Banxia Yiqian

546
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
Oh

547
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Banxia Yiqian

548
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
Oh

549
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Banxia Yiqian

550
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,780
Oh

551
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,780
Banxia Yiqian

552
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
Oh

553
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,780
Banxia Yiqian

554
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh

555
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Banxia Yiqian

556
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Oh

557
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
Banxia Yiqian

558
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Oh

559
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Banxia Yiqian

560
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
Oh

561
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
Banxia Yiqian

562
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
Oh

563
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,780
Banxia Yiqian

564
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Oh

565
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Banxia Yiqian

566
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Oh

567
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
Banxia Yiqian

568
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
Oh

Banxia Yiqian

570
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,780
Oh

571
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Banxia Yiqian

572
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
Oh

573
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,780
Banxia Yiqian

574
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Oh

575
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
Banxia Yiqian

576
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,780
