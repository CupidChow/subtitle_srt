1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What would you order for dinner tonight?

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,260
Let's head to the Mushroom House once again, and pick what to eat!

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,160
relatable

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,500
Your response hurts...

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,800
She wants to be the only one next to you

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,380
I'm going to make a

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,520
little bit of a

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,440
little bit of a

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,160
little bit of a

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,160

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,160
little bit of a

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
little bit of a

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,160
little bit of a

little bit of a

20

little bit of a

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,160
little bit of a

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
little bit of a

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
little bit of a

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
little bit of a

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
little bit of a

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
little bit of a

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
little bit of a

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
little bit of a

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
little bit of a

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
little bit of a

00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
little bit of a

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
little bit of a

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
little bit of a

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
little bit of a

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
little bit of a

36
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
little bit of a

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
little bit of a

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,160
little bit of a

39
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
little bit of a

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
little bit of a

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
little bit of a

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
little bit of a

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,160
little bit of a

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
little bit little bit

45
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
of a shadow

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
A little bit of a

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
little bit of a

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
little bit of a

49
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
little bit of a

50
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:17,680
Timing with a

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,780
老師

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Owner, come crowds

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Why are you following me?

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,040
What? This road is opened by you.

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Only you can go, not me?

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Fine, you follow me.

57
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,040
I won't go back with you to see your mother.

58
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
If you have the ability, follow me to Guangping City.

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
I, Chu You Huang, the head of Guangping, will obey your order.

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
What order?

61
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
The personal badge of Lord Song.

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Seeing this order, I will obey you.

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,040
You're going to receive the order like this?

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
I will obey your order.

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Lord Song ordered me to investigate the missing Wang case.

67
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I chose you to be the detective.

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
The order has been issued.

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
You can go to Guangping the day after tomorrow.

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
You don't have to go back and report it.

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Just follow me to handle the case.

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Sit down.

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
This is not right.

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,040
The missing Wang case is a case from many years ago.

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,040
The case may be related to this case.

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Moreover, the missing Wang is His Majesty's uncle.

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
He is a royal family member and has a noble status.

78
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,040
If he disappears, he will be searched everywhere.

79
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Do you have any objection?

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
I don't dare to.

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Fine. Since you don't have any objection, let's go.

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Where are we going?

83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Back to the capital.

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Isn't the missing Wang missing in Guangping?

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
We need to find clues for the investigation.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
The missing Wang is from Shendu.

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
We will go back to Shendu to find an old man he knows.

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
We will ask him first.

89
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
What old man?

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
My mother.

91
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Master, we have been looking for him for so long.

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
We finally found a demon hiding over there.

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Why did you let him go so easily?

94
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
We are all from the same sect.

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
It is not convenient to interfere.

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
A little demon is nothing.

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Why bother to disturb the spirit?

98
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Master, this tea is...

99
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,040
I have been observing the North Dou in the night.

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040
It is in the southeast.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Today, we will have a guest.

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Sir, this lady is looking for you.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Father, I cannot stand by and watch this.

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,040
I will go to the underground city tomorrow.

105
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,040
I hope you will not blame me for my words.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I will be waiting for you.

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Banxia.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Banxia.

109
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Dr. Jiu.

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Long time no see.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Are you looking for Miss Duan?

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Yes.

113
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Miss Duan left early in the morning.

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Left early?

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Where did she go?

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
I don't know.

117
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
The two of them left together.

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Hurry up!

119
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Be careful!

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Don't fall!

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Hurry up!

122
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
What are you two doing?

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
Going to the underground city.

124
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,040
Do you have a pass?

125
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Please wait.

126
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
Hurry up!

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
The underground city.

128
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,440
Miss Duan,

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
you wait here first.

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
We'll go out and ask around.

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
If there's any news,

132
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
we'll come back and tell you.

133
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
I'll go with you.

134
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
The underground city is full of snakes.

135
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,640
It's inconvenient to bring you along.

136
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,640
You two wait here.

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Thank you.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Miss,

139
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
is it daytime or night?

140
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
It should be night.

141
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
But,

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,840
the ship didn't leave for long.

143
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,640
We're still in the underground city.

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
It should be.

145
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,240
I felt familiar when I came here.

146
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,640
Now that I see it,

147
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,640
I should have been here.

148
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,840
You should have been here.

149
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you remember I told you

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,440
that I was kidnapped when I was little?

151
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
It was the last time I met Man Ying.

152
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
That's it?

153
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Manager Lu,

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
your goods have arrived.

155
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Thank you.

156
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Let's go.

157
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Light up the goods.

158
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Yes.

159
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Let's go.

160
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
What's wrong?

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I can smell the snake's waist

162
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,440
when I come here.

163
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
I don't dare to go in.

164
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
How did you get in before?

165
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I went back

166
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
when I got here.

167
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Hello,

168
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm Lu Chunmin.

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm a businessman

170
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
in the underground city.

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
May I know your name?

172
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
My name is Jiu.

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm Chi Xue.

174
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Jiu,

175
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,840
is this your first time

176
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,640
to come to the underground city?

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,440
If you don't mind,

178
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,640
I'd like to guide you.

179
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Thank you.

180
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
You're welcome.

181
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Xun Yi,

182
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,840
there's a painting here.

183
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
This is the Dragon Gate of the Rain.

184
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
It's said that the flood

185
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
in Shanggu was severe.

186
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
The ancient people knew the world of rain.

187
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,640
They made a river to pass through,

188
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
but it was built in the Dragon Gate.

189
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
They led their tribemen to pass the Dragon Gate

190
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
and went to the east, west, and second mountain

191
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
to pass the water.

192
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
It has a history of 13 years.

193
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
The ancient people knew the world of rain.

194
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
They made a river to pass through,

195
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
but it was built in the Dragon Gate.

196
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
They led their tribemen

197
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
to pass the water.

198
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
It has a history of 13 years.

199
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
There's also the Fish Palace,

200
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
the Flower Palace,

201
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
the Golden Thread Sea,

202
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
and the Queen's Pavilion.

203
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
They're all

204
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
the legends of the world.

205
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Do you know

206
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
who painted these murals?

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
I don't know.

208
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
The underground city is so old.

209
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
It's impossible to find out

210
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
who painted them.

211
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I think these murals are bright

212
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,640
and preserved in such a damp environment.

213
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
The city is still complete.

214
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
It's not like an old place.

215
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Their age should not be long.

216
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
The people who built the underground city

217
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
are not the same group, right?

218
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
No matter who it is,

219
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
it's easy to paint these stories

220
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
that don't believe in fate,

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
don't believe in books,

222
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,640
and don't believe in fate.

223
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
You have a good eye.

224
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Please.

225
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
The underground city looks ordinary.

226
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
It's actually a gold mine.

227
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
You two should be careful

228
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
when you come here for the first time.

229
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Thank you for reminding me.

230
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Brother,

231
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
I'll go with you.

232
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
How about a drink?

233
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
We still have important things to do.

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
We won't go together.

235
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
That's a pity.

236
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Thank you for your help.

237
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
I'm sorry for the trouble.

238
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm leaving.

239
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Goodbye.

240
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Goodbye.

241
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Goodbye.

242
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Let's go.

243
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Xun Yi,

244
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
where should we go?

245
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
You two!

246
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Are you looking for someone?

247
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Ma Songqi, the patrol horse of the underground city

248
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,640
is willing to help you.

249
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Don't be nervous.

250
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
We are serious people.

251
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Please look.

252
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
We are the 18 commercial companies

253
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
who work together to verify the patrol horse.

254
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
We are the police who are responsible

255
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
for the crime in the underground city.

256
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,640
We are here to help you.

257
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
How about this service?

258
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Let's consider it.

259
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Xun Yi,

260
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
he doesn't look like a good person.

261
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
I don't want money.

262
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
But it's not that good.

263
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
This young man is so far-sighted.

264
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Xun Xun, let's go.

265
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Okay.

266
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Please rest assured.

267
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Not only me,

268
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
all the patrol horses in the underground city

269
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,640
are not allowed to ask for money from the visitors.

270
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
This is the rule set by the 18 commercial companies.

271
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
No one dares to violate it.

272
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
What do you do if you don't collect money?

273
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
The patrol horse belongs to the Chamber of Commerce.

274
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Of course, it has the power to take it.

275
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,640
But if the visitors

276
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,640
see us talking nonsense,

277
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
they can give us some pocket money.

278
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
We can't take it.

279
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Thank you.

280
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Thank you.

281
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
We are here.

282
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Please come in.

283
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
What is this place?

284
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,640
This is the small cave I told you about.

285
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
This is one of the 18 famous commercial companies

286
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
in the underground city.

287
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
It's the main business of money.

288
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
The underground city rules that

289
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
all business that comes from the outside

290
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
must go to the small cave first

291
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,640
and exchange the money for the cash.

292
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
So all the transactions in the underground city

293
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
are to use cash, right?

294
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
That's right.

295
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Please take a break here.

296
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I'll go get a drink.

297
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Thank you.

298
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Thank you.

299
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
You're welcome.

300
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Please wait a moment.

301
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Please be quiet.

302
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
What's wrong?

303
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Nothing.

304
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Nothing.

305
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Excuse me.

306
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Excuse me.

307
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Do you really have no money?

308
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
You have such a tight wallet.

309
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
There must be some good stuff.

310
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Maybe there's only a little money.

311
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
If we take it out,

312
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
we can exchange for some cash.

313
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
That's right.

314
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
You...

315
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Is that okay?

316
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
You've been preventing me all the way.

317
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Just for this?

318
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Of course.

319
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
I'm afraid you'll steal my radish.

320
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Thank you.

321
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
This way, please.

322
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,640
This is the cheapest room in this inn.

323
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
There's a basin in the bathroom.

324
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
The water is in the tank.

325
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
We don't have time to light up the candles.

326
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Please have a seat.

327
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

328
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,640
we rarely entertain our guests in this room.

329
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Please don't leave anything inside.

330
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

331
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
please don't leave anything inside.

332
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Please don't leave anything inside.

333
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Please have a good rest.

334
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Slowly.

335
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Xuan Yi.

336
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
It's noisy here.

337
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
There's a noodle stall outside.

338
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
And this back room...

339
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Why did they arrange it like this?

340
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Chi Xu,

341
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
please don't mind.

342
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's clean up first.

343
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
After that,

344
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
we'll go find Ban Xia.

345
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Brother,

346
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
who is it?

347
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Nothing.

348
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Two poor guys live here.

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Where's Fan?

350
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
He said he had something to do outside.

351
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
He'll be back later.

352
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Look at this map.

353
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Look at it carefully.

354
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Here.

355
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Here.

356
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
And here.

357
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
We've searched all these places.

358
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Brother,

359
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
we've been searching for a long time.

360
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
We didn't even find a trace of King Xian.

361
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Did we find it wrong?

362
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
It's impossible.

363
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
We must have leaked the door.

364
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Brother,

365
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
we've lived on the third floor and the second floor.

366
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Now we're living here.

367
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
If we can't find it,

368
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
we'll go to the street.

369
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
I've been starving for days.

370
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
You've been in Guangping for so long,

371
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
but you haven't been to the underground city.

372
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
You grew up in Shenzhou.

373
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Have you seen a Shia soldier?

374
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I have.

375
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Where did the Shia soldier come from?

376
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
You're the one who asked.

377
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
I was just saying.

378
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
It doesn't mean you haven't seen it.

379
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,640
I heard you were looking for me.

380
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
We're looking for the best horse in the underground city.

381
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
That's me.

382
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Really?

383
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Absolutely.

384
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
You can ask around.

385
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm the best horse in the underground city.

386
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
My name is Song Qi.

387
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Let me introduce you.

388
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,640
I can swear on my silver in Xiaodongtian.

389
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Do you have it?

390
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
It's not about whether I have it or not.

391
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,640
As long as you tell me,

392
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
I'll definitely do it well.

393
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
It's autumn.

394
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
This man came to the underground city with his wife.

395
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
He disappeared.

396
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
He's over 40 years old.

397
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
He's a noble and generous man.

398
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
His wife is old,

399
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
but she's a good dancer.

400
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
She has a lot of experience.

401
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
They might use the name of the person.

402
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Her surname is Bai or Wei.

403
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
This is the deposit.

404
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Where is it?

405
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
In three days,

406
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
you can bring me any information about him.

407
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Twice as much.

408
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
How can you believe him?

409
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
He's a snake.

410
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
It must be easier to find people than us.

411
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
You don't help him get the money and run away?

412
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
I don't need this money.

413
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
You look so happy.

414
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
You're just like your mother.

415
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Thank you for your sincere evaluation.

416
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
I'll pass it on to you.

417
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
No need.

418
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Hello, I'm Ma San.

419
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm the famous horse in the underground city.

420
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
I wonder what you want to see me for.

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
We're looking for the best horse in the underground city.

422
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Isn't that me?

423
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
It's autumn.

424
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
This man came to the underground city with his wife.

425
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
He disappeared.

426
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
His identity is unknown.

427
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
You're here.

428
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Miss, please eat.

429
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
It's been a couple of days.

430
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Why is there no news?

431
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Miss,

432
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
do you think

433
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
they're really trying to help us?

434
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
They've been asking about Gan Shen Tang.

435
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
They said they don't know Dr. Jiu.

436
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
They changed their attitude.

437
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
But Xuan Ye told me

438
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
they're really

439
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
a witch-hunting group.

440
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Witch-hunting group?

441
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
They're different.

442
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Kong Tong Zi said he's a witch-hunting group.

443
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
I don't think

444
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
they care about us.

445
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Let's go find them.

446
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Okay.

447
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Tihu Bookstore

448
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
is a store.

449
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
The underground city is big.

450
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
But we can't find them.

451
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
We can find them.

452
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Let's eat.

453
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
We'll go after dinner.

454
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
You're on time.

455
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Did you meet a lot of people these days?

456
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Am I the first one

457
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
to bring news?

458
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
You're right.

459
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
You're the best

460
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
in the underground city.

461
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
You're so kind.

462
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I know

463
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
the person you're looking for.

464
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Many people came to the underground city

465
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
to find him.

466
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
But they didn't do anything.

467
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Please look this way.

468
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
This is

469
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
the residence of the real person, Huang Fu Bai.

470
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
You're looking for him.

471
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
You're looking for him in the underground city.

472
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Huang Fu Bai

473
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
is very weird.

474
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
He meets three people every day.

475
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
If I hadn't

476
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
asked him to call you

477
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
I would have called you.

478
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Yang.

479
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Yang.

480
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Here it is.

481
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Thank you.

482
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
I may need to trouble you in the future.

483
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
You're welcome.

484
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
I'll leave you to your business.

485
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I won't accompany you.

486
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Goodbye.

487
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Goodbye.

488
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
I don't know if it's real or not.

489
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
You gave him the money again.

490
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
You don't believe him?

491
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Or you don't believe me?

492
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I don't believe you.

493
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
I don't believe you.

494
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Is there anyone?

495
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Yes.

496
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Close the door.

497
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Another one?

498
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
I see.

499
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
You two are so smart.

500
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
You're not sick.

501
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Why are you here?

502
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
You have a good eye.

503
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
We're not here to ask for treatment.

504
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
It doesn't matter what you're here for.

505
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
It's wrong to treat a person.

506
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Of course.

507
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Two years ago

508
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
this person came here

509
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
with his wife.

510
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Do you remember?

511
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Who are you?

512
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
To be honest

513
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
we're the subordinates of Dali Temple.

514
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
This is the uncle of the emperor

515
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
King of Xin'an.

516
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Two years ago, he came to the underground city

517
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
and disappeared.

518
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
We're here to find him.

519
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I advise you not to look for him.

520
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Why?

521
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Even if you find him

522
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
he's already

523
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
a pile of bones.

524
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
What do you mean?

525
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
He has a blood disease.

526
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
He was in a panic when he came to me.

527
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
He should be

528
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
dead by now.

529
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I've read a lot of papers

530
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
about the prince.

531
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
There's no mention of his incurable disease.

532
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
There's a doctor in the palace.

533
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
He's ill.

534
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
If I can cure him

535
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
he won't come to me.

536
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
It's a pity that he's too late.

537
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
I have no reason to come back.

538
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Xiao Tao!

539
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Xiao Tao, don't run!

540
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Stop!

541
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Where are you, you thief?

542
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
You dare to destroy the underground city

543
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
and steal things.

544
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Do you want to die?

545
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm fine.

546
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Miss, is this your wallet?

547
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Yes.

548
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Thank you.

549
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
You're welcome.

550
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
But it's dangerous to

551
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
bring so much money with you.

552
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Remember, go to Xiaodongtian

553
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
and exchange the money for the ticket.

554
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
No one will be able to steal it.

555
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
We just came here.

556
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
We're not familiar with the rules.

557
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
It's okay if you're not familiar.

558
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
You have to find someone to lead the way.

559
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Do you know what it means to be a guest?

560
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Do you want to buy things or find someone?

561
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
We're looking for someone.

562
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Then you should have met me.

563
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
I'm Ma Songqi, the horse rider of the underground city.

564
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,520
I'm the

565
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
I can help you.

566
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Really?

567
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Of course.

568
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
No need.

569
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
We can find it ourselves.

570
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Thank you.

571
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
I didn't know that.

572
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
You didn't know that?

573
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
I didn't know that.

574
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
But I can help you.

575
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
But I can help you.

576
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
No need.

577
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Thank you.

578
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
I

579
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Be careful.

580
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
What are you looking at?

581
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
I didn't see anyone.

582
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
What's that smell?

583
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Is it my nose?

584
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Or did you eat something dirty?

585
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
You're so naughty.

586
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Right?

587
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Brother, he scolded me.

588
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
You're so strange.

589
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
What are you doing?

590
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
It's none of your business.

591
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm trying to persuade you.

592
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
I'm trying to persuade you.

593
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Don't be like your boss.

594
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Don't be like your boss.

595
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
You can't do that.

596
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
You can't do that.

597
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
You can't do that.

598
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
You can't do that.

599
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
You can't do that.

600
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
You can't do that.

601
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
You're dreaming.

602
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Brother, what's that attitude?

603
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
I'll beat them.

604
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
It's not cool.

605
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
Master, those two women are not in the inn.

606
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Where can they go?

607
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
They may not go back.

608
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
They go to look for it themselves.

609
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
They don't have the strength to go back.

610
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Is there anything wrong?

611
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
After the reorganization of the underground city.

612
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
It's not that messy.

613
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
But we have to find them as soon as possible.

614
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Master, you really want to help him find his parents?

615
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Take money and help them get rid of the disaster.

616
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
We can't get into the underground city without their communication.

617
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
We can't get into the underground city without their communication.

618
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
I saw it a few days ago.

619
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
They are close to the kid from the Bajumen.

620
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
They lied to us that they didn't know each other.

621
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
They lied to us that they didn't know each other.

622
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Master,

623
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
what you said is a misunderstanding among the people of the same path.

624
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Don't be too cruel.

625
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
I don't share the same path with people who are different from each other.

626
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
I don't share the same path with people who are different from each other.

627
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Look at this.

628
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Look at this.

629
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Run!

630
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Watch out!

631
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Watch out!

632
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Watch out!

633
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Who are you?

634
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
You still want to run?

635
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Monster?

636
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Yes.

637
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
What Xuanye said is right.

638
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
There is a monster in the underground city.

639
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
We ran into one as soon as we came out.

640
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
But I don't think he is a bad guy.

641
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
He helped us catch the thief and get the money back.

642
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
He is a bad guy.

643
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
The monster is good and bad.

644
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
He is a good guy.

645
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
What are you afraid of?

646
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
What are you afraid of?

647
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
What are you afraid of?

648
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
What should we do now?

649
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Let's do something!

650
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,520
Fine, then.

651
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Then let's go inside.

652
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Good idea.

653
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Xiaojing!

654
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Are you alright?

655
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Quick!

656
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
I am ok.

657
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Why did he...

658
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Just a little problem.

659
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
You are not a man.

660
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
You are a man.

661
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
You are a man.

662
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
You are a man.

663
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
You are a man.

664
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
You are a man.

665
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
You are a man.

666
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
You are a man.

667
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
You are a man.

668
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
You are a man.

669
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
You are a man.

670
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
You are a man.

671
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
You are a man.

672
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
You are a man.

673
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
You.

674
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
You.

675
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
You.

676
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
We didn't see you.

677
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
What's wrong?

678
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
What's wrong?

679
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
What people are you talking about?

680
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Just ignore what people say.

681
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
You are a father right?

682
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
How can you be like this?

683
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
You are hitting us?

684
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
There is one more person behind us.

685
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
You.

686
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Just ignore them.

687
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,480
Let's go.

688
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,560
There's a fight ahead.

689
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,240
Hurry up.

690
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,040
Wait for me.

691
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Someone's fighting.

692
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,000
They're fighting.

693
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,160
They're fighting.

694
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Miss Deng.

695
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
You know her?

696
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,960
Then why did she save you?

697
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,200
And why did you help her?

698
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
What about you?

699
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,640
Why did you hurt her?

700
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,840
You said your eyes can turn into demons.

701
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,240
You should know what she is.

702
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,760
Has she done anything bad?

703
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,600
But she's a demon.

704
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,160
So what if she's a demon?

705
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,840
She shouldn't be killed if she's a demon.

706
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,520
You don't know your wife.

707
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,600
You can't tell the difference between a human and a demon.

708
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,880
Tell me.

709
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,800
Do you know her?

710
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,560
Where did she run to?

711
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
I don't know.

712
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,640
Tell me.

713
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
I don't know her.

714
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,700
Tell me.

715
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,240
Tell me.

716
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,160
Why are you here?

717
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Dr. Chou.

718
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,200
And you again.

719
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,760
Do you wanna die?

720
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,720
Bajor's scum so common.

721
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,080
You're so swapped and ferocious.

722
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,760
One more time.

723
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll see you around.

724
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,800
See you again

725
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,100
You two wait outside

726
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,020
Come with me

727
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,040
Come

728
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm sorry.

729
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,000
Why did you come to the underground city alone?

730
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,200
It's not one person. It's four people.

731
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,800
You mean the two people from before?

732
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,200
There was some misunderstanding between us.

733
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Misunderstanding?

734
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,400
It's my business anyway. I don't want to explain it to you.

735
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
For you, I broke the rules between my father and I.

736
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,000
What do you think I am?

737
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
I was controlled by you.

738
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
I investigated your parents' whereabouts.

739
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,600
What? You're going to break the rules before you get over it?

740
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,200
You found someone more suitable than me?

741
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,400
I don't understand. What did I do to offend you?

742
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,400
What is worse than you, a big girl?

743
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,400
Say something.

744
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,800
Why are you so fierce? This is my business.

745
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Do I have to report to you wherever I go? What is my relationship with you?

746
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,400
It's all my fault. I was too nosy.

747
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
You have nothing to do with me. I don't have the right to control you.

748
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm leaving now. I won't help you anymore.

749
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Why are you holding me?

750
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Let go.

751
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Let go.

752
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
You're hurt.

753
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Are you still leaving?

754
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll leave after I finish reading.

755
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,600
Sit down.

756
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
Don't cry. You were the one who didn't tell me.

758
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Why didn't I tell you? Your father told you not to come to the underground city.

759
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,600
You insisted. You're an adult now. Why are you so disobedient?

760
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,200
Why do you think I'm disobedient?

761
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
It's dangerous.

762
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,200
No matter it's me or you, you have to be careful.

763
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
You know?

764
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,200
Let me be careful.

765
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,200
I almost fought with them on the street just now.

766
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,000
I was saving your life.

767
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,200
We were just thinking. He just wanted to scare me.

768
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,600
But you didn't.

769
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,600
It's okay.

770
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm sorry.

771
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
What happened just now?

772
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Why did those two people want to hurt you?

773
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
They wanted to kill that person.

774
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
But that person saved me before.

775
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
And in order to help me,

776
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I was also chased.

777
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
I pushed the log down.

778
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
And he ran away.

779
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Just one person?

780
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Ten ghosts.

781
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
How could you help a ghost?

782
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
What's wrong with ghosts?

783
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Ghosts can't be killed.

784
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
And he helped me before.

785
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Okay.

786
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Remember not to touch water these two days.

787
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Okay.

788
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
You've been looking for two days.

789
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Have you found anything?

790
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
What?

791
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
The Tihu Bookstore.

792
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
From tomorrow,

793
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll look for it with you.

794
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Okay.

795
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Wait a minute.

796
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
From now on,

797
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
no matter what happens,

798
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
we'll discuss it.

799
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
We'll make a decision after that.

800
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Do you understand?

801
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Coming.

802
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
What's wrong?

803
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
It's not me knocking.

804
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
It's him.

805
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Bro,

806
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
we meet again.

807
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
My master is here.

808
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
A person with severe illness,

809
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
came to the underground city,

810
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
asked for help from a famous doctor,

811
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
and lost hope.

812
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
He disappeared without a sound.

813
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
What's the reason?

814
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
No reason.

815
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
So you think he committed suicide?

816
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
He might be sick.

817
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
He died anyway.

818
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
It's reasonable that he couldn't be found.

819
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
I don't think so.

820
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Look,

821
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
the family of the King of Xin'an is big.

822
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
The King has four sons and six daughters.

823
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
The youngest is only four years old.

824
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
The Princess has no children.

825
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
The other concubines can all be raised.

826
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Do you think

827
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
the life of the King's family

828
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
is peaceful?

829
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
It's not.

830
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
After the Prince disappeared,

831
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
the family was in turmoil.

832
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
The sons were also in a bad mood.

833
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Now it's getting worse.

834
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
The King of Xin'an is strong and has a great reputation.

835
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
He's a man who

836
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
has a hundred days to live.

837
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
He doesn't rush to go back and arrange the funeral.

838
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
He hides in a place where no one knows

839
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
and ends himself.

840
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
How long?

841
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
How long?

842
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
I think he had an accident.

843
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Whether he's alive or dead,

844
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
find the cause of the accident,

845
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
and make sure no one is cheating.

846
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
This is the best explanation

847
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
to the King and the Dali Temple.

848
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
You really came to find Xin'an?

849
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
What else?

850
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Do you think it's just for you?

851
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I didn't say that.

852
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Okay, let's go.

853
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
The clue is broken.

854
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
There are still a lot of things

855
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
we have to do later.

856
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
This is for you.

857
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
What?

858
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
I put Chong You's dagger on it.

859
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
What's the use?

860
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
A friend of mine gave it to me.

861
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
It can kill demons.

862
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
There are demons in the underground city.

863
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Be careful, there's always a way out.

864
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
I'll be generous.

865
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Chong You also gave it to you.

866
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Are you worried about me?

867
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
I'm afraid you'll drag me down.

868
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Who's dragging you down?

869
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
This way, please.

870
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Please.

871
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Chi Xuan!

872
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Chi Xuan!

873
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Not bad, Xuan Yi.

874
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
You're really a good man.

875
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
Who are you?

876
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Why are you...

877
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Why am I here to stop you from hiding?

878
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Let me introduce myself.

879
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,600
I'm Shen Tu Nan, the owner of Xiaodong Tian.

880
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Or you can call me Uncle Shi.

881
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
The most dreamy start of the journey,

882
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,600
the world is in a trance

883
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
The world is in a trance

884
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,600
The world is in a trance

885
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,600
The world is in a trance

886
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,600
The world is in a trance

887
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,600
The moon has passed through the wind and snow

888
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,600
The moon has passed through the wind and snow

889
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,600
The moon has passed through the wind and snow

890
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,600
The moon has passed through the wind and snow

891
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
These hard works to accomplish

892
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
However hard, theSalvation will not pass

893
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,400
Although countless Techn Kal techniques

894
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,600
The beauty of art will be attributes for all

895
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,600
So when you listen the music of the Touch pain

896
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,600
With her, fans will Brazilian

897
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
These easy paits

898
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
These easy paits

899
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,600
These easy paits

900
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,600
Will bring out yourension

901
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
I'm sorry.

902
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
I'm sorry.

903
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm sorry.

904
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
I'm sorry.

905
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
I'm sorry.

906
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
I'm sorry.

907
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
I'm sorry.

908
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
I'm sorry.

909
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm sorry.

910
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

928
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

930
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm sorry.

931
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
I'm sorry.

932
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
I'm sorry.

933
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
I'm sorry.

934
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
I'm sorry.

935
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
I'm sorry.

937
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
I'm sorry.

938
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
I'm sorry.

939
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm sorry.

940
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
I'm sorry.

941
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600

944
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
I'm sorry.

945
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
